Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. The cooperative approach that we certainly believe needs to be taken in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme is well exemplified by the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell showing how effective cooperation can be achieved when they signed an intergovernmental agreement in December for a full state-wide NDIS rollout after the Hunter launch project. I referred earlier in my remarks to the role of the New South Wales minister, Andrew Constance, in that occurring. I would hope that what we see from the government is the Prime Minister applying that very constructive approach to negotiations with the other states and territories.


I also want to refer to those states which are not specifically hosting a launch site but which are nevertheless committed to the NDIS, including both Queensland and Western Australia. The Productivity Commission, in its work, did not envisage that every state would host a launch site but it also did not see the absence of a launch site as a barrier to participation in the national rollout. While the coalition supports the government's $1 billion commitment, we cannot reconcile this figure with the $3.9 billion the Productivity Commission said would be needed over the forward estimates for phase 1 of the NDIS. We are hoping that the government will explain this and make appropriate provisions in the coming May budget.


On the bill itself: it establishes the framework for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, known as the agency. This will enable the scheme to be launched and the agency to operate the launch in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme will benefit more than 20,000 people with a disability, their families and their carers living in South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria.


The scheme will provide funding to individuals or organisations to help those people with disabilities to participate more fully in economic and social life through the provision of an entitlement enabling things such as aids, equipment, supported accommodation or personal attendant care.


The mechanics of the agency will be established by way of legislative instruments called the NDIS rules. These regulations will further detail areas such as eligibility and assessment criteria. The government released a discussion paper on the rules on 1 February this year, but the discussion paper perhaps left a little to be desired in the information it contained. It proposed a series of questions this but it was not really a draft set of rules. This is significant, as the bill itself is essentially a framework; it establishes a transition agency, the board, the CEO and general definition of eligibility. But the nuts and bolts of the scheme will be established by the rules.


A recurrent theme in the evidence presented by witnesses was that it was difficult to offer advice, to pose questions or to plan for the launch sites in the absence of the substantive rules. The government released seven drafts of NDIS rules on the final day of hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on Tuesday, 5 March. These included draft rules for becoming a participant; draft rules for children; draft rules for privacy—and my colleague Senator Mason has referred to those at some length in his remarks; draft rules for nominees; draft rules for support; draft rules for registered providers; and draft rules for plan management. They are still the subjects of consultation with the states and territories and disability stakeholders, and the coalition is also studying them carefully.


The government has also indicated that there are potentially dozens of batches of draft rules to be released. I suggest that that is not the way to do this. The rules need to be released quickly, and well before the passage of the bill through the parliament, but given the position in which we find ourselves here in this chamber today that would seem to not be the case. In her second reading speech the Prime Minister indicated the government's intention to bring the final version of the bill to a vote in the budget session. Those remaining rules urgently need to be released to enable proper scrutiny and consultation with stakeholders. The risk with this government, as always, is in its ability to implement it competently. In the absence of these rules it makes it very difficult for stakeholders in particular.


The interaction of three components—the NDIS bill, the NDIS rules and the operating guidelines for the NDIS launch transition agency—will determine how the NDIS operates. Developing a complete picture of how the NDIS will unfold is limited by incomplete and insufficient information. The work of the Senate committee has been critical in this space, and it should have had the benefit of the full rules and the operating guidelines for the agency before it was able to finish its work.


To sum up, it is appropriate to acknowledge the role played by figures on both sides of the chamber in helping to elevate the public policy profile of disability. I particularly acknowledge the coalition's shadow spokesman on this matter, Senator Mitch Fifield, who across my area of Western Sydney—and across the rest of Australia, from reports from my colleagues—has been unstinting in his efforts to make sure that we as a coalition engage with the most important stakeholders in this vital policy area and that we hear directly from them as to their views and their concerns. That is the way that we would formulate policy. That is the approach that we take, and there is no better exemplar than Senator Fifield. But the most credit must go to people with disabilities—to their families, to their carers and to the organisations that support them, including those very important organisations that I mentioned in Western Sydney in particular. They came together and decided that enough was enough. They said, 'There must be a better way to do this, and we won't stop until we find it.'


The coalition wants the NDIS to be a success regardless of who is in government at any time. We want the launch sites to run smoothly. We stand ready to work with the government and with all jurisdictions to make the NDIS a reality.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:39):  At the outset, I indicate my support for the very worthy concept of this scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. But it is important that we ensure the implementation of this scheme is effective, efficient and sustainable in the long term. For too long, Australia has been lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to support and care for people with disabilities. In my view, it is unacceptable that Australians with a disability still find it so difficult to be part of everyday life and to be involved in work and activities that are meaningful and important to them—in short, to live a full and dignified life.


The Productivity Commission inquiry that prompted this scheme was scathing in its assessment of the current support systems. I know these words from the commission's report have been repeated again and again, but they are worth quoting once more:


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient. It gives people with a disability little choice, no certainty of access to appropriate supports and little scope to participate in the community.


The commission, which goes on to describe the current system as a 'system marked by invisible deprivation and lost opportunities', provides an excellent and comprehensive report, including a blueprint for a national disability insurance scheme.


I believe there are few who disagree that we need a major overhaul of the way people with disabilities are supported and cared for. The commission's excellent report delved into the issue of what it means, in everyday terms, when that support is inadequate or poorly delivered. For example, the commission found that there was a strong link between disadvantage and disability, with individuals and their carers more likely to be in financial and social difficulties. These include social isolation, lower levels of education and employment and difficulties with housing. Carers and families were more likely to be under strain and have poorer personal wellbeing. Some particularly heartbreaking findings in the report were about people with profound limitations. It found:


only 16 per cent had been visited by friends or family in 3 months, and around 59 per cent had not had a telephone call in 3 months


around 18 per cent had not had any social contact in the last 3 months


around 44 per cent had not used the Internet in the last 12 months.


It also found:


…around 18 per cent of carers only had face-to-face social contact either once every three months or less often.


This level of disconnect is both tragic and incredibly concerning. As we know, humans thrive on social interaction and it is vitally important to wellbeing. It is awful to know that this system has failed to this extent.


I believe the NDIS, if implemented correctly, will be life changing for many people with disability and their families. In particular, I note that there are specific provisions in the bill relating to early intervention for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders, where treatment from a young age is vital. I acknowledge the work of the AEIOU centre in Queensland, a not-for-profit organisation that delivers early intervention care for children on the autism spectrum, with remarkable results. Appropriate early intervention can make a huge difference, with long-term impacts that actually reduce a child's level of disability as an adult. A vital part of this service is also the respite hours they provide parents. This organisation is still small, but its services are in huge demand and they are having a massive impact.


A better and more flexible funding structure under the NDIS will give parents the resources they need to get into the AEIOU program and will hopefully give AEIOU the resources it needs to meet demand, because that demand is critical and we cannot delay that. I acknowledge the fact that this legislation is designed to establish a framework, with further detail covered by rules to be made by the minister. I note Senator Payne's quite valid concerns about the framework being somewhat vague at this stage. We need to have those rules so that we can see the details, and that is important.


I have some fundamental concerns relating to individuals who have potential compensation claims seeking support under the NDIS. As someone who has been a compensation lawyer—and I still have my practising certificate and very small law firm—it is something that I am acutely aware of. For example, under the bill as it stands, individuals will lose their right to choose whether or not they want to take legal action in relation to a possible compensation claim. Instead, that person may be compelled to take legal action: if they do not, their support under the NDIS can be suspended. That just seems fundamentally wrong. It is inconsistent with the whole tenor of the scheme.


Basically, this bill uses the right to disability support as a stick behind the carrot, and that is wrong. Further, if an individual wants to appeal the decision forcing them to take legal action, they will need to go through an internal review or take the matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This means the person in question will either have to take on the services of an advocate or a lawyer, or defend themselves. But there is no provision allowing funding for that legal representation under the NDIS, potentially leaving people out of pocket and worse off than they would have been if the scheme had never existed in the first place—and that would be a perverse outcome.


I am very concerned that the NDIS seems overly reliant on payments through compensation claims for its funding. I want to make it absolutely clear that I find this unacceptable, that the responsibility for funding even part of the scheme should rest on the very individuals it is supposed to help. In line with the Senate committee's recommendations, individuals should not be forced to take legal action unless there is some sort of safeguard to protect them from economic loss. There are no such safeguards in this bill. In fact, the government amendments in the House have made these provisions even more onerous on individuals. In fact, where a compensation claim has been taken over or made by the CEO on behalf of an individual, it appears the CEO then has full rights to act on the individual's behalf without that person's consent.


The scheme is supposed to be about giving people with a disability the power to choose and control their own treatment and support, but these provisions blatantly remove any kind of choice from the equation. They operate on the very assumption that a person's only choice in this situation is the one that is right for the NDIS, not the one that is right for the individual themselves. To me, this seems to go against the intent of the bill and treats people with a disability in a patronising and condescending manner. This is particularly clear when you consider similar provisions in other state, territory and Commonwealth legislation which do not have the same element of force and do include safeguards, and that is why I will be moving amendments to that effect and I am looking forward to the support of my colleagues on this side of the chamber and my crossbench colleagues to remedy this absolutely clear anomaly.


Beyond establishing protection for individuals in the case of subrogation—a concept that I will discuss in the committee stage of this bill—these amendments will also ensure that individuals who go through the appeals process will have access to independent advocates. These amendments will also include provisions requiring the CEO to provide reasoning for reviewable decisions and to ensure that individuals are protected from costs if a review goes to the AAT. They also state that the CEO must ensure that the agency institutes a process to ensure that communications to individuals are made in a way that takes their disability into account and allows them to interact with the agency in an effective way. For example, the agency must take into account a person's visual impairment when communicating with them and therefore communicate verbally and provide written documents in an accessible form. This will ensure that individuals dealing with the agency will not be disadvantaged because of their disability. These amendments are in line with the recommendations from the Australian Lawyers Alliance and I thank representatives from that organisation, and in particular the ALA's National President, South Australian lawyer Tony Kerin, for the time they spent with me two days ago discussing these issues.


Ultimately, I support the measures in the bill but we need to make sure that they are open and flexible enough to meet changing demands and that they do not unintentionally perpetuate the exclusion of people with a disability. I will be supporting this bill, but I will be looking forward to discussing it further in the committee stage because there are a number of amendments in order to safeguard the rights of the disabled that must be dealt with. Finally, in the course of the committee stage I do want to raise the spectre of the link between this scheme and a national injury insurance scheme—a no-fault scheme—and the dangers I think that poses, and I will be quoting from the former chief judge of the Employment Court of New Zealand, Chief Judge Tom Goddard, who is scathing about the New Zealand no-fault scheme.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:47):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. As the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, said on 13 April 2012, the National Disability Insurance Scheme is 'an idea whose time has come'. The coalition have enthusiastically supported each of the milestones on the road to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We supported the initial work that was done by the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion in the last budget and we have supported the five launch sites. We support the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full state-wide rollout after the Hunter launch. We support this legislation, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013.


Indeed, the coalition called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. What did we get in response to that? The Prime Minister, in her inimitable style, just simply rejected that and said, 'We're getting on with it.' This is a very important issue for thousands of Australians with a disability and their families and carers, and that just goes to show the disdain that the Prime Minister has for something that should have been done on a bipartisan basis. The member for Dawson, George Christensen, has had a motion in the House of Representatives to establish such a bipartisan committee for some time. Regrettably, that motion has not been brought forward for a vote. The shadow minister, my colleague, Senator Fifield, moved a motion to establish the oversight committee. Unfortunately, those opposite and their alliance partners, the Greens, voted this down in the Senate. 


The Australian Labor Party always likes to pay lip service to wanting cross-party support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but when the opportunity was presented they declined to support it. Another example of paying lip service, is the Australian Labor Party's move, hopefully, not to guillotine debate in this matter. It is a very important bill that in this situation needs to be given full airing and full opportunity for all members and all senators to express their views on this important area. It deserves the full scrutiny of the Senate. 


In relation to the NDIS, one of the areas that needs to be examined is clause 22, which sets out the age requirements that a person must satisfy in order to become a participant in the NDIS launch. The age requirement is that that person is under the age of 65 on the date the access request is made. This requirement implements part of recommendation 3.6 of the Productivity Commission report and reflects that the NDIS is one part of a broader system of support in Australia, with people over the age of 65 able to access the age care system. Those people who are receiving support under the NDIS and turn 65 can choose either to remain in the NDIS or to move to the aged care system. In other words, the policy intent is that the NDIS and the aged care system remain separate systems that address the different needs of separate cohorts of people; people with a disability and older people with a disability, respectively. Arguably, this assumes that there will be some similarity in the care and support available between the NDIS and the aged care systems. It is concerns like this that need to be worked out, and debate should not be curtailed on these issues.


There is evidence, and certainly there was some evidence provided to the Senate inquiry, that the aged care system may not be an appropriate choice for some people with a disability. We saw in the report, for example, a survey of people with intellectual disabilities living in residential aged care in Victoria raising issues about the appropriateness of such arrangements for this group, including the extent to which such facilities offer sufficient opportunities for participation in community activities and the development of meaningful relationships. Aged care providers themselves also identified a number of difficulties associated with residents with intellectual disabilities fitting into the activities and support provided by that facility. Some providers, however, indicated that these could be overcome by working with specialist disability services. Let us not forget that the NDIS is a person-centred and self-directed funding model. It is aligned to the objectives of empowering the individual and removing the concept of big government from people's lives and, above all, reducing red tape.


I now move to some of the comments made by coalition senators in relation to this bill. We know that the system for Australians with a disability is broken, and it was clear from the submissions of the 1,600 people and organisations that took the time to put in submissions that this very point was made in just about all of those submissions. In the end the evidence that emerged made it very clear that there are people with a disability in Australia who are left without the assistance that they need. As a coalition, we agree that a new system of support based on need, rather than rationing, with the entitlement for support going to the individual, is needed. This represents a shift from the focus of rationing to entitlement, with the person being at the centre of the system and the services that he or she needs being wrapped around them, with support, equipment and service providers of their choice being able to provide those services. This is the vision that the Productivity Commission has in relation to disability. It is also the vision of the Productivity Commission in relation to the aged care system. The basic tenet of the report Caring for older Australians, which was a landmark report that the Productivity Commission did in relation to the aged care system, was a shift from the current ration system in aged care to an entitlement system. The Productivity Commission set out a framework as to how that could happen. Whilst it did not drill down to that detail it is clear that that Productivity Commission report enjoys great support right across the spectrum in the aged care sector, evidenced by the 500 submissions made to Productivity Commission initially, and then by another 500 submissions made after the draft report was released in relation to that legislation.


As far as the leader of the opposition is concerned the issue of disability and Australians with a disability is one he has a very personal commitment to. As part of his 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride $550,000 was raised for Carers Australia. Along that thousand-kilometre route Mr Abbott met with people with disabilities and their carers, and disability organisations to hear directly from them about issues pertaining to disability and to know that the funds from that bike race would go directly to a very important organisation that assists people with disabilities. Indeed, the next two Pollie Pedal rides will also be in partnership with and raise funds for Carers Australia.


Any comments that the coalition offers in this debate are offered in a constructive way, with the intention of making this legislation better. It is something that the coalition wanted to offer bipartisan support for; we wanted to set up a committee where this could be done in a depoliticised manner. The coalition's proposal for aged care reform which we set out at the last official election was a four-year agreement which would not only offer flexibility and certainty in the system but would, above all, provide long-term certainty and a depoliticising of that system.


In the end, it is important to note that every government in Australia and every opposition in Australia supports and wants to see an NDIS. It is a system that will depend on cooperation and on work being done between governments across the political spectrum. This constructive approach has been evidenced when New South Wales Premier O'Farrell and the Prime Minister signed an intergovernmental agreement in December for a full, statewide NDIS rollout after the Hunter launch project. It was disappointing to see that the Prime Minister did not treat all jurisdictions as partners at the COAG meeting in July 2012, and it is to the credit of both the Victorian and New South Wales governments that they continue to negotiate in the face of what has clearly been misrepresentation by the federal government, and that they have reached agreement to host launch sites. It is vitally important that we have a cooperative approach.


I now turn to the aged-care system. This is of particular importance and has been raised with me in various forums that I have attended around Australia as shadow minister for ageing. If people with a disability over the age of 65 are to be looked after in the aged-care system then it is vitally important that the aged-care system is reformed—and reformed in a major way, not just in the way that this government has of paying lip-service. We have seen promises of reform in aged care but, five years on, there is very little evidence of real change on the ground.


I remind the Senate that in 2010 Ms Gillard said that aged-care reform would be a second term priority, and this was at the election when Ms Gillard had to defend herself against the serial leaker who claimed that she had not supported big increases in the age pension because 'old people never vote for us'. But the reality is that we have had a litany of reports and reviews—about 20 of them, including three by the Productivity Commission—which cover ageing and aged-care matters. They have been continually ignored, or responded to with more inquiries without making those vitally important decisions to secure aged care into the future.


Aged-care reform needs to be long term but it also needs to be sustainable. Shortly, we will have the opportunity to debate the package of bills that are a part of the Living Longer. Living Better package. There are five bills which, quite frankly, do not resolve many of the outstanding issues of viability for providers and certainly do not respond to the concerns that have been raised by providers, through the inquiry into the NDIS, because of the added responsibilities that they will have in relation to catering for older Australians with a disability.


We have seen funding cuts of $1.6 billion out of the aged-care funding instrument. Of course, this has put additional pressure on the sector and, most especially, on smaller providers in regional and rural areas. The government has chosen to cherry-pick only a few recommendations from the Productivity Commission's report, Caring for Older Australians. This package of bills will impose even more bureaucracy, even more regulation, on what is already a very, very highly regulated sector.


Most recently we have seen Minister Butler in another spectacular gaffe. First of all, he insulted the people of Western Sydney with his crass remarks about Rooty Hill and then he insulted the people of Western Sydney again when he went out to make his very low-key announcement, downgraded from the Prime Minister to Minister Shorten and Minister Butler, and then just Minister Butler. It was another gaffe in relation to that announcement on the day when he asserted somebody was trying to steal a car—it ended up being the local priest whose car had been blocked in by the minister's car.




Senator Sinodinos:
  What!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Yes, Senator Sinodinos, this is very much a gaffe-prone minister. Today we see him worrying about whether he will or will not support Prime Minister Gillard. Perhaps Minister Butler should be concentrating on—




Senator Sinodinos:
  Gutless Butler.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Absolutely. To be or not to be—thank you, Senator Sinodinos—a supporter. Instead of worrying about that, Minister Butler, might I suggest that you worry about the key issues in your portfolio, which are the aged-care system, which needs reform and for which your proposed changes will only make things worse. Aged Care Australia tells us that 60 per cent of aged-care providers are operating in the red. There is a real viability issue for providers, most especially smaller providers in regional and rural areas. So it is little wonder that aged-care providers, who will be dealing with older Australians with a disability, are understandably concerned that they are not going to be able to provide the services that our older Australians with a disability do need.


As I said, this is a sector that does need reform, and I have real concerns that proper reform will not be undertaken in the aged-care sector, which this minister and this government seems loath to do—they are only paying lip-service to it. And what are we seeing? We are seeing that the government is more concerned with rolling out its workforce compact by ripping $1.6 billion out of aged-care funding—to then turn it back and return it supposedly as a $1.2 billion workforce compact as a bid to refinance unions in the aged-care sector. Of course, there is United Voice, as we have seen. Indeed, I have come along this morning with the latest pamphlet from United Voice in which United Voice are urging aged-care workers to join United Voice to 'speak with one voice in negotiations'. That is what it is about. That is what it is really all about, refinancing the unions, the aged-care unions: United Voice, Minister Butler's former union; the HSU, which we know suffered a spectacular fall in membership; and the Nurses Federation. 


In the end, I would remind the Senate that under this so-called administrative change, which is really an industrial instrument, aged-care providers of 50 beds or more must enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement; otherwise, they will not be able to access funding. If they are 50 beds or fewer, they do not have to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement but they must comply with the terms of the compact to be able to access that funding.


What does that mean? That means that, already, that 60 per cent which is operating in the red are going to find it harder and harder to be viable; but most especially here is the government promising pay rises which will never materialise. Why? Because providers are not going to be able to meet those wage increases on the tied money that the government is providing. So another false promise by this minister, who really is demonstrating that he is not up to the job.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (10:07):  This is a landmark piece of legislation: the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013, which is supported by both sides of the house. Some people may be surprised at that; they talk about this parliament being fractious and in some ways dysfunctional. Whatever the government's contribution to that, on this occasion we have come together on a matter which we regard as being in some sense above politics. That is a very serious statement to make, to say that something is above politics. I think what we have here is a recognition that we as a parliament have listened to the community and to a section of the community who for too long felt that they were being shunted aside, being ignored, being discriminated against; many families and their carers, disabled people and their families have had to suffer in silence. They could not get access to the range of services they needed on the terms that were appropriate to their particular circumstances. 


This legislation, this scheme, seeks to remedy many of those considerations. That is why I certainly support it and that is why my side of politics supports it. It is gratifying that all sides of politics seem to be keen to move on this matter now. In saying that, I am conscious that we are embarking on a very ambitious enterprise as a nation. This is a very complex, long-term, significant set of reforms. In some ways, it provides a precedent in other areas of social support, but it also provides some warning bells about how these sorts of schemes should be considered and implemented.


We face an extra bill when the scheme is fully matured of around $6 billion to $8 billion and possibly more per annum extra, on top of what we now spend. That is a significant expending of public resources, and it is premised on not only compassion and social desiderata—if I can put it like that—but also an economic component in the sense that there is a view that going down this road with the National Disability Insurance Scheme will yield more benefits than costs over the longer term.


There will of course be the social benefits for those who are directly affected, but what we are saying is that there will ultimately also be national benefits, public benefits, over and above those private benefits and that some of those benefits will be economic benefits, because people who are being helped will be in a better position, potentially, in a number of cases, to participate more fully in the economic and social life of our country. That is very important. Tony Blair once made the point that fairness in the workplace begins with the prospect of a job. So anything we can do to help disabled people to realise their full potential, so that they become full and participating members of our economy and society, is very important—not only for their self-esteem and meaning in their lives but also for the contribution they make to the country and how that ultimately enriches all of us socially and economically. So there are some very important issues at stake in this bill and in this legislation that we are debating today.


We are not, as I said before, debating this in a rancorous, partisan way; there is agreement. But, in making comments on the legislation, I do want to raise a couple of points on the way through. These are not points that are necessarily the most significant and some may say, 'Well, you are raising points which are more economic or financial, or sort of bean-counter points,' but I raise them anyway in the spirit of saying: let's make sure that, in adding to the pool of funds available in this area, we are getting the best value for money out of what we are already spending in this space, not in order to cut what we are already spending in this space—that is not what we are intending to do—but, like all these things, let us make sure that the spending we are putting into the system is going on top of a level of spending that is itself the most efficient and effective way to deploy existing resources to help disabled people.


In negotiating with the states, this government or a future government must make sure that there is genuine additionality in the resources that those states are providing to the table. I commend the New South Wales and federal governments for coming to an agreement recently and, like my colleague, Marise Payne, yesterday, I commend the New South Wales Minister for Ageing and Minister for Disability Services, Andrew Constance, who is a very smart, pragmatic and committed minister in this space. He has done a great job on behalf of the people of New South Wales in this space, and I commend him, Premier Barry O'Farrell and their federal counterparts for coming to an agreement. But my point is: let's make sure that the funding going into this space from the states is additional funding, so that we get the best possible deal for the Commonwealth from the states and we are maximising the resources available for disabled people.


In that context, I refer back to the Productivity Commission, which handed down a landmark report on this space. In part, the report went to this issue of funding and the profile for funding. The point made there was that something like $3.9 billion was needed over the next four years, or this current four years, in order to begin to realise the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. To date, the government has provided $1 billion over the forward estimates, and in this budget we wait to see what the longer term funding plan will be.


There had been speculation in the press that the government might well publish forward estimates that go some way beyond the traditional three or four years—perhaps out to 2020—to indicate how it was funding significant additional responsibilities, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the Gonski education reforms. I welcome a commitment by the government to provide a longer term set of forward estimates which explain clearly how we build up the funding to the National Disability Insurance Scheme over time so reach the peak funding—which I think at this stage is expected to be in 2018.


We have to be careful that this does not become one of those cheese-paring exercises, a bit like what we do in the foreign aid area. There we make laudable commitments in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and then say, a bit like St Augustine, 'Make me pure but not just yet,' and we keep putting off the day when we lift the ratio of our foreign aid to our GDP. Over the last couple of years there has been a tendency to do that. I hope for the National Disability Insurance Scheme we do not fall into the same trap simply because over time we find our budgetary situation is deteriorating and we are unable to meet this full commitment.


That may not be an issue for this government. One of the reasons I raise this now is that it could be an issue for a future coalition government. This is a dilemma that we all face, but the point that we have made and the point that the government has made is that schemes like this would be accommodated by reducing spending elsewhere. It is important that we note that it is better to go down the route of reducing spending in other areas rather than seeking to raise taxes further, given that most of those taxes will fall on middle-income earners. From an economic perspective that is the more appropriate way to pay for a national disability insurance scheme.


As I said before, this has bipartisan support. I commend people on both sides of politics who have supported the scheme from its inception, or conception. On my side of politics, I commend our leader, Tony Abbott, who through early support for the scheme and through his work with the Pollie Pedal has been a visible and genuine, committed supporter of doing more in this space. I commend our shadow spokesman in the area, Mitch Fifield. He is a flint-hard economic rationalist who on this occasion has seen the light and decided we must do more. He has handled a difficult area in dealing with stakeholders and the government on the matter with great deftness, skill and authority. I commend him for the work he has done within the party room in bringing us all along on this journey. I also commend Senator Sue Boyce, who has been quite a vocal supporter of the scheme, based in part on personal experiences.


I will not mention others, but my point is simply to say this: the field evidence is very strong that people from both sides of politics have been very strongly supportive. On the other side of politics, outside this chamber, I commend John Della Bosca, a very skilful New South Wales ex-Labor minister and operative. He is an organisation man who has done an excellent job in helping to mobilise public opinion on and support for the scheme. It would be remiss not to say something about some of the people involved in the conception of the scheme: John Walsh, a partner at PwC, who conceived it. It was progressed by Bruce Bonyhady, the president of Philanthropy Australia. I knew Bruce Bonyhady 20 or 30 years ago in the Treasury. I think he was in the forecasting or modelling space. He is a rigorous thinker and he brought that rigour as well as his commitment to helping people with disability to the table. He has done a great job in further fleshing out the concept and helping to sell it.


I note in passing that this matter was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit in 2008. That summit was notable for three things: first of all, Kevin Rudd telling us who the best and brightest in Australia were; some of us were very disappointed in the outcomes of that exercise. Secondly, it did not necessarily yield that many things. I think the bionic eye came out of that process and something is being done on that. Thirdly, there was tax reform, which came on the table when Kevin Rudd had to go on the 7:30 Report and describe the outcomes of the summit. He then decided, 'Let's have a tax review,' and that was the Henry review, which in turn led to other things. But this item, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, is one of the better outcomes of something that was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit.


One of the features of the scheme that I am particularly attracted to is the fact that it is a person-centred and self-directed funding model. It is aligned to the objectives of empowering the individual, removing government from people's lives and reducing red tape. To be honest, we will wait and see how far it goes in reducing red tape and removing government from people's lives. I am a bit sceptical about the extent to which the government gets out of people's lives and reduces red tape, but empowering the individual, setting up a model which is person-centred and which that person drives through their command over funding and resources, drives the package of measures necessary to help them, so it is a customised package. I think that is what this NDIS is trying to get at. It is also trying to provide greater certainty to people about what is available to them so that they do not have to wait in queues and all the rest of it. One downside of all of this that we have to make sure we address is that people who are providing services to the NDIS do not ratchet up their prices because they think that demand is going up as everybody wants everything immediately. We have to guard against people exploiting the situation. That is a footnote.


I support the person-centred and self-directed funding model. I think we showed more of this across government activity, more of a—for want of a better expression—life-cycle model of how government interacts with individuals. I think that is very important, particularly because in an area like this there is some focus on early intervention to 'mitigate, alleviate or prevent the deterioration of' a person's functional capacity. Early intervention to minimise later problems means that there is greater capacity for people to potentially be more self-reliant and better able to do things for themselves. Getting people, to the extent possible, to be mobile and to be able to hold down a part-time or full-time job is important for their self-esteem and the contribution they can make to our nation.


So I support the person-centred and self-directed funding model. It would be interesting to apply this more across government activity. I suspect it would be expensive to do that, so perhaps it is not as appropriate in other areas because of cost; but, certainly, in this area, it is a new model and it will be interesting to see how it goes. I support that element of the model. As the notes say:


The individual needs to be at the centre and in charge, able to pick the supports, the aids, the equipment and the service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report …


I make the point that for some time now, as a reflection of that bipartisanship that I mentioned earlier, the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This is not only a good idea on policy grounds but also a good idea on political grounds for the government to lock the opposition into ongoing support for the NDIS. I do not understand why the government seems to want to shut the opposition out when embracing the opposition and locking them in is the best guarantee that the NDIS will have not only safe delivery but also a reasonably robust childhood growing to maturity with the right sort of support from all sides of the parliament. A parliamentary oversight committee would lock in all parties and provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. In other words, the parliamentary committee would seek to take out some of the political pointscoring and debate around what I said before was a matter above politics.


In bringing this vision to fruition I think people on the Labor side should avoid the temptation to claim this reform as some reflection of quintessential Labor values. There are very big Australian values around fairness and looking after people who cannot look after themselves, and they are shared by all sides of politics. We sometimes differ about the means to achieving that fairness, and that is a legitimate discussion. Our side of politics—the right-of-centre parties—always put more focus on how we can equip people to better look after themselves, to exercise personal choice and responsibility. That is where sometimes there is quite a marked philosophical difference and therefore a practical policy difference between the two sides of politics. But this is not about something which is quintessentially a Labor value; this is quintessentially a pragmatic Australian response to an important social issue. I am disappointed that on occasion Labor have sought to exploit this for partisan purposes. I say that gently and in passing to underline the point that this is all about bipartisanship.


As Tony Abbott reiterated at the Press Club recently:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


I commend Tony Abbott for that. I do not commend the Prime Minister for attacking some of her state colleagues in the lead-up to the Council of Australian Government meeting and seeking to portray them as somehow being against the scheme. State governments have legitimate responsibilities to argue about how their funding and their services link into this broader national scheme. In the spirit of cooperation, these are issues that are best hammered out behind closed doors and are not the subject of public rancour, pointscoring and mud-slinging. That will not achieve anything. 


This is also reflected in the fact that we do not have to have launch sites in every state. The fact that we have launch sites in a number of states is a good thing, but the Productivity Commission never envisaged every state hosting a launch site and never saw the absence of a launch site as a bar to taking part in a full national rollout. The Premier of Queensland, Campbell Newman, has written to the Prime Minister with a proposal to be part of a full national rollout, and Premier Colin Barnett of Western Australia has written to the Prime Minister proposing a joint WA-Commonwealth national disability insurance scheme. The coalition will continue to place this issue above politics and is prepared to work with state and Commonwealth governments towards a better deal for people with a disability.


In the time remaining, I make the point that the bill before the chamber is essentially a framework establishing the transition agency, the board, the CEO and a general definition of eligibility. The mechanics of the scheme will be established by the rules. A discussion paper on the rules was released on 1 February but it was essentially a series of questions. It is not a draft set of rules. The government released seven sets of draft rules on the final day of hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on 5 March: draft rules for becoming a participant, draft rules for children, draft rules for privacy, draft rules for nominees, draft rules for support, draft rules for registered providers and draft rules for plan management. These draft rules are still the subjects of consultation with state and territories and with stakeholders in the disability sector. We will study them carefully. The government has also indicated that there are potentially dozens of batches of draft rules still to be released which need to be released quickly and well before the passage of the bill through parliament. We need as much information as possible to understand the implications of where we are going in this very important space.


Finally, I commend the legislation and the scheme to the chamber. I think it can make an important difference to the lives of disabled Australians. I have heard too many stories of parents who despair about what will happen to their disabled children after they pass on. It is very important that we assure them that the Australian people are there to take on that responsibility and that task.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (10:27):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Disability Scheme Bill 2013.This National Disability Insurance Scheme is an idea whose time has come. It is an historic day that this scheme is being debated in the Senate and is a real step forward. It is very much an expression of the reality of the federal parliament supporting the concept of the Aussie fair go to ensure that disabled people do have a fair go and are given an opportunity to realise their potential. There are many people in Australia with disabilities whose lives will be improved with the advent of this scheme. Sometimes the perception that someone is disabled is taken to mean that they cannot or are not able to participate in community activities or to do many things which other people might do. This is a recognition more than anything else that disabled people do have abilities, dreams and ambitions and should be assisted to achieve those dreams and ambitions and live meaningful and dignified lives in our community. The fact that disabled people are being given support by the community, and recognition that they are entitled to respect as fellow Australians, is very important. I congratulate those responsible for the development of this legislation.


The coalition has supported each milestone on the road to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We supported very strongly the initial work done by the Productivity Commission on planning for this NDIS. The coalition supported the billion dollars allocated to the NDIS in the last budget, we supported the concept of the five launch sites and we supported the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full state-wide rollout after the Hunter launch. We do support this legislation very strongly, because, as I have said, it means that disabled people in this country will be given recognition and the opportunity to live lives that are dignified, and be able to achieve their dreams and aspirations.


When Labor members and senators say that the NDIS represents quintessentially Labor values I have to say that I do not think they are particularly Labor values that it represents, but they are the Aussie values of a fair go and giving people a chance to realise their potential. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a person-centred, self-directing funding model. It is aligned to the objectives of empowering the individual and removing government from people's lives and reducing red tape, which are all values which the coalition strongly supports. The coalition believes that the full implementation of the NDIS will be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers, and we believe that we have to make sure that the details of this scheme are got right and that they do really mean that the scheme works for the benefit of disabled people.


The NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform which is going to unfold over the life of several parliaments, and it will develop and progress over that time. It should, we believe, be the property of the parliament as a whole, on behalf of the Australian people, rather than of any one political party, and I think that is the spirit in which this whole piece of legislation is being debated here today. The coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Tony Abbott, the leader of the Liberal Party, reiterated this offer in his recent Press Club address, when he said:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


The government, we believe, should accept the coalition's offer of a parliamentary oversight committee. The coalition intends to give the government, the Greens and the Independents an opportunity to accept our hand of cooperation by moving an amendment to this bill to establish such a nonpartisan oversight committee. I do hope, quite simply, that that offer is seen as not being partisan political, and that it is accepted in the spirit in which it is offered so that an oversight committee can be set up to ensure that this scheme works effectively for the people who it is designed to support.


It is important to note that every government and every opposition in Australia want to see an NDIS established in this country. That is why at the COAG before last it was disappointing that the Prime Minister could not rise above her partisan instincts on this issue, and it is to the credit of the Victorian and New South Wales governments that they continued to negotiate in the face of public attack and misrepresentation by the federal government and reached agreement to host launch sites. It is a bit sad that politics has entered into this debate at any level. I hope that the politics will be forgotten in further meetings at COAG and that there will be a spirit of cooperation to ensure that this very worthy legislation is put into practice to benefit the disabled people in our community.


There cannot be a meaningful NDIS without an intergovernmental agreement with each state and territory, and that is something that is yet to be negotiated. Given that, I would like to say a few words in defence of the states who have perhaps been misrepresented as not hosting a launch site. I do not think that means they do not support the NDIS but that they have some concerns about details. It has to be said that the Productivity Commission never envisaged every state hosting a launch site and never saw the absence of a launch site as a bar to taking a full part in the national rollout.


In particular, as a Western Australian I have supported the decision of Premier Barnett who has written to the Prime Minister proposing a joint WA-Commonwealth NDIS be set up. Western Australia has its own problems in terms of distance and the vast size of the state and there are some special local factors which have to be taken into consideration. 


We on the coalition side emphatically supported the government's commitment of $1 billion to the NDIS in the last federal budget. I must say we had some difficulty that the sum was only $1 billion when, in fact, the Productivity Commission's recommendation was that at least $3.9 billion would be necessary over the forward estimates for the first phase of the NDIS. We can only hope that more money will be forthcoming in the budget in May and, of course, only time will tell how much money is needed to really make this scheme effective. I hope, in the spirit of the nobleness of the endeavour to ensure that disabled people in this country are able to realise their potential and live in dignity, that there will not be arguments about penny pinching and that the money will be available for this scheme.


The scheme will provide funding to individuals or organisations to help people with disability to participate more fully in economic and social life through the provision of entitlements enabling such things as aids, equipment, supported accommodation and personal attendant care.


The history of this National Disability Insurance Scheme is that the idea has been around for a long time, but people only began giving serious consideration to a national disability insurance scheme over the last five years. It is appropriate to acknowledge the role played by figures on both sides of the chamber in helping to elevate the public policy profile of disability. But the lion's share of the credit must go to those people who have disabilities, their families, their carers and the organisations who support them. These people came together because they decided that in modern, prosperous, wealthy Australia enough was enough and something had to be done to support the disabled people in our community. This is a long overdue measure. In particular, I acknowledge that in Western Australia, our Premier, Colin Barnett, has supported this concept and I know the differences are not, as I have said, ones of principle but merely of detail. There are some particular West Australian factors to be built in to an NDIS in Western Australia.


In conclusion, this is a historic step forward for the Australian community, and the NDIS is very much in the spirit of giving everybody a fair go, a quintessential Aussie value.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:40):  I too rise to make some brief observations on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. I note that in the second reading speech of the shadow minister, Mitch Fifield, he outlined in essence the two principal purposes of this bill. I will not speak to the construct of the bill, but I would like to take the opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the significance of the difference that the implementation of this legislation will make to the lives of so many people. The bill has bipartisan support in this chamber. I am delighted to see that because of the huge impact it will ultimately have on families who deal with disabilities and individuals who deal with disabilities. It will provide them with opportunities and choices. In that way it will in effect change individuals' lives.


When you look at the facts, it is quite compelling to see that some 400,000 people in Australia live with disabilities. That is a number that unfortunately, for whatever reason, is on the rise. Some 400,000 individuals suffer from disabilities—that is, in essence more than 400,000 families that have to deal with the impact of disabilities and provide for the impact of disabilities. It is regrettable that it has taken this time for us to come up with a framework for a national disability insurance scheme, a framework that we all support. The Productivity Commission looked into the scheme in around 2009. It is on the advice of the Productivity Commission that an enormous amount of work has gone into the determination of its structure, framework, and planning as to how this should apply. There has also been a good and effective consultative process to come to where we are today.


The reason it is so heartening is that there is no quick fix for this issue. It is not a situation where one model will fit all. The model must be able to be tailored to the needs of the individual and ultimately will, I hope, not only support the physical challenges faced by those with disabilities but also provide critical psychological and emotional support for families and friends in the lifelong challenge they face and live with. Most of us know someone with a disability or we know families or friends dealing with people with disabilities, so we know first-hand what is required for those families to cope through a lifetime.


In the Senate over the last 12 months we seem to have had a huge population growth, with senators having the joy of a baby entering their lives, either as parents or grandparents. We know, particularly in the last 12 months on the coalition side, that there is one heartfelt wish of those parents or grandparents—that is, the newborns have 10 fingers and 10 toes and they are healthy. That is their one wish: that those children are healthy. As we know, that is not always the case. It is a real issue for those who have to deal with beautiful children who are born with disabilities, or may develop them later on in life.


Since I was elected as a senator, one of the things that has presented to me as an opportunity, which I do not know that I would have had if I had not been elected to the Senate, is to actually visit a number of places that are either early intervention centres, employment workplaces for those with disabilities or other workplaces that provide varying ranges of support services for families. The one thing that strikes you when you attend all of these facilities is the extraordinary love, honesty and goodwill that those with disabilities automatically share and present to all whom they meet. They just have such a wonderful temperament—so many of them. Sometimes, I think that we perhaps could take a leaf out of their books in the way in which we deal with each other in this place, because the degree of goodwill that is shared when you visit so many of these places is so apparent. One thing that strikes me as much as anything is this wonderful sense of humour so many have, and they are very quick to take the mickey out of you. As a politician, I think it is a very good thing to rock up somewhere and have a young child or even an adult take the mickey out of you as you are visiting a particular place. In the main, they just have such wonderful senses of humour, and it is something that I do not know whether I would have had the opportunity to meet so many and attend so many places as I have as a senator. In my patron seats there is a large number of support services and a couple of those that I want to mention in making my short observations.


I firstly acknowledge the families. I know a number of families whose lives changed for their lifetime and for their children's lifetime when they had children with disabilities. They have become full-time carers for individuals from the moment those children were born through the life of the parents, and it depends on the degree of disability as to the extent to which that 24/7 care has been necessary. I am reminded of someone very close to me who has a daughter who has dramatic challenges and needs 24/7 care. She made observations to me not so long ago when her daughter turned 18 about the level of services that they could no longer access and how their economic capacity to raise income in that household was dramatically reduced by the amount of care that they had to provide. It was a bit of a vicious cycle. Their No. 1 overarching concern was what was going to happen to their daughter once they could no longer provide the care that they had, whether because they physically could not or because they financially could not. We have see many instances where ageing parents have expressed their concern about what was going to happen and they have had to put their adult children into aged care facilities because there were no services or residential care available for them to put their disabled adult daughter or son into an appropriate residential facility. You have circumstances where a young 20-year-old has had to be put into an aged-care facility, which is a great tragedy.


I would like to come to a couple of places that I have visited that do a tremendous job. I know that this bill will reinforce the support that the families are able to provide for their children. The first is a specialist early childhood centre in Bayswater in the electorate of Deakin in Victoria. It is an early childhood intervention service called Irabina. I had the great fortune of going there a few months ago because an extraordinarily generous Victorian, Chris Malcolm, the managing director of Clark Rubber, an incredibly philanthropic and generous individual, made a donation, with the Liberal Party, to Irabina to support some services that they are providing. They provided thousands of dollars worth of goods that would assist with early intervention for those children. 


Irabina has programs that are family centred for preschool age children. It is a program targeted at early intervention for children diagnosed with or suspected to have autism spectrum disorder. I did not jump into the pool but I joined in with activities they had in the swimming pool. I saw firsthand how early intervention for children that are diagnosed early in their lifetime with autism spectrum disorder can actually break the cycle and assist them in developing the skills and developing learning capacities so that they can then enter a mainstream school and, in many cases, go on to be able to reach their personal and true potential. In many cases for these families this early intervention is a life-changing opportunity.


One of the mothers I spoke to was saying that with this particular scheme there is support provided, but it does not cover the intensive therapies required. This legislation, because it is tailored towards individuals, which is one of the elements I strongly applaud, will provide individual financial support as is needed.


Another facility I visited with the coalition leader, Tony Abbott, and shadow minister, Senator Mitch Fifield, was in Nunawading. Nadrasca in Nunawading is a great place, and Senator Fifield has been there on a number of occasions. Nadrasca was established in 1967. Its purpose when established was to develop a range of services for people with a disability. The organisation has developed and evolved over time. It currently provides a range of services and employment for over 350 people with a disability. It employs approximately 150 permanent, part-time and casual staff across all their services to assist their clients.


The services that they support and provide include—and this is not a comprehensive account—a disability-supported employment service; a service that provides daily programs and activities for persons with significant disabilities; and accommodation services which include 24-hour care and independent living as well as recreational and holiday programs, all of which are tailored to the needs of individual families. Nadrasca Industry is a critical and essential part of the organisational structure of support for disability services because it provides employment and vocational training opportunities for people with a disability and generates revenue in addition to government funding. It generates revenue which is put back into the system to provide greater support.


Recollecting our most recent visit there, it was a great example of how they support people with disabilities and also the diversity of those who might be intellectually or physically disabled. It really does ground you. It was very hard, and it was great to see the leader of the coalition, Tony Abbott, put in a headlock by those working on the factory floor because they did not want him to leave. I do not think I got the same response—I do not know about you, Senator Fifield—but they had the leader in a headlock at one stage! Our program of visits which were scheduled while we were there for an hour or so was rolled out to probably double that—I do not know quite how long we were there in the end—because they did not want us to leave. They loved the engagement; they loved the opportunity to be able to offer and be involved in meaningful activities. This is what is so critical.


I acknowledge the importance of early intervention and therapy, because one-on-one sessions can identify learning issues. I am sure we all know of a lot of examples where diagnosis and early intervention have enabled individuals to go on into—for want of a better word—mainstream activities, mainstream schools and mainstream workplaces. It has to be our No. 1 goal to support people to do that. Early intervention does that through improving fiscal competency and may even slow or minimise the progression of a particular disability.


In essence, this legislation ultimately provides a greater choice for families. What it does is give a greater raft of opportunities for families, and various courses that they can take, so that they can provide greater support and so that we can provide greater support for them. The No. 1, fundamental thing is to appreciate and recognise those with disabilities and to give them the opportunity to be involved. I do not mean to say this in a patronising way, but they may be able to make an active contribution to society. They do now, and this provides a great opportunity for them to do that even more. I strongly support this and I would like, in closing, to recognise and acknowledge all those unsung Australian heroes who basically have held the disability sector together and who have supported what is an enormous, important area and task. I would like to pay my deepest respect to them.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (11:00):  I too rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013, and do so to support the bill.


I am sure that everybody who has stood in this place so far to speak on this particular bill would have risen and said that as parents—and most of us probably are parents—the one thing that you consider yourself very lucky for is when you have your children and your children come out 'with 10 toes and 10 fingers', as the senator said before. But there are many people who do not have that luxury. I think we do need to acknowledge that most of us in this place are extremely lucky because we have the luxury of not having to deal with the issue of disability on a firsthand basis.


There is certainly no doubt that everybody is touched by disability, or knows somebody who has the big task of looking after somebody with a disability, whether that be a mental, physical, emotional or challenging social disability. We all need to realise that in the blink of an eye that can change. I am sure many of us here know that as a result of accident, misfortune, illness or disease that in one minute what is otherwise a household of perfectly healthy people who get up every morning and get on with their lives can change 'just like that'.


In speaking to this bill I would like to make three points. Firstly, I believe an issue such as disability, and particularly how we as a society deal with disability, needs to be above partisan politics. This is not something that we can score points on, and nor should we even try to score points on it. What we should be doing is working together, all parties, whether we be the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party, the Greens or our Independent colleagues who sit here. We all need to be working towards a solution that is going to make the lives of people who are disabled in this country and of the people who have to care for them day in, day out and night in, night out easier. I think we do need to make a very clear distinction that any political game that is played with this particular piece of legislation is an absolute disgrace, and anybody who does that should be entirely ashamed of themselves.


I think everybody acknowledges that the current model of disability is broken. You only have to look around Australia to realise that if you live in one state or another state you will have matters in relation to disability treated differently. It depends on how your disability occurred; whether you are born with a disability. If you are going to have a disability you are probably better off to have one as a result of an accident, where you can sue someone. It does seem quite extraordinary that where you live and the nature of how your disability occurred can have such an extraordinary impact on the resources and support that you get for that particular disability.


A classic example of just how intense this can become is that in South Australia at the last state election a party was set up called Dignity for the Disabled, and that single-issue party actually managed to achieve a spot in the Legislative Council in South Australia. A young lady by the name of Kelly Vincent, who is disabled herself—wheelchair bound—was elected to the Legislative Council in South Australia. That was a complete and utter direct response to the fact that the South Australian disability system had completely let down people with a disability in South Australia. So we now have Kelly advocating from within the House of Parliament in Adelaide in relation to disability issues. I think that is an absolute reflection of the community's support for assistance and for some sensible measures to be taken in relation to how we deal with disability; the fact that we have a member of parliament who has gone into parliament simply because of the issue of how disabilities were being handled in the state of South Australia.


The second point I would like to make actually relates to productivity. I do not imagine that many people think of disability and productivity in the same breath, but there are a lot of people out there who have disabilities who have the capacity to add productively to the community, the environment and the economy in which they live and operate. I think we certainly need to be looking at ways in which we can give the responsibility, the onus and the ability back to people with disabilities to try to make as much of a productive contribution to their society as they possibly can.


There are a couple of programs that I would not mind bringing to the attention of the chamber. The first one is a program called the 'circles' program. It assists a person, particularly with a mental disability, to create a circle of friends—hence the reason it is called the 'circle' program. It encourages them to get out and create a new circle of friends outside of the traditional family and institutionalised care that they often get. They actually go out into the community and are encouraged to get a group of friends. Firstly, it relieves the family of the 24/7 burden of having to deal with the issues for that particular person. But it also gives them a wider network of opportunity to be able to find out what things are available for them out there.


It might be dealing with an issue of housing, it might be dealing with an issue of just going shopping. There are myriad things that people like us take for granted because we have such a wide circle of friends and contacts whom we actually draw on for all of the things—the experiences and activities—that we have in our lives. People with mental disabilities, particularly, often get shut down and they live within a very restricted cocooned environment. This circles program seeks to try and break out of that enclosed environment and allow people with disabilities the opportunity to get out.


They look to develop relationships. They create roles within these people's lives so that they can feel highly valued and can contribute. It allows them to develop competencies that they may not otherwise be able to see, simply because they do not have the opportunity to have those recognised. It also allows them to have community participation and inclusion, which is obviously a huge benefit and advantage in the quality of life of these people.


The other project that has been operating in South Australia and other states sets up microenterprise businesses. A group has set up within the community and talks to people about finding out what a disabled person really likes to do. We have one young girl in St Peters, in a suburb of Adelaide, who has set up her own microbusiness. Coincidentally her name is Fleur, French for flowers, and she has set up Fleur's Flowers. She goes around to small businesses—cafes and the like—every week and asks them if they want her to pop some flowers on their tables, and every week she goes back and she replaces those flowers. They pay her a reasonable, nominal amount. It is only just a little bit more than the cost of the flowers, but she has now got a purpose and so every morning she gets out of bed and goes down to the flower market. She buys her flowers and works out how many flowers she can do for the amount that she is charging each one of these businesses. She now has a productive purpose in life and she is actually earning a little bit of money. Even though she is certainly not removing the need for the assistance that she would otherwise have, she is actually supplementing her income and the support that she requires from outside by earning a little bit of money of her own.


Another amazing example of this particular project is a young man in Perth. When he was asked about the things he really liked to do, he said that he really liked waiting. Everybody thought, 'What do we do with somebody who really likes waiting?' They went through a myriad of other things that he might possibly like to do or might be interested in, but he was not interested. He just wanted to wait. Some inventive person actually came up with an idea. I do not know how many of you have been really annoyed when you need your telephone fixing or your power needs to be fixed and the guy at the utilities department says that they will be there sometime between nine o'clock and three o'clock in the afternoon. All of us have to go to work and it becomes very difficult, because you have to rush home or whatever. They have set up a microbusiness for this chap where he goes and sits in your house and waits for the tradesman to come along. He will let them in and then he will stand there and look after them and make sure that they are not damaging the house. He obviously gets paid a nominal amount for doing that, but he saves you the problem of actually having to stay home.


There are a lot of these inventive little businesses that some of these programs can look at. Those are the kinds of activities that we need to be looking at so that we can actually have a productive approach to how we deal with disabilities. It is about the efficient use of resources. It is about giving the people who know best—the people on the ground and who are dealing with these disabilities day in, day out, and even to some extent those people who do have disabilities—the opportunity to have a say in what happens to the money that is involved with disability. They are probably the people who are going to best placed to get the money spent where the money needs to be spent, instead of wasting it, as so often is the case in bureaucracy, on the administration—or people justifying the process of getting where they are going instead of spending money on productive outcomes for the people and places that need it.


Lastly, I want to talk about funding. The most important thing with any of these schemes is about getting the funding and getting on with the job. I notice that the Productivity Commission came out and suggested $3.9 billion. I understand at this stage that only $1 billion has been allocated. We need to get on with the job. We need to make a decision. We need to prioritise where this money is coming from and we need to get on with the job of implementing this program. We need the details about how it is going to get out there so that we can make sure that it is as efficient and as effective as it possibly can be.


I was just speaking this morning with a lady in South Australia, Judy Francis, who has a disabled son. In fact, she could not talk for terribly long because, even though he is 50 years old, she still has to take him to the doctor this morning. Judy was telling me that the scheme has been talked about for so long and many who are involved in disabilities—in Judy's case, in a first-hand way with her son—were all very excited when the project and the program was first raised and talked about. They thought, 'At last, at last, at last, we are going to see something happening in disabilities '. She has been working on getting appropriate housing because, like many parents who are ageing—and you can probably work out that if she has a 50-year-old son then Judy is at that stage in her life—she is looking towards achieving an ongoing care program for her son when she is no longer able to care for him. She saw the National Disability Insurance Scheme, when it was first touted, as a wonderful, wonderful opportunity where she could actually, with some comfort and some relief, have some opportunity for her son to be able to have a program put in place for when she was no longer able to care for him, as she and her husband currently do. 


We need to get on with this. We certainly need to stop what Senator Kroger was talking about, which was young people with disability whose parents are no longer able to look after them who are then going into aged-care homes. That is a completely inappropriate place for our young disabled people to be located. In my own home town, when I was visiting the nursing home not that long ago, I ran into a wonderful lady who had been looking after her profoundly disabled daughter all of her life at home. She is now no longer able to look after herself and here she is in a nursing home with this young woman who is in an aged-care facility—a completely inappropriate place for her to be.


In saying that, I, like all of my colleagues, am very excited about the opportunity to do something good and innovative so that we can move on—and for the legacy of this parliament to be that we actually did something in support of the people in our society who need our help. It is a judgement that will be made. I am certainly happy to support this bill and commend that everybody support the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:13):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. Today we are making history. Today we move, here in the Senate, to legislate a National Disability Insurance Scheme. At present, most people with a disability in Australia can expect to face a lifelong battle to achieve what the rest of us take for granted: they struggle to get the appropriate support to get out of bed, to get support for personal care with dignity, to leave their home if they have one, to get to school or work, to get a job, to be included and valued and to be part of the community.


We know we have to do better, because people with a disability deserve a fair go. We know that creating a more inclusive society is the right and decent thing to do and today, here in the Senate, we are taking a critical step in supporting people with disability to live their lives the way they want—supporting them in achieving their social and economic aspirations by having a truly inclusive Australia. Gone will be the days of pleading for assistance and having to describe one's circumstances in the worst possible light—a truly demoralising experience. Gone will be the cruel postcode lottery that currently exists. We will replace this with dignity and respect. We will transform disability services within Australia by building the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It is a scheme that recognises that all people live within families and communities, and this will be considered throughout the planning process. The scheme will support individuals with disability to make informed decisions and therefore maintain these strong, resilient families and communities where real choices of service provider can be made to deliver client focused and tailored services. 


To reach this point, to stand here today before the Senate with this bill, is a historic moment—a moment that has not just happened overnight. This has a history that dates back to the Whitlam Labor government. Forty years ago Prime Minister Whitlam sought to introduce a national compensation scheme, a fact that resonates with one of my advisers here today. And now, under another reformist Labor Prime Minister, we are here today to finish the job.


I have had the privilege of being party to some of the steps that got us here. In opposition I moved, on a number of occasions, a reference to inquire into the operation of the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, and was finally successful in 2006. This report was handed down in February 2007 and, once Labor formed government in November 2007, we got on with the job of implementing some of the recommendations. Establishing the new National Disability Agreement with dramatic increases in funding, focused outcomes and deliverables for disability programs and developing the National Disability Strategy were included in those recommendations and I am proud to say that, in true Labor fashion, we have delivered.


In July 2008 we signalled to the world our commitment to improving the lives of people with disability when we ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In Australia we have been working to fulfil our obligations under the UN convention to ensure that the mainstream service systems are focused on the principles of inclusion. In 2011, for the first time in our history, all governments—local, state, territory and our federal government—agreed to a National Disability Strategy, a unified, national approach to breaking down barriers faced by Australians with disability. Since this time we have been paving the way for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a revolutionary reform to the way we provide care and support in our country.


The NDIS has been the goal of so many people with disability, their families and carers and the disability service sector for so many years. You have worked so hard and today is your day. Today we salute your drive and determination, your patience and persistence and your plain hard work. There are many people we need to thank for their role in this long journey: members of the National People with Disabilities and Carer Council; the Productivity Commission, notably Commissioner Patricia Scott and Associate Commissioner John Walsh; the National Disability Insurance Scheme Advisory Group; the members of the four expert working groups; the National Disability and Carer Alliance; and all our peak disability and carers bodies. Thank you to Every Australian Counts, including: the state bodies, the community campaigners and of course the 154,654 Australians who have signed up to this campaign; the 674 people who have had their say online via ndis.gov.au forums; and to all those people with disability, their family members and carers, and their service providers and advocates who have attended any one of the 70-plus forums that Minister Macklin and I have held across the country.


I also take this opportunity to put on the record my thanks to Senator Claire Moore and the members of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for their work in recent months, talking to people right across the country and delivering a constructive and informative report. In doing so, I also thank the people who made the almost 1,600 submissions—again, we have heard you. Many tens of thousands of Australians have had a part in designing the NDIS, and it shows. To each and every one of you: you have made a significant contribution to this historic reform. Australia will be a better place for everyone because of your efforts and for that I thank you.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme will be an insurance scheme for all Australians, that will provide care and support services based on need to any Australian with a significant or profound disability regardless of how they acquired that disability, in much the same way as all Australians have access to social security and universal healthcare systems that provide entitlement to services based on need. This bill establishes the framework of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency. It will enable the scheme to be launched and the agency to be established in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme will benefit around 26,000 people with disability and their families and carers living in South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, the Hunter region in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria. The scheme established by this bill will transform the lives of people with disability and those of their families and carers. For the first time they will have their needs met in a way that truly supports them in living with choice and dignity. It will bring an end to the tragedy of services denied or delayed, and instead offer people with disability the care and support they need over their lifetimes. As was found by the Productivity Commission in its extensive inquiry, and I quote:


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, and gives people with a disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports.


It needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed now, and this bill will take a critical step in doing just that.


Every 30 minutes, on average, someone in Australia is diagnosed with a significant disability. This could be any of us, as disability does not discriminate. Only those with considerable wealth could possibly afford the costs of lifetime care that are required in response. Most Australians with a disability cannot carry this responsibility alone, nor should they be left to. This bill will implement the first stage of a nationwide, demand-driven system of care, tailored to the needs of each individual and established on a durable, long-term basis. The bill reflects the extensive work on design, funding and governance undertaken with states and territories, with people with disability, their families and carers, and with other key stakeholders, work which is ongoing as we continue to build and refine the scheme.


The current funding model, based on historical annual budget allocations, will be replaced by an insurance approach based on actuarial analysis of need and future costs. The scheme will respond to each individual's goals and aspirations for their lifetime, affording certainty and peace of mind for people with disability and their carers alike. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency will work with people to plan and to take account of their individual circumstances and needs. The scheme will give people the care and support that is objectively assessed as being reasonable and necessary over the course of their lifetime.


The bill sets out the objects and principles under which a National Disability Insurance Scheme will operate including giving people choice and control over the care and support they receive and giving effect, in part, to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It sets out the process for a person becoming a participant in the scheme, how participants develop a personal, goal based plan with the agency and how reasonable and necessary supports will be assured to participants. People will be able to decide for themselves the type of care and support they receive and choose how they want to manage those supports. They will be able to access assistance from local coordinators, should they wish, and early intervention therapies and supports will be offered where they will improve a person's functioning or slow, or prevent, the progression of their disability over their lifetime. The bill also provides that the agency will be responsible for the provision of support to people with disability, their families and carers. 


Again, I thank all of those who have contributed so far to this important debate. Some amendments have been made to the bill in the House of Representatives to address decisions made by the Council of Australian Governments, other agreements negotiated with the states and territories, and from ongoing engagement with people with disabilities, their families, carers, advocates and services providers. Those amendments also responded to some of the matters raised in submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee during its inquiry into the bill. Further amendments will be moved by the government here in the Senate. These amendments respond further to the recommendations in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's report on the bill, tabled last week. For example, one amendment revises the objects clause of the bill to reflect Australia's international human rights obligations more strongly and to ensure that this clause operates in conjunction with other laws. A further amendment will recognise the importance of advocacy in the lives of people with a disability.


In closing, I thank many departmental officials from FaHCSIA, including those working for the agency, Prime Minister and Cabinet, and other departments who have been engaged in the design process. Your work has been enormous. I also thank those state and territory officials from across Australia whose work has helped us to get to this point. This bill will be an enormous first step in bringing equality to people with disability, their families and carers. Our government will continue to work with people with a disability, and their families and carers, as we continue to establish a National Disability Insurance Scheme. I thank all senators who have spoken in this debate for their support of this historic legislation and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:28):  I just wanted, at the start of the committee stage, to acknowledge some people. In my second reading speech I acknowledged those beyond the parliament and the government who had been instrumental in bringing the legislation to this point, but I did want to thank Senator McLucas and her office for the courtesies extended to my office and to me during this process. I also wanted to thank Senator Macklin's office and acknowledge the work of Senator Moore, as the chair of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, in stewarding the inquiry into the NDIS legislation. I think Senator Moore really ranks with Senator Payne when it comes to the discipline she imposes upon committees that she has chaired. I would also like to thank Senator Siewert, as deputy chair, for her contribution there. It is also important to acknowledge the committee secretariat of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, Dr Ian Holland, and his staff, who worked extremely hard in a very compressed time frame.


I also thank the 1,597 people and organisations who made submissions to that inquiry. We will, in the course of this morning, see some of the fruits of the work of that committee come to bear as some of the recommendations that were made by the committee are taken up. I should also acknowledge officers of FaHCSIA, for their very hard work in bringing the legislation to this place, and Mr David Bowen.


I also want to express my pleasure that the notice of motion that was circulated last night in relation to the proposal to guillotine debate on the NDIS legislation looks as though it will not come to pass. I in no way reflect on Senator McLucas in relation to that motion because I know these things are determined by others in this place with chamber responsibilities. I am sure Senator McLucas was instrumental in seeing that motion not come to pass by her internal advocacy in the government because I know she, of all people, would not want there to be any curtailing of debate on this legislation.


I want to move to what will probably be the least significant issue raised in this committee stage, so let me get it out of the way first—that is, the issue of the proposed name change for the NDIS. Minister Macklin, in a press release on 18 March—two days ago; I am losing track of time—headed 'Extra funding for playgroups to give kids a better start', announced on the second page in paragraph 14 a name change. This is not where I naturally would look for an announcement about a change of name for the NDIS, nevertheless, it was there. In the release it said:


Ms Macklin said the Government was taking a big step this week toward peace of mind for people with disability, their families and carers with the passage of the NDIS Bill through Parliament.


In another step that this care and support is about to become real for Australians with disability and their families, we now have a name for the National Disability Insurance Scheme—


I thought we had one, but anyway it goes on—


'DisabilityCare Australia'.


The release continues:


The name has been chosen based on consultations with people with disability, their families and carers, peak organisations and the general public.


DisabilityCare Australia reflects the principles of the NDIS—that all Australians with significant or profound disability receive the care and support they need, regardless of how they acquired that disability.


I was a little surprised that the proposed name change was buried—that is the only way to put it—at the bottom of a press release in relation to funding for playgroups.


There was some reaction from stakeholders in relation to the proposed name change, and I will just go through a few of those. Lesley Hall, who is well known to all of us presently in the chamber, the chief executive of the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations said:


It does not represent what the scheme is about …


The scheme is not just about caring, it's about supporting people to have to get on and do what they want in life.


She continued to say:


She said the word ""care"" had implied the scheme was linked to welfare and paternalism.


David Heckendorf, who has cerebral palsy, said:


Oh, come on guys! Really? Disability Care? Why not go all the way and call it Crip Care? …


It is not about caring. It is about empowering or enabling, equipping, etc. Can't we be a little more imaginative?


And Jackie Softly said:


I hate the name. But I worry more that the name reflects the way the powers that be see it. Now that is very scary …


Kelly Vincent, the Dignity for Disability member of parliament in the South Australian Legislative Council, who Senator Ruston made reference to before, said in response to the proposed name change: 


We aren't a scheme for sick people needing care—we're people with disabilities that need to be supported, assisted and enabled …


We don't need the NDIS name change to further perpetuate patronising attitudes.


I was surprised about the manner of the announcement of the name change, and it would seem from that selection of quotes that there is some concern in the sector among some people with disability that the name might not be an accurate reflection of the nature of the scheme.


My questions to the parliamentary secretary are these. Can she supply some additional background as to the process that was gone through in relation to seeking to rebrand the NDIS and whether DisabilityCare Australia is the settled name for the NDIS? Is it intended to be a trading name that will replace National Disability Insurance Scheme? Will the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency be renamed to the DisabilityCare Australia Launch Transition Agency? I am interested in the process that led to the new name. I am also interested in the manner of its announcement and what the intention of the government is as to how exactly it will be used.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:36):  Senator, in answer to your questions, I need to provide some clarity for you. This is not a name change. National Disability Insurance Scheme was the name that Mr Bonyhady took to the 2020 summit some years ago. It is a name that was then picked up by the Productivity Commission in their work. There have been a number of senior and key players who have had conversations about whether or not the word 'insurance' should rightly sit in that name.


It was always the plan of the government to provide a name that is accessible and means something to Australians broadly, particularly Australians with disability, in the same way that Medicare comes from the Health Insurance Act in Australia. We do not have a Medicare act; we have the Health Insurance Act. In the same way Centrelink is delivered through the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency Act—that is how we have Centrelink. So it is not unusual; it is, in fact, predictable. It is not a point that, I think, carries much weight, so can I suggest we get on with the main job. Your question was in terms of the agency. That is a matter for deliberation down the track; it is not a consideration at present.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:38):  As I indicated at the outset, this is the least important matter that will be raised here, but given it has only arisen in the last few days and has been the comment of a number of people with disability, I thought it was worth giving the parliamentary secretary the opportunity to provide some additional context around the proposed branding of the scheme. As I think I indicated yesterday, it is not something about which the opposition wish to make a capital case, but I think it deserved some brief ventilation.

   (b) ensure that all members are persons with skills, experience or knowledge that will help the Advisory Council perform its function; and


   (c) ensure that:


      (i) a majority of the members are people with disability; and


      (ii) at least 2 of the members are carers of people with disability; and


      (iii) at least one of the members is a person who has skills, experience or knowledge in relation to disability in rural or regional areas; and


      (iv) at least one of the members is a person who has skills, experience or knowledge in the supply of equipment, or the provision of services, to people with disability.


Note: A particular member may meet one or more of the conditions in subparagraphs (5)(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv).


By way of explanation of these government amendments, the government has moved amendments in the House to respond to what we have heard from people with disability and their families and carers, from service providers and from the states and territories. Many people have also provided their views to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill, and the government is proposing additional amendments to be moved in the Senate to respond to the committee's report.


The amendments in the House were designed to make it clear that a fundamental aim of the scheme is to maximise the independence of people with disability. In delivering the NDIS, they require that the agency supports the independence, participation and exercise of choice and control by people with disability. The amendments we are moving in the Senate also make clear that, in addition to the cultural and linguistic circumstances of people with disability, their gender should be taken into account by anyone acting on behalf of a person with a disability. That is amendment (8) and responds to committee recommendation 5.


Amendments (1), (2) and (9) and committee recommendation 1 give greater visibility to the object of the scheme that relates to the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other relevant human rights conventions. They include a specific reference to the object of maximising independence for people with disability.


The Senate committee also discussed the role of advocacy and the NDIS in great detail, and the government is proposing amendments to acknowledge the role of advocacy in representing the interests of people with disability and to recognise that advocacy supports people with disability in a range of ways. Those amendments are (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) and respond to committee recommendation 7.


Amendments (10), (11), (12) and (15) respond to committee recommendation 18. In response to a request by the Senate committee, the amendments also clarify that where an examination is required for access, planning or reviewing in addition to medical, psychiatric and psychological examinations there can be other examinations conducted by an appropriately qualified person.


Amendments (13) and (14) respond to committee recommendation 20. To respond to the Senate committee's concerns, the amendments ensure that NDIS rules can be made to deal with the mechanisms registered providers of supports must have in place for dealing with conflicts of interests. There is a risk of conflicts of interest arising, for example, if a registered provider of supports both provides supports to people with disability and manages funding for supports under plans. The NDIS rules will be able to specify approval criteria and/or ongoing obligations that registered providers of supports must meet for managing conflicts of interest. The NDIS rules will be able to provide more detail around what kind of mechanisms a registered provider who undertakes both functions must have in place.


Amendments (15) and (16) respond to committee recommendation 29. Amendments moved in the Senate provide for greater representation of people with disability on the advisory council while ensuring that a diverse experience of disability is also reflected. As recommended by the Senate committee, the amendments mean that a majority of the people on the advisory council will be people with disability and there will be at least one member who has experience or knowledge of disability in rural and regional areas. This is in addition to the existing requirements that there be at least two people who are carers of people with disability and at least one person with experience or skills in the supply of equipment or services. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:43):  I have a series of questions around those amendments. While I commend the government for taking on a number of the recommendations from the committee, there are some that are not necessarily being done through amendments, and there are also questions around those amendments and what is in scope or not. Should we go through issue by issue, because I am sure that Senator Fifield has questions as well? I also have a few questions around amendments that were made in the House of Representatives to the compensation provisions, which Senator Xenophon also brings up, and may clarify some of the issues Senator Xenophon is trying to address through his amendments. Perhaps we could do compensation first. I am looking around the chamber to see if that is okay with people.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Furner
):  Let us start with that, Senator Siewert.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I appreciate the government has already moved to deal with the issue of subrogation, which, as the parliamentary secretary will know, came up time and again. The issue that came up time and again by a number of organisations—and the chamber has a deep interest in this at the moment—was why the CEO still needs those powers to compel participants to seek compensation. One of the key issues that came out during the Senate inquiry was the fact that the CEO could compel. That is why the argument was there for subrogation. Can the parliamentary secretary explain why those powers are still necessary given the subrogation issue has been dealt with?

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:45):  We need to ensure that insurers, both public and private, maintain effort. The last thing we want to do is shift costs to the NDIS that are in fact the appropriate costs of another insurance agency. If we were to essentially take over the responsibility of other both public and private insurers, that would put real pressure, in our view, on the fund with potential serious impacts not only in a funding sense. Insurance requires that, if something has gone wrong, the appropriate insurer should pay the costs of that event.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:46):  I understand that and that is the whole purpose of the compensation provisions. The point there is that if you are enabling the CEO to subrogate anyway—and I am not a lawyer so I may not be using 'subrogation' and 'subrogate' in the correct context—why still have those powers in there to compel? Does that make sense?

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:47):  The answer to that is that you have to start from somewhere. The first question the CEO asks a participant is: will you go to the TAC and make a claim, for example? There has to be a start to the process. Then, as you know, through subrogation that person may say they do not want to and then the CEO has another set of options in front of them to be able to take a matter on their behalf—and I think you understand the trickle-down options that are available following the amendments in the House of Representatives. But the answer to your question is that you have to start somewhere. So the first step is you ask a participant to take an action at the appropriate insurer.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:48):  I acknowledge that the amendment that the government moved and was passed in the House did go some way towards addressing the recommendation of the Senate committee, but I want to follow up on what the parliamentary secretary was saying before. A lay person reading the amended legislation would see that the chief executive has great powers of compulsion. I appreciate that the way a mechanism of this sort operates in reality may not be as blunt as it appears in the legislation. Are you saying that, if an individual elects not to pursue action themselves or they do nothing, by so doing they have in fact elected to subrogate their responsibility to the CEO? Although it may look in black and white as though the chief executive is directing that something happen, in fact the way it will operate in practice is that the individual is in effect electing to make a choice and to subrogate some of their rights to the CEO.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:49):  I think we need to put this in a little bit of context. The first point I would make is that a person who has just been involved in a very traumatic event probably is not going to go to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act to ascertain what their next steps are. They will be associated with their insurance company and they will be referred to the national disability insurance agency locally provided, and this will be done extremely sensitively and compassionately. That was very much the message we received from the Senate Committee Affairs Legislation Committee.


In terms of how it will happen, there will be a discussion undoubtedly. If the case does concern legal action, there will be a discussion managed very sensitively with the individual to ascertain whether they wish to take that legal action. I imagine this will be a discussion not held on just one occasion. There will be an opportunity for there to be further discussion if the person says they are not doing that. That is when subrogation occurs and that is when there is an opportunity for the CEO to ascertain whether legal action is appropriate or whether they should take it on behalf of the person who has been involved in that event.

I would be interested in whether you have received any legal advice as to what the practical outworking of the proposition that Senator Xenophon has put forward may be, just to provide a little light, because being a layman I have read amendments such as his and it is not immediately apparent as to what the practical import may be.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:53):  Are we then leaving the rest of the compensation issues until Senator Xenophon gets here? It seems to make sense.




Senator McLucas:
  Yes.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I might leave the issue around legal privilege till then as well. Can I move on to advocacy. This is an issue that came up extensively, and the Greens also have an amendment on advocacy. Many submitters drew a clear distinction between the systemic advocacy to improve access for all people with a disability in specific areas of need, and they also looked at individual advocacy, particularly advocacy for individuals who are in dispute with the NDIA. On the weight of evidence, the Australian Greens, as I articulated in my second reading contribution, felt that it was better to leave the funding of advocacy outside the scheme, but we still felt it was very important, and we very strongly support the committee's recommendations that the concept of advocacy be included in the NDIS, which the government is doing through these amendments.


The role of advocacy is brought into sharp focus by the mechanisms by which each participant and others can seek to challenge and address decisions of the agency. We have supported the recommendation that launch sites should monitor this aspect. So the issue that came up was the immediate review and then going to what people felt was the more extreme AAT approach. They were looking for something in between. I understand the government's concern about setting a whole new process up through the launch sites, because they want to get this up and running, which is why the committee recommended that there be this process of monitoring this particular aspect to see if there are a lot of concerns coming up during the launch site process and to see whether there is a need for an intermediate step between those two levels of what is essentially appeal. There was, of course, that call for funding of advocacy.


So the problem here is that, yes, we totally get the weight of evidence that suggests that we should not be funding advocacy under the agency, but that then leaves out there the issue of advocacy and how we are going to fund it. The problem is that in the past—I am not pointing the figure at any particular governments here—we have seen funding for advocacy go up and down. We have had previous attempts to muzzle advocacy, and under this government there was the failure to index some of the grants to advocacy agencies—which was, I have to say, reversed, but it can be something that comes and goes, and that is not good for advocacy. So my question to government is: one of the recommendations in the report was funding of advocacy, so what is the government doing about funding for advocacy services, given that they will not be provided for through the scheme itself?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:57):  Senator Siewert can be assured that the government totally understands the necessity for strong advocacy services. We are moving into a new age, and people will have different questions, and many people will need to be supported through that process. So I have just moved amendments that recognise the role of advocacy, but we are working to ensure that the merits system is accessible and as non-adversarial as possible. Mr Bowen has said—I think it was at Senate estimates—that seeking a resolution to any issue has to be the first priority and that path will be taken to internally manage any question as assiduously as possible.


As you indicated, we will be providing additional funding to advocacy organisations to ensure that advocacy support is available. We are working through the detail of that at the moment. As you know, advocacy agencies are funded in different ways around the country. We have undertaken an extensive mapping exercise with the support of our National Disability Advocacy Program funded agencies, and we have also undertaken to look at those agencies that are funded by states and territories to ensure that we have the advocacy and also the interrelationship between various agencies strengthened so that people can navigate the advocacy system as well.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (11:59):  I thank Senator Siewert for enabling me to jump in. I know she has other questions. For a variety of reasons I did not have the opportunity to speak on the second reading debate, and I hope I might have the leave of colleagues to make some general comments. In all likelihood I will be out of the building when Senator Fifield's amendment in relation to the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee is debated. With the leave of the parliamentary secretary, I will make some quick comments to that.


Senator Fifield has said for a long time that the NDIS should be beyond partisan politics. That is why he, as the responsible shadow, and the coalition in totality seek the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics. If we are going to be fair to men, women, children and families with disabilities as a nation, we must undercommit and overdeliver. If we overcommit and underdeliver then we are letting down a group of Australians who are relying on us as parliamentarians to ensure that this works. As Senator Fifield knows full well, I have the great honour of being the godparent of two young people with disabilities, and I know that their parents do not want this to be about politics. They want it to be about outcomes. That was communicated to me by one of these parents in no uncertain terms a couple of weeks ago. They want us to ensure that this is all above politics. I ask the government again to reconsider Senator Fifield's amendment, because this is, in my view, the surest way of ensuring that the politics and the heat are taken out of this.


I think it is a very, very good amendment. It is good because it is right for people with disabilities. It is good and right for those families of people with a disability. In the strongest possible terms I urge honourable senators to enable the perception and the reality amongst the community that this is above politics. As I said before, we have a unique opportunity to genuinely make generational change, and we must never lose sight of either the opportunity or the requirement to do so. Thank you.

I have been working around this stuff for over six years, and nothing is going to get in the way of delivering for people I have had the fortune of meeting who currently are not being provided a service that anyone in this country could be proud of. We have worked extraordinarily hard.


The proposal that the opposition has put is not a practical answer to ensuring that we do get the delivery that we are all seeking—including me. We have a number of governance arrangements in place that will ensure that we deliver a national disability insurance scheme starting on 1 July in your state in the Barwon region. To do that, we have worked very closely with states and territories, and a lot of those are Liberal Party states and territories. The politics has been left outside the door. I pay tribute to Minister Mary Wooldridge of your state because she has been extremely cooperative and helpful, as have her departmental officials. I say the same for Mr Constance from New South Wales. This is well and truly above politics. This is about getting it right for people with disability. I hope that comforts your godchildren's parents.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:09):  I will indicate the opposition's disposition towards the government amendments, taking each in turn. Amendments (1), (2) and (9) relate to more clearly referencing Australia's treaty obligations. That was recommended by the Senate committee, and the opposition have no issue with that. Government amendments (3) and (8) relate to giving a more specific reference on advocacy, which Senator Siewert has also been pursuing, and that also was a recommendation of the Senate committee. I think the form of words the government has alighted on is the appropriate form of words in this area to give appropriate recognition to the central role that advocacy plays in the lives of many people with disability to ensure that they are able to attain their full rights, but it does observe the appropriate demarcation that advocacy be separately funded.


Government amendments (10), (12) and (15) make a little clearer the sorts of professionals that the CEO can seek advice from. With the original drafting there was a concern that it might inadvertently exclude, by not listing, certain professionals. This leaves that more open, which I think is appropriate.


Government amendments (13) and (14) relate to conflicts of interests in relation to service providers. Again, the Senate committee and particularly Senator Boyce had a concern that reference to organisations having appropriate mechanisms to resolve conflicts of interest and to ensure that there are not conflicts of interest should be in the primary legislation. I acknowledge that the government has taken that on board.


Government amendment (16), which relates to the membership of the advisory board, I think is helpful in ensuring that there is appropriate representation. I am particularly pleased that there is the maintenance of having at least two positions for people who represent carers. I just wanted to indicate our disposition towards each of those government amendments.

You will be aware that, during the Senate inquiry, issues around Aboriginal engagement with the scheme and concerns particularly about some cultural aspects of disability in Aboriginal communities were raised. There were comments made in a report about looking at the possibility of a launch site. I understand the government does not want to have a specific launch site for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There were some recommendations. My question goes to how you are going to better engage Aboriginal communities in the scheme, given the very substantial issues that have been raised.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:15):  I do not want it on the record that we do not want a launch site that covers Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As you know, launch sites were identified through nominations from various states and territories in terms of what they were proposing. We are very pleased that in South Australia there are discussions continuing around the provision of services in remote parts of the state for the first cohort and as it grows. That will be an important learning for us as well. We have had discussions around the APY Lands with South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia, thinking that we may be able to do something more broadly than simply in the South Australian area, as does happen with a range of other programs.


The other thing to go to is the number of practical design fund projects that have been funded that do focus on a number of issues; notably, the fact that for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians the word disability is not part of their lexicon. We need to make sure that we do overcome this underutilisation of even current disability services by people who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It is something that we are very aware of. We are working very closely with the First Peoples Disability Network and I commend Mr Damian Griffis for his engagement and representation. He has been wonderful to work with. It is an issue that I am personally very aware of, living next to Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait, where service delivery is very difficult. I am keen to make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in rural and remote areas, but also in urban areas. Let's not forget that many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders live in our cities and they also underutilise disability services. Yes, we have a big piece of work to do, and we are working on it.

I know through other work that I do in this space, particularly with hearing, that there is great difficulty for people incarcerated accessing services. It was raised during the Senate inquiry. Could you provide any information on whether the scheme can be extended to people in custody? If it can, how will that process work?

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:21):  It is often difficult to extend services to people once they enter custody. We have been working on this in relation to access for Australian Hearing to provide services particularly to Aboriginal people suffering hearing loss. We know that people with disability are overrepresented in custodial places. There is nothing to preclude someone being a participant while in custody, if their usual place of residence is in the launch site. There would be some limits to what they might be able to access and the rules will outline what the NDIS can provide. For example, I could imagine that if a person needs personal care and support it would be very hard to provide that in a custodial setting. The agency is working with each jurisdiction to map interfaces with other systems to ensure that accountabilities are clear and that administrative processes are effective. But can I point you to the rules in schedule 1, on page 23, at 7.29(b), which state:


The NDIS will be responsible for:


…   …   …


(b) where a person is in a custodial setting supports which are required as a result of the person's functional impairment and are additional to supports required by the general population in relation to the following:


(i) aids and appliances; and

We actually do have a prison in the Barwon region. A state that has established a prison system has a duty of care to the people who are in that prison. You have made the point—and I have heard it many times—that you do not know that that duty of care always extends appropriately, particularly in terms of services for people with disability. But we are working through those boundary issues. We can continue to update the committee as required, as we get more information about how that will technically work.

The parliamentary secretary will be aware—and I am sure the minister is also aware—that this issue came up during the committee inquiry. That is, the issue of the process of recovery, which is the focus of mental health, and around the issues of recovery rather than seeing disability as an ongoing permanent disability. It was raised a number of times. While I think some people are pretty clear about it there is still a lot of concern, because mental health takes a recovery approach, as to whether it will be included for those people who are very strongly in their pain process looking at a recovery approach.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:28):  I just want to raise the issue of guide dogs. It is often and usually the case at the moment that individuals who need the assistance of guide dogs gain those at no cost to themselves as a result of the fundraising efforts of particular organisations which largely self-fund these services. Minister, I would appreciate your assistance in working through how that situation will operate under an NDIS. For example, you may have the scenario where an individual receives support, an entitlement, through the NDIS and they go to a service that previously provided, say, a guide dog at no cost to the individual receiving that service. How will that organisation be able to identify that that individual actually receives funded support as opposed to another individual who may not be eligible for NDIS supports?


Let's say they are over the age of 65, they go to a guide dogs organisation and they receive a guide dog at no expense to themselves. 


I am interested in working this through as a representative example of how the NDIS might work. Will there be a requirement that the organisations providing the guide dogs have the individual, who will be in receipt of those services, sign a statutory declaration saying that they are or are not in receipt of NDIS supports? It would be appropriate that that individual put some of that NDIS support towards that organisation from which they might previously have received the service at no expense. What will be the mechanism for that organisation to receive the appropriate payments? Essentially, how will that organisation seek to identify those people who should be making a contribution to a service that may previously have been free through their NDIS supports?

First of all, I love guide dogs and I think they are beautiful—I do not know how relevant that is. Secondly, we have indicated that guide dogs are included in the NDIS. The test will be the same test applied to every assisted technology, every support that is provided—that is, is it reasonable and necessary.


The substantive point you are making is: how will an entity that is delivering guide dogs at quite reasonable expense know that the person is approved to be provided a guide dog? The agency is working that detail through at the moment. The point that was made by those who visited us yesterday is a good point, and we are working through it. The legislation is quite clear that the person is entitled to supports and if they purchase something outside of the supports they have agreed to then they are liable. No, you cannot go to the guide dog society and get a guide dog if you are not entitled to one. Sorry, Senator Fifield, you cannot have a guide dog.

There will be scenarios where an individual is not entitled to NDIS supports, but in the view of the guide dog organisation they have the need for a guide dog. It may be that they are over the age of 65 and they acquired vision impairment later in life, so they will not be entitled to NDIS supports. However, in the view of the guide dog organisation they would be someone the organisation would look to provide a guide dog to. There will still be a need for these organisations to have the capacity to differentiate between those individuals who are funded and those who are not.

They were concerned around insecure working conditions and wanted to make sure that measures were put in place like enhanced skills training capacity of people working in the disability sector. What is the government doing with that recommendation? Have they taken it on board and are there any actions that you think need to be put in place to deal with that issue around the potential for insecure work, given the move to self-directed funds? They were not having a go at that move—and neither am I, I strongly support that—but I think they raise some legitimate issues.

The government appointed an expert working group to advise on the issues affecting sector capacity and workforce issues as we transition to an NDIS. Their work has been very extensive and ongoing. We are also working to continue this work as we progress, including the need for a forward looking comprehensive workforce strategy. We have had conversations with some of the unions around that question as well. This must consider the move to individualised funding and the impact of that on working arrangements, and it is also a part of the broader work we are doing on consumer directed care. That is the interface that we are talking about. It is an issue that we are very alive to, and we intend to work very closely with all relevant stakeholders as we meet and beat the challenge that is in front of us. It is a big challenge and we are growing a large workforce of people. The questions of quality are real and we will ensure that we do provide a quality workforce. That is absolutely fundamental to the delivery of a quality scheme.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Would you like to speak to that, Senator Siewert?




Senator SIEWERT:
  I will do so very quickly, because I would love to get this one dealt with as well. This one relates to the function of the agency. We believe that the bill includes the principle that providing reasonable ministry support extends before financial support and capacity building to include a responsibility or function to ensure that people with a disability can live independently and participate fully in the community. This function is broadly similar to the idea of systemic advocacy that is covered extensively in the committee report. We touched on it in our additional comments and we took on board very strongly the comments made by, for example, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Mr Graeme Innes.


So this amendment provides that broader function for the agency. In particular, during the committee discussion it strongly came up as the intersection between the NDIS and delivery of mainstream services, and the discussion very clearly highlighted that it was not the idea that the scheme replace services that should be delivered from mainstream services and that, in fact, there is going to be a need to do some negotiating sometimes with some of those mainstream services. So we believe very strongly that this will enhance the functioning and powers of the agency. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-20,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:42):  Senator Siewert suggested that the lights dimmed when I got up to speak. I am sure that was a factual statement, not a metaphorical one! I move the amendment standing in my name, amendment (1) on sheet 7362:


(1) Clause 4, page 5 (after line 23), after subclause (5), insert:


   (5A) People with disability have a right to access independent disability advocacy support to promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and to enable them to participate fully in the community.


This relates to providing assistance for people with a disability in terms of the issue of advocacy. One of the concerns that I raised in my second reading contribution was that at the moment, if there is a dispute—and it will get to that, unfortunately, in some cases—there will be situations when a person with a disability will, in the absence of this amendment, simply not have the support of an advocacy service. So there may be someone who has a profound disability and has to slug it out with representatives from the Australian government—the Australian Government Solicitor's office or a large legal firm representing the Australian government. That to me seems to be fundamentally unfair. What this amendment states is that people with disability have a right to access independent disability advocacy support to promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and to enable them to participate fully in the community.


There are other issues in terms of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which will be dealt with eventually, but I think that it is important that, for the purpose of this particular amendment, there must be some assistance for people with a disability in terms of advocacy. The parliamentary secretary said in the course of debate on the earlier amendments that the government were considering their position in relation to this, because simply having a phrase in the legislation that says everyone has the right to advocacy is all very well but, unless you actually provide that advocacy, you are not going to achieve the outcome that is desired. So this is consistent with the government's approach, but this is actually doing something about it, and that is why I think it is very important that this amendment be supported, because otherwise it will make a mockery of the framework that is meant to provide advocacy for those with a disability. Unless it is entrenched by this amendment, it just will not happen.


Progress reported.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. The cooperative approach that we certainly believe needs to be taken in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme is well exemplified by the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell showing how effective cooperation can be achieved when they signed an intergovernmental agreement in December for a full state-wide NDIS rollout after the Hunter launch project. I referred earlier in my remarks to the role of the New South Wales minister, Andrew Constance, in that occurring. I would hope that what we see from the government is the Prime Minister applying that very constructive approach to negotiations with the other states and territories.


I also want to refer to those states which are not specifically hosting a launch site but which are nevertheless committed to the NDIS, including both Queensland and Western Australia. The Productivity Commission, in its work, did not envisage that every state would host a launch site but it also did not see the absence of a launch site as a barrier to participation in the national rollout. While the coalition supports the government's $1 billion commitment, we cannot reconcile this figure with the $3.9 billion the Productivity Commission said would be needed over the forward estimates for phase 1 of the NDIS. We are hoping that the government will explain this and make appropriate provisions in the coming May budget.


On the bill itself: it establishes the framework for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, known as the agency. This will enable the scheme to be launched and the agency to operate the launch in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme will benefit more than 20,000 people with a disability, their families and their carers living in South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria.


The scheme will provide funding to individuals or organisations to help those people with disabilities to participate more fully in economic and social life through the provision of an entitlement enabling things such as aids, equipment, supported accommodation or personal attendant care.


The mechanics of the agency will be established by way of legislative instruments called the NDIS rules. These regulations will further detail areas such as eligibility and assessment criteria. The government released a discussion paper on the rules on 1 February this year, but the discussion paper perhaps left a little to be desired in the information it contained. It proposed a series of questions this but it was not really a draft set of rules. This is significant, as the bill itself is essentially a framework; it establishes a transition agency, the board, the CEO and general definition of eligibility. But the nuts and bolts of the scheme will be established by the rules.


A recurrent theme in the evidence presented by witnesses was that it was difficult to offer advice, to pose questions or to plan for the launch sites in the absence of the substantive rules. The government released seven drafts of NDIS rules on the final day of hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on Tuesday, 5 March. These included draft rules for becoming a participant; draft rules for children; draft rules for privacy—and my colleague Senator Mason has referred to those at some length in his remarks; draft rules for nominees; draft rules for support; draft rules for registered providers; and draft rules for plan management. They are still the subjects of consultation with the states and territories and disability stakeholders, and the coalition is also studying them carefully.


The government has also indicated that there are potentially dozens of batches of draft rules to be released. I suggest that that is not the way to do this. The rules need to be released quickly, and well before the passage of the bill through the parliament, but given the position in which we find ourselves here in this chamber today that would seem to not be the case. In her second reading speech the Prime Minister indicated the government's intention to bring the final version of the bill to a vote in the budget session. Those remaining rules urgently need to be released to enable proper scrutiny and consultation with stakeholders. The risk with this government, as always, is in its ability to implement it competently. In the absence of these rules it makes it very difficult for stakeholders in particular.


The interaction of three components—the NDIS bill, the NDIS rules and the operating guidelines for the NDIS launch transition agency—will determine how the NDIS operates. Developing a complete picture of how the NDIS will unfold is limited by incomplete and insufficient information. The work of the Senate committee has been critical in this space, and it should have had the benefit of the full rules and the operating guidelines for the agency before it was able to finish its work.


To sum up, it is appropriate to acknowledge the role played by figures on both sides of the chamber in helping to elevate the public policy profile of disability. I particularly acknowledge the coalition's shadow spokesman on this matter, Senator Mitch Fifield, who across my area of Western Sydney—and across the rest of Australia, from reports from my colleagues—has been unstinting in his efforts to make sure that we as a coalition engage with the most important stakeholders in this vital policy area and that we hear directly from them as to their views and their concerns. That is the way that we would formulate policy. That is the approach that we take, and there is no better exemplar than Senator Fifield. But the most credit must go to people with disabilities—to their families, to their carers and to the organisations that support them, including those very important organisations that I mentioned in Western Sydney in particular. They came together and decided that enough was enough. They said, 'There must be a better way to do this, and we won't stop until we find it.'


The coalition wants the NDIS to be a success regardless of who is in government at any time. We want the launch sites to run smoothly. We stand ready to work with the government and with all jurisdictions to make the NDIS a reality.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-20,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:39):  At the outset, I indicate my support for the very worthy concept of this scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. But it is important that we ensure the implementation of this scheme is effective, efficient and sustainable in the long term. For too long, Australia has been lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to support and care for people with disabilities. In my view, it is unacceptable that Australians with a disability still find it so difficult to be part of everyday life and to be involved in work and activities that are meaningful and important to them—in short, to live a full and dignified life.


The Productivity Commission inquiry that prompted this scheme was scathing in its assessment of the current support systems. I know these words from the commission's report have been repeated again and again, but they are worth quoting once more:


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient. It gives people with a disability little choice, no certainty of access to appropriate supports and little scope to participate in the community.


The commission, which goes on to describe the current system as a 'system marked by invisible deprivation and lost opportunities', provides an excellent and comprehensive report, including a blueprint for a national disability insurance scheme.


I believe there are few who disagree that we need a major overhaul of the way people with disabilities are supported and cared for. The commission's excellent report delved into the issue of what it means, in everyday terms, when that support is inadequate or poorly delivered. For example, the commission found that there was a strong link between disadvantage and disability, with individuals and their carers more likely to be in financial and social difficulties. These include social isolation, lower levels of education and employment and difficulties with housing. Carers and families were more likely to be under strain and have poorer personal wellbeing. Some particularly heartbreaking findings in the report were about people with profound limitations. It found:


only 16 per cent had been visited by friends or family in 3 months, and around 59 per cent had not had a telephone call in 3 months


around 18 per cent had not had any social contact in the last 3 months


around 44 per cent had not used the Internet in the last 12 months.


It also found:


…around 18 per cent of carers only had face-to-face social contact either once every three months or less often.


This level of disconnect is both tragic and incredibly concerning. As we know, humans thrive on social interaction and it is vitally important to wellbeing. It is awful to know that this system has failed to this extent.


I believe the NDIS, if implemented correctly, will be life changing for many people with disability and their families. In particular, I note that there are specific provisions in the bill relating to early intervention for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders, where treatment from a young age is vital. I acknowledge the work of the AEIOU centre in Queensland, a not-for-profit organisation that delivers early intervention care for children on the autism spectrum, with remarkable results. Appropriate early intervention can make a huge difference, with long-term impacts that actually reduce a child's level of disability as an adult. A vital part of this service is also the respite hours they provide parents. This organisation is still small, but its services are in huge demand and they are having a massive impact.


A better and more flexible funding structure under the NDIS will give parents the resources they need to get into the AEIOU program and will hopefully give AEIOU the resources it needs to meet demand, because that demand is critical and we cannot delay that. I acknowledge the fact that this legislation is designed to establish a framework, with further detail covered by rules to be made by the minister. I note Senator Payne's quite valid concerns about the framework being somewhat vague at this stage. We need to have those rules so that we can see the details, and that is important.


I have some fundamental concerns relating to individuals who have potential compensation claims seeking support under the NDIS. As someone who has been a compensation lawyer—and I still have my practising certificate and very small law firm—it is something that I am acutely aware of. For example, under the bill as it stands, individuals will lose their right to choose whether or not they want to take legal action in relation to a possible compensation claim. Instead, that person may be compelled to take legal action: if they do not, their support under the NDIS can be suspended. That just seems fundamentally wrong. It is inconsistent with the whole tenor of the scheme.


Basically, this bill uses the right to disability support as a stick behind the carrot, and that is wrong. Further, if an individual wants to appeal the decision forcing them to take legal action, they will need to go through an internal review or take the matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This means the person in question will either have to take on the services of an advocate or a lawyer, or defend themselves. But there is no provision allowing funding for that legal representation under the NDIS, potentially leaving people out of pocket and worse off than they would have been if the scheme had never existed in the first place—and that would be a perverse outcome.


I am very concerned that the NDIS seems overly reliant on payments through compensation claims for its funding. I want to make it absolutely clear that I find this unacceptable, that the responsibility for funding even part of the scheme should rest on the very individuals it is supposed to help. In line with the Senate committee's recommendations, individuals should not be forced to take legal action unless there is some sort of safeguard to protect them from economic loss. There are no such safeguards in this bill. In fact, the government amendments in the House have made these provisions even more onerous on individuals. In fact, where a compensation claim has been taken over or made by the CEO on behalf of an individual, it appears the CEO then has full rights to act on the individual's behalf without that person's consent.


The scheme is supposed to be about giving people with a disability the power to choose and control their own treatment and support, but these provisions blatantly remove any kind of choice from the equation. They operate on the very assumption that a person's only choice in this situation is the one that is right for the NDIS, not the one that is right for the individual themselves. To me, this seems to go against the intent of the bill and treats people with a disability in a patronising and condescending manner. This is particularly clear when you consider similar provisions in other state, territory and Commonwealth legislation which do not have the same element of force and do include safeguards, and that is why I will be moving amendments to that effect and I am looking forward to the support of my colleagues on this side of the chamber and my crossbench colleagues to remedy this absolutely clear anomaly.


Beyond establishing protection for individuals in the case of subrogation—a concept that I will discuss in the committee stage of this bill—these amendments will also ensure that individuals who go through the appeals process will have access to independent advocates. These amendments will also include provisions requiring the CEO to provide reasoning for reviewable decisions and to ensure that individuals are protected from costs if a review goes to the AAT. They also state that the CEO must ensure that the agency institutes a process to ensure that communications to individuals are made in a way that takes their disability into account and allows them to interact with the agency in an effective way. For example, the agency must take into account a person's visual impairment when communicating with them and therefore communicate verbally and provide written documents in an accessible form. This will ensure that individuals dealing with the agency will not be disadvantaged because of their disability. These amendments are in line with the recommendations from the Australian Lawyers Alliance and I thank representatives from that organisation, and in particular the ALA's National President, South Australian lawyer Tony Kerin, for the time they spent with me two days ago discussing these issues.


Ultimately, I support the measures in the bill but we need to make sure that they are open and flexible enough to meet changing demands and that they do not unintentionally perpetuate the exclusion of people with a disability. I will be supporting this bill, but I will be looking forward to discussing it further in the committee stage because there are a number of amendments in order to safeguard the rights of the disabled that must be dealt with. Finally, in the course of the committee stage I do want to raise the spectre of the link between this scheme and a national injury insurance scheme—a no-fault scheme—and the dangers I think that poses, and I will be quoting from the former chief judge of the Employment Court of New Zealand, Chief Judge Tom Goddard, who is scathing about the New Zealand no-fault scheme.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:47):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. As the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, said on 13 April 2012, the National Disability Insurance Scheme is 'an idea whose time has come'. The coalition have enthusiastically supported each of the milestones on the road to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We supported the initial work that was done by the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion in the last budget and we have supported the five launch sites. We support the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full state-wide rollout after the Hunter launch. We support this legislation, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013.


Indeed, the coalition called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. What did we get in response to that? The Prime Minister, in her inimitable style, just simply rejected that and said, 'We're getting on with it.' This is a very important issue for thousands of Australians with a disability and their families and carers, and that just goes to show the disdain that the Prime Minister has for something that should have been done on a bipartisan basis. The member for Dawson, George Christensen, has had a motion in the House of Representatives to establish such a bipartisan committee for some time. Regrettably, that motion has not been brought forward for a vote. The shadow minister, my colleague, Senator Fifield, moved a motion to establish the oversight committee. Unfortunately, those opposite and their alliance partners, the Greens, voted this down in the Senate. 


The Australian Labor Party always likes to pay lip service to wanting cross-party support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but when the opportunity was presented they declined to support it. Another example of paying lip service, is the Australian Labor Party's move, hopefully, not to guillotine debate in this matter. It is a very important bill that in this situation needs to be given full airing and full opportunity for all members and all senators to express their views on this important area. It deserves the full scrutiny of the Senate. 


In relation to the NDIS, one of the areas that needs to be examined is clause 22, which sets out the age requirements that a person must satisfy in order to become a participant in the NDIS launch. The age requirement is that that person is under the age of 65 on the date the access request is made. This requirement implements part of recommendation 3.6 of the Productivity Commission report and reflects that the NDIS is one part of a broader system of support in Australia, with people over the age of 65 able to access the age care system. Those people who are receiving support under the NDIS and turn 65 can choose either to remain in the NDIS or to move to the aged care system. In other words, the policy intent is that the NDIS and the aged care system remain separate systems that address the different needs of separate cohorts of people; people with a disability and older people with a disability, respectively. Arguably, this assumes that there will be some similarity in the care and support available between the NDIS and the aged care systems. It is concerns like this that need to be worked out, and debate should not be curtailed on these issues.


There is evidence, and certainly there was some evidence provided to the Senate inquiry, that the aged care system may not be an appropriate choice for some people with a disability. We saw in the report, for example, a survey of people with intellectual disabilities living in residential aged care in Victoria raising issues about the appropriateness of such arrangements for this group, including the extent to which such facilities offer sufficient opportunities for participation in community activities and the development of meaningful relationships. Aged care providers themselves also identified a number of difficulties associated with residents with intellectual disabilities fitting into the activities and support provided by that facility. Some providers, however, indicated that these could be overcome by working with specialist disability services. Let us not forget that the NDIS is a person-centred and self-directed funding model. It is aligned to the objectives of empowering the individual and removing the concept of big government from people's lives and, above all, reducing red tape.


I now move to some of the comments made by coalition senators in relation to this bill. We know that the system for Australians with a disability is broken, and it was clear from the submissions of the 1,600 people and organisations that took the time to put in submissions that this very point was made in just about all of those submissions. In the end the evidence that emerged made it very clear that there are people with a disability in Australia who are left without the assistance that they need. As a coalition, we agree that a new system of support based on need, rather than rationing, with the entitlement for support going to the individual, is needed. This represents a shift from the focus of rationing to entitlement, with the person being at the centre of the system and the services that he or she needs being wrapped around them, with support, equipment and service providers of their choice being able to provide those services. This is the vision that the Productivity Commission has in relation to disability. It is also the vision of the Productivity Commission in relation to the aged care system. The basic tenet of the report Caring for older Australians, which was a landmark report that the Productivity Commission did in relation to the aged care system, was a shift from the current ration system in aged care to an entitlement system. The Productivity Commission set out a framework as to how that could happen. Whilst it did not drill down to that detail it is clear that that Productivity Commission report enjoys great support right across the spectrum in the aged care sector, evidenced by the 500 submissions made to Productivity Commission initially, and then by another 500 submissions made after the draft report was released in relation to that legislation.


As far as the leader of the opposition is concerned the issue of disability and Australians with a disability is one he has a very personal commitment to. As part of his 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride $550,000 was raised for Carers Australia. Along that thousand-kilometre route Mr Abbott met with people with disabilities and their carers, and disability organisations to hear directly from them about issues pertaining to disability and to know that the funds from that bike race would go directly to a very important organisation that assists people with disabilities. Indeed, the next two Pollie Pedal rides will also be in partnership with and raise funds for Carers Australia.


Any comments that the coalition offers in this debate are offered in a constructive way, with the intention of making this legislation better. It is something that the coalition wanted to offer bipartisan support for; we wanted to set up a committee where this could be done in a depoliticised manner. The coalition's proposal for aged care reform which we set out at the last official election was a four-year agreement which would not only offer flexibility and certainty in the system but would, above all, provide long-term certainty and a depoliticising of that system.


In the end, it is important to note that every government in Australia and every opposition in Australia supports and wants to see an NDIS. It is a system that will depend on cooperation and on work being done between governments across the political spectrum. This constructive approach has been evidenced when New South Wales Premier O'Farrell and the Prime Minister signed an intergovernmental agreement in December for a full, statewide NDIS rollout after the Hunter launch project. It was disappointing to see that the Prime Minister did not treat all jurisdictions as partners at the COAG meeting in July 2012, and it is to the credit of both the Victorian and New South Wales governments that they continue to negotiate in the face of what has clearly been misrepresentation by the federal government, and that they have reached agreement to host launch sites. It is vitally important that we have a cooperative approach.


I now turn to the aged-care system. This is of particular importance and has been raised with me in various forums that I have attended around Australia as shadow minister for ageing. If people with a disability over the age of 65 are to be looked after in the aged-care system then it is vitally important that the aged-care system is reformed—and reformed in a major way, not just in the way that this government has of paying lip-service. We have seen promises of reform in aged care but, five years on, there is very little evidence of real change on the ground.


I remind the Senate that in 2010 Ms Gillard said that aged-care reform would be a second term priority, and this was at the election when Ms Gillard had to defend herself against the serial leaker who claimed that she had not supported big increases in the age pension because 'old people never vote for us'. But the reality is that we have had a litany of reports and reviews—about 20 of them, including three by the Productivity Commission—which cover ageing and aged-care matters. They have been continually ignored, or responded to with more inquiries without making those vitally important decisions to secure aged care into the future.


Aged-care reform needs to be long term but it also needs to be sustainable. Shortly, we will have the opportunity to debate the package of bills that are a part of the Living Longer. Living Better package. There are five bills which, quite frankly, do not resolve many of the outstanding issues of viability for providers and certainly do not respond to the concerns that have been raised by providers, through the inquiry into the NDIS, because of the added responsibilities that they will have in relation to catering for older Australians with a disability.


We have seen funding cuts of $1.6 billion out of the aged-care funding instrument. Of course, this has put additional pressure on the sector and, most especially, on smaller providers in regional and rural areas. The government has chosen to cherry-pick only a few recommendations from the Productivity Commission's report, Caring for Older Australians. This package of bills will impose even more bureaucracy, even more regulation, on what is already a very, very highly regulated sector.


Most recently we have seen Minister Butler in another spectacular gaffe. First of all, he insulted the people of Western Sydney with his crass remarks about Rooty Hill and then he insulted the people of Western Sydney again when he went out to make his very low-key announcement, downgraded from the Prime Minister to Minister Shorten and Minister Butler, and then just Minister Butler. It was another gaffe in relation to that announcement on the day when he asserted somebody was trying to steal a car—it ended up being the local priest whose car had been blocked in by the minister's car.




Senator Sinodinos:
  What!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Yes, Senator Sinodinos, this is very much a gaffe-prone minister. Today we see him worrying about whether he will or will not support Prime Minister Gillard. Perhaps Minister Butler should be concentrating on—




Senator Sinodinos:
  Gutless Butler.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Absolutely. To be or not to be—thank you, Senator Sinodinos—a supporter. Instead of worrying about that, Minister Butler, might I suggest that you worry about the key issues in your portfolio, which are the aged-care system, which needs reform and for which your proposed changes will only make things worse. Aged Care Australia tells us that 60 per cent of aged-care providers are operating in the red. There is a real viability issue for providers, most especially smaller providers in regional and rural areas. So it is little wonder that aged-care providers, who will be dealing with older Australians with a disability, are understandably concerned that they are not going to be able to provide the services that our older Australians with a disability do need.


As I said, this is a sector that does need reform, and I have real concerns that proper reform will not be undertaken in the aged-care sector, which this minister and this government seems loath to do—they are only paying lip-service to it. And what are we seeing? We are seeing that the government is more concerned with rolling out its workforce compact by ripping $1.6 billion out of aged-care funding—to then turn it back and return it supposedly as a $1.2 billion workforce compact as a bid to refinance unions in the aged-care sector. Of course, there is United Voice, as we have seen. Indeed, I have come along this morning with the latest pamphlet from United Voice in which United Voice are urging aged-care workers to join United Voice to 'speak with one voice in negotiations'. That is what it is about. That is what it is really all about, refinancing the unions, the aged-care unions: United Voice, Minister Butler's former union; the HSU, which we know suffered a spectacular fall in membership; and the Nurses Federation. 


In the end, I would remind the Senate that under this so-called administrative change, which is really an industrial instrument, aged-care providers of 50 beds or more must enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement; otherwise, they will not be able to access funding. If they are 50 beds or fewer, they do not have to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement but they must comply with the terms of the compact to be able to access that funding.


What does that mean? That means that, already, that 60 per cent which is operating in the red are going to find it harder and harder to be viable; but most especially here is the government promising pay rises which will never materialise. Why? Because providers are not going to be able to meet those wage increases on the tied money that the government is providing. So another false promise by this minister, who really is demonstrating that he is not up to the job.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (10:07):  This is a landmark piece of legislation: the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013, which is supported by both sides of the house. Some people may be surprised at that; they talk about this parliament being fractious and in some ways dysfunctional. Whatever the government's contribution to that, on this occasion we have come together on a matter which we regard as being in some sense above politics. That is a very serious statement to make, to say that something is above politics. I think what we have here is a recognition that we as a parliament have listened to the community and to a section of the community who for too long felt that they were being shunted aside, being ignored, being discriminated against; many families and their carers, disabled people and their families have had to suffer in silence. They could not get access to the range of services they needed on the terms that were appropriate to their particular circumstances. 


This legislation, this scheme, seeks to remedy many of those considerations. That is why I certainly support it and that is why my side of politics supports it. It is gratifying that all sides of politics seem to be keen to move on this matter now. In saying that, I am conscious that we are embarking on a very ambitious enterprise as a nation. This is a very complex, long-term, significant set of reforms. In some ways, it provides a precedent in other areas of social support, but it also provides some warning bells about how these sorts of schemes should be considered and implemented.


We face an extra bill when the scheme is fully matured of around $6 billion to $8 billion and possibly more per annum extra, on top of what we now spend. That is a significant expending of public resources, and it is premised on not only compassion and social desiderata—if I can put it like that—but also an economic component in the sense that there is a view that going down this road with the National Disability Insurance Scheme will yield more benefits than costs over the longer term.


There will of course be the social benefits for those who are directly affected, but what we are saying is that there will ultimately also be national benefits, public benefits, over and above those private benefits and that some of those benefits will be economic benefits, because people who are being helped will be in a better position, potentially, in a number of cases, to participate more fully in the economic and social life of our country. That is very important. Tony Blair once made the point that fairness in the workplace begins with the prospect of a job. So anything we can do to help disabled people to realise their full potential, so that they become full and participating members of our economy and society, is very important—not only for their self-esteem and meaning in their lives but also for the contribution they make to the country and how that ultimately enriches all of us socially and economically. So there are some very important issues at stake in this bill and in this legislation that we are debating today.


We are not, as I said before, debating this in a rancorous, partisan way; there is agreement. But, in making comments on the legislation, I do want to raise a couple of points on the way through. These are not points that are necessarily the most significant and some may say, 'Well, you are raising points which are more economic or financial, or sort of bean-counter points,' but I raise them anyway in the spirit of saying: let's make sure that, in adding to the pool of funds available in this area, we are getting the best value for money out of what we are already spending in this space, not in order to cut what we are already spending in this space—that is not what we are intending to do—but, like all these things, let us make sure that the spending we are putting into the system is going on top of a level of spending that is itself the most efficient and effective way to deploy existing resources to help disabled people.


In negotiating with the states, this government or a future government must make sure that there is genuine additionality in the resources that those states are providing to the table. I commend the New South Wales and federal governments for coming to an agreement recently and, like my colleague, Marise Payne, yesterday, I commend the New South Wales Minister for Ageing and Minister for Disability Services, Andrew Constance, who is a very smart, pragmatic and committed minister in this space. He has done a great job on behalf of the people of New South Wales in this space, and I commend him, Premier Barry O'Farrell and their federal counterparts for coming to an agreement. But my point is: let's make sure that the funding going into this space from the states is additional funding, so that we get the best possible deal for the Commonwealth from the states and we are maximising the resources available for disabled people.


In that context, I refer back to the Productivity Commission, which handed down a landmark report on this space. In part, the report went to this issue of funding and the profile for funding. The point made there was that something like $3.9 billion was needed over the next four years, or this current four years, in order to begin to realise the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. To date, the government has provided $1 billion over the forward estimates, and in this budget we wait to see what the longer term funding plan will be.


There had been speculation in the press that the government might well publish forward estimates that go some way beyond the traditional three or four years—perhaps out to 2020—to indicate how it was funding significant additional responsibilities, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the Gonski education reforms. I welcome a commitment by the government to provide a longer term set of forward estimates which explain clearly how we build up the funding to the National Disability Insurance Scheme over time so reach the peak funding—which I think at this stage is expected to be in 2018.


We have to be careful that this does not become one of those cheese-paring exercises, a bit like what we do in the foreign aid area. There we make laudable commitments in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and then say, a bit like St Augustine, 'Make me pure but not just yet,' and we keep putting off the day when we lift the ratio of our foreign aid to our GDP. Over the last couple of years there has been a tendency to do that. I hope for the National Disability Insurance Scheme we do not fall into the same trap simply because over time we find our budgetary situation is deteriorating and we are unable to meet this full commitment.


That may not be an issue for this government. One of the reasons I raise this now is that it could be an issue for a future coalition government. This is a dilemma that we all face, but the point that we have made and the point that the government has made is that schemes like this would be accommodated by reducing spending elsewhere. It is important that we note that it is better to go down the route of reducing spending in other areas rather than seeking to raise taxes further, given that most of those taxes will fall on middle-income earners. From an economic perspective that is the more appropriate way to pay for a national disability insurance scheme.


As I said before, this has bipartisan support. I commend people on both sides of politics who have supported the scheme from its inception, or conception. On my side of politics, I commend our leader, Tony Abbott, who through early support for the scheme and through his work with the Pollie Pedal has been a visible and genuine, committed supporter of doing more in this space. I commend our shadow spokesman in the area, Mitch Fifield. He is a flint-hard economic rationalist who on this occasion has seen the light and decided we must do more. He has handled a difficult area in dealing with stakeholders and the government on the matter with great deftness, skill and authority. I commend him for the work he has done within the party room in bringing us all along on this journey. I also commend Senator Sue Boyce, who has been quite a vocal supporter of the scheme, based in part on personal experiences.


I will not mention others, but my point is simply to say this: the field evidence is very strong that people from both sides of politics have been very strongly supportive. On the other side of politics, outside this chamber, I commend John Della Bosca, a very skilful New South Wales ex-Labor minister and operative. He is an organisation man who has done an excellent job in helping to mobilise public opinion on and support for the scheme. It would be remiss not to say something about some of the people involved in the conception of the scheme: John Walsh, a partner at PwC, who conceived it. It was progressed by Bruce Bonyhady, the president of Philanthropy Australia. I knew Bruce Bonyhady 20 or 30 years ago in the Treasury. I think he was in the forecasting or modelling space. He is a rigorous thinker and he brought that rigour as well as his commitment to helping people with disability to the table. He has done a great job in further fleshing out the concept and helping to sell it.


I note in passing that this matter was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit in 2008. That summit was notable for three things: first of all, Kevin Rudd telling us who the best and brightest in Australia were; some of us were very disappointed in the outcomes of that exercise. Secondly, it did not necessarily yield that many things. I think the bionic eye came out of that process and something is being done on that. Thirdly, there was tax reform, which came on the table when Kevin Rudd had to go on the 7:30 Report and describe the outcomes of the summit. He then decided, 'Let's have a tax review,' and that was the Henry review, which in turn led to other things. But this item, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, is one of the better outcomes of something that was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit.


One of the features of the scheme that I am particularly attracted to is the fact that it is a person-centred and self-directed funding model. It is aligned to the objectives of empowering the individual, removing government from people's lives and reducing red tape. To be honest, we will wait and see how far it goes in reducing red tape and removing government from people's lives. I am a bit sceptical about the extent to which the government gets out of people's lives and reduces red tape, but empowering the individual, setting up a model which is person-centred and which that person drives through their command over funding and resources, drives the package of measures necessary to help them, so it is a customised package. I think that is what this NDIS is trying to get at. It is also trying to provide greater certainty to people about what is available to them so that they do not have to wait in queues and all the rest of it. One downside of all of this that we have to make sure we address is that people who are providing services to the NDIS do not ratchet up their prices because they think that demand is going up as everybody wants everything immediately. We have to guard against people exploiting the situation. That is a footnote.


I support the person-centred and self-directed funding model. I think we showed more of this across government activity, more of a—for want of a better expression—life-cycle model of how government interacts with individuals. I think that is very important, particularly because in an area like this there is some focus on early intervention to 'mitigate, alleviate or prevent the deterioration of' a person's functional capacity. Early intervention to minimise later problems means that there is greater capacity for people to potentially be more self-reliant and better able to do things for themselves. Getting people, to the extent possible, to be mobile and to be able to hold down a part-time or full-time job is important for their self-esteem and the contribution they can make to our nation.


So I support the person-centred and self-directed funding model. It would be interesting to apply this more across government activity. I suspect it would be expensive to do that, so perhaps it is not as appropriate in other areas because of cost; but, certainly, in this area, it is a new model and it will be interesting to see how it goes. I support that element of the model. As the notes say:


The individual needs to be at the centre and in charge, able to pick the supports, the aids, the equipment and the service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report …


I make the point that for some time now, as a reflection of that bipartisanship that I mentioned earlier, the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This is not only a good idea on policy grounds but also a good idea on political grounds for the government to lock the opposition into ongoing support for the NDIS. I do not understand why the government seems to want to shut the opposition out when embracing the opposition and locking them in is the best guarantee that the NDIS will have not only safe delivery but also a reasonably robust childhood growing to maturity with the right sort of support from all sides of the parliament. A parliamentary oversight committee would lock in all parties and provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. In other words, the parliamentary committee would seek to take out some of the political pointscoring and debate around what I said before was a matter above politics.


In bringing this vision to fruition I think people on the Labor side should avoid the temptation to claim this reform as some reflection of quintessential Labor values. There are very big Australian values around fairness and looking after people who cannot look after themselves, and they are shared by all sides of politics. We sometimes differ about the means to achieving that fairness, and that is a legitimate discussion. Our side of politics—the right-of-centre parties—always put more focus on how we can equip people to better look after themselves, to exercise personal choice and responsibility. That is where sometimes there is quite a marked philosophical difference and therefore a practical policy difference between the two sides of politics. But this is not about something which is quintessentially a Labor value; this is quintessentially a pragmatic Australian response to an important social issue. I am disappointed that on occasion Labor have sought to exploit this for partisan purposes. I say that gently and in passing to underline the point that this is all about bipartisanship.


As Tony Abbott reiterated at the Press Club recently:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


I commend Tony Abbott for that. I do not commend the Prime Minister for attacking some of her state colleagues in the lead-up to the Council of Australian Government meeting and seeking to portray them as somehow being against the scheme. State governments have legitimate responsibilities to argue about how their funding and their services link into this broader national scheme. In the spirit of cooperation, these are issues that are best hammered out behind closed doors and are not the subject of public rancour, pointscoring and mud-slinging. That will not achieve anything. 


This is also reflected in the fact that we do not have to have launch sites in every state. The fact that we have launch sites in a number of states is a good thing, but the Productivity Commission never envisaged every state hosting a launch site and never saw the absence of a launch site as a bar to taking part in a full national rollout. The Premier of Queensland, Campbell Newman, has written to the Prime Minister with a proposal to be part of a full national rollout, and Premier Colin Barnett of Western Australia has written to the Prime Minister proposing a joint WA-Commonwealth national disability insurance scheme. The coalition will continue to place this issue above politics and is prepared to work with state and Commonwealth governments towards a better deal for people with a disability.


In the time remaining, I make the point that the bill before the chamber is essentially a framework establishing the transition agency, the board, the CEO and a general definition of eligibility. The mechanics of the scheme will be established by the rules. A discussion paper on the rules was released on 1 February but it was essentially a series of questions. It is not a draft set of rules. The government released seven sets of draft rules on the final day of hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on 5 March: draft rules for becoming a participant, draft rules for children, draft rules for privacy, draft rules for nominees, draft rules for support, draft rules for registered providers and draft rules for plan management. These draft rules are still the subjects of consultation with state and territories and with stakeholders in the disability sector. We will study them carefully. The government has also indicated that there are potentially dozens of batches of draft rules still to be released which need to be released quickly and well before the passage of the bill through parliament. We need as much information as possible to understand the implications of where we are going in this very important space.


Finally, I commend the legislation and the scheme to the chamber. I think it can make an important difference to the lives of disabled Australians. I have heard too many stories of parents who despair about what will happen to their disabled children after they pass on. It is very important that we assure them that the Australian people are there to take on that responsibility and that task.

 (Western Australia) (10:27):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Disability Scheme Bill 2013.This National Disability Insurance Scheme is an idea whose time has come. It is an historic day that this scheme is being debated in the Senate and is a real step forward. It is very much an expression of the reality of the federal parliament supporting the concept of the Aussie fair go to ensure that disabled people do have a fair go and are given an opportunity to realise their potential. There are many people in Australia with disabilities whose lives will be improved with the advent of this scheme. Sometimes the perception that someone is disabled is taken to mean that they cannot or are not able to participate in community activities or to do many things which other people might do. This is a recognition more than anything else that disabled people do have abilities, dreams and ambitions and should be assisted to achieve those dreams and ambitions and live meaningful and dignified lives in our community. The fact that disabled people are being given support by the community, and recognition that they are entitled to respect as fellow Australians, is very important. I congratulate those responsible for the development of this legislation.


The coalition has supported each milestone on the road to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We supported very strongly the initial work done by the Productivity Commission on planning for this NDIS. The coalition supported the billion dollars allocated to the NDIS in the last budget, we supported the concept of the five launch sites and we supported the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full state-wide rollout after the Hunter launch. We do support this legislation very strongly, because, as I have said, it means that disabled people in this country will be given recognition and the opportunity to live lives that are dignified, and be able to achieve their dreams and aspirations.


When Labor members and senators say that the NDIS represents quintessentially Labor values I have to say that I do not think they are particularly Labor values that it represents, but they are the Aussie values of a fair go and giving people a chance to realise their potential. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a person-centred, self-directing funding model. It is aligned to the objectives of empowering the individual and removing government from people's lives and reducing red tape, which are all values which the coalition strongly supports. The coalition believes that the full implementation of the NDIS will be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers, and we believe that we have to make sure that the details of this scheme are got right and that they do really mean that the scheme works for the benefit of disabled people.


The NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform which is going to unfold over the life of several parliaments, and it will develop and progress over that time. It should, we believe, be the property of the parliament as a whole, on behalf of the Australian people, rather than of any one political party, and I think that is the spirit in which this whole piece of legislation is being debated here today. The coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Tony Abbott, the leader of the Liberal Party, reiterated this offer in his recent Press Club address, when he said:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


The government, we believe, should accept the coalition's offer of a parliamentary oversight committee. The coalition intends to give the government, the Greens and the Independents an opportunity to accept our hand of cooperation by moving an amendment to this bill to establish such a nonpartisan oversight committee. I do hope, quite simply, that that offer is seen as not being partisan political, and that it is accepted in the spirit in which it is offered so that an oversight committee can be set up to ensure that this scheme works effectively for the people who it is designed to support.


It is important to note that every government and every opposition in Australia want to see an NDIS established in this country. That is why at the COAG before last it was disappointing that the Prime Minister could not rise above her partisan instincts on this issue, and it is to the credit of the Victorian and New South Wales governments that they continued to negotiate in the face of public attack and misrepresentation by the federal government and reached agreement to host launch sites. It is a bit sad that politics has entered into this debate at any level. I hope that the politics will be forgotten in further meetings at COAG and that there will be a spirit of cooperation to ensure that this very worthy legislation is put into practice to benefit the disabled people in our community.


There cannot be a meaningful NDIS without an intergovernmental agreement with each state and territory, and that is something that is yet to be negotiated. Given that, I would like to say a few words in defence of the states who have perhaps been misrepresented as not hosting a launch site. I do not think that means they do not support the NDIS but that they have some concerns about details. It has to be said that the Productivity Commission never envisaged every state hosting a launch site and never saw the absence of a launch site as a bar to taking a full part in the national rollout.


In particular, as a Western Australian I have supported the decision of Premier Barnett who has written to the Prime Minister proposing a joint WA-Commonwealth NDIS be set up. Western Australia has its own problems in terms of distance and the vast size of the state and there are some special local factors which have to be taken into consideration. 


We on the coalition side emphatically supported the government's commitment of $1 billion to the NDIS in the last federal budget. I must say we had some difficulty that the sum was only $1 billion when, in fact, the Productivity Commission's recommendation was that at least $3.9 billion would be necessary over the forward estimates for the first phase of the NDIS. We can only hope that more money will be forthcoming in the budget in May and, of course, only time will tell how much money is needed to really make this scheme effective. I hope, in the spirit of the nobleness of the endeavour to ensure that disabled people in this country are able to realise their potential and live in dignity, that there will not be arguments about penny pinching and that the money will be available for this scheme.


The scheme will provide funding to individuals or organisations to help people with disability to participate more fully in economic and social life through the provision of entitlements enabling such things as aids, equipment, supported accommodation and personal attendant care.


The history of this National Disability Insurance Scheme is that the idea has been around for a long time, but people only began giving serious consideration to a national disability insurance scheme over the last five years. It is appropriate to acknowledge the role played by figures on both sides of the chamber in helping to elevate the public policy profile of disability. But the lion's share of the credit must go to those people who have disabilities, their families, their carers and the organisations who support them. These people came together because they decided that in modern, prosperous, wealthy Australia enough was enough and something had to be done to support the disabled people in our community. This is a long overdue measure. In particular, I acknowledge that in Western Australia, our Premier, Colin Barnett, has supported this concept and I know the differences are not, as I have said, ones of principle but merely of detail. There are some particular West Australian factors to be built in to an NDIS in Western Australia.


In conclusion, this is a historic step forward for the Australian community, and the NDIS is very much in the spirit of giving everybody a fair go, a quintessential Aussie value.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:40):  I too rise to make some brief observations on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. I note that in the second reading speech of the shadow minister, Mitch Fifield, he outlined in essence the two principal purposes of this bill. I will not speak to the construct of the bill, but I would like to take the opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the significance of the difference that the implementation of this legislation will make to the lives of so many people. The bill has bipartisan support in this chamber. I am delighted to see that because of the huge impact it will ultimately have on families who deal with disabilities and individuals who deal with disabilities. It will provide them with opportunities and choices. In that way it will in effect change individuals' lives.


When you look at the facts, it is quite compelling to see that some 400,000 people in Australia live with disabilities. That is a number that unfortunately, for whatever reason, is on the rise. Some 400,000 individuals suffer from disabilities—that is, in essence more than 400,000 families that have to deal with the impact of disabilities and provide for the impact of disabilities. It is regrettable that it has taken this time for us to come up with a framework for a national disability insurance scheme, a framework that we all support. The Productivity Commission looked into the scheme in around 2009. It is on the advice of the Productivity Commission that an enormous amount of work has gone into the determination of its structure, framework, and planning as to how this should apply. There has also been a good and effective consultative process to come to where we are today.


The reason it is so heartening is that there is no quick fix for this issue. It is not a situation where one model will fit all. The model must be able to be tailored to the needs of the individual and ultimately will, I hope, not only support the physical challenges faced by those with disabilities but also provide critical psychological and emotional support for families and friends in the lifelong challenge they face and live with. Most of us know someone with a disability or we know families or friends dealing with people with disabilities, so we know first-hand what is required for those families to cope through a lifetime.


In the Senate over the last 12 months we seem to have had a huge population growth, with senators having the joy of a baby entering their lives, either as parents or grandparents. We know, particularly in the last 12 months on the coalition side, that there is one heartfelt wish of those parents or grandparents—that is, the newborns have 10 fingers and 10 toes and they are healthy. That is their one wish: that those children are healthy. As we know, that is not always the case. It is a real issue for those who have to deal with beautiful children who are born with disabilities, or may develop them later on in life.


Since I was elected as a senator, one of the things that has presented to me as an opportunity, which I do not know that I would have had if I had not been elected to the Senate, is to actually visit a number of places that are either early intervention centres, employment workplaces for those with disabilities or other workplaces that provide varying ranges of support services for families. The one thing that strikes you when you attend all of these facilities is the extraordinary love, honesty and goodwill that those with disabilities automatically share and present to all whom they meet. They just have such a wonderful temperament—so many of them. Sometimes, I think that we perhaps could take a leaf out of their books in the way in which we deal with each other in this place, because the degree of goodwill that is shared when you visit so many of these places is so apparent. One thing that strikes me as much as anything is this wonderful sense of humour so many have, and they are very quick to take the mickey out of you. As a politician, I think it is a very good thing to rock up somewhere and have a young child or even an adult take the mickey out of you as you are visiting a particular place. In the main, they just have such wonderful senses of humour, and it is something that I do not know whether I would have had the opportunity to meet so many and attend so many places as I have as a senator. In my patron seats there is a large number of support services and a couple of those that I want to mention in making my short observations.


I firstly acknowledge the families. I know a number of families whose lives changed for their lifetime and for their children's lifetime when they had children with disabilities. They have become full-time carers for individuals from the moment those children were born through the life of the parents, and it depends on the degree of disability as to the extent to which that 24/7 care has been necessary. I am reminded of someone very close to me who has a daughter who has dramatic challenges and needs 24/7 care. She made observations to me not so long ago when her daughter turned 18 about the level of services that they could no longer access and how their economic capacity to raise income in that household was dramatically reduced by the amount of care that they had to provide. It was a bit of a vicious cycle. Their No. 1 overarching concern was what was going to happen to their daughter once they could no longer provide the care that they had, whether because they physically could not or because they financially could not. We have see many instances where ageing parents have expressed their concern about what was going to happen and they have had to put their adult children into aged care facilities because there were no services or residential care available for them to put their disabled adult daughter or son into an appropriate residential facility. You have circumstances where a young 20-year-old has had to be put into an aged-care facility, which is a great tragedy.


I would like to come to a couple of places that I have visited that do a tremendous job. I know that this bill will reinforce the support that the families are able to provide for their children. The first is a specialist early childhood centre in Bayswater in the electorate of Deakin in Victoria. It is an early childhood intervention service called Irabina. I had the great fortune of going there a few months ago because an extraordinarily generous Victorian, Chris Malcolm, the managing director of Clark Rubber, an incredibly philanthropic and generous individual, made a donation, with the Liberal Party, to Irabina to support some services that they are providing. They provided thousands of dollars worth of goods that would assist with early intervention for those children. 


Irabina has programs that are family centred for preschool age children. It is a program targeted at early intervention for children diagnosed with or suspected to have autism spectrum disorder. I did not jump into the pool but I joined in with activities they had in the swimming pool. I saw firsthand how early intervention for children that are diagnosed early in their lifetime with autism spectrum disorder can actually break the cycle and assist them in developing the skills and developing learning capacities so that they can then enter a mainstream school and, in many cases, go on to be able to reach their personal and true potential. In many cases for these families this early intervention is a life-changing opportunity.


One of the mothers I spoke to was saying that with this particular scheme there is support provided, but it does not cover the intensive therapies required. This legislation, because it is tailored towards individuals, which is one of the elements I strongly applaud, will provide individual financial support as is needed.


Another facility I visited with the coalition leader, Tony Abbott, and shadow minister, Senator Mitch Fifield, was in Nunawading. Nadrasca in Nunawading is a great place, and Senator Fifield has been there on a number of occasions. Nadrasca was established in 1967. Its purpose when established was to develop a range of services for people with a disability. The organisation has developed and evolved over time. It currently provides a range of services and employment for over 350 people with a disability. It employs approximately 150 permanent, part-time and casual staff across all their services to assist their clients.


The services that they support and provide include—and this is not a comprehensive account—a disability-supported employment service; a service that provides daily programs and activities for persons with significant disabilities; and accommodation services which include 24-hour care and independent living as well as recreational and holiday programs, all of which are tailored to the needs of individual families. Nadrasca Industry is a critical and essential part of the organisational structure of support for disability services because it provides employment and vocational training opportunities for people with a disability and generates revenue in addition to government funding. It generates revenue which is put back into the system to provide greater support.


Recollecting our most recent visit there, it was a great example of how they support people with disabilities and also the diversity of those who might be intellectually or physically disabled. It really does ground you. It was very hard, and it was great to see the leader of the coalition, Tony Abbott, put in a headlock by those working on the factory floor because they did not want him to leave. I do not think I got the same response—I do not know about you, Senator Fifield—but they had the leader in a headlock at one stage! Our program of visits which were scheduled while we were there for an hour or so was rolled out to probably double that—I do not know quite how long we were there in the end—because they did not want us to leave. They loved the engagement; they loved the opportunity to be able to offer and be involved in meaningful activities. This is what is so critical.


I acknowledge the importance of early intervention and therapy, because one-on-one sessions can identify learning issues. I am sure we all know of a lot of examples where diagnosis and early intervention have enabled individuals to go on into—for want of a better word—mainstream activities, mainstream schools and mainstream workplaces. It has to be our No. 1 goal to support people to do that. Early intervention does that through improving fiscal competency and may even slow or minimise the progression of a particular disability.


In essence, this legislation ultimately provides a greater choice for families. What it does is give a greater raft of opportunities for families, and various courses that they can take, so that they can provide greater support and so that we can provide greater support for them. The No. 1, fundamental thing is to appreciate and recognise those with disabilities and to give them the opportunity to be involved. I do not mean to say this in a patronising way, but they may be able to make an active contribution to society. They do now, and this provides a great opportunity for them to do that even more. I strongly support this and I would like, in closing, to recognise and acknowledge all those unsung Australian heroes who basically have held the disability sector together and who have supported what is an enormous, important area and task. I would like to pay my deepest respect to them.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (11:00):  I too rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013, and do so to support the bill.


I am sure that everybody who has stood in this place so far to speak on this particular bill would have risen and said that as parents—and most of us probably are parents—the one thing that you consider yourself very lucky for is when you have your children and your children come out 'with 10 toes and 10 fingers', as the senator said before. But there are many people who do not have that luxury. I think we do need to acknowledge that most of us in this place are extremely lucky because we have the luxury of not having to deal with the issue of disability on a firsthand basis.


There is certainly no doubt that everybody is touched by disability, or knows somebody who has the big task of looking after somebody with a disability, whether that be a mental, physical, emotional or challenging social disability. We all need to realise that in the blink of an eye that can change. I am sure many of us here know that as a result of accident, misfortune, illness or disease that in one minute what is otherwise a household of perfectly healthy people who get up every morning and get on with their lives can change 'just like that'.


In speaking to this bill I would like to make three points. Firstly, I believe an issue such as disability, and particularly how we as a society deal with disability, needs to be above partisan politics. This is not something that we can score points on, and nor should we even try to score points on it. What we should be doing is working together, all parties, whether we be the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party, the Greens or our Independent colleagues who sit here. We all need to be working towards a solution that is going to make the lives of people who are disabled in this country and of the people who have to care for them day in, day out and night in, night out easier. I think we do need to make a very clear distinction that any political game that is played with this particular piece of legislation is an absolute disgrace, and anybody who does that should be entirely ashamed of themselves.


I think everybody acknowledges that the current model of disability is broken. You only have to look around Australia to realise that if you live in one state or another state you will have matters in relation to disability treated differently. It depends on how your disability occurred; whether you are born with a disability. If you are going to have a disability you are probably better off to have one as a result of an accident, where you can sue someone. It does seem quite extraordinary that where you live and the nature of how your disability occurred can have such an extraordinary impact on the resources and support that you get for that particular disability.


A classic example of just how intense this can become is that in South Australia at the last state election a party was set up called Dignity for the Disabled, and that single-issue party actually managed to achieve a spot in the Legislative Council in South Australia. A young lady by the name of Kelly Vincent, who is disabled herself—wheelchair bound—was elected to the Legislative Council in South Australia. That was a complete and utter direct response to the fact that the South Australian disability system had completely let down people with a disability in South Australia. So we now have Kelly advocating from within the House of Parliament in Adelaide in relation to disability issues. I think that is an absolute reflection of the community's support for assistance and for some sensible measures to be taken in relation to how we deal with disability; the fact that we have a member of parliament who has gone into parliament simply because of the issue of how disabilities were being handled in the state of South Australia.


The second point I would like to make actually relates to productivity. I do not imagine that many people think of disability and productivity in the same breath, but there are a lot of people out there who have disabilities who have the capacity to add productively to the community, the environment and the economy in which they live and operate. I think we certainly need to be looking at ways in which we can give the responsibility, the onus and the ability back to people with disabilities to try to make as much of a productive contribution to their society as they possibly can.


There are a couple of programs that I would not mind bringing to the attention of the chamber. The first one is a program called the 'circles' program. It assists a person, particularly with a mental disability, to create a circle of friends—hence the reason it is called the 'circle' program. It encourages them to get out and create a new circle of friends outside of the traditional family and institutionalised care that they often get. They actually go out into the community and are encouraged to get a group of friends. Firstly, it relieves the family of the 24/7 burden of having to deal with the issues for that particular person. But it also gives them a wider network of opportunity to be able to find out what things are available for them out there.


It might be dealing with an issue of housing, it might be dealing with an issue of just going shopping. There are myriad things that people like us take for granted because we have such a wide circle of friends and contacts whom we actually draw on for all of the things—the experiences and activities—that we have in our lives. People with mental disabilities, particularly, often get shut down and they live within a very restricted cocooned environment. This circles program seeks to try and break out of that enclosed environment and allow people with disabilities the opportunity to get out.


They look to develop relationships. They create roles within these people's lives so that they can feel highly valued and can contribute. It allows them to develop competencies that they may not otherwise be able to see, simply because they do not have the opportunity to have those recognised. It also allows them to have community participation and inclusion, which is obviously a huge benefit and advantage in the quality of life of these people.


The other project that has been operating in South Australia and other states sets up microenterprise businesses. A group has set up within the community and talks to people about finding out what a disabled person really likes to do. We have one young girl in St Peters, in a suburb of Adelaide, who has set up her own microbusiness. Coincidentally her name is Fleur, French for flowers, and she has set up Fleur's Flowers. She goes around to small businesses—cafes and the like—every week and asks them if they want her to pop some flowers on their tables, and every week she goes back and she replaces those flowers. They pay her a reasonable, nominal amount. It is only just a little bit more than the cost of the flowers, but she has now got a purpose and so every morning she gets out of bed and goes down to the flower market. She buys her flowers and works out how many flowers she can do for the amount that she is charging each one of these businesses. She now has a productive purpose in life and she is actually earning a little bit of money. Even though she is certainly not removing the need for the assistance that she would otherwise have, she is actually supplementing her income and the support that she requires from outside by earning a little bit of money of her own.


Another amazing example of this particular project is a young man in Perth. When he was asked about the things he really liked to do, he said that he really liked waiting. Everybody thought, 'What do we do with somebody who really likes waiting?' They went through a myriad of other things that he might possibly like to do or might be interested in, but he was not interested. He just wanted to wait. Some inventive person actually came up with an idea. I do not know how many of you have been really annoyed when you need your telephone fixing or your power needs to be fixed and the guy at the utilities department says that they will be there sometime between nine o'clock and three o'clock in the afternoon. All of us have to go to work and it becomes very difficult, because you have to rush home or whatever. They have set up a microbusiness for this chap where he goes and sits in your house and waits for the tradesman to come along. He will let them in and then he will stand there and look after them and make sure that they are not damaging the house. He obviously gets paid a nominal amount for doing that, but he saves you the problem of actually having to stay home.


There are a lot of these inventive little businesses that some of these programs can look at. Those are the kinds of activities that we need to be looking at so that we can actually have a productive approach to how we deal with disabilities. It is about the efficient use of resources. It is about giving the people who know best—the people on the ground and who are dealing with these disabilities day in, day out, and even to some extent those people who do have disabilities—the opportunity to have a say in what happens to the money that is involved with disability. They are probably the people who are going to best placed to get the money spent where the money needs to be spent, instead of wasting it, as so often is the case in bureaucracy, on the administration—or people justifying the process of getting where they are going instead of spending money on productive outcomes for the people and places that need it.


Lastly, I want to talk about funding. The most important thing with any of these schemes is about getting the funding and getting on with the job. I notice that the Productivity Commission came out and suggested $3.9 billion. I understand at this stage that only $1 billion has been allocated. We need to get on with the job. We need to make a decision. We need to prioritise where this money is coming from and we need to get on with the job of implementing this program. We need the details about how it is going to get out there so that we can make sure that it is as efficient and as effective as it possibly can be.


I was just speaking this morning with a lady in South Australia, Judy Francis, who has a disabled son. In fact, she could not talk for terribly long because, even though he is 50 years old, she still has to take him to the doctor this morning. Judy was telling me that the scheme has been talked about for so long and many who are involved in disabilities—in Judy's case, in a first-hand way with her son—were all very excited when the project and the program was first raised and talked about. They thought, 'At last, at last, at last, we are going to see something happening in disabilities '. She has been working on getting appropriate housing because, like many parents who are ageing—and you can probably work out that if she has a 50-year-old son then Judy is at that stage in her life—she is looking towards achieving an ongoing care program for her son when she is no longer able to care for him. She saw the National Disability Insurance Scheme, when it was first touted, as a wonderful, wonderful opportunity where she could actually, with some comfort and some relief, have some opportunity for her son to be able to have a program put in place for when she was no longer able to care for him, as she and her husband currently do. 


We need to get on with this. We certainly need to stop what Senator Kroger was talking about, which was young people with disability whose parents are no longer able to look after them who are then going into aged-care homes. That is a completely inappropriate place for our young disabled people to be located. In my own home town, when I was visiting the nursing home not that long ago, I ran into a wonderful lady who had been looking after her profoundly disabled daughter all of her life at home. She is now no longer able to look after herself and here she is in a nursing home with this young woman who is in an aged-care facility—a completely inappropriate place for her to be.


In saying that, I, like all of my colleagues, am very excited about the opportunity to do something good and innovative so that we can move on—and for the legacy of this parliament to be that we actually did something in support of the people in our society who need our help. It is a judgement that will be made. I am certainly happy to support this bill and commend that everybody support the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:13):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. Today we are making history. Today we move, here in the Senate, to legislate a National Disability Insurance Scheme. At present, most people with a disability in Australia can expect to face a lifelong battle to achieve what the rest of us take for granted: they struggle to get the appropriate support to get out of bed, to get support for personal care with dignity, to leave their home if they have one, to get to school or work, to get a job, to be included and valued and to be part of the community.


We know we have to do better, because people with a disability deserve a fair go. We know that creating a more inclusive society is the right and decent thing to do and today, here in the Senate, we are taking a critical step in supporting people with disability to live their lives the way they want—supporting them in achieving their social and economic aspirations by having a truly inclusive Australia. Gone will be the days of pleading for assistance and having to describe one's circumstances in the worst possible light—a truly demoralising experience. Gone will be the cruel postcode lottery that currently exists. We will replace this with dignity and respect. We will transform disability services within Australia by building the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It is a scheme that recognises that all people live within families and communities, and this will be considered throughout the planning process. The scheme will support individuals with disability to make informed decisions and therefore maintain these strong, resilient families and communities where real choices of service provider can be made to deliver client focused and tailored services. 


To reach this point, to stand here today before the Senate with this bill, is a historic moment—a moment that has not just happened overnight. This has a history that dates back to the Whitlam Labor government. Forty years ago Prime Minister Whitlam sought to introduce a national compensation scheme, a fact that resonates with one of my advisers here today. And now, under another reformist Labor Prime Minister, we are here today to finish the job.


I have had the privilege of being party to some of the steps that got us here. In opposition I moved, on a number of occasions, a reference to inquire into the operation of the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, and was finally successful in 2006. This report was handed down in February 2007 and, once Labor formed government in November 2007, we got on with the job of implementing some of the recommendations. Establishing the new National Disability Agreement with dramatic increases in funding, focused outcomes and deliverables for disability programs and developing the National Disability Strategy were included in those recommendations and I am proud to say that, in true Labor fashion, we have delivered.


In July 2008 we signalled to the world our commitment to improving the lives of people with disability when we ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In Australia we have been working to fulfil our obligations under the UN convention to ensure that the mainstream service systems are focused on the principles of inclusion. In 2011, for the first time in our history, all governments—local, state, territory and our federal government—agreed to a National Disability Strategy, a unified, national approach to breaking down barriers faced by Australians with disability. Since this time we have been paving the way for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a revolutionary reform to the way we provide care and support in our country.


The NDIS has been the goal of so many people with disability, their families and carers and the disability service sector for so many years. You have worked so hard and today is your day. Today we salute your drive and determination, your patience and persistence and your plain hard work. There are many people we need to thank for their role in this long journey: members of the National People with Disabilities and Carer Council; the Productivity Commission, notably Commissioner Patricia Scott and Associate Commissioner John Walsh; the National Disability Insurance Scheme Advisory Group; the members of the four expert working groups; the National Disability and Carer Alliance; and all our peak disability and carers bodies. Thank you to Every Australian Counts, including: the state bodies, the community campaigners and of course the 154,654 Australians who have signed up to this campaign; the 674 people who have had their say online via ndis.gov.au forums; and to all those people with disability, their family members and carers, and their service providers and advocates who have attended any one of the 70-plus forums that Minister Macklin and I have held across the country.


I also take this opportunity to put on the record my thanks to Senator Claire Moore and the members of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for their work in recent months, talking to people right across the country and delivering a constructive and informative report. In doing so, I also thank the people who made the almost 1,600 submissions—again, we have heard you. Many tens of thousands of Australians have had a part in designing the NDIS, and it shows. To each and every one of you: you have made a significant contribution to this historic reform. Australia will be a better place for everyone because of your efforts and for that I thank you.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme will be an insurance scheme for all Australians, that will provide care and support services based on need to any Australian with a significant or profound disability regardless of how they acquired that disability, in much the same way as all Australians have access to social security and universal healthcare systems that provide entitlement to services based on need. This bill establishes the framework of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency. It will enable the scheme to be launched and the agency to be established in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme will benefit around 26,000 people with disability and their families and carers living in South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, the Hunter region in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria. The scheme established by this bill will transform the lives of people with disability and those of their families and carers. For the first time they will have their needs met in a way that truly supports them in living with choice and dignity. It will bring an end to the tragedy of services denied or delayed, and instead offer people with disability the care and support they need over their lifetimes. As was found by the Productivity Commission in its extensive inquiry, and I quote:


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, and gives people with a disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports.


It needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed now, and this bill will take a critical step in doing just that.


Every 30 minutes, on average, someone in Australia is diagnosed with a significant disability. This could be any of us, as disability does not discriminate. Only those with considerable wealth could possibly afford the costs of lifetime care that are required in response. Most Australians with a disability cannot carry this responsibility alone, nor should they be left to. This bill will implement the first stage of a nationwide, demand-driven system of care, tailored to the needs of each individual and established on a durable, long-term basis. The bill reflects the extensive work on design, funding and governance undertaken with states and territories, with people with disability, their families and carers, and with other key stakeholders, work which is ongoing as we continue to build and refine the scheme.


The current funding model, based on historical annual budget allocations, will be replaced by an insurance approach based on actuarial analysis of need and future costs. The scheme will respond to each individual's goals and aspirations for their lifetime, affording certainty and peace of mind for people with disability and their carers alike. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency will work with people to plan and to take account of their individual circumstances and needs. The scheme will give people the care and support that is objectively assessed as being reasonable and necessary over the course of their lifetime.


The bill sets out the objects and principles under which a National Disability Insurance Scheme will operate including giving people choice and control over the care and support they receive and giving effect, in part, to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It sets out the process for a person becoming a participant in the scheme, how participants develop a personal, goal based plan with the agency and how reasonable and necessary supports will be assured to participants. People will be able to decide for themselves the type of care and support they receive and choose how they want to manage those supports. They will be able to access assistance from local coordinators, should they wish, and early intervention therapies and supports will be offered where they will improve a person's functioning or slow, or prevent, the progression of their disability over their lifetime. The bill also provides that the agency will be responsible for the provision of support to people with disability, their families and carers. 


Again, I thank all of those who have contributed so far to this important debate. Some amendments have been made to the bill in the House of Representatives to address decisions made by the Council of Australian Governments, other agreements negotiated with the states and territories, and from ongoing engagement with people with disabilities, their families, carers, advocates and services providers. Those amendments also responded to some of the matters raised in submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee during its inquiry into the bill. Further amendments will be moved by the government here in the Senate. These amendments respond further to the recommendations in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's report on the bill, tabled last week. For example, one amendment revises the objects clause of the bill to reflect Australia's international human rights obligations more strongly and to ensure that this clause operates in conjunction with other laws. A further amendment will recognise the importance of advocacy in the lives of people with a disability.


In closing, I thank many departmental officials from FaHCSIA, including those working for the agency, Prime Minister and Cabinet, and other departments who have been engaged in the design process. Your work has been enormous. I also thank those state and territory officials from across Australia whose work has helped us to get to this point. This bill will be an enormous first step in bringing equality to people with disability, their families and carers. Our government will continue to work with people with a disability, and their families and carers, as we continue to establish a National Disability Insurance Scheme. I thank all senators who have spoken in this debate for their support of this historic legislation and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:46):  Today I rise in the matters of public interest discussion to make a contribution to the ongoing debate about the cost of living. As we know, cost of living is an issue which the opposition love to go on about because they are on a winner. But what I intend to show is that, when you look at the opposition's policies, you realise there is a large amount of hypocrisy coming from those opposite regarding the cost of living. 


On that side of the chamber is an opposition that is constantly finding ways to wind back much-needed assistance for families and households. By contrast, this Labor government has been working hard to address cost-of-living pressures by providing assistance to pensioners, families and working Australians. 


I am proud to be part of a government which has boosted pensions dramatically. The combined effect of our 2009 pension reforms delivering an increase to the base rate and fairer indexation have delivered the highest pensions in history. Starting today, they will further be boosted by Labor's clean energy supplement. Today, a single pensioner on the full pension will earn $207 more a fortnight, and a pensioner couple will earn an extra $236 a fortnight more than they did before our historic pension reforms in September 2009. We have delivered billions of dollars of income tax cuts, which much of that going to low- to middle-income earners. Our decision to triple the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 means that a million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. 


We have boosted the retirement savings of ordinary Australian workers by a decision to progressively lift the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. This will deliver an extra $100,000 in retirement savings for the average worker. We are helping eligible mums and dads with the cost of putting their children through school with the Schoolkids Bonus of $410 per child in primary school and $820 per child in high school. We have a whole suite of measures that are aimed at helping Australians meet the cost of living, and it is clear from our policies that the assistance is focused on those who need the most help.


The opposition like to use the term 'class warfare' to describe this approach, but the use of this term is just a cover for their hypocrisy. They bleat about the cost-of-living pressures yet oppose the very measures that are designed to relieve those pressures. If the coalition are genuinely concerned about the cost of living, why do they oppose a boost to retirement savings? Why do they have a paid parental leave scheme that pays parents who are already better off five times as much as those on the minimum wage? Surely this is an act of 'class warfare'. Why do they talk about raising taxes and cutting pensions so they can use that money to reward big polluters? 


Before I go into detail about some of the policy differences between the government and the opposition, I should mention the government policy that is central to the opposition's attack on us over the cost of living. That of course is the decision to price carbon. In the lead-up to the introduction of a carbon price on 1 July last year, those opposite talked it up as a 'great big new tax' that was going to 'send a wrecking ball through the economy' and 'wipe whole towns off the map'. It was first described by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, as a 'cobra strike'; then as a 'python squeeze'; now it appears it is an 'octopus embrace'. The way Mr Abbott's analogies are going it will probably end up as a kitten rub or a puppy pounce, but whatever kind of animal Mr Abbott wants to liken it to, the fact is the lived experience of the carbon price has been quite benign when compared with the opposition's overblown, alarmist rhetoric.


Let us get a few facts on the table. First of all, the coalition constantly offers the carbon price as evidence that we are a high-taxing government. Nothing could be further from the truth. The overall tax as a percentage of GDP has been lower under all of the five years of Labor than it ever was under any year of the Howard government. Regarding the effect on the price of goods and services, the government always said we knew there would be some price impacts, but they have been quite small. Treasury predicted that a carbon price would cause a 0.7 per cent increase in CPI inflation. Compare this to the 2.5 per cent increase to inflation caused by the Howard government's goods and services tax. Households are being compensated for the carbon price through increased payments and income tax cuts. Contrast this with the introduction of the GST, where the compensation was delivered as income tax cuts only, and primarily benefited middle- to high-income earners.


Through our clean energy supplement, starting today, a single pensioner on the full pension will receive a clean energy supplement of $13.50 a fortnight, or $350 a year. Between now and 1 January 2014, clean energy supplement payments will start to be delivered to recipients of Newstart, family tax benefit, youth allowance and various other government payments. For the initial period of the operation of the carbon price, these recipients were compensated with a lump sum clean energy advance payment. Whether it is increased payments or tax cuts, nine out of 10 households receive some form of compensation. Over four million households have received compensation of at least 20 per cent more than their average price impact. In other words, four million households across Australia will be better off after the combined effect of the carbon price and the household assistance package. In my home state of Tasmania, people are receiving further assistance from the Tasmanian government. Power price increases have been limited, providing power price relief averaging $200 per household, and the Tasmanian government has also boosted electricity concessions. This has been funded from the windfall that Hydro Tasmania has received as a result of the carbon price.


It is hard to know where the Coalition stand on our household assistance measures. Will they keep them or will they wind them back? You have the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, on the one hand saying that he will retain some household assistance, then you have Mr Hockey, the shadow Treasurer, saying all the assistance will be wound back. So who are we supposed to believe? Here we have coalition frontbenchers in two of the most senior portfolios who cannot even get their story straight on how much they intend to raise income taxes and cut pensions by. What we do know is that Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey will raise income taxes and they will cut pensions, but they cannot seem to agree by how much. They are all tied in knots on this, because they know that after forgoing the revenue from the carbon price they still need to find even more billions to fund their expensive 'direct action' plan, which will cost over $1,500 per household.


On top of the massive hole their hare brained 'direct action' scheme would punch in the federal budget, they would have to come up with at least another $5 billion a year to maintain the government's household assistance commitments. Remember, the combination of a carbon price and household assistance actually results in millions of households being better off financially, because that assistance is greater than the price impact. And given the assistance is targeted at lower-income households, it is primarily those households which will suffer when the coalition remove both the carbon price and the associated household assistance, should they become the government.


Is this another case of class warfare, I ask myself. But that is not all that low-income households stand to lose under an Abbott led coalition government. They also stand to lose the schoolkids bonus, which helps low-income families with essential school expenses such as excursions, uniforms and textbooks. And a coalition government would raise the taxes on big businesses by 1.5 per cent a year to fund their gold plated paid parental leave scheme. This new tax, which will cover the parental leave of high-paid executives, will flow through to the cost of basic groceries and will be paid by ordinary families at the checkouts. 


For the average household with a mortgage, the major factor that affects the cost of living is interest rates. Since coming to government in 2007, Labor has contained growth in spending. While those opposite keep perpetuating the myth that coalition governments are more fiscally restrained, the fact is that spending growth over the five years of this government—even including the economic stimulus package—has been lower than any equal period under the Howard government.


Our strict fiscal discipline has given the Reserve Bank greater flexibility to move on interest rates and these are now much lower than they were under the Howard government. In fact, a household with an average mortgage will now save around $5,000 a year because of the drop in interest rates since we came to government in 2007. To put greater competitive pressure on the banks to pass on interest rate cuts, we have introduced a ban on mortgage exit fees imposed by the coalition. In combination with the Reserve Bank interest rate cuts, this has helped to further ease cost of living pressures for families with mortgages.


As to the future of interest rates under a coalition government, we have no idea how they will match their rhetoric on fiscal discipline because of their abysmal failure to release costed policies. Not only have they failed to release costed policies but also they steadfastly refuse to submit their policies to the Parliamentary Budget Office to have their costings independently verified. We do know that Mr Hockey, the man who would be Treasurer under such a government, has revealed that they have a $70 billion black hole. So far though, we are none the wiser as to how far they intend to go to plug that black hole.


We know that a failure to contain spending can lead to upward pressure on interest rates. For an example of the coalition's form on fiscal discipline, maybe we should look at a recent report from the International Monetary Fund which rated the Howard government as the most wasteful government in Australia's history.


The final point I would like to mention when it comes to the coalition's assault on hardworking Australians is their plan for GST distribution. Some of my colleagues—Senator Brown; Dick Adams, the member for Lyons; and the Labor candidate for Denison Jane Austin—were with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, in Hobart a couple of weeks ago to launch Labor's campaign against Mr Abbott's plan to rip $700 million a year in GST receipts out of my home state of Tasmania. This decision will cost Tasmania the equivalent of 800 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 500 allied health professionals and 100 childcare workers every year.


This is a cost-of-living issue for Tasmanians not only because of the thousands of Tasmanians who would be without work if Mr Abbott had his way on GST but also because the lack of access by Tasmanians to vital public services would mean that they would have to fund these services out of their own pocket. Unlike the coalition, Labor remains committed to horizontal fiscal equalisation—that is, the distribution of GST based on the needs of each state and territory and their capacity to deliver services. This is also an important issue for other states and territories that rely on a disproportionate share of GST revenue to provide equivalent services to the highly populated and resource rich states. Without equal access to vital public services for every state and territory, people in South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory will have to reach into their own pockets to get the services that people in New South Wales and Western Australia receive.


A per capita distribution of GST as proposed by Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett and warmly received by Mr Abbott would drive up the cost of living for states, like my home state of Tasmania. It would result in a violation of the principles of universal access to quality education and health services that all Australians hold dear.


In conclusion, we know that Australians are concerned about the cost of living and that some Australians are doing it tough. Labor recognises this and we have delivered valuable assistance to households to help ease cost-of-living pressures. If the coalition wins government and Mr Abbott becomes Prime Minister, this assistance is under threat. The greatest threat to the cost of living in Australia is clearly the prospect of an Abbott-led coalition government. To reiterate, I point out that while those opposite keep perpetuating the myth that coalition governments are more fiscally restrained, the fact is that spending growth over five years of this government—even including the economic stimulus package—has been lower than any equal period under the Howard government. The concerns of the Tasmanian people in regard to the opposition's approach to GST is one that I think—I am glad to see that—




Senator Bushby:
  Tasmania has an absolute right of veto. It can't happen. You know that. Tell Tasmanians the truth.





Senator BILYK:
  Obviously I have hit a mark. You can always tell when you have made a mark and you have hit the nail on the head because you get the opposition senators interjecting, carrying on like little children in the childcare centres where I used to work, just carrying on. Maybe the good senator opposite would do better to talk to his constituents in Tasmania and tell them what they are going to do should Mr Abbott become Prime Minister. How will the coalition even hold its head up to the Tasmanian people knowing that it is cutting funds to Tasmania. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, especially that senator over there that is interjecting. You ought to be absolutely ashamed of yourself. From the point of view of a Tasmanian senator, besides the fact that your behaviour is a bit childish, as are your comments about GST, you should be out there supporting the people of Tasmania.

…   …   …


In particular, Mr Quigley highlighted that workforce mobilisation issues were being faced … by Syntheo in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.


We are determined to overcome these challenges with workforce mobilisation. NBN Co. is already taking measures. Today Service Stream announced that Syntheo has reached agreement with the NBN Co. to hand back the remainder of its design and construction activities in the Northern Territory. This will enable NBN Co. to take direct control of the rollout in the Northern Territory, allowing Syntheo to concentrate its resources on the rollout in Western Australia and South Australia to bring high-speed broadband to Australians in these states sooner. By June 2021 all Australians will have access to high-speed, universal, affordable broadband.




Senator Birmingham:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. My question related to targets by 30 June this year, not June 2021, as the minister is currently trying to draw the Senate to. I ask you to please refer the minister to my very specific question, which was about targets by 30 June this year.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, on the point of order: the minister is giving a very detailed answer about the rollout schedule. That was precisely the content of the question. I know Senator Birmingham wants to make a political point, but the minister is being very helpful to the senator by providing him with details about how the government and the NBN are working in relation to the rollout schedule. There is no point of order.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:01):  I wish to answer a question asked by Senator Colbeck at additional estimates, question 179. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.




The answer read as follows—



Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee 


ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE 


Additional Estimates February 2013 


Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry


Question: 179


Division/Agency: Finance and Business Support Division 


Topic: IER


Proof Hansard page: Written


Senator COLBECK asked:


Figures provided at Additional Estimates indicated the IER has dropped from approximately $24 million to $10 million this financial year, and that the target figure is actually $18 million.


Specifically what has this money been spent on?


Has industry been advised of the erosion of the reserve?


Has industry approved the use of this money?


What efficiencies is the division implementing to redress the ongoing use of the IER?


What is the IER expected to be by the end of the current financial year?


When will decisions be made on how to return the IER to the target of $18 million?


Answer:


1. At Additional Estimates the opening balance of the reserve on 1 July 2012 was $14.3 m. The import clearance deficit for 2012-13 was forecast to be $24.7 m. This would put the reserve into a $10.4 m deficit position.


Departmental budgets have been updated since Additional Estimates and the forecast operating deficit has reduced from $24.7 m to $10.9 m. As a result, the reserve balance is forecast at a $3.4 m surplus.


The range of the reserve agreed in the Cost Recovery Impact Statement (CRIS) is between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of annual expenditure. This equates to approximately $4 m to $19 m.


Attachment A provides a breakdown of expenditure for the 2012-13 year to date.


2. Yes. Industry is provided financial information as part of the Import Industry Finance Working Group.

3. The industry reserve is a mechanism to smooth out operational results of cargo operations over years. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) does not seek industry agreement to draw on the reserves each time a deficit is incurred. Industry is informed of the forecast, actual expenditure and the underlying activities on a regular basis.


4. From 2007-08 until now, the following efficiencies have been implemented:


a. Reduction of intervention of containers departing the wharf gate from 100 per cent external inspection to 30 per cent inspection.


b. Paperless processing of non-commercial air cargo documentation.


c. Reclassification of postcodes previously classified as rural (rural assurance postcode review).


d. Reduction of intervention on Air Cargo containers from 20 per cent intervention to surveillance only.


e. Reduction of intervention on letter class documents from 20 per cent intervention to surveillance only.


f. Introduction of a nationally consistent approach to monitoring imported goods at quarantine approved premises, airports, wharves and port precincts.


g. Redirection of resources away from low risk activities and toward high risk cargo.


h. Conducted targeted campaigns on imported commodities to verify the documentary assessment


i. Implementation of processes to reduce intervention on high risk cargo based on good compliance (Sea Container Hygiene System, Q-Ruler and e-cert)


j. Import conditions have been refined to reduce intervention on low risk cargo.


The industry reserve is a mechanism to smooth out operational results of cargo operations over time. DAFF does not plan to cease using the reserve for this purpose.


5. The IER is forecast to be' $3.4 m in surplus at the end of 2012-13.


6. The range of the reserve agreed in the Cost Recovery Impact Statement (CRIS) is between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of annual expenditure. This equates to approximately $4 m to $19 m. The current 2012-13 forecast closing balance of the reserve is $3.4 m. The operating result and IER are monitored throughout the year.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to all questions without notice asked today.


The particular answers to which I wish to address myself are the answers given by Senator Conroy to Senator Humphries and by Senator Ludwig to a dorothy dix question from his backbench concerning the government's backdown on its Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012.


Backdowns do not come more humiliating than this. Throughout most of 2012 the former Attorney-General, Ms Nicola Roxon, described the anti-discrimination bill as one of the government's signature pieces of human rights legislation. It was the centrepiece of her social engineering—her ambitions to turn Australia into a nanny state, governed by political correctness, in which the government would decide what it was appropriate for people to say. That is what Ms Roxon said again and again: 'We will decide what is appropriate.'


We in the opposition saw that for what it was: part of a front in the war that the Gillard government has waged against freedom of speech. The attack on freedom of speech can sometimes be frontal but sometimes, equally insidiously, it can be subtle. It can be subtle in changing the manner in which people deal with each other, what they feel free and unconstrained to say to one another and the subjects they feel are open to them to discuss in ordinary discourse; and yet this government, to its undying shame, brought forward legislation which sought to impose the government's will between citizen and citizen in a free country to try to determine what people were free to say to one another. They brought forward a bill which, among other things, would have made it unlawful for a person, in the course of a political discussion in the workplace, to express an opinion which another person in that workplace might have found offensive. Just think about that, Mr Deputy President: what that would mean for freedom of discussion in Australia's workplaces and what it would have done to the Australian way of life overall.


More shamefully, not only did they make this insidious, subtle but dangerous attempt to trammel our freedom of speech, they pretended it was nothing more than an exercise in statutory tidying up. The new Attorney-General, Mr Mark Dreyfus, said so. He said, in an opinion to Steve Austin on 612 ABC Radio in Brisbane in January this year, that this law makes no change to the existing law; it is just a tidying up of existing legislation. That was not the truth. Attorneys-General should tell the truth. Mr Dreyfus, being a senior council, should certainly know how to tell the truth about a statute, and that was not the truth. As every witness to the Senate committee observed, this was a radical departure in Australian law.


Now, this morning, Mr Dreyfus has dumped the proposal comprehensively and instead adopted the opposition's proposal, because the opposition senators who sat on the Senate committee that reviewed the bill made two recommendations: firstly, that the bill not be proceeded with and, secondly, that part II of the Sex Discrimination Act be amended to include identity as a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex person as a protected attribute to which the act extends—a well acknowledged and longstanding gap in the coverage of legitimate anti-discrimination law by the Commonwealth of Australia. That is what Mr Dreyfus announced this morning.


So in the course of a humiliating backdown, Mr Dreyfus announced, as the policy of the government—a government that has been in office for 5½ years—the policy the coalition took to the 2010 election, and shamefully sought to cover his tracks by saying, 'We're just going to have another look at this.' Nobody listening to Mr Dreyfus this morning was persuaded because what Mr Dreyfus was doing was raising the white flag on one of the most dangerous attempts at social engineering in the history of this parliament. Nevertheless, the freedom wars go on on the front of freedom of the press.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I am absolutely amazed that today we should be looking at a celebration of something which we have just heard the shadow Attorney-General state with great pride is something the opposition will be supporting. In fact, you pointed out that in the five years of our government we had not moved to pick up on this issue—in twelve years of your government you did not even identify this issue.


What we had today was the Attorney-General go out and talk about how we are moving with this process. We are moving forward with one extremely important element: to ensure that there is equity in our community. We are moving forward because we know that we have agreement on this. This is something we can do now that will achieve a result for people who have been waiting for a very long time to have their rights fully enshrined in the legislation. You know, of course, that our government has moved to remove discrimination against people who are in same-sex relationships and who identify in this way, in a whole range of government legislation. In fact, I believe that it is 85 pieces of legislation in which we have removed any discrimination. This particular amendment that we are bringing forward today for this legislation enshrines the fact that people cannot be discriminated against for being in same-sex relationships or being intersex—I will just get the words correct and get that on record—and that is coming forward in legislation. 


I am amazed that, instead of actually working and saying that we have achieved this, we have to go back into this extraordinary conspiracy process which was run by the opposition consistently through the extensive Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee proceedings that my friend Senator Crossin chaired—and an astounding amount of submissions came forward—which was looking at consolidating our anti-discrimination laws in Australia. The Attorney-General, on the ABC radio in Brisbane earlier this year—and luckily I happened to be listening to that interview; I do not always hear everything that is on that program, but I did hear that—talked about the tidying-up process. He also talked about changes that would be taking place in that process. What he said clearly this morning in public was that we were going to continue with that work, because it is complex and it is also necessary. The Attorney-General has said on record that we are moving forward with this one piece of legislation today. But there is no abandonment; we are not moving away from the commitment that we made to pull together the five pieces of legislation that are part of that process now. 


I cannot understand why this has been portrayed consistently by senators on the other side as some form of attack on, or some form of conspiracy against, free speech. I am not going to go down that track in this short contribution of how we look at free speech in this place. There are quite serious differences around what constitutes free speech. Nonetheless, we need to see that this is not a time in the political process to say that because we have not moved forward with all the recommendations from the wonderful Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that we are moving away from it. What the Attorney-General has said—and what our government has said—is that this is a work in progress, and it is clearly on the record that that is what we are going to be doing.


I think what we need to see is that there are people on the other side who are opposed to some of the things that were being discussed in that committee. They were open about that. They opposed some things and they put in opposition comments that they do not want those things to happen. That does not work for our side as well. There is no abandonment to our commitment to move forward with our anti-discrimination legislation. This is a step forward, and I believe we have had the commitment that means that it is going to be accepted. So at least that will occur. 


I am very sorry that I will not have a chance to talk more deeply about Senator Colbeck's question about the IER. It is something in which I have deep interest and I know that it is something that will cause a great deal of discussion. I sincerely trust that we will hear from Senator Colbeck about the importance of this area in this taking note exercise. I just apologise, through you, Mr Deputy President, that I cannot take up that issue. We are not moving away from our anti-discrimination process.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:11):  I certainly will be taking up further discussion around the IER, as was perhaps promised by Senator Moore. I have to say, the minister's answer to this question today just demonstrates even further the complete and utter chaos that operates within the government around the operations of the agricultural portfolio. I asked a number of questions at additional estimates on 11 February—not long ago—to find out what the status of this reserve was. I was told that it would be reducing from about $24 million in surplus to about $10 million in surplus. Just last Friday the committee received a correction to the advice that was given to the committee and to me at additional estimates on 11 February. When I asked the question about what the reserve might be, I was told by the departmental official that the forecast was to be around $14 million by the end of the financial year—a change from $24.688 million. The correction that arrived to the committee last Friday, and that was accepted by the committee on Monday just gone, was that the IER is forecast to be around $10 million in deficit; a turnaround of $24.688 million, going from $14 million in surplus—reducing by $24.68 million—to about $10 million in deficit.


Today Minister Ludwig came in and said that it has since been recalculated. He accused me of trying to mislead the Senate and of not doing my homework. This is the latest advice that I have, accepted by the committee on Monday and received last Friday, saying that we are $10 million in deficit. He then tabled an answer today to questions on notice, taken by the department and by the government at estimates on 11 February, saying that the figure has been revised—after he tried to accuse me of misleading the chamber by giving a wrong number when his department gave me that number just last Friday—to say that the industry reserve balance is forecast at $3.4 million. That is a start; that is at least a change, but it is still a significant reduction from $14 million in surplus to $3.4 million. They are still going backwards by $10 million. Yet, when I ask what the money is being spent on, the minister cannot tell us the answer to that question. What is the money being spent on? Is it, as we suspect, significant, out-of-control cost overruns on new IT systems being developed by the department? We just want to know; industry wants to know.


But, more importantly, how are we going to turn this around? How do we turn around this continued running down of industry reserve funds that are there so that there does not have to be a huge fluctuation in the rate of fees and charges that are charged to industry? Is industry going to have to pay for the government's complete inefficiencies yet again? Are we going to see huge increases in fees and charges like we did under the export fees and charges program where they have gone up in excess of 1,300 per cent? Are we going to see more of that? How is it going to be recouped? How will we get this reserve back to $18 million—$18 million is where the department would like to see the reserve placed.


The minister had absolutely no idea of any of these elements of those questions today—absolutely none. The only thing he could do was to accuse opposition of misleading the parliament when he has not provided the parliament with the information that we sought. He tabled an update after question time today, and yet the latest information we had from the department, from the government, was only last Friday. It just demonstrates the complete and utter chaos that exists within the agriculture portfolio. It compounds the complete debacle of live exports that has caused damage right across the beef industry in this country. You really wonder how this minister continues to hold his portfolio when, within three or four days, and only four or five weeks after additional estimates, we have complete chaos in relation to the numbers that are being provided to this parliament.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  I too would like to take note of the answers to questions on notice. I would particularly like to take up the points that Senator Brandis was raising about the issues of the Anti-Discrimination Act and the response from Senator Moore. To me, it was a pretty disingenuous attempt by Senator Brandis on this issue because, as we all know, that draft consultation bill that was released last December was a very important piece of work that attempted to consolidate five anti-discrimination bills. It has undergone a very deep and meaningful process of scrutiny through the Senate committee process and, as the Senate committee reported last month, there were more than 100 recommendations in that report from the committee.


To me, it seems that when we are trying to use the committee process to improve and to amend legislation for the greater good—to bring those five pieces of legislation together, to make sure the language is consistent, that changes to a consolidated act do not accidentally disenfranchise or disadvantage anyone—there is this notion, when we are all here trying to do some very important work, that this should be seen as a capitulation in some respects. We are damned if we do and we are damned if we don't in this place so often if we decide not to proceed helter-skelter down a road of reform.


What I was pleased to hear Minister Dreyfus say this morning was the acknowledgement that major changes were going to be required to that draft legislation to ensure that it did reflect the many, many concerns raised about the issues brought forward. So let us just be a little bit more genuine about the purpose of the redrafting work that will be done; doing what we should do wisely and sensibly—sending it back to the drafters for major improvements. I look forward to seeing that bill when it comes forward again.


The alternative is what Senator Brandis, as the shadow spokesperson and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, has in mind in terms of anti-discrimination. His suggestion is a promise to repeal the Racial Vilification Act. In my mind, that is something that will go about stripping people's protections from hate speech. We have seen plenty of examples in the media about that, and I really hope that we would not be going down that path as an alternative to anti-discrimination legislation.


However, I actually asked a very important question today in question time, which went to Senator Kim Carr. It was in relation to the fact that it is Seniors Week this week and the important contribution that the government is making and the important support that the government is giving to senior Australians. I want to acknowledge the fact that single pensioners will, from today, start receiving that extra $35.80 a fortnight and that pensioner couples on a maximum rate will receive an extra $54 a fortnight—and that includes Labor's clean energy supplement.


What we as a Labor government are about is ensuring that senior Australians, wherever they live, are being supported in the community. The raft of initiatives that have been undertaken to ensure that our senior Australians are able to live with some dignity are very important. The aged care package that Minister Butler released last week and the financial planning services that the Department of Human Services has been rolling out for senior Australians are all very sensible and supportive initiatives that I am very proud that we are able to have in place. But, again, the opposition's suggestion is to claw back the initiatives that are under the Household Assistance Package, reducing pensions by at least $350 a year. I think the options are very clear for all Australians about seniors.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:21):  I rise to take note of answers from Senator Wong to a question from Senator Edwards particularly relating to the collapse of Priority Engineering Services, a firm in South Australia that has been an innovator for many years in the area of engineering and manufacturing. This is a company that has a worldwide footprint in terms of their stamping press washers in the automotive sector, particularly in Malaysia. They have been a pivotal part of South Australia's industry presence, stemming back to the Collins-class submarine and some of the work they did on that through to current projects.


The vindictiveness that came across the chamber from Senator Wong today was particularly disappointing, because it was about politics as opposed to the people who are involved in this company. Both Mr Peter Page and Mr Peter Parrish, the directors of this company, have invested a huge amount of their personal effort, time, resources and capital into developing this company and growing it to be a significant employer of South Australians, an innovator of manufacturing processes and a contributor to the manufacturing capability of this country. To have their efforts dismissed in such a manner is truly disappointing.


Priority Engineering is one of many firms in South Australia that has been encouraged by the government to move from their traditional markets of the automotive sector and mining into the defence sector. The government has consistently told them that there are huge opportunities for them by getting engaged with the prime contractors from overseas and getting into the global supply chain, particularly into the support for acquisitions and sustainment in this country. This has not just been verbal encouragement—$1.8 million was given by this Labor government to Priority Engineering specifically to enable them to tool up and skill their people through an acquisition so that they could participate in this defence industry sector.


For private business, that does not just come out of thin air. Those kinds of acquisitions mean that you take on debt, and debt needs to be serviced. Some of the things that bank managers look at are whether you have a business plan and where your work is coming from. In the case of defence industry, the document they look to is the Defence Capability Plan. When the government issues a Defence Capability Plan and, more importantly, announce, on the strength of that capability plan and a tender process, a preferred tenderer that they have entered into contract negotiations with, there is a high degree of expectation on the part of defence industry that the dates that have been put forward in the Defence Capability Plan and the tender will be followed through.


When the government mismanages that plan, as was the case in one of the projects that Priority Engineering was involved with, and cannot bring to conclusion a contract negotiation process with the prime—it had stretched on for months and months into new years—that spells cash flow problems for companies. It appears that one thing that this government does not understand is the reality for small business of profit and loss and the importance of cash flow. When they mismanage plans, cancel or defer programs or cannot bring to timely conclusion contract negotiations that directly goes to the cash flow, and therefore the viability, of the people who have tooled up in the expectation of fulfilling part of Australia's national defence capability requirement.


This government has mismanaged the Defence Capability Plan. That mismanagement has had a direct impact on Australia's defence capability through the failures of companies like Priority Engineering. If the people of Australia cannot trust this government with defence capability, and therefore the security of this nation, and if they cannot trust them with the security of their jobs, then it is time for the people of this country to change the government so that we bring in a government that truly looks at the role that defence industry plays as a part of the national defence capability of this country and puts in place defence capability plans that are achievable and predictable and will be implemented not only for the benefit of the nation but so that we can sustain the jobs and the innovation that the defence industry has so consistently brought to this country.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2013-03-20,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (15:26):  I want to take note of the answer provided by the Minister representing the Attorney-General in relation to the government's abandonment of their commitment to reform anti-discrimination laws which was officially announced today.


The government has suggested that this is merely a deferral of their commitment, but the reality is, as we know, that if the foreshadowed reform of these anti-discrimination laws was not to be introduced this week, so that it could be debated in the next session, then, effectively, it is off for all comers. We know that unless that was going to occur before the election we would not know what happen after that.


Unfortunately, with this abandonment the government is betraying the hopes and the faith of many Australians who have been waiting for a very long time to see simpler, fairer equality laws. Significant numbers of people have been working in relation to this matter for many years. There has been extensive consultation. There have been reports in relation to the law reform, and, of course, we have also recently seen a comprehensive and thorough inquiry process by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a member. So I had the benefit of actually hearing the numerous submissions made by Australians across the country who have been very keen to see fairer, simpler equality laws brought in, consistent with the government's pre-election commitment.


We know that what will happen with this walking away from this election commitment is that there will be many people who will now be unprotected who were going to have protections enhanced. Victims of family and domestic, for instance, currently can be discriminated against without sanction, for instance, in the real estate market, where they can be denied accommodation by real estate agents if the agents are concerned that a person applying for accommodation may be subject to domestic violence. They have no recourse at the moment. People with family responsibilities—carers and parents—can be discriminated against in most situations without any recourse.


These were reforms that were foreshadowed in the draft exposure bill. They were recommendations of the committee inquiring into the bill that will now be abandoned. We also know that there are many people in Australia who can still be discriminated against by religious organisations, religious bodies and schools. Those people were not necessarily going to be protected by the changes to the law, although that is what the Greens were certainly calling for.


We do know that the exposure draft of the bill did suggest that at the very least people who were needing aged-care be protected from the existing religious exceptions in current antidiscrimination law. The government had put that in the exposure draft. The committee had certainly recommended that that be upheld, but that in fact is now not going to occur.


The government has indicated that it will take some limited but important reform steps in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act to include sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. We very much welcome those. They are long overdue. Unfortunately, being so restricted, there are still many Australians who will be left short.


The other aspect we do need to be aware of, even in relation to that law reform, is that the religious exceptions will remain and indeed will extend to people who have those protected attributes as well. So where religious bodies and organisations are allowed to lawfully discriminate currently on the basis of protected attributes they will continue to be allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. Of course, they are a significant body of the Australians who are discriminated against by those powerful institutions in society. Today the news does not offer them any hope that that will change, because the religious exceptions will remain on foot. 


The Attorney-General has said timing and complexity are issues. Why did the government leave this election commitment until the last minute? Labor has clearly lost the political will to protect human rights. This is a great shame. It is a shame that Labor apparently does not have the courage of its convictions to see these reforms through, to take on the debate, to make the case and to make sure that Australians are adequately protected, as it had undertaken to do before the election.

The speech read as follows—



The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Great Barrier Reef) Bill 2013 implements in our national environment laws key recommendations of the World Heritage Committee to ensure the Great Barrier Reef does not get added to the ""world heritage in danger"" list.


The Australian Greens share the World Heritage Committee's ""extreme concern"" that the Australia's world heritage icon, the Great Barrier Reef, is being overrun by industrialisation.


In June of 2012, the World Heritage Committee stated that unless the Australian Government makes substantial progress on improving our management of the Great Barrier Reef, the Committee at its meeting of June 2013 will have to consider inscribing the Reef on the ""List of World Heritage in Danger"". This would be a tragedy for our Reef, and the extraordinary number of Australians who love this place, and the 54,000 people who rely on it for their livelihood. The only other countries that have had their world heritage properties inscribed on this list are among the world's poorest, and war-torn nations—Afghanistan, the Congo, Yemen.


In February 2013, the Australian Government submitted its state party response to the concerns outlined by the World Heritage Committee. 


The Australian Greens have carefully reviewed this response, and are very concerned that far too much is greenwash and obfuscation. While we welcome the announcement of an independent panel to investigate the ecological disaster in Gladstone Harbour in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, this is long overdue given the wildlife disease that has been apparent since dredging began in 2011, compounded by flooding impacts. Such an investigation must be based on independent data if it is to be truly independent—not the data collected by the very folk doing the reef's largest dredging program, Gladstone Ports Corporation. We welcome federal investigation into Gladstone Harbour but the government is failing to genuinely address a number of other critical recommendations made by the World Heritage Committee. 


The Greens want to see strong steps taken urgently to secure the future of the Reef, in line with the World Heritage Committee's recommendations. To that end, we have identified a number of recommendations by the Committee and the UNESCO reactive monitoring mission which are suitable for implementing through our national environment laws. 


This bill proposes to put in place a permanent ban on any new port development outside of the existing and long-established major port areas within or adjoining the GBR WHA, including specifically banning new port developments in the ecological valuable Port Alma, Balaclava Island, northern Curtis Island and the entire northern section of the Great Barrier Reef. This would implement, under our national environment laws, Recommendation 5 of the World Heritage Committee's decision of June 2012 (Decision 36 COM 7B.B), and reflects the findings of UNESCO's reactive monitoring mission's report, which identifies a number of pristine areas along the Great Barrier Reef coastline which should not be destroyed by industrial port developments.


This bill also proposes to stop port expansions if they impact individually or cumulatively on the Outstanding Universal Value of the Great Barrier Reef.  This implements Recommendation 5 of the World Heritage Committee's decision of June 2012 (Decision 36 COM 7B.B).


The third major amendment proposed by this bill is that it will put in place a moratorium to stop the national environment minister from approving any new developments that would seriously affect the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area until the Strategic Assessment currently underway, and a resulting long term plan for the sustainable development of the Reef, has been completed and considered by the World Heritage Committee. This implements Recommendation 2 of UNESCO's Reactive Monitoring Mission's report, which the World Heritage Committee has requested the Australian Government address (per the Committee's Recommendation 4 of Decision 36 COM 7B.B). The critical point of this amendment is to ensure that the Minister can no longer continue to tick off the very projects that have prompted the World Heritage Committee's extreme concern, while they are undertaking their strategic assessment to work out what the reef in fact can handle. Since the World Heritage Committee first made this recommendation in June 2012, the Government has flouted this request and approved expansions of Abbot Point (including 3 million cubic metres of dredging), and the huge Alpha coal mine. The terms of reference for the strategic assessment currently underway to assess coastal development impacting on the Great Barrier Reef explicitly says, despite the World Heritage Committee's request, that project level assessments and approvals will continue to be progressed unhampered by the strategic assessment process. That is, anything that is applied for before the strategic assessment finishes cannot have its approval impacted by the strategic assessment—like a smoker going to the Doctor and getting everything but their lungs checked. That's why this amendment requires the World Heritage Committee to assent to the strategic assessment before the moratorium is lifted, to ensure that it does adequately address the parameters which the World Heritage Committee said it should.


Lastly, this bill proposes to amend the approval criteria for projects that will impact the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area, so that projects can only be approved if they deliver a net benefit for the Reef. This amendment also requires that a methodology be developed to underpin this judgement, and that the 'net benefit' reasoning is explained by the Minister for each project that is approved. This will implement part of the World Heritage Committee's Recommendation 8 (Decision 36 COM 7B.B), which calls on the Government to ensure that developments affecting the Great Barrier Reef demonstrate an overall net benefit to the protection of the Reef's Outstanding Universal Value. The Government itself, in its February 2013 state party response to the World Heritage Committee's concerns stated that any approvals granted under the EPBC Act will include best practice conditions so as to promote an overall net positive impact for the property. If this is genuinely intended, a clear methodology is without question needed, and this bar locked in place in law. 


The Australian Government has so far fallen short in acting on the World Heritage Committee's recommendations, but this bill presents the Government and the Coalition the opportunity to stand up for our Reef, and do what the Committee has clearly stated the Reef desperately needs. 


It should be beyond party politics to protect our Reef, to keep it as the seventh wonder of the natural world that so inspires our spirit, fills our coffers with 6 billion annual sustainable—and long-term—incomes, and keeps employing 54,000 people. Political parties of all persuasion must take this warning from the World Heritage Committee seriously and do everything we can to avoid the Reef being placed on the World Heritage In Danger list. Such a listing would be a disaster for our tourism industry, and would acknowledge the serious environmental peril the reef is in from the scourge of dredging, dumping and shipping for fossil fuel exports, and from the climate change impacts when such fossil fuels are burnt.


On behalf of Australia's reef communities, and all Australians who love our Reef, I implore our elected representatives for their support on this bill. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is simply too precious to lose.


I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:00):  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion standing in the name of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Conroy, I move: 


That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion to vary the hours of meeting a routine of business for Wednesday 20 March and Thursday 21 March.


As senators will be aware there have been matters occurring in the House of Representatives, with respect to the broadcasting and related bills that the government is determined to progress in this week. The motion that was circulated will be amended to respond to Senator Fifield's concern with respect to progressing matters around the national apology for forced adoptions. The further motion will allow the Senate to express its position on these bills that were voted on in the other place this week.


Senators would be aware that it is not unusual for such a motion to tightly order business of the Senate in the last few sitting days of a session. The issues contained in the bills have been widely canvassed and debated over quite some considerable time. The government reform follows extensive consultation and discussion. I recognise that the Senate has made good progress in considering legislation on the days that we have sat for the autumn sittings. Time-management motions by a government in the last weeks of a sitting are, as the opposition knows, not unusual. Governments of all persuasions are faced with the same options in managing their legislative program. I do not apologise for the use of the time management motion when the alternative is extended weeks and hours of sitting to grind through sometimes very repetitious contributions. Some senators, particularly those from the opposition, may not appreciate reasonable attempts to manage time. It is for the Senate to decide whether it supports diversity in the media and upholding press standards, and indeed others are also keen, across all parties, to move forward on the NDIS. I recommend the motion to the chamber.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The motion that Senator Collins is foreshadowing seeks to do two things that should not be done: it seeks to guillotine debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. If there is any piece of legislation that has come before this chamber this year or even last year, where a spirit of bipartisanship should be at play, it is this piece of legislation. If there is any piece of legislation that deserves proper scrutiny, we all agree with the NDIS and we all support this legislation. But it is complex legislation and there is no reason it should not have the same scrutiny as any other piece of legislation. There is every reason why the 1,600 people who made submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the NDIS should have the opportunity to have many of the issues that they have raised ventilated in the committee stage of this bill.


It is appalling that the NDIS legislation is going to be a victim of this government's media reform package. The other thing that should never happen—which was foreshadowed in the earlier motion that Senator Collins circulated and which she is now seeking to insert into the motion which we just passed—is having consideration of the package of media bills tied to the arrangements for the apology to those who were forcibly adopted.


We had reached agreement around the chamber that the arrangements for Thursday would be agreed on a cooperative basis. We said that we would support a motion that outlined arrangements for Thursday that would facilitate the arrangement for the forced adoption apology. That was done by agreement. Yet, this afternoon we have sprung on the chamber, with no notice, a proposition by the government to run those two things together: the arrangements for the forced adoption, which we have agreed upon, and then to take advantage of our goodwill and cross party support for that change in arrangements, to try and use time in the afternoon for the media package of bills. That is appalling. I think anyone who is coming to Canberra for the apology for those who were forcibly adopted should be aware that this government has sought to sully their day. This government has sought to drag these tawdry bills, these appalling bills, these Orwellian media bills into a day that should be dedicated and focused on the apology to those Australians who were forcibly adopted.


I thought that the government had a modicum of decency. I thought that the government had a modicum of good will. I thought that they were able to separate their nakedly partisan objectives in relation to the media package of bills today. But no, they could not help themselves—they are going to mire Thursday, they are going to mire that day, which is meant to be about the apology to those who were forcibly adopted. I cannot believe it, Mr President.


Senator Collins knows better than to do this. I can only assume that those on the other side have directed that she take this action. We cannot support the debasement of tomorrow, which is meant to be a significant day for those Australians who have sought an apology.


The apology is no small issue for those who were forcibly adopted. The media package of bills should not blight what is a very important day for those people. But I come back to where I started. What appals me more than anything is the proposed guillotine on the NDIS legislation. But we should not be surprised. We know that the government want to gag a free press, they want to gag debate on the NDIS, they want to gag debate on the media rules and, to that extent, I have to acknowledge they are being totally consistent.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:08):  I rise to say that I am looking forward to getting the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill through the Senate. I note that there has already been significant progress in the committee stage. There are now another 2¼ hours in which to progress the bill further through that committee and, the sooner we can get on with it, the sooner that debate will occur. I do not think there is anyone who does not want to see that legislation dealt with, passed and brought into law. The Greens support that happening.


As to the particular media bills, the Greens have worked very hard to ensure that we get recognition for the online platform for the ABC and SBS and also to ensure that the ABC can continue to do its overseas programming instead of putting it out to tender. Those bills are very, very important. I do not think that there would be anyone listening, especially the Friends of the ABC, who would not recognise just how important it is to have that protection of its online presence. A technological change has enabled it, but it is not enshrined as it currently applies. I, for one, want to see that protection being given to the ABC and SBS as quickly as possible and want to ensure that the ABC's overseas service continues in the way that it has.


I think there has been a bit of grandstanding here. It is definitely in the public interest to get these particular bills through. It is disingenuous to bring the apology for forced adoptions into this debate. My colleague Senator Siewert has done a huge amount of work through the committee system to deliver for people seeking this apology. The Greens are very pleased that this day will come to the parliament tomorrow. We will certainly be there as part of a very respectful apology to people who have been victims of forced adoptions. I do not want that process to be part of a grandstand by the coalition. There should be tripartite support for this in a dignified manner tomorrow. With that, Mr President, we want to see the disability legislation go through, we want to see the legislation that protects the ABC and SBS go through and we will be pleased to see those go through today.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:11):  This is, once again, an outrageous abuse of Senate process by a government that, frankly, is addicted to gagging debate in this place, is addicted to curtailing the proper scrutiny of its reforms and just cannot help itself but to mismanage the affairs of this chamber and ram through laws that this country should not have without proper debate.


In the life of this parliament we have seen 158 bills guillotined through this chamber and, if this motion is successful, another seven will be added to that list and 165 bills will have been guillotined under the watch of this government. Senator Fifield already outlined the fact that this move to guillotine debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme is an astounding step by the government. Everyone in this chamber, especially people on this side, wants to see that legislation passed. The opposition is more than willing to work cooperatively with the government to do so but, instead, in an attack on the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation that exists around the NDIS, this government, addicted to guillotining it, addicted to the guillotine, had to guillotine this measure as well.


Equally, they are guillotining the six media reform bills, four of them highly controversial. The hypocrisy of all this is astounding, especially from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Conroy. Let me reflect on what Senator Conroy had to say, back in 2006, about media reforms then. At that stage he put out a press release, in which he said:


Government senators have used their numbers to turn the communications committee inquiry into the media law bills into an absolute farce …


And further:


It is clear that the Government does not want its legislation subjected to proper scrutiny by the senate committee …


Senator Conroy went on:


The committee will be forced to cram more than 30 witnesses into just two days of hearings …


In a complete abuse of the Senate committee process, the minister nominated the reporting date before the committee had even met. The public are entitled to wonder what the government is trying to hide. The government is clearly determined to ram this legislation through the parliament and is arrogantly prepared to sacrifice proper Senate scrutiny to achieve this objective.


Those were Senator Conroy's words in 2006. In 2006 there were four media bills under consideration. Today there are six bills under consideration. In 2006 the government of the day allowed 34 days for consideration of the bills between the houses. This year, the government of the day is allowing just seven days worth of consideration. In 2006 the government of the day allowed 17 days for the committee to report. This year, the government has allowed barely two days for the committee to conduct hearings and report.


This is an amazing situation, where this government wants to push through the most far-reaching, first-ever peacetime regulation of media in this country, and it is doing it under guillotine. This reform process is shambolic, it is too rushed and it is half baked. And do not take my word for it, Mr President, because they are not my words; they are the words of Mr Wilkie, the member for Denison, who just a short while ago described the media reform process of this government as 'shambolic, too rushed and half baked'. I could not agree more. That is why this motion should be defeated and that is why there is no way these six media reform bills should be guillotined.


We all know that this government's desire to ram this media legislation through this Senate and through this parliament is driven purely by vengeance; purely by their vengeance to get back at those who have criticised the many, many failures of this government. They have thin skins over there on the government benches and on the cross benches; they want to get back at the people who have been their chief critics and they want to do it by the end of this week.


Although the Prime Minister has completely sidelined Senator Conroy from this process and made a mockery of his take-it-or-leave-it stance in terms of no amendments to the bills, the government remains determined to exact its revenge. This Senate should reject this motion and reject the government's desire to have that revenge.

 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (16:16):  I join this debate reluctantly, but just to put a bit of practical advice into the chamber if I could be so bold. It is currently quarter past four. The motion says that if we pass this motion we will have two hours to debate the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have spent all of this morning in committee. The legislation was actually introduced to the House of Representatives last year. We have had an extended second reading debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and no speaker was curtailed. If we were to stop the grandstanding—and I do apologise, Senator Birmingham, but I think you were more or less debating the media laws rather than an hours motion—and get on with the business of dealing with this, we would have two more hours in committee to deal with the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


We all agree about the bipartisanship—the tripartisanship, in fact—around this bill; it is a very important bill. So I do urge the Senate to consider that in the passage of this debate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:17):  For Senator McLucas's information—you would think she would know better, having been here as long as she has—this is actually a motion to set aside standing orders to allow the government to move a motion. It is not the motion about the hours. She is criticising Senator Birmingham for debating the media laws and she herself then committed the error of debating the hours motion rather than the motion which is to set aside standing orders, which I actually want to talk about.


I do not think that any of the government speakers have actually demonstrated a need to set aside the standing orders or to allow for this motion to be dealt with now in preference to the agenda that was before us. I do want to point out that the government's proposed motion that Senator McLucas wants us to deal with now is as dysfunctional as is this government generally. I suspect that what the government is trying to do is to get a little bit of free time for tomorrow so that we can have the ultimate leadership challenge as it comes along, and I am surprised that the Greens are facilitating the leadership challenge tomorrow.


If the government's proposal is eventually adopted—if this motion is passed and we are allowed to continue with the hours motion—it does mean that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has met today and carefully looked at both the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill and the broadcasting bills, if I can call them that, is not going to be able to table until after all of those bills are dealt with. Mr President, you would understand that one of the reasons the Senate sets up committees like the Scrutiny of Bills is so that we can in a bipartisan way have a look at bills that come through and alert senators—as you know, the committee itself does not give opinions or take partisan views, but it does alert senators—to things that the committee thinks the chamber should be aware of. As I said, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has done a fair bit of work on these two bills. There are some horrendous provisions in the broadcasting bills which do impact on freedoms, rights and liberties, and it is the duty of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to alert senators to those, because the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has more time and better advisers, I might say, to make senators aware of these.


These draconian measures really need to be brought to the attention of the senators when they are debating these two bills. And yet, the Labor Party in promoting the change to the order, simply overlooks the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It obviously does not want us—want the Scrutiny of Bills Committee—to alert the parliament to some of the tremendously restrictive provisions of the broadcasting bills. These provisions clearly take away people's rights—infringe upon their rights—and give some quite unfettered powers to the government. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, quite rightly, is not making a judgement on them, but rightly pointing that out to the parliament. This government is so dysfunctional—or, perhaps, so functional and so clever—that it wants to make sure that the particular Scrutiny of Bills Committee report does not come in until after those two bills are voted upon by the Senate.


How unfortunate is that? Had the government consulted a bit wider, had they taken senators into their confidence, perhaps that could have been pointed out to them. But they rushed forward with these bills—anything to get through these draconian measures, measures that really impact upon freedom of speech—without any concern for the forms and norms of this chamber. 


As I say, I know that this is all about giving a bit of space tomorrow for the leadership challenge, which we all know is coming along, but you could do it in a different way to this and you could allow the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to at least precede these bills. (Time expired)

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:30):  Senator Collins, you are not speaking to this, clearly?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  We want to get to the NDIS!




Senator FIFIELD:
  Mr President, I must start by noting that interjection. The government are so keen to get legislation passed they are seeking to move a motion to guillotine debate. There is a slight inconsistency there.


As I mentioned in the earlier procedural debate, this motion seeks to mire two important issues in grubby partisanship. It seeks to sully the NDIS debate by giving precedence to the government's package of media bills. I would have thought that if there was a piece of legislation that deserved to be considered on its merits—that deserved all the opportunities that this forum provides for discussion and debate—it would be the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Indeed, it has been a matter of some pride for all those around the chamber that the proposition of legislation for a National Disability Insurance Scheme is something that could demonstrate the Australian parliamentary and political system at its very best to the Australian people—where all parties come together to say that there is an issue, a cause, that is bigger than ourselves and the parliament, and that the need to deliver a new deal for Australians with disability is so great.


That has been the experience to date. That was very much the tone and theme in the other place when they were debating the NDIS legislation. There were no restrictions on debate in the other place. There was no effort to curtail examination in the other place. There was no attempt to limit the airing of views of stakeholders in relation to the NDIS in the other place. I have taken some pride in the fact that we in the Australian Senate tend to be a little more respectful of the processes of this parliament, that we tend to defend more vigorously the role of parliamentary committees and the committee stage for bills in this place. But what we see in the motion before us is a pure, simple, naked guillotine.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! This is the precedence motion that is before the chair. I just thought I would draw that to your attention.




Senator FIFIELD:
  This is nothing more than an attempt to give precedence to something that will ultimately give effect to a guillotine that will curtail debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There were 1,600 submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the NDIS legislation—an extraordinary number of submissions. It just goes to show the level of community feeling and the desire for that piece of legislation to be passed. So it has been with a heavy heart and great disappointment that I have seen this afternoon a series of motions, the ultimate objective of which is to facilitate the passage of a motion that would see the guillotining of debate on the NDIS legislation.


The other issue which the various procedural motions today have sought to sully is that of the apology to those who have been forcibly adopted. We had, I thought, reached agreement around the chamber that Thursday's arrangements would be reordered in order to facilitate that apology in the Australian parliament. I thought that agreement had been reached on that. We willingly said that we would do whatever was necessary to arrange tomorrow's program in the Senate to acknowledge the special nature of the day and facilitate the activities that will take place. That was an unexceptional decision by those around this chamber. I thought it had been clear that any motions that the government might seek to move in this place in relation to business today to facilitate their package of media bills would be completely separate from Thursday—that Thursday would be quarantined and respected and that the significance of the apology would be acknowledged in this place by not seeking to drag matters of controversy into tomorrow.


We saw in the motion that Senator Collins circulated earlier today an attempt to combine the rearrangement of business today with the rearrangement of business tomorrow, which was bad enough in itself. But in addition to that, Senator Collins sought to include in the arrangements for Thursday another guillotine and the listing of the package of media bills. That should never have happened. It should never have been contemplated. When that fundamental error was drawn to the attention of the government they reverted to the original motion on the Notice Paper for Thursday—but subsequently proceeded to endeavour to amend that and repeat the errors that were in the motion they circulated today.


You may have some difficulty following that train of events, Mr President, but probably not because you know this place better than almost anyone. For those who may be listening, yes, it sounds confusing, and it is confusing because this government's management of this chamber and their efforts to seek to arrange government business in this place have been nothing but a shambles. It has been completely chaotic over the last day. There is no other way to put it.


We have two issues which should never have been mired in controversy: the National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation and the apology to those who were forcibly adopted. This Senate still has the opportunity to not be complicit in the government's attempts to merge, muddy and sully the handling of the NDIS legislation and the apology on forced adoptions. That is why the coalition have not supported any of the procedural motions in relation to these matters today, and we will not be supporting this motion either. To do so would be to make senators on this side of the chamber complicit in an effort to say to the Australian people that Senator Conroy's package of fundamentally flawed media bills—Senator Conroy's Orwellian legislation—was more important than the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Let me tell you, I do not think Senator Conroy's legislation is more important than the National Disability Insurance Scheme and I do not think that Senator Conroy's legislation is more important than the apology to those were forcibly adopted. I think these motions and the activities of the last 24 to 48 hours in this place tell you everything you need to know about this government. Yes, they pay lip-service to the importance of a National Disability Insurance Scheme and, yes, they pay lip-service to the importance of an apology to those who have been forcibly adopted. But when it comes down to it, what really matters to this government is partisan political advantage, and they will seek to get that however they can. If that means introducing draconian media laws to gag a free press, then they will do that. If it means seeking to gag and guillotine legislation on the NDIS in this place in order to give precedence to Senator Conroy's package of media bills, then they will do that. If it means sullying Thursday, which is meant to be a day dedicated to the issue of an apology to those who have been forcibly adopted, by combining it with consideration of Senator Conroy's deeply controversial package of media bills, then they will do that. That is what this motion is about, that is what the motion before was about and that is what the next motion will be about—naked, partisan political advantage and the pursuit thereof. As I say, if there were any two issues that should have been quarantined, separated and defended from being dragged into that grubby, grubby objective of this government, it would have been the National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation and the apology to those forcibly adopted. That is why we cannot support this motion.


But, as I said earlier today, I do have to hand it to the government in one respect: they are remorselessly consistent. They always default to the restriction of expression, the restriction of freedom, the restriction of debate and the restriction of scrutiny at each and every opportunity. That is what the package of media bills is about. We have all heard of the Public Interest Media Advocate. We all know that that is really a political interest media advocate or, if you want to dress it up a little bit, you can call it a government interest media advocate. That is what that new position is about. That is the fundamental essence of most of the bills in that media package which Senator Conroy is seeking to put forward. We know they always default to seeking to curtail expression, to curtail thought, to curtail a free expression and to curtail legitimate democratic criticisms of a deeply flawed government. 


We know that this government do not like criticism. Who does like criticism? There is not a government that has ever been elected—or a government that has been in office who has not been elected, for that matter—who likes or enjoys criticism. When we had the privilege of being on the other side of this chamber, we did not particularly enjoy the media criticism that we received. But you know what? It kept us on our toes. It helped make us better. It helped ensure that where there were errors and where there were failures, they were exposed, and it helped the government of the day to govern better—much as an opposition providing scrutiny of the government of the day should help them to govern better. I must say, I feel a complete failure on that score because our scrutiny has not helped this government govern better in any way, shape or form. Lord only knows what their governing might have been like if we had not applied the scrutiny that we have. We know that they always default to curtailing and seeking to gag the critics, as is the objective of their package of media bills, the passage of which these procedural motions are ultimately designed to help facilitate.


We all agree with the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but it is very complex legislation. I spent nine days in public hearings with the Community Affairs Legislation Committee looking at the NDIS. I spent a lot of time looking at the legislation, looking at the draft rules, talking to stakeholder groups and reading the submissions that have come in—it is complex legislation. Even when there is an area that you agree upon, you still have a job to try and make sure that the legislation is the best that it can be. That is why we have these processes. It does not matter whether a proposition is one that all parties agree with or one that is the subject of deep controversy, this chamber, this Senate and the committees of the Senate have a job to do to examine all legislation to make sure that it is the best that it can be. The more complex it is, the greater that task and the greater that responsibility is. This is why the parliament as a whole has spent the best part of 3½ months looking at the NDIS legislation. The Community Affairs Legislation Committee spent the best part of 3½ months looking at that legislation.


And yet this government wants to curtail the very important committee stage of consideration of that legislation. There are many, many community groups, people with disabilities, disability organisations and disability advocates who have views that they want ventilated, who have made the effort to put submissions to the community affairs committee and who, at the very least, want some of the questions that they have posed put to the government. They support the legislation—of course they do—but they still have questions in relation to it, and yet this government seeks to deny them the opportunity to do that.


I want to draw a contrast between the level of scrutiny that there has been on the NDIS legislation, which is going to be curtailed, and the media bill package. There have been 3½ months of scrutiny by the community affairs committee into the NDIS legislation. Let me compare that to the scrutiny that there has been on the package of media bills which Senator Birmingham has been so assiduously working on. That package of media bills has had 3½ days of consideration. Just compare that: 3½ months consideration of the NDIS versus 3½ days consideration of the package of media bills. It is bad enough that the guillotine will come down on the consideration of the NDIS legislation, but it is appalling beyond belief that the package of media bills that Senator Conroy would like to see through this parliament has only had 3½ days of consideration.


When you think about it, if a package of legislation which is complex and which has the support of the whole parliament has 3½ months of consideration, how much more consideration should a package of bills, which do not have the support of the whole parliament, are incredibly controversial and do not have the support of a single media outlet or a single card-carrying member of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance—other than Senator Bob Carr, who proudly produced his MEAA card last night; he is the sole member of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance who was actually in favour of Senator Conroy's package of legislation—deserve? But if we need 3½ months to consider a complex but supported piece of legislation in the NDIS, why on earth is this government only allowing 3½ days consideration by the Senate environment and communications committee of Senator Conroy's package of bills? There is only one reason—that is, this government knows that the legislation will not stand scrutiny. This government knows that with every day that passes, more and more Australians recognise Senator Conroy's package of bills for what they are: an attempt to muddle—well, it is a muddle, that is for sure—an attempt to muzzle the free press.


We have a tendency in Australia to take for granted those things that underpin a free and democratic society. We all know what they are. It is the freedom of association, the rule of law, freedom of speech and a free press. This government has systematically set about undermining each and every one of those underpinnings of our free and democratic society, including freedom of association, where they are quite happy for unions to march in at will through the front door of a business. I think people in business should be able to associate with whomever they want. As for freedom of expression, we saw what happened to Mr Bolt when he simply expressed a view in a newspaper on something—he was hauled off to court. And we know now that Senator Conroy is seeking to curtail freedom of the press. When it comes to the rule of law, you only need look at the government's abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission to see what their attitude is to the rule of law. The rule of law does not apply if you are a particular sort of organisation. This government have been remorselessly consistent in their attempts to curtail freedom. They have been remorselessly consistent in their efforts to curtail their critics. As I said, they have always defaulted and always will, because that is the Labor way—to try to shut down their critics.


We cannot support the motion that is before the chair at the moment because we cannot and never will be complicit in anything that seeks to curtail freedom of speech and freedom of expression. That is the ultimate objective of each of these procedural motions—that is, to facilitate, through this parliament, without scrutiny, a package of media bills that will fundamentally undermine one of the underpinnings of our free and democratic society. We cannot do that; we will not do it. As long as we have breath in this place we will speak out against what Senator Conroy is trying to do. We will speak out against what the Prime Minister is attempting to do. I do not care whether she is the Prime Minister or whether she is replaced by someone else, Labor is, at essence, the same. What we really need is a change of government. We are not going to allow them to facilitate this particular measure.

",Senate,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,BUSINESS,17,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-03-20,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:50):  This motion strikes at two very significant principles: firstly, the principle of an effective and democratic and fair parliament and, secondly, the principle of a free and open media to scrutinise the operations of the parliament. This motion strikes very deeply at the heart of both of those things, because this motion undermines the capacity of this parliament to provide appropriate scrutiny to far-reaching legislation going through this place. In doing so, this motion will facilitate the passage of that far-reaching legislation that attacks the principle of a free media and a free press in Australia. For that reason this motion must be opposed, should be opposed and should be defeated so that this chamber can have a proper debate on issues of such significance.


This motion applies, of course, to two areas of very significant legislation—two far-reaching reforms: one of which the opposition, along with the cross-benchers and the government, is deeply and sincerely committed to; and the other of which we are deeply and sincerely opposed to. We are deeply and sincerely committed to seeing the passage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation.


Senator Fifield has led, on behalf of the opposition, a passionate stance of supporting this, of trying to strengthen the reform and of calling for greater detail and greater commitments through the life of this parliament. He has sought every step of the way to try to make this a bipartisan measure on behalf of the coalition. We want this measure to succeed. This is a far-reaching measure of fundamental and profound importance to millions of Australians, the many Australians with a disability and the many more Australians who are related to those with disabilities, carers for those with disabilities and friends of those with disabilities.


Getting this legislation right is fundamental to its future success, and we want the NDIS to be a success. Therefore, we want to get this legislation right and we believe that it deserved complete and thorough scrutiny through this parliament. As Senator Fifield said, it got the scrutiny it deserved in the other place. In the House of Representatives, there was no guillotine to the NDIS legislation; there was open debate. The open debate ensured that there was the right level of scrutiny.


In this place, sadly, the government is now seeking to curtail that debate, and quite unnecessarily so. The government could have very easily proposed extended hours to solely deal with the NDIS. I am confident that in the spirit of bipartisanship and spirit of cooperation the opposition has to this policy issue those extended hours would have been granted. We would have been willing to sit for as long as it took this week to deal with the NDIS and to deal with the sensible amendments related to it. However, the government, because it also wants to get its media reforms through and wants to exact its revenge on those who have dared to criticise it, has had to apply a guillotine not just to those controversial media reforms but to the very sincere and important reforms related to the NDIS.


That is a shame because it undermines the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship that should surround those reforms. It is to the credit of the opposition and Senator Fifield in particular that we have been so willing to work with the government on this important issue—difficult at times though it can be—and to the shame of the government that they are wrapping up the NDIS in a guillotine motion in this controversial procedure at this time.


As I said, their motives for doing so are clear. It is not to do with the NDIS, in fairness to the government; it is to do, of course, with the media law reforms. Reforms that are the most far-reaching in terms of their impact on the operation of media in this country. When it comes to the hours of sitting for this Senate and when it comes to ensuring we have proper scrutiny of legislation in this place, we should expect that to be adhered to.


I am not the first person to stand in this place and criticise a procedural motion like this that tries to vary the hours and vary the arrangements and in doing so tries to ram legislation through this place. I am far from the first person to do so. Senator Wong, now the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, back in 2005 said:


We are asking for something very simple: that complex, controversial legislation that has far-reaching implications for millions of Australians be properly scrutinised by this chamber through a Senate committee process before it is voted on. 


Let us look very closely at what Senator Wong was asking for there: that complex, controversial legislation that has far-reaching implications for millions of Australians be properly scrutinised. Both of the legislative packages that are before the chamber fit into that realm. The NDIS may have far-reaching support but it is complex—it is complex for sure. The media reform legislation, equally, has far-reaching effect across all Australians. It is complex and it is most certainly controversial as well.


Senator Wong was right in 2005. She was correct in saying that such legislation deserved proper scrutiny then, and it deserves proper scrutiny today as we debate this. When this chamber divides shortly, I hope that Senator Wong and her Labor colleagues will reflect on the words that she said in 2005 and remember that they were asking, as she said, for something very simple: that complex, controversial legislation that has far-reaching implications for millions of Australians be properly scrutinised.


Equally, in 2006 the now Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Conroy, who of course is the proponent of these media reforms—or at least was the proponent of these media reforms until the Prime Minister pulled the rug out from under his feet and subsumed all negotiations with the cross-benchers in the other place, said:


You do not just need to be here in this chamber to realise how arrogant and out of touch this government has become with the ramming through of legislation, ridiculously tight deadlines for legislation, changing the sitting pattern all the time and using the guillotine. It is turning this chamber, which for 30 or 40 years has been a chamber of accountability and scrutiny, into a farce.


Senator Conroy is of course now the leader of the government in this place. Prior to that, he was the deputy leader of the government in this place. 




Senator Fifield:
  It is hard to believe.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
 It is very hard to believe, Senator Fifield, and I think many on the other side find it equally hard to believe that Senator Conroy is their leader.




Senator Fifield:
  But not for long.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Possibly not. That could be the case across the parliament. Senator Conroy prior to being a cabinet minister, prior to being one of the leaders of the government in this place, had a very sanctimonious stance it seems. He was more than happy to criticise the previous government. He was more than happy to criticise the changing of the sitting pattern, the ridiculously tight deadlines for legislation, the ramming through of legislation and the use of the guillotine—all things that this government and Senator Conroy are guilty of time and time again. In fact, this government has used the guillotine on many more occasions than the previous government ever did. On some 158 occasions to date this government has applied the guillotine to separate pieces of legislation. If this motion is successful, another seven will be added to that list, bringing the total number of bills that have been guillotined through this place to 165. Senator Conroy should equally think long and hard when he comes to vote on this as to how hypocritical his stance is compared with what he previously uttered.


The crossbenchers are not innocent in this place either. Senator Milne previously said:


The Australian people deserve a house of review. A house of review means appropriate scrutiny of legislation and appropriate scrutiny of governments.


It does indeed. Senator Milne was correct. The Greens, who have supported this process to date, should when the division comes think long and hard again about Senator Milne's words. Do the Greens genuinely support a house of review that provides appropriate scrutiny of legislation and appropriate scrutiny of government? If they do, they would not support this motion. They would not support this motion because it most definitely does not provide for appropriate scrutiny of legislation in this place.


This motion will see, as I said, two very significant areas of reform undertaken. Debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013 will be concluded in the next couple of hours if this motion is successful. Despite the number of amendments that are outstanding and despite the cooperative nature of the debate to date, the NDIS reforms will be rammed through. They are far-reaching reforms that will have—hopefully—positive, profound impacts on the lives of so many Australians. The government is curtailing proper consideration. We need to make sure we maximise the long-term benefits of those reforms.


With the media reform package, the government proposes to deal with two of the bills tonight and four of the bills tomorrow. Again, there will be just a few hours of consideration for each of those packages. There will be a few hours for changes to our media landscape that are quite profound. Perhaps it would be acceptable to have curtailed debate on these matters had there been proper, thorough debate through the Senate committee process beforehand. But it has been far from it. The Senate committee sat for two days this week. The bills were released only last Thursday and witnesses had no time whatsoever to provide submissions to that process. Perhaps it would be appropriate for this place to curtail debate as proposed in this motion had there been proper consideration through the Senate committee, but that has not been possible under the terms stipulated by this government.


Perhaps it would be possible to curtail debate to some extent had there been proper consideration of these bills in the other place, but no, in the other place the bills have been brought on and taken off by the government—they have mostly been off; they have been sitting off the table without any debate while negotiations were happening behind closed doors. Mr Wilkie has confirmed that Senator Conroy has been shut out of those negotiations. Amazingly, the lead minister has also been absent during this debate about whether his laws get debated in this chamber. The Leader of the Government in the Senate is missing in action once again. Perhaps it would be acceptable to see some element of curtailed debate in this place if there were thorough scrutiny in the other place, but that most certainly will not be the case. If the Senate is to debate these bills as proposed in the motion before us, then the other place will have a maximum of only a few hours to finalise consideration of the legislation as no doubt it will be pushed through under guillotine in that chamber as well.


Perhaps it would even be acceptable to see some degree of curtailed debate on these bills on these far-reaching media reforms had there been proper public debate surrounding them, but they were released for the public to see only last Thursday. Last Thursday was the first time anybody saw the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (News Media Diversity) Bill 2013. Last Thursday was the first time anybody saw the News Media (Self-regulation) Bill 2013—that is a rather ironically titled bill. Last Thursday was the first time anybody saw the News Media (Self-regulation) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. Last Thursday was the first time anybody saw the Public Interest Media Advocate Bill 2013. So, if this motion is successful, in the space of a week the government will have expected the public to have had proper debate around these proposed far-reaching media reforms and their restrictions on the operation of free media in Australia, in the space of a week the government will have expected the parliamentary committee processes of the House of Representatives and the joint committees, like the human rights standing committee that handed down a most interesting and damning report on these reforms, to have considered the legislation. The government believes that a week is sufficient time for the House of Representatives to consider these bills and that a week is sufficient time for the Senate to consider these bills.


I know that Senator Ludlam, who is sitting over there, has a different view from mine on media regulation. However, I also know that Senator Ludlam believes in proper public policy processes, and I would urge Senator Ludlam to exercise whatever influence he can on his colleagues in the Australian Greens to make sure that they stand up for proper public policy-making processes, oppose this motion before the Senate and support the proper scrutiny of these far-reaching media reforms.


Not only has there been no case made in any adequate terms as to why these reforms are necessary or how these reforms would work but there most certainly has been no case made as to why there is such urgency surrounding these reforms—why it is that this parliament must finalise them by 9 pm tomorrow night. Why must this parliament finalise these reforms by 9 pm tomorrow night? No member of the government stood up and said why it is so necessary or why it is so urgent. Senator Conroy, the responsible minister and the leader of the government in this place, has not been seen for hours. He has not been seen in this chamber. He has not been seen, according to Mr Wilkie, in the negotiations around his legislation. It seems as if the government has gone and hidden Senator Conroy in a corner somewhere.




Senator Fifield:
  Good plan!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  A very good plan, Senator Fifield. I understand their embarrassment. I understand why they are embarrassed that he is part of their leadership team. I understand why they are embarrassed that he has put them in this position, where they have been subjected to ridicule and criticism over the abhorrent handling of this legislation and where even Mr Wilkie, the Independent member for Denison, has described the process as 'shambolic', 'too rushed' and 'half-baked'. They are words that perhaps the crossbenchers might reflect on. They are not my words as to the process being applied; they are the words of a fellow crossbencher and Independent member in this parliament, the member for Denison, who describes the process applied to these media reforms as 'shambolic', 'too rushed' and 'half-baked'.


Pass this motion and you will only add to it. Pass this motion and we will see a bad process get worse. Pass this motion and we will see bad laws pushed through this parliament. Pass this motion and we will see a further eroding of the proper principles when it comes to handling of parliamentary standards and media laws. That is why this motion should be defeated, and I urge the chamber to do so.

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Thank you, Senator Birmingham. Before I call Senator Macdonald—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, Xenophon.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just a moment. I am going to remind honourable senators that the motion before the chair is:


That a motion to vary the hours of meeting and routine of business for Wednesday 20 March 2013 and Thursday 21 March 2013 may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business today until determined.


I would ask those contributing to the debate to be as relevant to that motion as possible, within the high degree of latitude which is typically granted to others. I did see Senator Macdonald on his feet.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Senator Xenophon was too.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald was on his feet first.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Senator Xenophon was on his feet as well.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:10):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am conscious Senator Xenophon wants to speak.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Xenophon was on his feet. You may not have seen him at the time. I have made that point to you. We have already had two speakers from the other side of the chamber. It is quite out of order not to allow Senator Xenophon to make his contribution at this stage.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: Senator Macdonald was on his feet first. I do understand the convention of moving the speakers around the chamber. However, I think there is only so long a senator should be expected to stand on their feet before they are recognised and given the call. A senator cannot stand on their feet indefinitely waiting for another senator to get to their feet. But there should be the opportunity for all senators to contribute. Senator Xenophon and Senator Macdonald should both have the opportunity to contribute. The only way that will not occur is if the government moves a gag motion.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Let me just give you the benefit of the advice that I have received. It was very clear to me that Senator Macdonald was on his feet well before Senator Xenophon, but I have been advised by the Clerk that it is reasonable to expect proportionality in contribution to debate. Given those circumstances, I will call Senator Xenophon.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:12):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I am grateful for your ruling but I am also conscious that Senator Macdonald wants to make a contribution. My contribution will be for less than two minutes; it may even be for only a minute. Can I indicate that I will oppose the government's position. I think that this is really diminishing the role of the Senate as a house of review. This is not the way that parliament is supposed to run. I am concerned that with the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a very important piece of legislation, we have just over an hour to determine 15 series of amendments—substantial amendments that go to the heart of the integrity of the scheme in terms of people's rights to appeal. We also have the media laws, which will be rushed through, with significant impacts on the media in this country, issues of freedom of speech and a whole range of other issues. The Senate is meant to be a house of review. The parliament is meant to do its job properly. The founding fathers of the Constitution determined that this Senate was about reviewing legislation in an appropriate and proper manner, and we are not doing it by this motion. So I cannot support this in good conscience. Finally, I say that, if I am fortunate enough to be in this place next year and if there is a change of government, I will hold any new government to the same standards that I am now applying in relation to debates not being curtailed or gagged.

That the question be now put.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. You were not there, so you did not see what happened, but it was clearly understood that I stood first by an appropriate ruling by the Acting Deputy President. Senator Xenophon was given the call, but it was quite clear that I was the next one on my feet, as I was just then. I ask that you recognise me before you recognise—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins has moved a procedural motion. I am required to put that without debate.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I am raising the point of order that you should have recognised me in preference to her.



The PRESIDENT:  And I am saying there is no point of order at this stage. I am required to put the procedural motion without debate.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, you were not even here to see what happened previously.



The PRESIDENT:  I am now in the chair. I am dealing with the matters as they arise in the chamber.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Yes, but there was an order of speaking. I was called but, through an appropriate decision, Senator Xenophon was called, and then— 



The PRESIDENT:  There is no order of speaking in this debate.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  you had a choice of selecting either me or Senator Collins. You clearly looked only at Senator Collins, but I tell you I was on my feet before her and ask that you might recognise the first person on their feet, not the second person.



The PRESIDENT:  I have a procedural motion before me, and the question is that the question be put. I put the question.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Collins did verbal me. I rose when the matter was before the previous occupant of the chair.



The PRESIDENT:  If you have been verballed, I ask Senator Collins to withdraw.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I withdraw.



The PRESIDENT:  The verballing has been withdrawn if that is the way you took it.




Senator Fifield:
  Thank you; but, on a point of order—



The PRESIDENT:  I thought that was the point of order.




Senator Fifield:
  I have another point of order.

Senator Fifield:
  It is a point of order in relation to the procedural motion currently before you. If I cannot do it now then it is not relevant to do it afterward, so now is the appropriate opportunity for me.



The PRESIDENT:  All right. The question that I have to put—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The order of business is that I must put the motion that the question be put. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Collins be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that the motion to vary the hours of meeting be given precedence over other business today. That is the shorthand version.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, with respect, I thought we just voted on that.



The PRESIDENT:  No, what we have just dealt with was that the motion be put. We are now voting on the question that the motion to vary the hours of meeting and routine of business for Wednesday, 20 March 2013 and Thursday, 21 March 2013 may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business today until determined.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:28):  I seek leave to table and consider the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report now, with myself, Senator Edwards, who is a member of the committee, and Senator Fifield—should I not be able to finish my 10 minutes—having up to 15 minutes to talk on the consideration of the report. By way of explanation, I indicate that I was going to move an amendment to the substantive motion to provide for that. It was agreed, I thought, by the government for me, instead of moving the amendment, to be given leave to do that.



The PRESIDENT:  If you are seeking leave that is not in my hands, as you know. I will ask if leave is granted. Is leave granted?

  The request for leave in the terms described by Senator Macdonald leaves us in a situation where the Senate will not be able to consider the motion proper as has been circulated. I would suggest that leave be granted for Senator Macdonald to speak for five minutes.

The leave that Senator Macdonald is requesting we are happy to provide after the Senate has determined the motion.



The PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted for one minute? Leave is granted. Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Why am I surprised? My alternative is to move an amendment to the motion that the minister is about to or has moved. To facilitate her and at her request, I agreed not to move the amendment because she would give me leave to table and speak to this report for up to 15 minutes.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Afterwards.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  She is saying after that, but she told me earlier that if this goes after 6.15 then I will not get the leave. So it is the ultimate doublecross. So I will refuse her offer and move my amendment and I hope that the Greens would support me in allowing the scrutiny of bills issue to be put in place in front of both the disability and the media bills.



The PRESIDENT:  You are entitled to move an amendment. We need the motion in writing and if you could give us that, that would assist.

  Is it now appropriate for me to move—



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, you are in order.

 (South Australia) (17:55):  Thank you. I am acutely aware that we have less than 20 minutes before these bills will be voted on; therefore, I intend to—with the indulgence of my colleagues—as quickly as possible set out all the amendments I will be moving, because I think it is important to have them on the public record. They are amendments (2) to (6) on sheet 7362:


(2) Clause 100, page 84 (line 19), at the end of subclause (1), add:


   ; and (c) explaining the reasons for the reviewable decision.


(3) Page 86 (after line 17), at the end of Part 6 of Chapter 4, add:




103A


Costs



(1) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal can make a costs order providing that the CEO or Agency must pay the costs of a person who makes an application for a review of a decision.


(2) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal must not make a costs order providing that a person who makes an application for review of a decision is required to pay the CEO's or Agency's costs, unless in the opinion of the Tribunal the person is acting in a manner that is vexatious or an abuse of process of the Tribunal.


(4) Page 86 (after line 17), at the end of Part 6 of Chapter 4, add:




103B


Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 



      For the avoidance of doubt, if the CEO makes a decision under this Act, the decision is taken to be a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment.


(5) Page 86 (after line 17), at the end of Part 6 of Chapter 4, add:




103C


CEO to ensure appropriate means of communication



      The CEO must ensure that the Agency institutes a process to ensure that communications with participants in the National Disability Insurance Scheme are undertaken so as to allow the participants to deal with the Agency in the most effective way possible.


Note: For example, providing written communications to a person who is vision impaired does not allow that person to effectively communicate with the Agency. In this case, the Agency may determine that it is appropriate to directly speak with the person and to send them the written communication in braille form.


(6) Clauses 104 to 105B, page 87 (line 5) to page 90 (line 26), omit the clauses, substitute:




   104


Compensation



      Where:


   (a) compensation is paid or payable to a person (the injured party), otherwise than under a scheme of compensation under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law; and


   (b) the injured party has received, or is entitled to, damages from another person (the wrongdoer) in pursuance of rights arising from the same trauma as gave rise to the rights to compensation; and


   (c) the person to whom the compensation is paid or payable (the claimant) is entitled to recover the amount of the compensation; and


   (d) the person has taken no action to claim or obtain compensation,


then the following provisions apply:


   (e) the CEO is entitled to recover the amount of compensation paid or payable from the wrongdoer or the injured party, but subject to the following qualifications:


      (i) no amount may be recovered from the wrongdoer in excess of the wrongdoer's unsatisfied liability to the injured party; and


      (ii) no amount may be recovered from the injured party in excess of the amount of the damages received by the injured party; and


      (iii) in a case involving contributory negligence, the amount to be recovered from the wrongdoer by the claimant under this subsection must be adjusted to the extent that is just and equitable having regard to the extent to which the wrongdoer establishes that the contributory negligence contributed to the occurrence of the relevant injury; and


   (f) the claimant shall, on giving notice to a wrongdoer of an entitlement to recover compensation under this section, have a first charge, to the extent of the entitlement, on damages payable by the wrongdoer to the injured party; and


   (g) any amount recovered by the claimant against a wrongdoer under this subsection shall be deemed to be an amount paid in or towards satisfaction of the wrongdoer's liability to the injured party; and


   (h) an action for the recovery of compensation may be heard in a Court of competent jurisdiction.


I want to make it clear that amendment (1) on sheet 7362, which I moved earlier today, amends the general principles of the act, to provide that people with a disability have the right to access support from independent advocates. This will ensure that people with a disability are able to access independent advice and support when dealing with NDIS processes. 


Amendment (2) on sheet 7362 is parallel to amendment (1); it will insert a provision into section 100, which deals with reviewable decisions. This provision will require the CEO or delegate to provide reasons the decision is considered reviewable. This will ensure that people affected by these decisions will have adequate information to build their case effectively. 


Amendment (3) introduces provisions relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the awarding of costs. Under this item the AAT may not order an individual bringing a complaint to cover the CEO's or agency's costs unless the complaint is considered vexatious or an abuse of process. However, the AAT may order the CEO or agency to cover an individual's costs.


Amendment (4) inserts provision to clarify that the decision made under this act by the CEO is taken to be of an administrative character made under an enactment for the purpose of judicial review. 


Amendment (5) provides that the CEO must ensure that processes are in place to establish appropriate means of communication which take into account a person's disability—for example, in the case of a person who is vision impaired the CEO may decide to issue communications verbally as well as in an appropriate written form such as braille. This will ensure that all participants in the scheme have equal access to important information about their claims.


Amendment (6) revises the compensation claim section of the act. This new section seeks to address concerns that the provisions in these sections remove choice for the people concerned and rely too much on compulsion. This section is consistent with similar provisions in other state, territory and Commonwealth acts. It still allows a CEO to make a claim on an individual's behalf or to take over a claim, but it includes specific safeguards to ensure the individual has the initial benefit. It also removes the consequences of an individual not taking action required by the CEO, which under the bill as it stands results in payments being suspended. This is a blatantly unfair action and removes an individual's choice to an unacceptable extent. 


The question I pose to the government—and I appreciate that we are so limited for time—is that they make an undertaking to at least provide me with responses in writing or to table responses in relation to the matters I have raised, the amendments I have raised. 


On the issue of amendment (6), there is a fundamental flaw in what is being proposed. Why won't the government do what other states are doing? For instance, in South Australia, section 54(7) of the workers compensation legislation makes it very clear; that act has a right of subrogation which is much fairer and consistent with other states and actually gives an individual real rights. 


I support the intent of the bill wholeheartedly, but there are some fundamental flaws in the structure and the architecture of this bill, particularly in the area of the rights of individuals challenging decisions.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:59):  Briefly, I will try and address all of the questions you have raised, Senator Xenophon. It is unfortunate that we have missed up to nearly two hours. 


In terms of your advocacy question, I can advise that all external merits review applicants are entitled to a support person. This could be a friend or a family member. It could be an independent advocate funded through the Commonwealth National Disability Advocacy Program.


With respect to your second amendment, the government does not support that amendment essentially because it is important for the agency to explain the reasons for its decisions where this is needed. This is already provided for by the AAT Act and the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act which will operate to give NDIS participants the right to seek written reasons in relation to reviewable decisions. The amendment that you propose would go beyond the ADJR and AAT acts by requiring the CEO to include the notice in every reviewable decision the reasons for that decision. There is a risk that this would place an unreasonable and unnecessary administrative burden on the CEO in the agency and not greatly advance the interests of people with disability. 


The CEO and their delegates will of course make thousands of decisions, many of which—in fact I suggest most of which—could reasonably be anticipated to be totally uncontentious. Putting in that provision means that every time that the CEO makes a decision, there has to be a set of reasons given. 


With respect to your third amendment, in brief, I can say the AAT typically does not award costs. It is empowered to do so only in relation to specific areas so, as a general rule, the AAT does not award costs. 


Your fourth amendment goes to the review of decisions, and the advice that I have received is that the provision does not have practical legal effect and is unnecessary. It would duplicate the work already done under the ADJR act which defines the categories of decisions to which judicial review applies. It is good legislative practice not to duplicate provisions in the law as I am sure you understand better than most. It clutters and confuses Commonwealth statutes. 


With respect to amendment (5), I am advised this provision is already covered in clause 4 and is unnecessary. We are working with people with disability. We will ensure that communications with them are given in the right form. 


Finally, your final question to get a formal response: as we discussed earlier privately, I am quite happy to provide a written response to the questions that you raise. Thank you for your engagement with this part of the bill, and I look forward to continuing our discussions.

 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:03):  I want to make some brief remarks, because I just could not let some of the parliamentary secretary's comments go unremarked in relation to the alleged loss of time in relation to this bill. 


If we were following the red without having had a motion to change the order of business and to introduce a guillotine, in the ordinary course of events today we would be coming back to this legislation about now. So any allegation that the procedural motions earlier today were diminishing time for debate are quite incorrect. If the red was being followed as per usual, we would come to this legislation about now. The opportunity should not be denied to colleagues to express their displeasure at a motion that sought to guillotine this debate and other debate.

If you could share some of that information that you are sharing with Senator Xenophon, specifically around the South Australian amendment, that would be appreciated.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:05):  I will be very brief because of the time constraints. Senator Fifield says that this is not set in stone. But the fact is that this is fundamentally flawed, particularly in relation to clauses 104 to 105(b). The way they have gone about the subrogation, in terms of a third party's rights to compensation, is completely at odds with what other states have done. South Australia is just one example that I am well familiar with, with section 54(7) of their act. It really does constrain an individual's rights in a way that it seems to be heavy-handed and unusually onerous. I appreciate that Senator McLucas on behalf of the government will provide a response on this, but I just want to put it on the record that we will have to revisit this, because there will be case after case after case of inequitable outcomes. I am just trying to remedy this right now rather than later.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:07):  Let me be clear that I do not think that the legislation is perfect. I think it comes back to the rationale that the coalition has had for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the design and implementation of the scheme. It would have been good if such a committee had been set up quite some time ago. The opposition would have been very happy to work through a number of these design issues carefully. All I can say is that I think the need is still there for this committee to examine some of the sorts of issues that are being raised by colleagues, including Senator Xenophon. It would have been a good thing if that committee were already in place.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:08):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 7356 together:


 (2) Clause 22, page 25 (lines 20 to 26), omit subclause (1), substitute:


(1) A person meets the age requirements if the National Disability Insurance Scheme rules for the purposes of this paragraph prescribe that on a prescribed date or a date in a prescribed period the person must be a prescribed age and the person is that age on that date.


(3) Clause 22, page 25 (line 27), omit ""paragraph (1)(b)"", substitute ""subsection (1)"".


These amendments relate to the age requirement. We heard a lot of evidence during the committee inquiry around concerns about what happens to people over the age of 65 who acquire a disability. They are not included in the NDIS and they are supposed to be supported through the aged-care system. We heard a lot of witnesses expressing very strong concern that that particular group will not get the same support as they would through an NDIS.


I did go over this issue in my speech in the second reading debate, and I know that we are short of time, but I particularly want to point out that one of the groups that a number of us have a heard a lot from is the post-polio group—a group I am very concerned about—and I know they are very concerned about this.


In case we do not have time to get to it, if this amendment goes down, I have a second amendment that does not remove the age 65 cut-off but does seek to specifically reference those people suffering from post-polio symptoms. I know that is not ideal, naming a particular disability in the legislation, but it is potentially a large group of people. On this issue I would like to ask the government to outline whether they have considered it. It is an issue that was raised in the Senate Community Affairs Committee report, and specifically the committee asked the government to monitor it. I ask why they particularly put this in place and I also ask whether they are picking up on the recommendations of the community affairs committee about monitoring the impact that this will have on those aged over 65 and, in particular, that cohort of people who may have disabilities related to post-polio syndrome that are not currently being covered—in other words, will not be grandfathered—under this particular scheme.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (18:11):  Unfortunately we are not able to agree to Senator Siewert's amendments. The first question Senator Siewert asked is whether we considered this. Absolutely. This has been a considerable issue, but Senator Siewert will also note that the Productivity Commission made a very clear recommendation that the entry to the NDIS be prior to a person reaching age 65. There are, and the committee heard this as well, definitional issues that we have to deal with that go to non-age related matters. It is not a cut-and-dried question.


It is important to note also that in the launch phase of the scheme it is necessary to have a rule making power to limit the universality of the NDIS to reflect the agreement with some states and territories to provide the launch to age cohorts in the first phase. Given the time, in terms of the particular concerns around people who have had polio and post-polio effects, that amendment runs counter to the principle of the NDIS that we hold very dear, and that is that this is based on functionality and not diagnosis. I am quite aware that we do need to work very closely with people who have had polio. Their circumstances can be quite different, as can other degenerative diseases that I think we have addressed as well. 


In terms of the monitoring of this, of course the government will continue to monitor the whole of the NDIS rollout, but instead of tasking the agency with a specific task it will be the responsibility of the government to continue to monitor the effectiveness—and of course we are doing the two-year review of the NDIS in its totality.

 (South Australia) (17:55):  Thank you. I am acutely aware that we have less than 20 minutes before these bills will be voted on; therefore, I intend to—with the indulgence of my colleagues—as quickly as possible set out all the amendments I will be moving, because I think it is important to have them on the public record.

Compensation



      Where:


   (a) compensation is paid or payable to a person (the injured party), otherwise than under a scheme of compensation under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law; and


   (b) the injured party has received, or is entitled to, damages from another person (the wrongdoer) in pursuance of rights arising from the same trauma as gave rise to the rights to compensation; and


   (c) the person to whom the compensation is paid or payable (the claimant) is entitled to recover the amount of the compensation; and


   (d) the person has taken no action to claim or obtain compensation,


then the following provisions apply:


   (e) the CEO is entitled to recover the amount of compensation paid or payable from the wrongdoer or the injured party, but subject to the following qualifications:


      (i) no amount may be recovered from the wrongdoer in excess of the wrongdoer's unsatisfied liability to the injured party; and


      (ii) no amount may be recovered from the injured party in excess of the amount of the damages received by the injured party; and

   (h) an action for the recovery of compensation may be heard in a Court of competent jurisdiction.


I want to make it clear that amendment (1) on sheet 7362, which I moved earlier today, amends the general principles of the act, to provide that people with a disability have the right to access support from independent advocates. This will ensure that people with a disability are able to access independent advice and support when dealing with NDIS processes. 


Amendment (2) on sheet 7362 is parallel to amendment (1); it will insert a provision into section 100, which deals with reviewable decisions. This provision will require the CEO or delegate to provide reasons the decision is considered reviewable. This will ensure that people affected by these decisions will have adequate information to build their case effectively. 


Amendment (3) introduces provisions relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the awarding of costs. Under this item the AAT may not order an individual bringing a complaint to cover the CEO's or agency's costs unless the complaint is considered vexatious or an abuse of process. However, the AAT may order the CEO or agency to cover an individual's costs.


Amendment (4) inserts provision to clarify that the decision made under this act by the CEO is taken to be of an administrative character made under an enactment for the purpose of judicial review. 


Amendment (5) provides that the CEO must ensure that processes are in place to establish appropriate means of communication which take into account a person's disability—for example, in the case of a person who is vision impaired the CEO may decide to issue communications verbally as well as in an appropriate written form such as braille. This will ensure that all participants in the scheme have equal access to important information about their claims.


Amendment (6) revises the compensation claim section of the act. This new section seeks to address concerns that the provisions in these sections remove choice for the people concerned and rely too much on compulsion. This section is consistent with similar provisions in other state, territory and Commonwealth acts. It still allows a CEO to make a claim on an individual's behalf or to take over a claim, but it includes specific safeguards to ensure the individual has the initial benefit. It also removes the consequences of an individual not taking action required by the CEO, which under the bill as it stands results in payments being suspended. This is a blatantly unfair action and removes an individual's choice to an unacceptable extent. 


The question I pose to the government—and I appreciate that we are so limited for time—is that they make an undertaking to at least provide me with responses in writing or to table responses in relation to the matters I have raised, the amendments I have raised. 


On the issue of amendment (6), there is a fundamental flaw in what is being proposed. Why won't the government do what other states are doing? For instance, in South Australia, section 54(7) of the workers compensation legislation makes it very clear; that act has a right of subrogation which is much fairer and consistent with other states and actually gives an individual real rights. 


I support the intent of the bill wholeheartedly, but there are some fundamental flaws in the structure and the architecture of this bill, particularly in the area of the rights of individuals challenging decisions.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:59):  Briefly, I will try and address all of the questions you have raised, Senator Xenophon. It is unfortunate that we have missed up to nearly two hours. 


In terms of your advocacy question, I can advise that all external merits review applicants are entitled to a support person. This could be a friend or a family member. It could be an independent advocate funded through the Commonwealth National Disability Advocacy Program.


With respect to your second amendment, the government does not support that amendment essentially because it is important for the agency to explain the reasons for its decisions where this is needed. This is already provided for by the AAT Act and the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act which will operate to give NDIS participants the right to seek written reasons in relation to reviewable decisions. The amendment that you propose would go beyond the ADJR and AAT acts by requiring the CEO to include the notice in every reviewable decision the reasons for that decision. There is a risk that this would place an unreasonable and unnecessary administrative burden on the CEO in the agency and not greatly advance the interests of people with disability. 


The CEO and their delegates will of course make thousands of decisions, many of which—in fact I suggest most of which—could reasonably be anticipated to be totally uncontentious. Putting in that provision means that every time that the CEO makes a decision, there has to be a set of reasons given. 


With respect to your third amendment, in brief, I can say the AAT typically does not award costs. It is empowered to do so only in relation to specific areas so, as a general rule, the AAT does not award costs. 


Your fourth amendment goes to the review of decisions, and the advice that I have received is that the provision does not have practical legal effect and is unnecessary. It would duplicate the work already done under the ADJR act which defines the categories of decisions to which judicial review applies. It is good legislative practice not to duplicate provisions in the law as I am sure you understand better than most. It clutters and confuses Commonwealth statutes. 


With respect to amendment (5), I am advised this provision is already covered in clause 4 and is unnecessary. We are working with people with disability. We will ensure that communications with them are given in the right form. 


Finally, your final question to get a formal response: as we discussed earlier privately, I am quite happy to provide a written response to the questions that you raise. Thank you for your engagement with this part of the bill, and I look forward to continuing our discussions.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:03):  I want to make some brief remarks, because I just could not let some of the parliamentary secretary's comments go unremarked in relation to the alleged loss of time in relation to this bill. 


If we were following the red without having had a motion to change the order of business and to introduce a guillotine, in the ordinary course of events today we would be coming back to this legislation about now. So any allegation that the procedural motions earlier today were diminishing time for debate are quite incorrect. If the red was being followed as per usual, we would come to this legislation about now. The opportunity should not be denied to colleagues to express their displeasure at a motion that sought to guillotine this debate and other debate. I do not want to say any more than that on this matter but I just thought that had to be on the record.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:04):  I will just express the Greens will not be supporting these amendments. We have sympathy with the government's position on a number of these. In particular on advocacy, we have already passed amendments on that issue. I have been satisfied with the government's responses on compensation. If you could share some of that information that you are sharing with Senator Xenophon, specifically around the South Australian amendment, that would be appreciated. On the communication one, again, I agree that that issue is already covered in the clauses, so we will not be supporting them although I understand the intent.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:04):  Likewise, the opposition is satisfied with the amendment that the government moved in relation to the advocacy issue. We do understand the concerns that Senator Xenophon has expressed in relation to the compensation issue. The government has gone some way to addressing those, but I think most of us in this discussion recognise that the legislation that will be passed today is not an end point, that it is not set in stone, and that a number of these issues will be revisited.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:05):  I will be very brief because of the time constraints. Senator Fifield says that this is not set in stone. But the fact is that this is fundamentally flawed, particularly in relation to clauses 104 to 105(b). The way they have gone about the subrogation, in terms of a third party's rights to compensation, is completely at odds with what other states have done. South Australia is just one example that I am well familiar with, with section 54(7) of their act. It really does constrain an individual's rights in a way that it seems to be heavy-handed and unusually onerous. I appreciate that Senator McLucas on behalf of the government will provide a response on this, but I just want to put it on the record that we will have to revisit this, because there will be case after case after case of inequitable outcomes. I am just trying to remedy this right now rather than later.

We would not be putting up a piece of legislation that we were of the view had the flaws that you think are there. I will write to you to assure you that this legislation mimics other state-based legislation but also some Commonwealth legislation in the way that this element is treated. But please be assured that we are quite confident that this will not result in what you are expecting.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:07):  Let me be clear that I do not think that the legislation is perfect. I think it comes back to the rationale that the coalition has had for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the design and implementation of the scheme. It would have been good if such a committee had been set up quite some time ago. The opposition would have been very happy to work through a number of these design issues carefully. All I can say is that I think the need is still there for this committee to examine some of the sorts of issues that are being raised by colleagues, including Senator Xenophon. It would have been a good thing if that committee were already in place.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-03-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:08):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 7356 together:


 (2) Clause 22, page 25 (lines 20 to 26), omit subclause (1), substitute:


(1) A person meets the age requirements if the National Disability Insurance Scheme rules for the purposes of this paragraph prescribe that on a prescribed date or a date in a prescribed period the person must be a prescribed age and the person is that age on that date.


(3) Clause 22, page 25 (line 27), omit ""paragraph (1)(b)"", substitute ""subsection (1)"".


These amendments relate to the age requirement. We heard a lot of evidence during the committee inquiry around concerns about what happens to people over the age of 65 who acquire a disability. They are not included in the NDIS and they are supposed to be supported through the aged-care system. We heard a lot of witnesses expressing very strong concern that that particular group will not get the same support as they would through an NDIS.


I did go over this issue in my speech in the second reading debate, and I know that we are short of time, but I particularly want to point out that one of the groups that a number of us have a heard a lot from is the post-polio group—a group I am very concerned about—and I know they are very concerned about this.


In case we do not have time to get to it, if this amendment goes down, I have a second amendment that does not remove the age 65 cut-off but does seek to specifically reference those people suffering from post-polio symptoms. I know that is not ideal, naming a particular disability in the legislation, but it is potentially a large group of people. On this issue I would like to ask the government to outline whether they have considered it. It is an issue that was raised in the Senate Community Affairs Committee report, and specifically the committee asked the government to monitor it. I ask why they particularly put this in place and I also ask whether they are picking up on the recommendations of the community affairs committee about monitoring the impact that this will have on those aged over 65 and, in particular, that cohort of people who may have disabilities related to post-polio syndrome that are not currently being covered—in other words, will not be grandfathered—under this particular scheme. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,19,2,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-03-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (18:11):  Unfortunately we are not able to agree to Senator Siewert's amendments. The first question Senator Siewert asked is whether we considered this. Absolutely. This has been a considerable issue, but Senator Siewert will also note that the Productivity Commission made a very clear recommendation that the entry to the NDIS be prior to a person reaching age 65. There are, and the committee heard this as well, definitional issues that we have to deal with that go to non-age related matters. It is not a cut-and-dried question.


It is important to note also that in the launch phase of the scheme it is necessary to have a rule making power to limit the universality of the NDIS to reflect the agreement with some states and territories to provide the launch to age cohorts in the first phase. Given the time, in terms of the particular concerns around people who have had polio and post-polio effects, that amendment runs counter to the principle of the NDIS that we hold very dear, and that is that this is based on functionality and not diagnosis. I am quite aware that we do need to work very closely with people who have had polio. Their circumstances can be quite different, as can other degenerative diseases that I think we have addressed as well. 


In terms of the monitoring of this, of course the government will continue to monitor the whole of the NDIS rollout, but instead of tasking the agency with a specific task it will be the responsibility of the government to continue to monitor the effectiveness—and of course we are doing the two-year review of the NDIS in its totality.

(1) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal can make a costs order providing that the CEO or Agency must pay the costs of a person who makes an application for a review of a decision.


(2) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal must not make a costs order providing that a person who makes an application for review of a decision is required to pay the CEO's or Agency's costs, unless in the opinion of the Tribunal the person is acting in a manner that is vexatious or an abuse of process of the Tribunal.

CEO to ensure appropriate means of communication



      The CEO must ensure that the Agency institutes a process to ensure that communications with participants in the National Disability Insurance Scheme are undertaken so as to allow the participants to deal with the Agency in the most effective way possible.


Note: For example, providing written communications to a person who is vision impaired does not allow that person to effectively communicate with the Agency. In this case, the Agency may determine that it is appropriate to directly speak with the person and to send them the written communication in braille form.

   (a) compensation is paid or payable to a person (the injured party), otherwise than under a scheme of compensation under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law; and


   (b) the injured party has received, or is entitled to, damages from another person (the wrongdoer) in pursuance of rights arising from the same trauma as gave rise to the rights to compensation; and


   (c) the person to whom the compensation is paid or payable (the claimant) is entitled to recover the amount of the compensation; and


   (d) the person has taken no action to claim or obtain compensation,


then the following provisions apply:


   (e) the CEO is entitled to recover the amount of compensation paid or payable from the wrongdoer or the injured party, but subject to the following qualifications:


      (i) no amount may be recovered from the wrongdoer in excess of the wrongdoer's unsatisfied liability to the injured party; and


      (ii) no amount may be recovered from the injured party in excess of the amount of the damages received by the injured party; and


      (iii) in a case involving contributory negligence, the amount to be recovered from the wrongdoer by the claimant under this subsection must be adjusted to the extent that is just and equitable having regard to the extent to which the wrongdoer establishes that the contributory negligence contributed to the occurrence of the relevant injury; and


   (f) the claimant shall, on giving notice to a wrongdoer of an entitlement to recover compensation under this section, have a first charge, to the extent of the entitlement, on damages payable by the wrongdoer to the injured party; and


   (g) any amount recovered by the claimant against a wrongdoer under this subsection shall be deemed to be an amount paid in or towards satisfaction of the wrongdoer's liability to the injured party; and


   (h) an action for the recovery of compensation may be heard in a Court of competent jurisdiction.


Question negatived.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Sorry, Senator Fifield. We are moving through the amendments now. The time for debate has expired.




Senator Fifield:
  I appreciate that. Just on a point of order, I think it is important for those who may be listening to the broadcast to realise why there is no further debate because the government passed a guillotine to prevent debate.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  That is not a point of order, Senator Fifield. There is no point of order. The question now is that that the amendments on sheet 7361 circulated by the opposition be agreed to:

The speeches read as follows—



BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND) BILL 2013


The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend) Bill 2013 proposes minor amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to facilitate the early commencement of telecommunications services in the digital dividend spectrum, while that spectrum is still considered part of the broadcasting services bands.


In 2010, the Australian Government announced its decision to release 126 Megahertz of broadcasting spectrum as a digital dividend. 


This spectrum is expected to be cleared of all existing services by 31 December 2014. 


The release of this broadcasting spectrum is a significant benefit of the digital switchover process.


The auction of this spectrum in April 2013 will pave the way for next generation mobile broadband services in Australia, such as 4G mobile services. 


Following the auction's completion, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will consider applications on a case-by-case basis to allow successful bidders to commence services, before the digital dividend spectrum is redesignated out of the broadcasting services bands. 


In order to ensure successful bidders are not unduly restricted in the types of services that can be provided in the interim period, the Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act to limit the scope of datacasting regulation.  


For the foreseeable future, only commercial and national broadcasters are required to hold a datacasting licence for the delivery of datacasting services in broadcasting spectrum.


To achieve this limitation in the scope of datacasting regulation in the Broadcasting Services Act, the Bill will introduce the concept of 'designated datacasting services'. 


This is defined as a datacasting service provided by a commercial television broadcasting licensee, a commercial radio broadcasting licensee, or a national broadcaster. 


The Bill will also empower the Minister to specify, by legislative instrument, other services that are 'designated datacasting services'. 


This will allow flexibility to expand the scope of the datacasting regime if the circumstances warrant. 


For example, this may apply where a provider seeks to use broadcasting spectrum to provide a datacasting service that the Minister considers should be subject to the conditions of service and codes of practice that apply to licensed datacasting services.  


The Bill will also make a number of minor consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act to implement these changes.


Amendments to this Bill were passed in the other place to assist in managing the transition of the wireless audio devices community to alternate spectrum and provide clarity about the future operation of their devices.  


As amended, the Bill will require the Minister to direct the ACMA to review and report on the provision of spectrum for low interference potential device class licences and provide a transition pathway for such licences by 30 July 2013.


In addition, the main operative provisions in the Bill will not commence until 1 October 2013.


It should be noted that datacasting regulation under the Broadcasting Services Act will not apply to any services using digital dividend spectrum after the Minister removes this spectrum from the broadcasting services bands. 


This is intended to occur after that spectrum is cleared of digital television services as a result of the restack, scheduled for completion by 31 December 2014.


The proposals in this Bill will provide certainty and clarity around the conditions placed on the digital dividend spectrum in the interim period prior to its reallocation. 


 


FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2013




The 
Financial Framework Legislation Amendment


Bill (No.


2) 2013 would, if enacted, amend five Acts across three portfolios.



This Bill forms part of an ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they are identified and assists in ensuring that specific provisions in existing legislation remain clear and up-to-date.




Keeping the existing financial framework legislation up
‑to
‑date is also consistent with the reforms foreshadowed in the Government
'
s proposed Commonwealth Financial Accountability Review.







First, the Bill would amend the 
Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997
 to authorise the Commonwealth to form, or participate in forming, companies, as specified in the 
Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997.







The Bill would also amend the 
Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 
1997
 to specify the objects or activities of existing Commonwealth companies.





For the avoidance of doubt and to address potential constitutional issues raised by the High Court
'
s decision in 
Williams v Commonwealth
, the Bill would confirm the Commonwealth
'
s existing involvement with companies.


The proposed amendment would provide explicit legislative authority for the Commonwealth
'
s involvement in companies.





The Bill would amend the 
Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act


1977
 (the ADJR Act) to provide for decisions made under the proposed amendment to the FMA Act, as I


have outlined, not to be subject to administrative review.


As decisions about the formation of, and participation in, Commonwealth companies are not administrative decisions impacting on the interests of individuals, the Government considers that it would not be appropriate for such decisions to be subject to administrative review.







The second set of amendments in the Bill would establish a framework for dealing with overpayments within the 
Judges
'
 Pensions Act 1968
, the 
Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973
, and the 
Social Security Act 1991 
in relation to Australian Government Disaster Relief payments.


These changes are technical in nature and would address instances where payments are made by the relevant agency from a special appropriation to recipients, that are not, in practice, consistent with the requirements or preconditions imposed by these Acts and risk breaching section 83 of the Constitution.


The proposed amendments are similar in nature to the amendments delivered by the 
Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act


(No.


2)


2012
. 





Finally, the Bill would allow deferred tax asset relief to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation in relation to the transfer of assets from the Military Superannuation and Benefits Fund to the ARIA Investments Trust that occurred in May 2012.


This is an operational amendment and follows the Government
'
s decision to consolidate the trustees of the Commonwealth
'
s main civilian and military superannuation schemes.



This Bill is, accordingly, another step to help ensure that specific areas of the Commonwealth's financial framework remain effective and up-to-date.


 


FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES BILL 2013


The bill amends two Acts, the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and the Work Health Safety Act 2011. 


The Staff of ASIS


The amendments to the Intelligence Services Act will create a mechanism for Australian Secret Intelligence Service employees to move to an Australian Public Service agency in the same way that Australian Public Service employees can voluntarily transfer from one Australian Public Service agency to another under section 26 of the Public Service Act 1999. 


These amendments will better facilitate the protection of an ASIS employee's identity as an ASIS officer and broaden the mobility opportunities for ASIS employees in the Australian Public Service.


ASIS employees are not Australian Public Servants. Instead they are Commonwealth officers employed under the Intelligence Services Act. 


ASIS officers perform difficult and, at times, dangerous tasks in distant locations. Information about their work and their identities is closely held in order to protect them, their activities and the people they interact with. Indeed it is an offence under section 41 of the Intelligence Services Act to identify a staff member of ASIS, other than in a few prescribed circumstances. 


In order to protect their identity ASIS officers are typically identified as public servants. However, this may have unintended consequences when an ASIS officer seeks to move to a public service agency as there is no obvious reason why a person identified as a public servant would not transfer under the Public Service Act like any other public servant. 


The amendments include mechanisms by which the Public Service Commissioner and the Director-General of ASIS will agree on how the ASIS classifications correspond to the APS classifications. This will ensure that ASIS levels have an equivalent Australian Public Service level for operation of this new provision and the other related aspects of the Public Service Act (for example the special requirements in respect of merit that apply in relation to promotion).


This proposal does not detract from the Australian Public Service merit principle in engagement. Under section 35 of the Intelligence Services Act the Director-General must adopt the principles of the Public Service Act in relation to employees of ASIS to the extent to which the Director-General considers they are consistent with the effective performance of ASIS's functions. In accordance with this obligation, ASIS's recruitment and promotion policies are based on merit. 


Work Health and Safety 


This Bill also contains amendments to the Work Health Safety Act 2011. These amendments will enable the Director-General of ASIS, with the approval of the Minister responsible for the Work Health Safety Act, to make a declaration that specified provisions of the Work Health Safety Actdo not apply, or apply subject to modifications, in relation to persons carrying out work for the Director-General. 


These amendments clarify rather than amend existing Work Health Safety policy with regard to national security. The amendments make clear that in administering ASIS and in the exercise of the power to make a declaration the Director-General must take into account the need to promote the objects of the Work Health Safety Act to the greatest extent consistent with the maintenance of Australia's national security. 


The Work Health Safety Actalready recognises that national security may not always be compatible with full compliance with Work Health Safety Actand the need to ensure that national security is not prejudiced. However, currently there is no mechanism to modify the operation of the Act to people who perform work for the Director-General of ASIS. 


This is in contrast to the position of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Both of these agencies have mechanisms for modification of the WHS Act under sections 12C and 12D of the Act respectively. 


The environments in which ASIS operates overseas are very similar to the environments in which ASIO and the ADF operate. 


In these environments the requirements of national security may not always be compatible with full compliance with Australian work health and safety obligations. Indeed full compliance could in some circumstances place people who work for the Director-General of ASIS at risk and prejudice national security. 


Therefore there is a similar need for the Work Health Safety Actto be modified in its application to ASIS in appropriate circumstances. Any modification will only occur with the agreement of the Minister responsible for the Work Health Safety Act. 


 


INSURANCE CONTRACTS AMENDMENT BILL 2013


Having a safe, efficient and well-functioning insurance market is vital for all Australians.  Insurance enables people and organisations to participate in social and economic activities that they otherwise would not be able to engage in, as they are able to price and transfer risks associated with those activities and with other aspects of their lives.  


The important role that insurance plays in Australian society has become even more evident in the past few years with the devastating impact of natural disasters on so many lives.  


In recognising the critical role insurance plays and the impact that insurance has on families and businesses the Government has taken and continues to take a number of steps to improve the insurance market in Australia. 


In this regard, on 23 November 2011 the Government introduced the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 into Parliament. The Bill received Royal Assent on 15 April 2012. The 2012 Act introduced the framework for a standard definition of flood for home building, home contents, small business and strata title body corporate insurance contracts and for the provision of a Key Facts Sheet for home building and home contents insurance policies. 


During 2012, regulations to give effect to these two measures were made and I am pleased to say that a significant number of insurers have adopted the standard definition early. This measure in particular ensures that Australians can rely on a common understanding of what flood actually means in these type of insurance contracts. 


This Bill, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013, is yet another example of how the Government is improving the insurance market in Australia. The law governing contracts of insurance has a direct influence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the insurance market.  


This Bill has been developed over a long period.  Its history began back in September 2003, when a Review Panel comprising Mr Alan Cameron AM and Ms Nancy Milne was established to embark on a comprehensive review of the Act.


The Review Panel's final report was released in 2004.  The report noted that the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (the Act), which is the primary source of laws regulating the rights and obligations of insurers, insureds and relevant third parties, had generally been operating satisfactorily to the benefit of insurers and insureds.  However, the Review Panel found that some changes would be beneficial given the passage of time from the Acts original enactment. Consequently, the Review Panel made some recommendations to give effect to the beneficial changes that they had identified in the review. The review panel also recommended that further consultations should be undertaken on the details of any proposed amendments to give effect to their recommendations.


In 2010 after extended consultation with industry and consumer groups, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2010 (2010 Bill) was introduced into Parliament. While the 2010 Bill passed the House of Representatives, due to the calling of the 2010 Federal election the 2010 Bill lapsed. 


On the Government's return, it was decided that it was appropriate to consult further with key stakeholders to ensure that the amendments to the Act struck an appropriate balance between providing certainty for insurers and ensuring that insureds are able to obtain appropriate outcomes under the Act. Through this engagement, some additional refinements have been made to the proposed amendments to the Act. These refinements further add to the beneficial nature of the amendments to the Act. 


The Government appreciates the constructive and thoughtful way that consumer representatives and industry have worked closely together throughout the development of the amendments to the Act. 


The Bill includes measures that will:


remove impediments to the use of electronic communication for statutory notices and documents;


make the duty of disclosure easier for consumers to understand and comply with, especially at renewal of household/domestic insurance contracts; 


make the remedies in respect of life insurance contracts more flexible and suited to modern life insurance products; 


clarify the rights and obligations of persons named in contracts as having the benefit of cover, but who are not parties themselves; and


clarify what types of contracts are exempt from its operation.


Although many of the amendments are technical adjustments to the Act rather than significant changes to the framework of the Act, as a package they will operate to streamline and clarify requirements while maintaining appropriate consumer protections.  


The Government is also in the process of developing draft legislation to extend the unfair contract terms laws to general insurance. This will ensure that the protections against unfair contract terms that are enshrined in Australia's consumer protection legislation will also apply to general insurance contracts, which have until now been excluded. 


In conclusion, this Bill is yet another significant step made by the Gillard Government, in improving the insurance market in Australia. This Bill provides for a package of improvements and efficiencies to how the Act operates, while maintaining the right balance that the Act aims to strike between the interests of insurers, insureds and the wider public.  This Bill will help ensure a better functioning, more efficient insurance market that will ultimately benefit the entire Australian community.

PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS


FOURTH AND FIFTH REPORTS OF 2013


TABLING STATEMENT (SENATE) 


WEDNESDAY 20 MARCH 2013


The Fourth Report of 2013 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights sets out the committee's consideration of 24 bills introduced during the last parliamentary sitting week and four legislative instruments that the committee had previously deferred for further consideration. 


The committee has identified 12 bills that do not appear to give rise to human rights concerns. The committee will seek further information in relation to the remaining 12 bills and the four legislative instruments.


This Fourth Report of 2013 includes the committee's examination of the six bills that make up a package of legislation on media reform. The committee noted that these bills are the subject of inquiry by three other parliamentary committees. The committee therefore decided to expedite publication of its comments on these bills to assist the work of those committees.


The committee has set out its expectation that the timetable for the consideration of legislation should allow sufficient time for the Parliament to examine draft legislation in some detail. The committee has noted that a fundamental premise of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 is that the examination of draft legislation for human rights compatibility is an important component of Australia's Human Rights Framework, and that the role of the committee is not a purely formal one, nor is it intended to provide after-the-event commentary on legislation.


The committee's Fifth Report of 2013 is its final report on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Act 2012.


Since the committee's interim report on this legislation was tabled in September 2012, additional material has become available to the committee. This Fifth Report of 2013 takes account of that additional information; confirms the committee's interim views where relevant; and presents the committee's final views on this legislation.


The completion of the examination of this legislation has been a long and formative journey for the committee. Senators will appreciate that this matter came before the committee very early in its existence, before it had established work practices around the routine scrutiny of legislation.


I draw the attention of senators to the analytical framework applied by the committee in its interpretation of the underlying human rights obligations and principles engaged by this legislation.


The committee has taken the view that there is considerable overlap between limitations on rights and retrogressive measures, particularly where such measures interfere with an existing enjoyment of a right. 


Throughout its consideration of the measures in this legislation, the committee has focussed on three key questions:


Whether the measures are aimed at achieving a legitimate objective;


Whether there is a rational connection between the measures and that objective; and 


Whether the measures are proportionate to that objective.


The committee will continue to age pensioner ply this approach consistently to its assessment of limitations of rights.


In closing, senators will note that I avoid paraphrasing the committee's reports in my tabling statements because it is not possible to do so and still capture the import of the committee's conclusions.


Therefore, I encourage senators to read the committee's comments on legislation in their entirety. To not do so diminishes the work of the committee.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues for their principled approach to the consideration of these complex and contentious issues.


On behalf of the committee I again emphasise our gratitude to the committee's secretariat for their diligence and professionalism in carrying out their work, and their contribution to the collegiate actions of the committee.


I commend the committee's Fourth and Fifth reports of 2013 to the Senate.

The committee's Fifth Report of 2013 is its final report on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Act 2012.


Since the committee's interim report on this legislation was tabled in September 2012, additional material has become available to the committee. This Fifth Report of 2013 takes account of that additional information; confirms the committee's interim views where relevant; and presents the committee's final views on this legislation.


The completion of the examination of this legislation has been a long and formative journey for the committee. Senators will appreciate that this matter came before the committee very early in its existence, before it had established work practices around the routine scrutiny of legislation.


I draw the attention of senators to the analytical framework applied by the committee in its interpretation of the underlying human rights obligations and principles engaged by this legislation.


The committee has taken the view that there is considerable overlap between limitations on rights and retrogressive measures, particularly where such measures interfere with an existing enjoyment of a right. 


Throughout its consideration of the measures in this legislation, the committee has focussed on three key questions:


Whether the measures are aimed at achieving a legitimate objective;


Whether there is a rational connection between the measures and that objective; and 


Whether the measures are proportionate to that objective.


The committee will continue to age pensioner ply this approach consistently to its assessment of limitations of rights.


In closing, senators will note that I avoid paraphrasing the committee's reports in my tabling statements because it is not possible to do so and still capture the import of the committee's conclusions.


Therefore, I encourage senators to read the committee's comments on legislation in their entirety. To not do so diminishes the work of the committee.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues for their principled approach to the consideration of these complex and contentious issues.


On behalf of the committee I again emphasise our gratitude to the committee's secretariat for their diligence and professionalism in carrying out their work, and their contribution to the collegiate actions of the committee.


I commend the committee's Fourth and Fifth reports of 2013 to the Senate.


Debate adjourned.

Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (21:18):  Acknowledging that Easter is approaching, this is our last parliamentary sitting week until May. As such, I would like to briefly reflect on the achievements of the Rudd and Gillard governments and, in doing so, as a senator for Western Australia, acknowledging the impact these achievements have had in that state.


Significant changes have taken place, particularly in helping Australians with everyday living costs. On this side of the chamber, we are very proud of our achievements. We have gone out of our way to help Australian pensioners. Since September 2009, we have given 300,000 Western Australian pensioners a pay rise of up to $182 per fortnight, allowing them to live their lives with increased dignity. This week, I am pleased to say, they received a further cost-of-living increase.


We are increasing Australians' retirement savings through an increase in superannuation from nine per cent up to 12 per cent. Of course, this increase over time will have a major set of implications. An average 30-year-old on full-time wages will receive an extra $108,000 in retirement savings.


Unlike the rest of the world, we have avoided recession. We have maintained our AAA credit rating. We are one of only seven countries in the world to do so—something never achieved under the opposition.


Twenty-eight million people have been added to unemployment queues worldwide. In Australia, by comparison, we have created jobs, the latest figure disclosing 920,000 extra jobs since we came to government.


We have bullet-proofed the Australian economy and kept it well out of recession, and this during the worst economic downtown since the Great Depression. That is in contrast to the Japanese economy, which shrank around 1½ per cent in the last four or five years, the European set of economies, which shrank around two per cent, and the United States economy, which grew by just above 2¼ per cent. Australia's economy in that same period grew by a massive 13 per cent. I think that is a figure well worth repeating, so let me say this again: Australia's economy, despite the global financial crisis, has grown around 13 per cent under Labor—something that, on this side of the chamber, we are greatly proud of.


Our fiscal discipline and management has put downward pressure on interest rates. Interest rates are now just three per cent, compared to 6¾ per cent when the Howard government left office, saving families on an average $300,000 mortgage around $5,000 a year.


From July last year, we have given working families a tax cut. They get more money in their fortnightly or monthly pay cheques.


Across the country, more than 230,000 new parents are benefiting from up to 18 weeks leave. When the child starts school, parents receive a schoolkids bonus of $410 and up to $820 a year per child. There is a further boost to family payments, with eligible families with teenagers aged between 16 and 19 receiving over $4,000 per teenager.


This is very welcome news for families right across Australia. There are 900,000 Australian families, over 65,000 of them in Western Australia, benefiting from Labor lifting the childcare rebate.


In Labor, we are helping low-income Australians. A new $210 Supplementary Allowance for singles and $350 for couples will assist with essential living costs. We are investing a further $4.6 billion in dental care, assisting low-income families. That now makes it easier for almost 3½ million kids to see their dentist.


We have doubled investment in school education, upgrading facilities at every school right across the Commonwealth, with over $100 million of new school infrastructure in my duty electorate of Swan alone.


We have built science blocks, state-of-the-art training centres and purpose-built kindergartens and pre-primary classrooms. Through the My School website we have provided more information for parents than ever before.


We are delivering the skills and training required for the jobs of the future. We have invested $3 billion through our Jobs and Skills package. We are rolling out the National Broadband Network, bringing affordable, high-speed broadband to all Australians and Australian businesses, no matter where they are. We are very excited that residents in the Perth area of Victoria Park will be among the first in Western Australia to switch on. Very soon, they will have access to some of the world's highest speeds of broadband. It promises better education, better healthcare and better access for Australian homes and businesses.


Federal Labor have invested a record amount in infrastructure. We have invested $3.7 billion in Western Australian projects through the Nation Building Program. Under Labor, federal infrastructure spending in the state has nearly doubled, from $154 to $261 per person.


We are transforming and revitalising the state by sinking Perth's railway line through the city centre. We are widening the city's major access road, the Kwinana Freeway. We are transforming the state's busiest and most important transport hub: $686 million is being invested in a project known as the Gateway project. We are upgrading regional highways in Bunbury, Port Hedland and state-wide. Millions more are being invested in dangerous black-spot funding; that will save lives.


I am acknowledging these achievements as part of the work of a government of which I, for one, am very proud to be a member.
