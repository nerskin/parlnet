"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-11-30,"—I thank both Senator O'Brien and Senator Greig for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Fisheries (Validation of Plans of Management) Bill 2004. Senator O'Brien has given a precis of the purposes of the bill, and I will try not to take up the time of the Senate by repeating the content of it. Suffice it to say that I appreciate the support for it; it involves a fairly technical issue. The government is advised by AFMA that there is no real problem with plans of management, but a legal audit determined that there was some very minor doubt, which we want to put to rest by passing this bill, thus validating plans of management that have been dealt with in the past.
In concluding the debate, I want to comment on a couple of the issues that Senator Greig raised in his contribution. They were not directly related to the bill, but he raised some issues about fisheries management generally that I think require a response. He mentioned the super trawler Veronica, about which, I have to say, any number of left-wing candidates tried to make an issue during the election campaign. On all occasions, as I kept saying at the time, no formal application had been made by the connections of the Veronica to do anything in Australia. If there had been, there would have been quite a long process to go through, but that did not stop some of the Labor candidates trying to beat it up. I have to say that even my namesake in New South Wales, with whom I have a very close working relationship, did not mind having a bit of a chop—
—He doesn't tell us that.
—I do not want to destroy him by giving away any secrets, but we do get on rather well. As I always say to him, I think sometimes you lefties in the Labor Party are more genuine to your cause than some of your right factional brethren, and I say to Mr Ian Macdonald, the New South Wales minister, that, whilst I do not always agree with his politics, I think he is genuine in his approach to the work that he does. But he could not help having a bit of a chop on this issue because he thought it might help a couple of the Labor candidates in the federal election and, by gee, as events have shown, they needed every bit of help that they could get. Unfortunately, even the help of my namesake in New South Wales did not make much difference to the outcome.
Having said that—and I know Senator Greig will find that very interesting—I want to confirm for Senator Greig that the AFMA board has recently decided to adopt individual transferable quotas in the small pelagic fishery as the key management measure for the fishery. However, the freeze on boat nominations announced in September will continue until the board receives advice from the independent advisory panel on the allocation of statutory fishing rights in the fishery. The method of allocating fishing rights will be considered as part of the development of the statutory management plan of the fishery, and a final decision on the allocation is expected in June next year. The decision to maintain the freeze reflects AFMA's concern about the possibility of rapid overcapitalisation in the fishery, so the entry of any new vessels to be used in the small pelagic fishery against existing permits continues to be disallowed. 
The uncertainty of the stock levels and the increased interest in the small pelagic fishery were noted by AFMA. AFMA has, accordingly, issued an investment warning for the fishery effective from 6 July. The status of the target species in the small pelagic fishery is uncertain and stocks are currently managed under precautionary trigger catch levels that range from 100 to 9,000 tonnes for different species in each zone of the fishery. Once the trigger catch level is reached fishing ceases for the rest of the season. It can only be recommenced once the AFMA board has considered any new scientific advice and has consulted with stakeholder groups.
I simply conclude on the Veronica issue, Senator Greig, by indicating, as I did when I was asked to comment publicly, that no application had been made to any Australian government agency. If a foreign boat wants to fish and operate in Australian waters it has to go through any number of agencies. It had not made formal application to any of them, as I am advised. I am in a position where courts and others can look at the words that I say in relation to these issues, so I do not want to pre-empt anything that anyone might do at some time in the future. I have indicated, though, that, as far as the government is concerned, if that particular vessel fishes in a way it is alleged to have fished in the Northern Hemisphere, the government would be very concerned about it operating in a similar way in Australian waters. 
As Senator Greig would know, however, fisheries management in Australia is run by an independent statutory authority—and I think for good reasons; I do not think politicians and ministers should be involved in managing fairly technical things like fisheries—but if it became appropriate, I would not hesitate to consider some legislative support for the prospect of keeping all of our fisheries in a good condition. 
Senator Greig also referred in his speech to `the lack of any mention of domestic management planning or environmental assessment in the government's 2004 election fisheries policy'. We did not mention that because it was relevant to previous election commitments. Senator Greig well knows that all export fisheries, including state managed fisheries, have to get an environmental assessment under the EPBC Act. They are being done. Some of them have taken longer than anticipated and they have been given extensions of time by the environment minister, but we are proceeding with those as quickly as possible and I am quite confident that we will achieve that aim and have those plans with the appropriate assessments under the EPBC Act.
Senator Greig mentioned overfishing of various species of fish and said that the Bureau of Rural Sciences—which, I hasten to add, is an element of my department: it is part of the government—has assessed some of the fisheries as overfished. AFMA is aware of that and is endeavouring to correct those problems. It does take some time, though, to convert a fishery with an overfished status to a `ticked' status, if I can call it that. The redevelopment of fisheries does take a period of time. Those that have been identified as overfished are being worked on by AFMA and I am confident that, given a number of years, as is required, we will get those fisheries back to a very healthy state. AFMA is very much aware of that and the government is very much aware of that. That is our goal and we are proceeding towards that.
Senator Greig also mentioned some issues associated with bycatch. Again, it is something the government are very concerned about and we are working with the industry to get bycatch action plans in place and to appropriately deal with the issue. I share Senator Greig's concern and the fishing industry share Senator Greig's concern. The fishing industry are in fact leading the charge to ensure that all of our fisheries are sustainable and that bycatch is addressed in the appropriate way. 
Finally, Senator Greig mentioned a speech I made in Cairns yesterday morning and the press release I issued about it. He has misquoted me in reference to the `light hand on the tiller'. What I said was:
The Australian Government wants to keep a very light hand on the tiller to ensure that all responsibilities that relate to the management of Australia's fisheries resource, and the required accountability to the Australian public, are met.
We want to make sure that the fisheries are run properly. Having done that, we then do not think that governments are the right people to run the fishing industry; we think the fishing industry are the right people to operate the fishing industry and to direct it. Fishermen are very responsible; they understand the questions of sustainability and they will continue to manage the fishery properly. We think it is appropriate that the fishing industry itself should direct the business of fishing. We intend to keep an eye on the accountability issues and ensure the appropriate management of fisheries resources. Having said that, can I again thank all senators who have contributed to this debate and thank them for their support for the bill.
Question agreed to.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Family Law Amendment (Annuities) Bill 2004. At first blush it is a bill which might escape attention, but on further inquiry it is a bill which indeed has some important provisions for Australians, particularly those who are going through a divorce through the Family Court. The bill will appropriately bring the annuity products that are very much like superannuation within the legislative scheme in the Family Law Act for the splitting of super on marriage breakdown or divorce. We have had provisions which have brought in superannuation, and quite properly so, and there are annuity products which are very much like superannuation which need to be treated in the same manner. That is what this bill does.
Opposition senators have pointed out that this bill will be beneficial to couples, allowing more flexible settlements of property upon marriage breakdown. The Democrats have indicated that more attention should be given to providing more post-retirement income for women. I would note that the amendments in this bill indeed address that issue, even if it is in a relatively small way. These amendments allow couples to split annuity payments, thus allowing the non-member spouse—often a woman—to gain access to this retirement related income. Of course, that does go some way towards addressing the concern expressed by the Democrats.
There were a couple of other points which I think need addressing. The first concerns a comment by the opposition in relation to preservation requirements where an annuity is split. There was a suggestion that the spouse who is not the contractual party to the annuity—or, in the terms of the Family Law Act, the non-member spouse—may be able to access annuity payments even though the purchaser of the annuity—the member spouse—has not satisfied a contractual preservation requirement such as retirement age. This is not the case. Under the amendments being proposed to the Family Law Act, the non-member spouse will not be able to access annuity payments until the member spouse satisfies the preservation requirement and the member spouse is entitled to be paid. Indeed, that follows the principle that, where the spouse who has entered into the contract reaches preservation age, only then can annuities be paid out. Accordingly, the non-member spouse enjoys that benefit but not before the member spouse has reached that preservation age. That is much like the principle that you can pass on to someone else only the right that you have yourself; you cannot pass on a greater entitlement. That is precisely the principle that is reflected here. 
The second point which was raised in the debate, which I also wish to comment on, relates to the suggestion by the Democrats that the extension of the Family Law Act provisions on super splitting to include eligible annuities will mean that term annuities and lifetime annuities will be outside the scope of those provisions. The extension of the Family Law Act provisions to include eligible annuities will extend those provisions to all annuities currently in payment that were purchased with rolled-over superannuation amounts, including annuities payable for a fixed term or annuities payable for the lifetime of the purchaser. This is a valuable amendment to the Family Law Act. I thank senators for their contributions on and their support for the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to. 
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (ANNUITIES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—I rise to speak on the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004. The bill has been the subject of a bipartisan report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which recommended a number of amendments. We are pleased that the government has responded constructively to that report and that it will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage which the opposition will be supporting. 
The origin of this bill is resolution 15 of the Council of Australian Governments Leaders' Summit on Terrorism and Multi-Jurisdictional Crime in April 2002, which called for a national set of powers for cross-border investigations covering, among other issues, the use of electronic surveillance devices. Following this resolution, a joint working group was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers Council. The joint working group developed model laws, which were released for public comment in November 2003. This bill substantially implements those model laws, although there has been modification in a number of areas.
I should begin by observing that the need for legislation of this kind is clearly obvious. Currently, the only Commonwealth laws governing the use of surveillance devices by law enforcement authorities are the Australian Federal Police Act and the Customs Act. In addition, though, state and territory legislation governing surveillance devices is undesirably fragmented. As the joint working group stated in its November 2003 report—and it is worth quoting from that report as the genesis of where we are today: 
Currently, the law in each of these areas differs significantly between jurisdictions and there is no provision for recognition in one jurisdiction of authorisations or warrants issued in another jurisdiction. Where an investigation crosses State or Territory borders, the need to obtain separate authorities in each jurisdiction can result in delays, loss of evidence and other impediments to effective investigation. The creation of a national set of investigative powers is intended to facilitate seamless law enforcement across jurisdictions.
It is also important that we have Commonwealth legislation covering the full range of surveillance devices, including not only listening devices but also optical surveillance devices, data surveillance devices, equipment or programs used to monitor computer input and output, and of course tracking devices. The bill is restricted to the use of devices by law enforcement authorities, specifically the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and state or territory police investigating a Commonwealth offence. It enables these authorities to use surveillance devices where they have obtained a warrant from an eligible judge or Administrative Appeals Tribunal member.
The circumstances in which warrants may be sought and issued are broadly comparable to those applying to telecommunications interception warrants, and balance a range of factors including the gravity of the offence, the importance of the information sought, the availability of alternative methods of obtaining the information and the impact on privacy. A surveillance device may be used without a warrant if an emergency authorisation has been obtained. These may only be granted where the use of the device is demonstrably necessary to deal with a couple of issues: firstly, to deal with an imminent risk of serious violence to a person or substantial damage to property; secondly, to urgently recover a child subject to a Family Court recovery order; or, thirdly, to prevent the loss of evidence in an investigation of a specified serious offence, which includes those of terrorism, serious drug offences, treason, espionage and aggravated people-smuggling.
If an emergency authorisation is granted, the authorising officer must apply within two business days for retrospective approval by an eligible judge or AAT member. A surveillance device may be used without a warrant or an emergency authorisation in the following circumstances: where it is an optical surveillance device and its use does not involve entry onto premises without permission or interference without permission with any vehicle or thing, such as the observation of a person from a distance using binoculars or a camera; where it is used to record words spoken to a law enforcement officer or a group of persons including a law enforcement officer, such as a conversation with an undercover officer wearing a wire; and, lastly, where it is a tracking device and its use does not involve entry into premises or the interior of a vehicle without permission and its use has been authorised by an authorised officer. A clear example would be the placement of a tracking device on the exterior of a vehicle or vessel.
We note that these provisions for the use of surveillance devices without a warrant or emergency authorisation are modifications of the model laws released by the joint working group. They are said by the government to share the feature of being less intrusive forms of surveillance. The bill enables the use of surveillance devices in the investigation of a range of matters. It is worth going through some of those investigative matters. Specifically they relate to: firstly, the investigation of Commonwealth offences which carry a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment; secondly, the investigation by the Australian Federal Police or the ACC of a state offence with a federal aspect which also meets the three-year threshold; thirdly, the safe recovery of a child where the Family Court has issued a recovery order; and, fourthly, the investigation of offences against the Fisheries Management Act 1991, such as the illegal fishing of patagonian toothfish. We note that this contemplates the use of tracking devices on illegal fishing vessels in remote waters. I should add that surveillance devices may be used for the investigation of offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, such as failing to declare the import or export of Australian currency in excess of $10,000 or operating an account with a cash dealer in a false name. We note that this is included because such transactions are often indicative of more serious underlying conduct. 
We understand that this range of matters is broader than that proposed in the model laws but we recognise that these are all serious law enforcement issues of concern to Australians and that the use of surveillance devices will, in those circumstances, assist considerably with investigations following arrests. The bill also allows surveillance devices to be used under warrant for the investigation of Commonwealth offences outside Australia in accordance with international law. Outside Australia in this instance means in a foreign country or on a foreign-registered vessel or aircraft that is in or above waters beyond Australia's territorial seas. In such circumstances, though, a warrant may only be issued if the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the relevant foreign country. The requirement of agreement by a foreign official does not apply if Australia is exercising its jurisdiction in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. You can imagine this occurring in a number of circumstances—for example, if the vessel is in Australia's contiguous zone and the offence being investigated relates to customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws of Australia; or if the vessel is in Australia's fishing zone and the offence being investigated is one of the specified offences under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. As one would expect, the extraterritorial use of surveillance devices is particularly a matter for the Commonwealth and would not necessarily be dealt with in a model law developed with the states and territories. So again we recognise the need for some departure in this area.
The bill establishes a number of mechanisms to ensure the accountability of authorities using surveillance devices. We understand it was intended that these be based broadly on the mechanisms in the telecommunications interception regime. In particular, where information has been obtained without the required warrant, authorisation or approval, it may not be used by law enforcement authorities in the investigation of an offence or the bringing of a prosecution nor communicated to a foreign country under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. On the other hand, it may be communicated to an Australian intelligence agency if it relates to the functions of that agency and it can be communicated for the purposes of investigating compliance with the provisions of the Surveillance Devices Bill when it becomes an act or with other laws such as the Privacy Act. The bill imposes obligations on each relevant law enforcement authority to maintain detailed records of applications, warrants, authorisations and the use of surveil1ance devices and information obtained therefrom. In some circumstances it imposes obligations to destroy information not required for a recognised purpose under the act. The bill also provides that regular reports must be made to the minister about all warrants and authorisations. 
The bill introduced in the current parliament contains two new amendments that the opposition also supports. Of course this bill was introduced in the last parliament. However, due to time constraints, as I understand, in the legislative program, it failed to pass. The first of the amendments contained in the current bill is that minor defects in connection with a warrant or other authority will not void or vitiate a warrant. Clause 65(2) makes it clear that a reference to a defect or irregularity is one that is `other than a substantial defect or irregularity'. Clause 65 is consistent with section 75 of the Telecommunications (Interceptions) Act, which is colloquially called the T(I) Act, which has previously been supported by this Senate. Just as in the T(I) Act's savings provision, this amendment, clause 65(2) of the current bill, cannot protect a warrant containing a substantial defect in its issue or in its execution. The term `substantial' is not defined in the current bill. Some guidance may be obtained from the consideration of what constitutes a defect by going to the substance of a search warrant. A search warrant containing defects is not invalidated unless the defect affects the substance of the warrant in a material particular.
The second point of difference is technical and has regard to the fact that the Legislative Instruments Act will take effect from 1 January. The Legislative Instruments Act will require all new legislation to specify whether or not an instrument made under this act is legislative in character. The relevant clause provides that, whilst an instrument made under the current bill is not legislative in character, any regulations made in accordance with clause 66 of the current bill will be legislative instruments subject to the provisions of this act. Instruments made under the current bill that are not legislative instruments are things like instruments declaring federal judges to be eligible judges; records of emergency authorisations granted under the legislation; applications to eligible judges or nominated AAT members for approval of emergency authorisations; records of tracking device authorisations that are issued under the legislation; records that must be kept by law enforcement agencies about their applications for warrants, emergency authorisations and tracking device authorisations and the use of the information they may obtain; and the register of warrants, emergency authorisations and tracking device authorisations that must be kept by each law enforcement agency.
The Legislative Instruments Act has made it necessary to differentiate clearly between matters which are not legislative instruments and those that are. I suspect that not only will that now be a clear feature of speeches in second reading debates, where we try to say what is in and what is out, but also the government will carefully consider and watch to make sure that it can differentiate clearly between what is a regulation and within the reach of the Legislative Instruments Act and what is not clearly within the reach of the Legislative Instruments Act and therefore not a matter that needs to be dealt with in that manner.
In conclusion, the opposition acknowledges the significance of this bill and supports it being given a second reading. I will address the Senate committee report and the amendments resulting from it at the committee stage in due course. I think this is one of the matters of which I can speak with at least some knowledge, as I was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which dealt with the first Surveillance Devices Bill—it was not the Surveillance Devices Bill (No. 2) 2004, but we know that it only differs by two slight amendments. That committee report, which was handed down in May 2004, went through the background from which the bill arose and outlined some of the concerns and issues. The challenge, and I think the committee also drew much from this, was to strike a balance between giving our law enforcement officers effective tools to fight crime and ensuring their appropriate use with regard to Australians' privacy. The opposition remains committed to working with the government to make sure we get that balance right. ",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-11-30,"—I also rise to speak to the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004, but we take a different approach. We Democrats have a different response in that we are strongly opposed to the legislation before us. The primary purpose of this bill is to establish a new regime for the use of surveillance devices within Australia. As the explanatory memorandum notes, the use of surveillance devices is currently governed by a fairly piecemeal combination of state and Commonwealth law and common-law principles. We Democrats accept that there is a need for new legislation. The current situation is unacceptable and may leave the rights of Australians exposed. Legislative clarification is required. Given the plethora of technological instruments that now exist to spy on people, this is not an easy area in which to legislate. However, even conceding these difficulties, we still believe the government has failed to produce anything near what we would argue would be a more appropriate bill. What we have before us, we feel, is a weak bill and a dangerous bill. It is weak because its provisions are loose, and dangerous because they have the potential to be too broadly interpreted.
The bill establishes a regime which enables law enforcement officers to use surveillance devices subject to warrants. For example, a warrant may be obtained for the purpose of investigating a Commonwealth crime which has a maximum penalty of at least three years. A subsequent warrant may be obtained to retrieve the surveillance device. Warrants are issued by a judge or an AAT member. However, in urgent circumstances, temporary authorisation may be obtained from a senior police officer pending the grant of a warrant.
Information obtained pursuant to a warrant or an emergency authorisation is classified as protected information and can only be used in certain circumstances. Significantly, warrants are not required in relation to the use of tracking devices or optical surveillance devices. Information obtained using these devices is therefore not subject to the same level of protection as information obtained under a warrant. In practice this means that the police will be able to make a video of a person without that person's knowledge and the use of that video will not be subject to the restrictions which apply to protected information. This is one of the particular concerns we Democrats have in relation to this bill.
But perhaps the more disturbing aspect of the bill is that it contains no general prohibition against the covert use of surveillance devices. In that respect it differs greatly from the regime established by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. The lack of any general prohibition against covert surveillance leaves us with the situation where there are gaps and inconsistencies under the different pieces of state legislation. This means that in some states private detectives, private corporations and others may be able to legally monitor the activities of individuals if they do not breach any other law in the process. One of the most fundamental points that needs to be made in relation to this bill then is that it directly affects not just those individuals in relation to whom a warrant has been obtained but also the many other individuals with which that person interacts. Considering the number of people that each of us generally comes into contact with on a day-by-day basis, it is clear that at any given time a significant proportion of our Australian community is likely to be directly affected by the surveillance activities of our law enforcement agencies. 
The broad drafting of this bill, as we see it, means, for example, that the police could obtain a warrant to install listening devices in a particular pub and then listen to many conversations that take place in that pub that have absolutely nothing to do with the particular offence they are investigating. Another issue of concern for us Democrats is that surveillance device warrants will automatically authorise the use of force—not just to enter the premises with respect to which the warrant has been issued but to enter adjoining premises if necessary. This means that the police could use force to enter a person's property purely for the purpose of accessing that person's neighbour's property.
The Democrats believe that the bill needs to be amended so that the use of force must be expressly authorised in a surveillance device warrant. We believe that this is something which a judge or AAT member granting a warrant should have to turn his or her mind to. We also feel that the warrant should expressly specify any premises which the police are authorised to enter. Again, we will be looking to move amendments to that effect during the committee stage.
It is very clear that one of the most invasive aspects of this bill is its potential to authorise the surveillance of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Australians who are not suspected of any crime. This is particularly significant given the policy arguments advanced in support of the legislation. The government acknowledges that the use of surveillance devices is intrusive and infringes the right to privacy. However, it argues that this intrusion is justified in the case of those who commit serious criminal offences. What it fails to acknowledge is that the bill not only infringes the right to privacy of those who break the law but also infringes the privacy of thousands of other law-abiding Australians. Not only can their properties be broken into but their movements can be monitored and their conversations listened to—not just by the police but also by our intelligence agencies.
This brings me to the point that intelligence agencies are specifically excluded from the scope of this bill. While the Democrats acknowledge that there is already an established regime under the ASIO Act, we have long been critical of the lack of basic reporting requirements which apply to ASIO's surveillance activities. We simply do not accept that there is any legislative justification for excluding ASIO from the basic reporting requirements which apply to law enforcement agencies in relation to telecommunications interception and other surveillance activities.
As we have seen from the annual reports on the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, the government is well able to provide basic information regarding telecommunications interception activities, even in relation to the investigation of terrorism offences, without jeopardising national security in any way. Similarly, there are reporting requirements in the ASIO Act itself which relate to the new questioning and detention powers. We Democrats find it difficult to believe that ASIO can provide specific information in relation to individual cases of detention without jeopardising national security and yet is unable to provide general information on the exercise of its surveillance and telecommunications interception powers.  
Moving to another concern in relation to this bill, the Democrats concur with the Law Council of Australia that the bill enables surveillance devices to be used to investigate too broad a range of offences. The bill provides that a surveillance device warrant may be obtained for the purpose of investigating a Commonwealth offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years or more. We feel that that should be lifted to at least seven years. The infringement of personal privacy caused by surveillance devices is severe and should be restricted to limited circumstances. We do not believe that this level of infringement can be justified other than in relation to the most serious of criminal offences. Moreover, simply casually spying or eavesdropping on individuals suspected of criminal offences has the effect of violating their right to silence. Because they are unaware that law enforcement personnel are listening to their conversations, these individuals have no opportunity to exercise their right to silence.
The Democrats are also concerned that there appears to be no limit on the number of surveillance devices which may be used in relation to a single person at any one time. While a surveillance device warrant is required to specify the kind of surveillance device or devices proposed to be used, there is no requirement to specify the number of devices. Similarly, there is no ultimate time limit on how long a surveillance device warrant may remain in operation. While surveillance warrants of this nature may only be in force for a period not exceeding 90 days, it is possible to seek an extension for a further period not exceeding 90 days, and there is no limit on the number of extensions which may subsequently be sought. This means that it is possible for the actions and conversations of a single person to be constantly monitored by multiple surveillance devices for a period of, say, a couple of years. While I concede that this is unlikely given the requirement to satisfy a judge or AAT member every 90 days that that surveillance warrant is still justified, it is nevertheless possible under the provisions of the bill. We believe that ought to be remedied.
I would also like to draw attention to the provisions governing the granting of emergency authorisations. These provisions enable an application for an emergency authorisation to be made orally, in writing, or by telephone, fax, email or any other means of communication. This then creates the potential for a police officer to simply text message his or her superior officer and obtain immediate permission to use a surveillance device. Again, given the very intrusive nature of surveillance devices, we question whether this is an appropriate means of authorisation. However, we acknowledge that such an authorisation would need to be retrospectively approved by a judge or an AAT member.
What we believe is crucial is that, if authorisation is given verbally, by text message or in some other similar way, the senior law enforcement officer who gives that authorisation must write down the details of the authorisation as soon as possible after giving it. Having a written record of the authorisation will be vital to any court which may subsequently be required to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained pursuant to the emergency warrant.
In closing, the view of the Democrats is that the government should start again with this bill. We would advocate a redraft to address those areas that we and others in the community share strong concerns about, and the bill really should start from the premise that the use of surveillance devices should be prohibited and then subject to limited exemptions. The absence of such prohibitions from this bill is fatal to the Democrats' support. Finally, I seek leave of the chamber to have incorporated into Hansard the contribution to the second reading debate from my colleague Senator Stott Despoja who is currently on leave owing to travel restrictions. Party whips have been notified in advance.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-11-30,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on this Bill in my capacity as the Democrats' Spokesperson on Privacy.
This Bill is just one among a number of recent legislative initiatives which have serious implications for the right to privacy in this nation.
I spoke about this trend in my Second Reading Speech on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill.
The Bill before us now deals with the use of surveillance devices by law enforcement agencies. It is the first piece of Commonwealth legislation to attempt to regulate the use of surveillance devices, which is currently dealt with at a State level.
As my colleague, Senator Greig, has said, the Democrats agree with the Government that new legislation is needed to regulate the ever-increasing use of surveillance devices in the Australian community and this should be at a Federal level.
However, the Bill before us is inadequate on a whole range of fronts. Unlike the Telecommunications Interception regime, it contains no general prohibition against the use of surveillance devices, which is then subject to a range of exceptions for law enforcement and intelligence purposes. Apart from the ad hoc legislation which exists in some States, this Bill will have the effect of allowing the unregulated use of surveillance devices by the private sector and by intelligence agencies.
This is because the regulatory regime set out in the Bill is limited to a handful of law enforcement agencies. The regime itself is flawed, giving rise to gaps in the regulation of surveillance devices by enabling the use of some devices does without a warrant.
All in all, this is an entirely unsatisfactory bill.
But it is not simply a bad piece of legislation—it is a Bill which has massive implications for the privacy of Australians and should therefore be approached very cautiously.
In a paper prepared by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner more than a decade ago, the Commissioner defined “covert surveillance” as:
“The secretive, continuous or periodic observation of persons, vehicles, places or objects to obtain information concerning the activities of individuals which is then recorded in material form including notes and photographs.”
The Privacy Commissioner went on to say that:
“Covert surveillance is privacy intrusive because not only is information about an individual collected without that individual's consent or authority but the individual who is subject to the covert surveillance is usually unaware that he or she is under surveillance.”
At that time, the list of Commonwealth Government agencies that engaged in covert surveillance of the Australian community included the predecessor of Family and Community Services, the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Customs, the ATO, the Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and Comcare. Of course, Commonwealth law enforcement and intelligence agencies routinely conduct surveillance as well.
The extent of this Government surveillance is only likely to have increased over the past decade and that is before we even get to State Governments, local councils and the private sector—not to mention global surveillance initiatives such as the ECHELON project, in which Australia has partnered with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand under the auspices of the UKUSA Agreement.
The extent of surveillance which we now contend with in our everyday lives means that it is possible to monitor our movements, our communications, our spending habits, our internet use and our viewing. 
It is no longer far-fetched to make comparisons with the level of surveillance depicted in George Orwell's 1984, which was described as follows:
There was, of course, no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment ... it was even conceivable that [the Thought Police] watched everybody all the time ... They could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live ... in the assumption that ... every movement was scrutinized.
Surveillance is such a mass phenomenon that Queens University has now established what it calls “The Surveillance Project” to examine the globalisation of personal data.
According to its website, this project traces the paths of personal data flows as they cross national borders and explores the social, economic, political and cultural consequences of intensified personal data flows.
Of course, many of these personal data flows occur within the private sector—they occur when we use our credit cards, our frequent flyer cards, when we visit certain websites, when we order products over the telephone. Our mobile phones can be used to reveal our location and who we are communicating with.
A Google search of surveillance in Australia brings up, not only articles warning of ever-increasing threats to personal privacy but, as if to prove this very point, there are a whole lot of sites advertising spy equipment for sale to the general public.
For example, OzSpy, which describes itself as “Australia's favourite spy shop” and tells us that franchises are now selling in all states, with new stores about to open in Victoria and New South Wales. “If you're in the market for CCTV, listening devices, night vision, surveillance equipment, cameras, de-bugging, alarms [or] transmitters”, OzSpy is the shop for you.
It even sells hand-held lie-detectors for $129.00, which could come in handy at press conferences.
With the myriad of surveillance devices being used in everyday life, I believe it is time for us to reconsider the concept of consent.
It is often argued that privacy intrusions are justified because individuals have consented to the disclosure of their information, or the surveying of their movements, in return for a benefit. For example:
	the person who consents to a credit rating check, because they are applying for a loan;
	the person signs up to become a member of their local video store and, in doing so, agrees to their information being shared with associated companies around the world; or
	the person who chooses to shop in a particular shopping centre fully aware that there are security cameras operating in the centre.
In each of these cases, the person has either expressly or impliedly consented to an intrusion of their privacy. But how much choice did they really have?
These days it is almost impossible to participate in everyday life without consenting, willingly or unwillingly, to intrusions of your privacy.
If you want to hire a video, you have to provide your personal details to the store and, in the case of some stores, this means providing your details to a multinational corporation which wants to share those details with other corporations.
If you want to enter a competition, you often have to consent to the retention and sharing of your personal details.
You may not like the idea of being videoed while you shop, but if you want to purchase a particular item, you may have little choice.
These scenarios beg the question whether we really consent to privacy intrusions when we simply engage in everyday activities.
Often there is a clear choice between protecting personal privacy on the one hand and gaining a benefit on the other. For example, in the case of a competition for an overseas holiday, where a person chooses to provide their personal details in exchange for the chance to win the holiday.
In other circumstances, personal privacy is compromised in order to create security, for example, in the case of a mortgage. Clearly, a bank can not simply lend thousands of dollars to a person without first ascertaining whether he or she is likely to repay the money. The individual seeking the loan must provide personal information and consent to a credit rating check in order to demonstrate that he or she is a good credit risk. Again, this is a situation in which a choice is made on the basis of the benefit outweighing the value that the person places on their personal privacy. 
However, in the case of surveillance there is very little room, if any, for the concept of consent at an individual level. Instead, the weighing of competing interests occurs at a broader level. For example, in the case of surveillance cameras, there are the competing interests of privacy and public safety.
Because these decisions are made at a corporate level, whether in the public or private sector, it is important to ensure that those who make them are kept accountable. This is why regulating the use of surveillance devices is so important.
Regulation helps to ensure that in circumstances where an individual has no opportunity to consent to an intrusion of their privacy, that intrusion can be justified as being in the public interest.
In the case of covert police investigations, the interest being served is obviously the administration of justice and the need to prosecute those who commit crimes. Whether or not it is necessary to violate an individual's privacy to achieve this is obviously a matter for the person granting the warrant and that is why a warrant system is so important.
Unfortunately, this Bill enables law enforcement agencies to use certain kinds of surveillance devices without any warrant.
But the more startling omission is the fact that it makes no attempt to regulate the endemic level of surveillance within the private sector. I acknowledge that some States have passed legislation to address this issue, but the point is that this legislation is ad hoc and inadequate.
If a national regime is appropriate for law enforcement agencies, then it is also appropriate for the private sector. What we need is a more comprehensive approach that addresses all forms of surveillance within the Australian community, whether by public or private organisations. In that respect, this Bill is manifestly inadequate.
And it is for that reason that we are unable to support this Bill—for, although we recognise the urgent need to regulate the use of surveillance devices, we cannot support a Bill which leaves the privacy rights of Australians so exposed.",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 which is a very important one for both law enforcement and security agencies in this country. The bill, of course, implements the model electronics surveillance bill developed by the Commonwealth-state joint working group on cross-border investigations. I think that was referred to by Senator Ludwig in his earlier contribution to the debate.
The bill is therefore part of a national scheme to provide consistent legislation across the different Australian jurisdictions, though a number of changes or additions have been made to the model bill to suit the unique requirements of the Commonwealth. The bill provides for a comprehensive regime governing the use of surveillance devices at the Commonwealth level. The range of devices now includes optical surveillance devices, data surveillance devices and tracking devices along with listening devices. The range of offences has been broadened to include any offence with a penalty of at least three years imprisonment, as well as several specified offences. For the first time, the bill provides a proper framework for conducting extraterritorial surveillance. The bill also creates a stringent accountability regime and empowers the Commonwealth Ombudsman to check law enforcement agencies' compliance and to report through the Attorney-General to the parliament.
The bill before us today differs from the bill when it was first introduced in the previous session of parliament in March of this year. It was amended to respond to three of the six recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The bill now provides that the period within which an emergency authorisation must be brought before a judge or an Administrative Appeals Tribunal member for approval be 48 hours rather than two business days. This was mentioned in recommendation 1 of the Senate committee report. 
It also provides for a new civil remedies provision which allows those who have suffered loss or injury as a result of illegal use of a surveillance device by the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Crime Commission to sue the Commonwealth. This is the product of recommendation 4 of the Senate committee. It also puts in place a requirement that surveillance device material held for more than five years be destroyed unless the chief officer certifies that it is still needed for a permitted purpose. This was as a result of recommendation 5 of the Senate committee report.
As I have mentioned, three of those recommendations were accepted. The remaining three were not adopted and those are as follows. Recommendation 2, which recommended that the Ombudsman be required to review records of all use, including warrantless use, of optical surveillance devices such as binoculars, cameras and others, was rejected because the bill already substantively does this. Clause 55 requires the Ombudsman to inspect all records to ensure compliance with the bill, and paragraphs 52(e) to 52(h) require that records be kept regarding all, including warrantless, surveillance device use. This recommendation it was thought was accordingly unnecessary. Any further record-keeping requirements would have been an onerous imposition on police operational capabilities.
Recommendation 3 of the Senate report recommended that both the bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act be amended to ensure that circumstances in which similar kinds of surveillance devices may be used are clearly described and that limitations on their respective use are also clear. This was rejected. It is not possible to make the situation more clear than it already is without harming the technological neutrality of both laws. As it stands, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 in its passage makes any interception of a communication over a telecommunications network an offence unless done with a warrant. The Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 states that nothing in this bill authorises anything for which a telecommunications interception warrant is required.
Recommendation 6 of the Senate committee report dealt with the destruction requirements in the bill and it recommended that those requirements be brought into line with the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. The government believes this was based on a misinterpretation of the Ombudsman's input to that committee. The provisions of this bill are already substantively in line with the destruction regime under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act with the exception of the new provision which responds to the Commonwealth's fifth recommendation. The Ombudsman was referring to a proposal about destruction requirements made by a member of the committee. It was this suggestion which was not in line with the T(I) Act, not the bill itself. I would thank the committee for its useful work in relation to this and acknowledge, of course, that it has a great workload and this has been one of many bills that it has reported on.
This bill also contains several other changes that have been made since it was first introduced in March this year. Aside from changes, which I have just outlined, made in response to the Senate committee's report, the bill now enables additional state law enforcement agencies—such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales and other similar anticorruption agencies—to obtain a surveillance device warrant for the investigation of Commonwealth offences, putting their powers in line with those available to the police forces of each state and territory. The definition of a `recovery order' has also been expanded beyond a reference to an order made under section 67U of the Family Law Act to include a warrant for the apprehension of a child under the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations 1986. This widens the definition to cover orders made by courts other than the Family Court. 
Furthermore, since the introduction of the bill in March provisions have been made which include child sex tourism as an offence for which an emergency authorisation can be sought where it is necessary to prevent the loss of evidence relevant to the investigation of such an offence. Of course, with recent events dealing with child pornography and prosecutions relating to child sex tourism, this has become an increasingly important area for law enforcement.
There were a number of other minor changes made in a bill that was introduced in June this year. I note that this bill differs in two respects from the version that was introduced into the parliament in June. Firstly, it complies with the new requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. That is a technical amendment. Secondly, it adds a new provision which prevents minor defects in warrants from rendering a warrant and any evidence gathered under it invalid. This provision is modelled on an equivalent provision in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. While the new provision will maintain the admissibility of evidence obtained under a warrant or authorisation containing a minor procedural defect or irregularity, it will not protect warrants with substantial defects from being declared invalid. Obviously, it is not good public policy for a minor defect in a warrant to have the effect that it could be ruled as inadmissible evidence and result in the failure of a prosecution. As I have stated, this does not change the situation where there are substantial defects.
The bill will provide law enforcement agencies at the Commonwealth, state and territory level with important tools that will enable real progress to be made in the war against serious crime, while at the same time it puts in place a stringent accountability regime. I note that the Democrats have a number of amendments to be moved in the committee stage. I think it best that we deal with those in turn on the arguments presented by the Democrats. I commend this bill to the Senate and thank senators for their contributions.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-11-30,"—My question is to Senator Campbell, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Does the minister recall his statement to the Senate yesterday that the successful funding provided to Primary Energy Pty Ltd for a grains-to-ethanol proposal was applied for and assessed through the Namoi Valley adjustment package? Is the minister aware that Minister Anderson released a media statement on 2 February this year in which he announced funding for three other projects under the Namoi Valley adjustment package and that the Namoi Valley structural adjustment package would be put on hold from that date? In the light of media reporting today, how can the Deputy Prime Minister explain why a $1.2 million project located in his electorate was assessed and approved in August through a program that he himself suspended in February? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-11-30,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister that I asked him whether he was aware that the Namoi Valley structural adjustment package was put on hold in February and that the announcement about rolling it into other programs was made in 2003. Can the minister advise the Senate why this grant is listed as an approved grant under the Regional Partnerships Program on the official departmental web site if, in fact, it was assessed and approved under the suspended Namoi Valley package. Is the minister aware that the New England and North West Area Consultative Committee also identifies the Regional Partnerships Program as the source of funding for the Gunnedah grains-to-ethanol proposal? Does the minister stand by his statement yesterday that this project was assessed and approved under the Namoi Valley structural adjustment package?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-11-30,"—Here we are again with the Labor Party criticising regional program funding that benefits the regions. Here is a project with a modest investment from the Commonwealth government which will leverage significant investment from the private sector, create a strong market for commodities from the region and create renewable energy for Australia, and yet Labor want to criticise, carp and whine. I gave an accurate answer on this issue yesterday. The Labor Party would say that this project was not assessed under any fair or independent assessment process, and Senator O'Brien has, of course, admitted today that we were right; it has been done. 
The reality is that the Namoi structural adjustment package was in fact rolled into the Regional Partnerships Program. This project had been assessed and, once again, rather than the Labor Party going out there, looking at the region and trying to assess the value of it in their own way, they would rather sit inside the airconditioned comfort of Parliament House or sit along the cappuccino strips of Sydney or Melbourne and criticise any money that goes out to regional Australia. What I want the Labor Party to do today, rather than to whinge, criticise and moan about money going from the coalition government to the regions to assist employment, the environment and the economic development and growth of the regions, and to support Australia outside the capital cities, is to actually own up and tell us which one of these projects they are going to put the kybosh on—which one of these projects they think should be put in the dustbin or eradicated, and then I will take them seriously.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-11-30,"—The problem the Labor Party have is that they do not like the fact that the coalition has been very successful at identifying problems in regional Australia. The problems, which we have assessed over eight years, require significant support from government. We have identified a range of very successful projects, be it the R.M. Williams centre, an equine centre or a rodeo complex in Mount Isa. There are a whole range of projects that can assist local communities—
—Mr President, on a point of order: I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the question. He is dealing with matters which are not germane to the question which was asked of him. He should assist the Senate by restricting his answer to the question which has been asked, and I ask you to draw the question to his attention. 
—As you know, I cannot direct a minister as to how to answer a question, but I can remind the minister that he has 32 seconds of time remaining, and I draw his attention to the question.
—Thank you, Mr President. I fully understand the question, but the Labor Party do not like the answer. The answer is that the Labor Party are again criticising funds that are flowing to the regions to support regional economies, economic growth, jobs growth and sustainability, and they do not like it. They want to spend the next few weeks analysing which program it was assessed under and which program it was delivered under. It is being delivered under the Regional Partnerships Program because it is an efficient program delivery system that has been independently analysed by the Auditor-General and a range of other independent experts to prove that it delivers.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-11-30,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
I suggest to the Senate that the imbroglio surrounding the Regional Partnerships program is getting deeper and deeper. If you were a public servant trying to administer this program I would not be surprised if you were somewhat perplexed in working out the basis for funding of projects under this program. In the eyes of many public servants there is an eye-watering stench surrounding this program. It is being seen increasingly as a slush fund for the National Party. Today we raised some questions concerning one project that I am particularly concerned about and that is the $1 million—$1.2 million when you include the GST—that has been paid to Primary Energy Pty Ltd and which was announced on 17 August this year by the Deputy Prime Minister. This was paid to Mr Matthew Kelley who is, I understand, a very close associate of the Deputy Prime Minister. He is a member of the government's ethanol task force and he has been associated with the Deputy Prime Minister for some time.
According to the ASIC records he was operating a one-dollar company. The government paid $1.2 million to a company with a paid-up share value of $1. According to these records, his principal place of residence, his registered office and his principal place of business are one and the same place. So it would appear from the ASIC records that he is working from home. That is a hell of an amount to be paid to work from home. I could be corrected on that if the ASIC records were up to date. The government has paid $1.2 million to this firm when no ASIC return has been lodged for 2003. Papers were sent to ASIC but they were sent back because they were not complete. 
We have a situation here where the administration of the program has now been seriously questioned on the basis that $1.2 million has been paid to a company for undertaking research projects by the CSIRO. This is in complete contradiction of the guidelines themselves, which are very explicit on this very point. We have a situation where the Deputy Prime Minister actually announced the money being paid to this company at a barbecue attended by the Prime Minister, along with 700 other persons. It was clearly aimed at the re-election of the government and the re-election of The Nationals members of the government. The grant is being paid in contravention of the guidelines and it is now being said that it has been authorised by the junior minister in Mr Anderson's portfolio, Mr Lloyd. If the truth be known, that is a mere technicality. The grants were administered, and it was stated publicly on all the various government documents, as a Regional Partnerships program. It was not a local government program. It was approved by Mr Lloyd on the basis that it was the senior minister's electorate that the money was being paid into.
We have had further advice today that the government says, `Yes, it may well be that these guidelines were in fact breached.' The guidelines are quite explicit that money cannot be paid for research work. The government acknowledges that, although it tries to duck and weave and say, `Maybe it was a prospectus or something like that.' The reality now appears to be that the government has a new set of guidelines, and this is really Monty Pythonesque. The government has a new set of guidelines called the SONA guidelines—`strategic opportunities national assessment' guidelines. These are the guidelines you have when you get into trouble on the main guidelines. These are the guidelines that override all other guidelines. When the government says that it is in the national interest—by which they mean The Nationals' sectional interest—you can override the stated guidelines, the published guidelines, and you can say that this is now a SONA project, and the paperwork says how to use the SONA guidelines. From March this year a new set of arrangements have been in place in this government. There has been no published documentation, no statement that there are overriding guidelines, but a secret set of protocols to public servants to override the stated public policy position as announced by the government with regard to regional programs.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-11-30,"—The latest rant from Senator Carr has drawn attention to three facts, all of which, if you take away the hysteria of Senator Carr's comments, reinforce the correctness of the government's decision in granting this money under the Regional Partnerships program. Senator Carr's first claim was that the junior minister—and that was at the time and still is Mr Jim Lloyd—had agreed to the grant. The process is well known within this government if you are dealing with a grant that is in your electorate. The Deputy Prime Minister undertook to have the matter dealt with by another minister in the portfolio. That is something that he did when I was in the portfolio in relation to some of these grants, as I recall. The minister is required—and it is what I did and what I am absolutely sure Mr Lloyd would do—to look at it with his fresh set of eyes and to ascertain that the grant was within the guidelines. That is what I did when these grants came before me and that is what Mr Lloyd has done also. Ultimately it is Mr Lloyd's name as the minister that is on the letter. He has approved it and under his responsibilities he has to make sure that that is the case. So what has Mr Anderson done? He has said, `It is in my electorate so I am going to hand it over to another minister to make his assessment of it.' Mr Lloyd took responsibility for it. This is what he has done. It is a proper and correct process that has been abided by. 
Secondly, Senator Carr has said, `This is in his electorate. It is a National Party sectional interest.' What he is really saying there is that if you happen to be in an electorate of The Nationals you should not get any regional grants. That is of course stupid. The Nationals represent significant areas of Australia—
—and the Liberal Party do as well, Senator Ferris. In fact I am told that the Liberal Party represent more regional electorates than any other party in Australia. If you are a Liberal Party minister like me and want to deliver a grant to Western Australia, because that is my electorate, you are saying we should exclude Western Australia from receiving grants because I happen to represent Western Australia. If you happen to be Warren Truss, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, you should not have any grants to his electorate because he happens to be minister there. It is an absurd nonsense, a nonsense generated by a political party that have no understanding of probity or of proper process. They have been so long out of government that the normal processes of government are absolutely unfamiliar to them.
It also shows a political party absolutely out of contact with regional and rural Australia, as I said during question time. They live in the inner-city suburbs. They spend all their time sipping cappuccinos and wondering what they can do to further wreak havoc on regional and rural Australia. This is the political party under Mr Hawke and Mr Keating that totally destroyed the economy of Australia, drove interest rates up above 20 per cent for farmers and other people out there in regional Australia and wiped out a whole generation in regional Australia. Now they are in opposition they want to keep doing it. They will not give any credit where it is due.
The third point he makes is that the company operates from a farm in regional Australia and that, because he lives on the farm and he runs his business from the farm, he should not get support for a regional project. The reality, as you know better than most of your comrades opposite, Mr Deputy President, is that most people in regional and rural Australia run their businesses from their home. And what is the home called? It is called the homestead or the farmhouse. They have got a kitchen table there and they are the ones who sit there working hard day and night trying to figure out how they are going to reinvigorate their regional communities. Here is an Australian who has come forward with a project which will provide 50 permanent jobs and 350 indirect jobs in a massive benefit for the environment and a massive benefit for the community. Yet here are the Labor Party, who were wiped out at the last election because regional and rural Australia said, `We don't want these people running the economy again. We don't want to risk having these guys back in charge,' showing why they are so out of touch.
Senator Carr has also described to us very well that this project matched the guidelines. Senator Carr is now saying that he has discovered the guideline under which it was approved but he does not like the guideline. You do not think we should approve projects that have a national interest. We believe in supporting the local interest. We believe in supporting the regional interest and we believe in supporting the national interest. I would like to get Senator Carr or anyone who has the guts on the Labor Party side to say that this project would be cancelled under Labor.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-11-30,"—The Labor Party has moved to take note of the answers to a number of questions relating to financial mismanagement by this government. In question time today I raised an important issue which was arrogantly dismissed by the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin. I raised the latest Auditor-General's report, No. 15, which contained scathing criticisms of the financial management of a range of government departments and entities. Let me summarise what some of those criticisms were: drawings by five departments or entities relying on incorrect appropriations in 1998-99 to 2002-03 totalling $393 million; spending of $7.26 billion by one department against legislation that had not been passed by parliament—a pretty serious matter; spending of $23 million by two entities that was not approved by parliament, including $6.96 million in breach of section 83 of the Constitution—an illegal expenditure; and failure to disclose payments by two entities totalling $13.1 billion and $26.6 billion. There is a long list of financial mismanagement identified in the Auditor-General's report. 
It was the finance minister's response that these were all merely technical matters. That is not what the Auditor-General's report says. It says:
While many of the issues are quite technical, in a legal sense there are important considerations of appropriate accountability, including transparency ...
The report goes on to say that there are:
... significant shortcomings in the financial management of various Special Appropriations.
My colleague Senator Kirk posed a very important and detailed question on an issue which does impact significantly on the budget, and that related to Centrelink expenditures. The representational minister, Senator Patterson, was asked why it was—and this was identified in the Auditor-General's report—that Centrelink, through failing to obtain forward estimates from its clients, was running a $250 million overdraft for part of its funding purposes. Secondly, this overdraft was not authorised. Centrelink was running an illegal overdraft at the rate of a $250 million daily debit balance. It is extraordinary that a government instrumentality such as Centrelink would be running a daily debit balance of $250 million for expenditures when the budget is in surplus. Why would you do that? It seems extraordinary financial incompetence for Centrelink to run an overdraft in those circumstances.
Senator Kirk asked whether the minister knew of this. Did the minister authorise this illegal overdraft operation at the rate of $250 million each day? Senator Kirk went on to ask the cost of this overdraft. What was the interest being paid? It is here that Senator Patterson, in response, demonstrated that she apparently did know something about it. She assured the Senate that she knew what the interest rate was. She would not disclose what it was. It is absolutely ridiculous and absurd financially to be running an overdraft at the rate of $250 million per day. The Labor Party wants to know what the interest rate was. What was the interest bill? Was this overdraft authorised by the minister? If so, the Auditor-General said it was illegal—it was being operated illegally. This is a very important issue. It is not just some trifling amount of money, as Senator Minchin arrogantly dismissed it as being. It is financial incompetence of the first order to be running an illegal overdraft at a daily rate of $250 million. The Labor opposition wants some answers. This is part of wide-ranging, serious and scathing criticism by the Auditor-General of the incompetent financial management by the Department of Finance and Administration of devolved financial arrangements for government departments.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-11-30,"—I rise to speak on Senator Carr's motion to take note of answers. We have been in parliament one week—the first week was taken up by pomp and ceremony and in this second week we are right into the nitty-gritty of the business. We on this side are waiting to see some sort of form from the Labor Party—some sort of spark of interest, some sort of connection between the electorate and the ALP. It is the party that once represented rural Australia. In fact, it was born in rural Australia out of the shearers strike in the 1890s. It has certainly left its past behind. When I first joined the National Party we could go and get a game of cricket at Goondiwindi with the ALP. We used to have a yearly game of cricket with the ALP. Unfortunately, they do not have a team anymore. They have been sidelined because no-one in rural Australia wants to belong to the ALP.
If you sat here for this first week of parliament you could understand why, because since we have been back here this opposition have done only two things. The first is to bag their own leader. He has been called everything from a dead parrot to a mangy dog, and it goes on and on. The second, their other big policy projection, has been: `Let's try to attack the Regional Partnerships program.' I can't see why you are doing this. I can't see who it is impressing, I can't see it getting any votes and I can't see where it is taking you. It is disappointing that the Labor Party cannot even think of these things themselves. They have to depend on an Independent, Mr Windsor, the member for New England, to come up with some ideas so that they can tag along on his shirt tails to get some forward momentum.
The project that is under discussion at the moment started in the early 1990s when the New South Wales government made cuts to the water sharing plan in the Namoi Valley of about 78 per cent, leaving about 22 per cent of the water allocation there. It said that was going to cost the agricultural sector of the valley some $400 million in the life of that water sharing plan. So the New South Wales government put forward a Namoi water sharing plan and tried to come up with some packages that would assist the industry in the Namoi Valley. The package was placed on hold in 2004. The Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package was designed to assist the community to adjust. That is the background of the program. It was needed. There had been a 78 per cent cut in water allocation, down to 22 per cent, and independent assessors believed that $400 million was going to be cut out of the economy of the valley, so we decided we would do something.
I said yesterday in a similar debate: when John Anderson became leader of this party he said there were two Australias. One Australia was the cities, where the economy was moving and jobs and job opportunities were plentiful; but in the other, rural and regional Australia, the economy was moving at a different pace. So they put through these regional partnerships to assist the economy, give the economy a leg-up, balance the good times that were going in Australia and try to give rural and regional Australia some assistance. But all we have ever got out of it from the Labor Party is one bucket after the next.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-11-30,"—Senator Boswell referred to his past and took us on a bit of a trip down memory lane. I can recall back in earlier days when I was a young bloke watching a TV program called TheThree Stooges with Moe, Larry and Curly. We just saw them over there from The Nationals, sitting in the corner—the three stooges; an absolute joke. They are such a joke they are not taken seriously at all by anybody in this parliament. They sit here day after day in the Senate with nothing really to say. Today they have come in and Senator Boswell has sort of attempted to defend his colleague in the other place, Minister Anderson, but he has done a rather pathetic job of it. There is not one member of the Liberal Party government here to listen to the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate except the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, who has to be here.
—He's on duty.
—He's on duty. And the Liberal Party Whip. I am sure there are people listening to this debate. If you could see the looks on their faces. They have their heads buried in their papers. They were taking absolutely no notice at all of their country colleagues, The Nationals, because they are irrelevant. I listened to Senator Boswell's speech last night about what he saw as the future of the ethanol industry—a speech that is relevant to what was being discussed here in question time today. Senator Boswell had to get up in the Senate and make a speech in the address-in-reply debate outlining his policy views on the future of ethanol and biodiesel fuel in this country. He had to do that here in the Senate because obviously he cannot get those ideas anywhere through the coalition party room—nobody is listening. What an extraordinary way to try to put The Nationals policy down for discussion within the coalition.
I want to come back to the specific question that was asked by Senator O'Brien of Minister Campbell today regarding the funding for the proposed ethanol plant at Gunnedah. What is at issue here is accountability and probity. What is at issue here is the public's right to know and to feel confident that public money that is being given by way of grants is being allocated through a proper process of accountability. Clearly, when you look at the funding for this ethanol plant, and if you look at a range of other projects, a lot is left to be desired. For instance, yesterday the minister advised the Senate that the successful funding that was provided to Primary Energy Pty Ltd for the grains to ethanol proposal had been applied for and assessed through what was known as the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package. The problem with that answer yesterday is that that very adjustment package had been suspended on 2 February this year. But the funding was approved in August, only a couple of months ago. If you go to the web site, it says that the approval was from the Regional Partnerships program. So the minister cannot actually give us the true facts of how this project was funded. The reason he cannot is that the ground rules and the guidelines have been ignored and have been changed on the way through.
That of course is what has happened with many projects. I recall that, when I was chairman of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, we investigated funding for a project down in the Eurobodalla Shire under the dairy RAP program. They brought back the project four or five times to try to find a way to fund it, because it never met the guidelines. In the end, Warren Truss, the minister at the time, found a way. Of course, it was demonstrated at the inquiry that the way it was done was completely inappropriate, and that is what has happened here. In the other place Mr Windsor has raised the same concerns in respect of the equine centre. There should be an inquiry into these matters. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2004-11-30,"—I seek leave to make a statement in relation to the consideration of message No. 4 from the House of Representatives relating to the appointment of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services.
Leave granted.
—Yesterday, when the motion was moved to re-establish the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I moved an amendment, which was put and passed, to change the structure of the committee by providing greater flexibility in terms of the government and the opposition respectively being able to nominate their members to this committee from the House of Representatives and the Senate. Although it was possible to appoint the committee on the basis of that amended resolution and still be consistent with the requirements of the ASIC Act, which does require currently a fixed number of members of the House and the Senate, concern has arisen that there is a potential within the terms of that resolution for the ASIC Act not to be complied with. In light of that concern, as I advised yesterday, it is now proposed that the ASIC Act be amended early next year to similarly provide that degree of flexibility but that, until that amendment occurs, the structure of the committee will remain as it traditionally has. Therefore, the motion that was put in its original form yesterday is the way in which the committee should be structured until that amendment to the act occurs.
On that basis, I seek leave to have the motion as it was put yesterday put again, and the amendment to that motion put again and negatived, to give effect to that intention for the current structure to apply. Then, when the ASIC Act is amended early next year, there will be an opportunity again to put a subsequent motion dealing with the structure of the committee so that both the ASIC Act and the motion establishing the committee are in concert. At that time we will then be able to change membership of the committee to provide that greater flexibility should either the government or the opposition parties desire to change the balance in their numbers of members of the House and of the Senate constituting that committee.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-11-30,"—I move:
That the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulation 2004 (No. 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 2004 No. 121 and made under the Customs Act 1901, be disallowed.
The regulation which I am seeking to disallow enables the importation of dangerous dogs into Australia for what are deemed to be scientific purposes. Those dangerous dogs include the American pit bull, the Japanese tosa and the Argentinean and Brazilian fighting dogs. In seeking the logic behind the development of these regulations, the Democrats were told by the Minister for Justice and Customs that it was desirable to allow the potential import of these dangerous animals into Australia for scientific purposes. He then went on to write:
I understand that at this stage no immediate scientific purposes have been identified, which I consider is understandable given the absolute prohibition on imports that have existed for over a decade.
I guess the government is trying to be pre-emptive here and soften the complete import ban in advance of any possible application down the track to import these particular breeds of dogs for scientific purposes.
My view and the Democrats' view is that there have not been sufficient reasons given as to why we would want to relax this ban in any way, given the inadequate indications of what type of scientific research on these dogs may be required or desirable at any stage in the future. Indeed, there is no indication given as to why imported dogs of these particular breeds might be necessary for research, given that there are already significant numbers of these dogs present in Australia.
As far as I am aware, there has been no indication of any consideration of the possible impact on state legislation and regulations covering the ownership and use of these breeds of dogs, which in some jurisdictions have also been deemed to be potentially dangerous. I mention by way of example the Western Australian Dog (Restricted Breed) Regulations, made a couple of years ago under their Dog Act, which recognise a restricted breed of dog as a breed whose importation to Australia is prohibited under the Commonwealth Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. I do not know, and I would be interested if the minister could indicate, whether or not it has been verified that these regulations today are not going to have any impact on those Western Australian regulations. Similarly, currently in South Australia any person who gives away or sells, or advertises to sell or give away, any of the four breeds currently banned from import that are listed under this regulation is guilty of an offence. It is unclear how any scientific research on a dog imported under this regulation here today could operate in South Australia, given the state legislation that is already in existence.
I should emphasise, as I said before, that there is already in Australia a significant number of these breeds of dogs which have been deemed to be dangerous. There are inadequate protection and controls, in my view, over the use of dogs for research from some animal shelters. In 2000, South Australia's lost dogs home reported receiving 30 to 35 pit bull terriers each month—that is three times more than other breeds. Should the government wish to enable these breeds to be locked up for whatever experiments or research are deemed necessary, which are yet to be identified, I think there are already more than enough specimens existing in Australia. In my view there is still insufficient protection against how those dogs might be used for research and experimentation. We do not need to be importing more. 
There is no way in which the minister for customs or his department could possibly follow up to ensure that any dogs that are given a licence to be imported are actually used for the purposes described or, more importantly, that they are not also used for breeding either at the same time as the research is being conducted or after it is concluded. We do not have a proper national system for keeping track of the number and types of animals used in scientific research in Australia. Should we have national animal welfare laws established, as the Democrats have often advocated, beyond the piecemeal approach which is in existence at the moment from state to state—beyond the haphazard management which stretches across the agriculture, science, health, local planning and environment portfolios—we might have a legitimate baseline from which to make decisions around matters such as those proposed here today.
The government places a lot of reliance on the existence of animal ethics committees, saying that the ethics committees will approve any research and the minister has to ascertain that before they would permit the importation of dogs for scientific purposes. I would suggest that the minister see if he could be provided with the actual number and species of animals in experimental facilities in Australia today. The fact is that the minister could not do that, because they are not able to be produced, because the system we have is so piecemeal and not monitored and overseen on a national level. I do not seek to make any specific criticism of animal ethics committees; I served on an animal ethics committee at Griffith University in Queensland. But the fact is that there is no national oversight and register of all of these experiments that are approved by different animal ethics committees. Different committees work at different levels of efficiency and effectiveness. Once the approval is given by those committees for potential research, the ability to follow up and genuinely oversee and ensure that animals are used in the way that it is said they will be, and particularly that they are disposed of afterwards in the way it is said they will be, is less than perfect.
There is already a lot of debate and concern in Australia about the habit of some pounds—not all, by any means, but some—to, after dogs are dropped off, pass on those dogs for research purposes for experimentation in places like veterinary schools. People might say that if the dogs are going to be put down anyway then they may as well be used for training purposes for vets. I will not go into that argument here because there are broader issues, but the fact is there are currently not sufficient controls in Australia to properly monitor the situation or even know what is happening let alone to properly regulate the use or control of dogs in Australia for scientific research. In that situation, I do not believe we should be adding to the number of dogs that we bring into the country for this purpose.
On what I believe is a related matter—some may not see it as completely relevant to the current debate but I think it is germane—we do not have a proper system in place in Australia for companion animal management. We are saying here that the dogs we are proposing to import are not companion dogs but are for research. But the broader problem is about why some of these dogs are deemed to be dangerous and why in these circumstances, beyond having a blanket national ban on the importation of certain breeds, we do not have a proper coherent system for tracking animals and for companion animal management. There was a report in the Age just yesterday which showed that we still have not managed to get a simple, workable, single system for pet identification within Australia and for tracking of companion animals between states. That again brings us back to the problem that, once these dogs are allowed into Australia, there is no real mechanism for ensuring that they are tracked or are used for the purpose that it was said they were going to be used—even if that is legitimate, which is a separate debate—and that they are not also used for breeding stock. 
Senators would probably be aware that there is some community contention about the approach of banning certain breeds of dogs that are deemed to be dangerous, such as the American pit bull or these fighting dogs. The facts are certainly very important. Over 30,000 dog attacks were reported nationally in the year 2000 and by far the vast majority of those attacks were on children under 10 years of age. In the same year, the South Australian Health Commission released a report confirming dog attacks were the second most common cause of hospital admissions for children. It is believed that pit bull terriers were responsible for four of the seven dog attacks in Australia in the decade between 1990 and 2000 in which people have died—a higher death rate, I might note, than occurs from shark attack.
I believe that these figures and this problem are very much a result of a lack of responsibility on the part of pet owners rather than any inherent danger in dogs in general, but it all goes to highlight the lack of an overall national system of management of companion animals and dog breeds. I do not think we should be opening up a loophole to allow the importation of certain breeds of dogs that have been deemed to be dangerous when there is not a proper and adequate mechanism for following up or keeping track of those dogs or a proper mechanism for ensuring that the use of animals in research is justified in terms of that research. I do not think we should be expanding the numbers of animals at all. In light of these figures and in light of the lack of a proper national system for regulating the use of animals in experimentation, I hope the Senate would understand why I believe there should be a very good reason given for relaxing the ban on imports of the most dangerous breed of dogs, however slim the risk it may present might seem. I am yet to be convinced that the government has such a reason.
I am not convinced that all of the animal experimentation that is done in Australia, particularly on larger animals such as dogs, is done properly or is necessary. There is no national mechanism for overseeing all of that. Adding more dogs to the list or having more dogs potentially subjected to that experimentation is not something that I see as particularly desirable unless clear reasons are given. There have been no reasons given at all, beyond the suggestion that maybe somebody down the track might want to so we may as well relax it now in case they do.
Similarly, with regard to concern about having these dangerous dog breeds in Australia, the ban was put in place some years ago, presumably for the very good reason that we did not want to have more of these dogs within Australia. The longer the ban is in place, the more difficult it is for people who want that breed of dog to find a purebred version. In such circumstances and given that we do not have proper national controls and proper ways of tracking the animals once they come into Australia, relaxing the ban is, again, something I do not see as desirable or necessary, even if the risk is slim, unless a clear, strong reason is given. I certainly have not heard or seen any strong reason—or even a weak reason, frankly—from the government side. Hence, I have moved this disallowance motion.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—The opposition have taken a very careful look at this. We are minded, in this instance, to support the disallowance motion of Senator Bartlett. This is for a number of reasons, which I will go to briefly. In the first instance, the purpose of the motion, it seems to us, is to relax customs regulations prohibiting the import of dangerous dogs, such as pit bull terriers, for scientific purposes. The question that is raised is that there must be a live issue about scientific purposes being required at this particular juncture—this ban has been in for some time. We took it on face value and we sought advice from the regulations themselves as to the reasons for the relaxation of the customs regulation in this instance. They were unfortunately a little unclear. Having been on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I would have liked the opportunity to have a look at what they said as well, but time is always against us in these issues.
I then thought that the next best bet was to ask the Minister for Justice and Customs about the reasons for the relaxation of this particular regulation. Without going into any significant detail, there does not seem to have been a cogent reason put forward by the government. I would have thought—looking at the type of regulation—that it would be a live issue, perhaps an educational institution or some other scientific body seeking the importation of a particular dog for a reason which then required the relaxation. I would have thought that there was a significant issue that would militate against the reasons for not allowing these dogs in.
The reasons for not allowing these dogs in are quite clear. These types of dogs were banned in the first place because, according to the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Australia, children aged under 12 are most at risk of dog attacks and children aged one to four years have the highest rate of injury. Most serious injuries from dog attacks are to the child victim's head and face and these injuries often leave substantial scars. Peter Thomson et al in their 1997 study found that 90 per cent of children admitted to hospital from dog bites suffered injuries to the face or head. It is a big step for relaxation of the regulation to occur after it has been in for so long.
There are four breeds of dog explicitly banned from import under the current regulations. That instrument includes the dogo argentine, the fila brazileiro, the japanese tosa and the pit bull terrier. All of these dogs have been specifically bred from fighting breeds and can be particularly dangerous. I think everyone here and anyone listening would agree. One of the breeds, for example, was banned because it has the behavioural characteristic of extreme aversion to strangers and in many cases is liable to bite anyone who touches it, outside of those whom it considers immediate family. There is a history in relation to these particular dogs. I will not go into it in detail but, for instance, pit bull terriers, known for their stubborn attacks and aggressiveness, are supposed to be able to exert about 680 kilograms of pressure with jaws that lock like a steel trap—several times greater than that of a german shepherd.
It is true that a dog attack can happen; but these dogs are capable of doing much greater damage than can a fox terrier. That is why they have been banned and continue to be banned as imports. Dangerous dogs pose a significant threat to both domestic urban Australia and rural and regional Australia. The idea of lifting the ban, without any specified reason given and without the minister providing any detailed or cogent argument, deserves far more scrutiny than simply relaxing customs regulations. Given that the purpose is to relax the customs regulation prohibiting the import of dangerous dogs, you would expect that there would at least be some reasonable reason put forward to answer the usual things that we might ask in here: why, who, where, what and when? 
In this instance, as I have said, we have not been able to ascertain a reason from the minister other than the broad response that we have received. It certainly did not go to whether there was any broad consultation with interested groups or whether the scientific community had a specific use for these dogs. It did not go to any specific measures or safeguards to ensure that these dogs do not escape into the community or interbreed with domestic pets or whether there has been consultation even with wool growers, agricultural growers or anyone else. It is not a case of saying, `It's a minor regulation and we think there might be a use at some point.' We think the onus is on the government to demonstrate clearly why it should have the regulation and also to demonstrate that there has been consultation and that it knows who might be interested in importing the breeds so that it can ensure that this is dealt with in a reasonable way.
If the government does know all of that, it should put that on the table and inform the Senate of the reasons. We can then deal with it on its merits and determine our position accordingly. It seems that someone might have thought it was a good idea, but without any justification. If there is a justification, it should be provided; otherwise it is just a way of adding more red tape to the whole system: `We'll just have a customs regulation because we think we might need it.' It is a bit like a back-pocket amendment. Until there is a need, there is nothing to consider. Should the government have a particular need for an amending regulation, we would consider it on its merits. But, in this instance, there cannot be any merit because the government cannot demonstrate any need.
The proposed changes therefore—I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time on this—appear to be, from at least a short look at them, a waste of time and should not have been made in the first instance. Labor will support the motion of Senator Bartlett in this instance. We will add the caveat that this could change if a demonstrable need or reason is put to us as to why there should be a regulation for the importation of such banned dogs as these for scientific purposes. The government can always come back and do that. The onus is on the government to do that. We will not allow amendments such as this one.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS) AMENDMENT REGULATION 2004 (NO. 3)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2004-11-30,"—The import prohibition on dangerous dogs was introduced over 10 years ago as a measure to protect the community from dangerous breeds of fighting dogs, as has been discussed here so far this afternoon. The effect of the regulation was to deny the import of four breeds of dangerous dogs in all cases, including for legitimate research needs. The amendment to the regulation empowers the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, or a person authorised by him, to grant permission to import dangerous dogs only for scientific purposes.
The explanatory statement that was issued for the amending regulation advises that `scientific purposes' was defined in the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. The code applies to all those activities performed to acquire, develop or demonstrate knowledge or techniques in any scientific discipline, including activities for the purpose of teaching, field trials, environmental studies, research, diagnosis, product testing and the production of biological products. The regulations require the minister to take into account whether the establishment that proposes to use the dog conforms with the code and whether the scientific purpose has been approved by the animal ethics committee established in accordance with the code. 
The purpose of the code is to ensure the humane care of animals used for scientific purposes. It encompasses all aspects of the care and use of or interaction with animals for scientific purposes in medicine, biology, agriculture, veterinary and other animal sciences. I have been advised that the code sets out specific requirements concerning the acquisition and care of animals—including, importantly, a requirement that pens, cages and containers be escape proof and maintained in good repair. The amendment regulation maintains the public safety objective of the control, as it would not allow the import of dangerous dogs for companionship or other recreational or commercial breeding purposes. I understand that at this stage no immediate scientific purposes have been identified, which is quite understandable given the absolute prohibition that had existed for over a decade. However, the permission based arrangement is a prudent public policy approach to allow a timely and considered response with respect to legitimate and ethical scientific purposes as they arise.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS) AMENDMENT REGULATION 2004 (NO. 3)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-11-30,"—I thank the Labor Party for their pending support for the Democrats' disallowance motion. I do not believe anything the government representative said then seriously addressed the concerns that I have. This is not the most major issue the Senate is going to debate today or in the next couple of weeks, but it is nonetheless an appropriate matter for us to consider. I am pleased that Labor is supporting this disallowance motion to prevent dangerous dogs from being imported into Australia for scientific purposes in the future. I think it is a bit unfortunate that Labor is willing to wave through the Senate a whole raft of other legislation that is dramatically expanding—with grossly inadequate controls—the powers of the government in the areas of police and intelligence agencies to spy on Australians, but at least it is willing to support us in preventing the government having this small extra discretion in another area where there are not adequate controls. I thank Labor for that. I reinforce my point that this emphasises the need for a more coherent system, for a national approach, overseeing the use of animals in experimentation, tracking them and justifying that use much more than is done currently.

	(b)	an emergency authorisation does not authorise the use of force unless it specifically authorises the use of force.
These amendments seek to place some limitations on the use of force and of entry to premises for the purpose of installing, using and maintaining surveillance devices. Like the use of surveillance devices generally, which is highly intrusive, gaining entry to private premises and the use of force are highly intrusive practices. In its current form the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 provides that a warrant authorises the entry, by force if necessary, to the premises and to other specified premises adjoining or providing access to the premises. In other words, the police—acting under a warrant—are able to forcibly enter the premises of law-abiding Australians simply because those people might live next door to someone who is suspected of a criminal offence. The Democrats believe that the privacy and rights of law-abiding Australians should be protected to the greatest extent possible. The very significant intrusions permitted by this bill are said by the government to be justified by the overriding need to bring to justice those who commit serious criminal offences. Accordingly, in our view the intrusions permitted by the bill should as far as possible be targeted at those who commit such offences.
We believe that issues such as the use of force and entry to premises are issues which a judge or AAT member authorising a warrant should be required to turn his or her mind to. A requirement in the legislation that warrants should expressly authorise the use of force and specify each premises onto which entry is permitted will ensure that judicial officials who grant warrants will need to consider whether in each case the use of force and/or entry to premises is strictly necessary in order to install, use, maintain or retrieve a surveillance device. It may be that in some cases there is a less intrusive means by which the surveillance device can be installed and used, and in those cases the warrant should not authorise the use of force. It is that area that these Democrat amendments seek to address. In summary, they will provide that the use of force and entry to premises are not permitted unless they are expressly authorised in the warrant. In addition, they will put beyond any doubt that all premises to which entry is authorised must be specified in the warrant.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—The government's position is that it opposes these amendments on the basis that the provisions that are proposed by the Democrats would make it impossible for law enforcement to carry out their duties under this legislation and other legislation. At present the warrant which authorises entry onto specified premises may also authorise entry to adjoining premises for the purpose of access to those premises. In this case the adjoining premises must be specified in the warrant. I refer to clause 18(2)(a)(ii). Democrat amendment (12) appears to be confined to warrants relating to premises but amendment (13) makes it clear that this amendment must also be intended to apply to warrants in relation to object and persons, even though no amendments to clauses 18(2)(b)(ii) and 18(2)(c)(ii) have been proposed. Democrat amendment (13) precludes entry onto premises unless this is specifically authorised by the warrant and the use of force is specifically authorised. It would appear that this amendment would contradict the statutory authority afforded in clauses 18(2)(b) and 18(2)(c). In the case of warrants relating to specified persons or objects, it would not usually be known which premises it would be necessary to enter to execute a warrant—that is, it is quite often the case that law enforcement officers will be presented with a situation on their arrival where flexibility is needed for them in order to carry out their relevant duties.
If this amendment were accepted, law enforcement officers would be unable to execute the warrant because the premises on which a vehicle, for instance, was sitting would not be specified in the warrant even though that vehicle was just one metre from the public footpath. To preserve flexibility the government believes that law enforcement officers must have reasonable powers of entry subject to the constraints imposed by the warrant. In relation to the use of force, a warrant at present allows the use of force if necessary to gain entry onto any premises on which entry is permitted. The reference to `if necessary' ensures that any use of force is proportional and constrained by the purposes of the warrant. It will, however, not usually be possible to know ahead of time whether force will be needed to gain entry. Again, this is another of those situations where law enforcement is presented with a set of circumstances upon its arrival. It is something that you cannot ascertain without signalling your shots and, in fact, alerting those people under investigation to what is happening. The government believes therefore that if these amendments were to be adopted, it would make the situation unworkable for law enforcement. I can see the reason the Democrats propose them but, at the end of the day, the government opposes these amendments for the stated reasons.",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—As I understand it, Democrat amendment (12) would add two matters to the list of matters that a surveillance device warrant must contain. The first is details of any additional premises such as adjoining premises or those which are contiguous onto which entry may be required to access the premises on which the surveillance device will be used. The second is whether the warrant authorises the use of force. In relation to the first matter, we note that clause 18(2) of the bill provides that a warrant authorises the entry onto specified premises adjoining or providing access to the primary premises and, furthermore, clause 18(5) provides that if the premises belong to a person who is not the subject of the investigation, the eligible authority may not authorise interference with these premises unless satisfied that that is necessary. We think that the provisions in the bill address that first amendment in any event. 
In relation to the second matter, we note the bill provides for limited use of force if necessary to enter premises or to install maintenance or retrieve surveillance devices or enhance equipment. It does not authorise force to be applied to a person. That seems to be the import of the statute; the bill seems clear. Indeed, such force would not make sense in a covert surveillance operation or in many other circumstances where there is surveillance. It may of course not be possible for a law enforcement agency or eligible authority to know in advance whether force would be needed to enter a property or install a device. Of course, because of the way legislation is sometimes proposed, that is always difficult to ascertain from an operational sense. Some of the matters, as I think I have alluded to earlier in this debate, go to operational issues. Although I can understand the direction from which the Democrats are coming, it is a matter that has to be left to the law enforcement agencies which have proper protocols and procedures to ensure that they do these things according to the rule book and according to the legislation as well. For those reasons the opposition cannot support the amendment.
In relation to a proposed amendment, we are concerned that a 30-day bar on fresh warrants is arbitrary and that it could in fact prejudice investigations. The bill provides that an eligible authority considering a warrant application must take into account any previous warrants, and we believe this existing provision is appropriate. For those reasons we do not think that amendment is appropriate in this instance. Democrat amendments (20), (21) and (22) are equivalent to amendments (12) and (13) except that they apply to retrieval warrants for retrieving a surveillance device. For the reasons given earlier, we are similarly not prepared to support them. Amendment (26) relates to the emergency authorisation equivalent of earlier amendments relating to warrants and retrieval warrants. For the same reasons I have articulated, we are not minded to support it.

(15)	Clause 19, page 23 (after line 1), at the end of the clause, add:

Amendments (14) and (15) reflect the Democrats' concerns that under this legislation it would be possible for someone to be subject to continuous surveillance, and I spoke to that in my speech in the second reading debate. This is because there is no limit on the number of extensions that could be granted in respect of a surveillance device warrant. While there is some protection against indefinite detention arising from the need to satisfy a judge or AAT member that the warrant is still required, we Democrats feel that there is still a need to include a maximum period for the operation of a surveillance warrant. We have set that period at 180 days or roughly six months. If a person has been the subject of a surveillance warrant for a period of six months, a new warrant cannot be issued in respect of them for a period of a month. We feel that this is an important amendment which will ensure that the police only use these intrusive powers for the efficient collection of evidence relating to serious offences or child recovery. ",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—Amendment (15) provides that a warrant may not be in force for more than 180 days and, at the end of such a period, a new warrant may not be issued for a period of 30 days. In relation to the former issue, we note that clause 17(1)(ix) provides, I think, that a warrant may not be granted for a period exceeding 90 days, and clause 19(1) provides for the application for an extension not exceeding 90 days. There is no limit to the number of applications which may be made in these instances. This is consistent with the model legislation. I think it is important to note that the joint working group did not receive any submissions opposing this particular provision. The amendment would make this bill inconsistent with the model legislation in a way that the opposition would find it could not support.
In relation to the second matter, we are concerned that a 30-day bar on fresh warrants becomes, as I think I indicated earlier, very arbitrary and could prejudice investigations. This bill provides that an eligible authority considering a warrant application must take into account any previous warrants in relation to the same investigation.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—We believe these amendments, if adopted, would cause problems in relation to the operation of the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 and the duties imposed on law enforcement. We do not believe it makes any sense to interrupt the surveillance for 30 days and then have a resumption of it. We believe that, really, it should be in place for as long as it is needed, and that is borne out by the fact that some covert, controlled operations can go on for some time. An aspect might be drugs—a house might be under surveillance for quite a lengthy period of time—and we believe that should not be interfered with just because of some arbitrary demarcation of time. For that reason, we believe that the provisions in relation to the Surveillance Devices Bill are appropriate.

(17)	Clause 22, page 26 (line 6), after “lawfully”, insert “or unlawfully”.
This amendment relates to the retrieval of surveillance devices and, in particular, what to do in the event that a surveillance device has been unlawfully installed. Proposed section 22(1) of the bill currently provides that a law enforcement officer may apply for the issue of a retrieval warrant in respect of surveillance devices which have been lawfully installed. We are concerned about circumstances in which a surveillance device has not been lawfully installed—for example, if it is discovered that there were some irregularities with the original application warrant. While we obviously do not want to encourage the unlawful installation of surveillance devices, we suspect that this is something which may happen from time to time. In those circumstances, the illegality of the surveillance device is likely to prevent any evidence obtained from being used in court. However, we do believe that it should be open to the police to apply for a retrieval warrant to retrieve the unlawfully installed device. We note that proposed section 22(1) specifically targets circumstances in which a surveillance device warrant has expired and, therefore, the police no longer have any power to enter the premise or use force to retrieve the device. We believe it makes sense to extend this subsection to circumstances in which the police lack that power because the device has been unlawfully installed. ",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—I think the situation outlined is where someone has unlawfully put in something such as a surveillance device. I guess we could name one of them, but we will use the broad example of surveillance devices, which covers all of them. If they have done it unlawfully, it would seem inappropriate for them to then go and get a search warrant, sneak back in—although I am sure the law enforcement officers will object to me using that expression—and retrieve it. It would seem more sensible for them to put up their hand and say, `We've unlawfully installed a device.' The person may then want to claim that device and use it in civil proceedings for the unlawful installation or for whatever might be on it, but that is a matter for a future occurrence. I do not want to encourage any litigation.
It would be more sensible, more proper and more appropriate for the police. I think even the judge in that instance would say, `Well, if it was unlawfully installed, you need to put your hand up and go and tell the people that that's what's happened and follow due process'—wherever that might lead them—rather than try to use the statute to retrieve an unlawfully installed device. I think if that has occurred—it might be for a technicality or for a whole range of issues: wrong place, wrong time or whatever it might be—that is the better and more appropriate way to deal with it.",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

We prefer the regime as outlined in this bill, and we oppose the Democrat amendment.

These amendments seek to enhance the information contained in the written record of an emergency authorisation. The Democrats believe that this record should contain the same details that are required by clause 17 in respect of a normal warrant. We believe that this information will be important not only to the judge or AAT member who must consider whether approval should be granted but also in any court of law where the admissibility of the evidence is subsequently challenged. Perhaps, most importantly, amendment (25) requires the record of an emergency authorisation to set out the reasons why it was considered necessary to provide the emergency authorisation—in other words, the reasons for the urgency. We believe that this is a means by which to ensure a greater level of accountability in the granting of emergency authorisations, and we believe that it will help to ensure that such authorisations are only granted in situations involving genuine urgency. ",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—As I understand it, amendment (24) would require the record of an emergency authorisation under clause 31 to include the same information required by clause 17 in respect of a warrant. It seems to me that no useful purpose would be served if the information were already there. Not all of the matters in clause 17 would be applicable to emergency situations. You could imagine circumstances outside of clause 17 where an emergency situation might arise and require authorisation that would not be covered. If you step to the next process, the law enforcement authority must then apply within 48 hours—it used to be two business days—for approval of the emergency authorisation and, if desired, a warrant for the further use of the surveillance device. 
That application contains all the details and the information that is provided to justify why they require a warrant. That will stand or fall on the merits of the particular application before the AAT member or judge, as the case may be. Under clause 31 the authorising officer has an onus to ensure that it is an emergency and provide a written record accordingly that that is the basis for the warrant. All warrants have got to come back to the judge in this instance to demonstrate their bona fides, and if they want a further warrant then they have got to apply. That seems to be the way the system worked and it seems to have merit. We do not see any additional benefit served by the amendments in this instance. Therefore, we are not in a position to support them.",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—The government oppose these amendments. We do not believe emergency authorisations need to be recorded in any greater detail because, within 48 hours of granting those authorisations, such authorisations must come before a judge or a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for approval. It is at that point that aspects of the authorisation, including the grounds on which approval is sought, must be included in the affidavit to the judge or the AAT member. There is a record in clause 31 dealing with emergency authorisations. We believe that that is sufficient. For those reasons we believe the bill has a sufficient safeguard in relation to the reporting of detail for those emergency authorisations and the government do not agree with the Democrats' proposed amendments.

(28)	Clause 35, page 38 (lines 12 and 13), omit “, not being a manner that involves the destruction of that information”.
This amendment applies to the consequential orders that can be made by a judge or AAT member who does not give approval to an emergency authorisation. Clause 35(5) currently provides that a judge or AAT member in those circumstances may order that any information from or relating to the exercise of powers under the emergency authorisation be dealt with in a specific manner, not being a manner that involves the destruction of that information. It is important to remember that we are talking about information obtained from the use of a surveillance device which has not been approved by a judge or AAT member—in other words, the judge or AAT member has concluded that the situation did not warrant the emergency authorisation.  
The emergency authorisation mechanism has been included in the bill to address situations of genuine urgency, not as a general alternative to obtaining a judicial warrant. The requirement for emergency authorisations to be subsequently approved by a judge or AAT member is a vital safeguard against any potential abuse of this power. We Democrats feel that, where evidence has been obtained pursuant to an emergency authorisation which has not been approved, a judge or AAT member should have the discretion to order that the evidence be destroyed. It is highly unlikely that such evidence would be admissible in any criminal proceedings, and in that case there is a strong argument that the wrongfully obtained evidence should be destroyed. Our amendment does not require the evidence to be destroyed. However, it does give the judge or AAT member the discretion to order the destruction of material, if that is appropriate in the circumstances. This was an issue that was expressly referred to in the discussion paper produced by the joint working group, which was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers Council to prepare model legislation.
The joint working group argued that investing a judge or AAT member with the power to order the destruction of records would provide `an additional safeguard if the law enforcement agency obtains material that falls outside the ... approval.' For that reason we Democrats believe that this amendment is an important one which should help to guard against the use of wrongfully obtained evidence. It is consistent with the views of the joint working group and for those reasons I think the committee should give it consideration.",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

The amendment in this instance would enable the eligible authority to order the destruction of information obtained by the use of a surveillance device under an emergency authorisation which is not subsequently approved.

	(aa)	any information obtained from the use of a surveillance device without a warrant under Part 4; or
One of the most important aspects of this bill is that it limits the way in which evidence obtained through the use of surveillance devices can be used. Unfortunately these limitations do not apply to evidence obtained from all types of surveillance. Notably, evidence obtained by means of an optical surveillance device is not considered protected information for the purposes of this legislation and therefore is not subject to the same restrictions on the way in which it can be used. We Democrats disagree with this double standard for different types of surveillance devices. We believe that the covert videotaping of individuals going about their daily lives should be subjected to the same restrictions as other forms of surveillance. Accordingly, this amendment seeks to ensure that any information obtained through the use of a surveillance device without a warrant is treated as protected information.  ",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—The effect of the amendment would be to subject this information to the same restrictions which apply to information obtained where a warrant or authorisation is required. However, I think it is implicit within the bill—and you can recognise the way the bill has been drafted—that the information referred to would be obtained through lesser degrees of intrusion into the property and privacy of those under surveillance in those instances. The bill recognises that there are gradations of intrusion. There is that type of intrusion which is not significant and that which clearly is. In these circumstances we believe it is justified not to include this information in the protected information regime in the bill. 
You can recognise when there is a lesser degree of intrusion into the property and privacy of those under surveillance. The use of surveillance devices will stretch across a broad spectrum of circumstances, from binoculars and cameras right down to tracking or listening devices inside cars, vehicles or houses. There is a range of surveillance and I think the bill tries to encapsulate the whole range. With regard to the lesser type of intrusion the legislation tries to ensure that the rights are balanced all the way through rather than having a balance at the highest order which is not reflected at the lowest order of intrusion into property. I think the bill has achieved that balance as well as can be done. Therefore the bill achieves the objective of balancing the rights at the high end and at the lower end of intrusion. For those reasons we are not minded to support the amendment. 
The amendment would include in the category of protected information, information obtained by the use of a surveillance device where a warrant is not required under the legislation. Therefore the amendment would just add another layer so that the category at the higher end where a warrant is required is the same as the category at the lower end. I think you can clearly delineate between the two. The use of optical surveillance devices which do not involve entry onto premises or interference with property without permission and listening devices which record words heard by a law enforcement officer are the circumstances I am talking about, and it would seem that the way the bill is structured is a fair representation and a fair balance of people's privacy against the law enforcement officers' need to continue their investigations.",SENATE,<title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—This amendment, whilst well intentioned, has the effect that Senator Ludwig has mentioned. It would extend the protected information regime from material gathered under a warrant or authorisation to material gathered using optical surveillance devices without a warrant—for example, if you used binoculars or perhaps even a camera. You would have such a wide application of this amendment that any information gained by that means would be protected.
An example may be that a Federal Police officer who uses binoculars to look for a lost child could possibly commit an offence if he reported on what he saw through his binoculars to the parents of the child. That is taking it to the extreme, but certainly we do not believe that the same regime should apply to those devices for which a warrant is not required, such as a camera just taking a photograph, or a set of binoculars. Where you have a hidden camera or other devices installed there is of course a much stricter regime. For those reasons the government cannot support amendment (30) from the Democrats.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—I rise to speak on the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004. This bill establishes a regime for the handling of national security information in federal criminal proceedings. The opposition will be supporting the bill but will move several amendments at the committee stage. The bill arose as a result of a long process of inquiry by the Australian Law Reform Commission. However, the government chose to introduce this bill into parliament before the ALRC had handed down its final report entitled Keeping secrets: the protection of classified and security sensitive information. Paragraph 17 of the ALRC's submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill, which I participated in, states: 
The ALRC was not consulted during the development or drafting of these Bills, nor was this parallel process referred to in consultations, or in the submissions from the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian intelligence community.
This outcome is extremely regrettable because the original bill failed to consider the detailed recommendations contained in the ALRC's final report. This was clearly a wasteful mismanagement of public resources and the Attorney-General should offer the Australian people and the parliament a full explanation of this decision. Why he would set two processes in train independently and not ensure that they utilised each other's expertise in this matter is beyond belief.
The object of the bill is to prevent the disclosure of information in federal criminal proceedings where that disclosure is likely to prejudice national security, except to the extent that preventing the disclosure would seriously interfere with the administration of justice. In these circumstances, the bill provides a procedure where information relating to or the disclosure of which may affect national security may be introduced in federal criminal proceedings, taking into account the interests of national security and the right of a defendant to receive a fair hearing.
In the submission to the ALRC, the Law Council of Australia stated that a bill outlining a process for dealing with security sensitive information in criminal proceedings was desirable to ensure:
The clear expression of the possible orders that may be made to ensure the appropriate balance between the public interests and the interests of justice. The Council sees as desirable the Commission's proposals (10-10) that emphasise the wide powers courts and tribunals have to ensure the appropriate balance in the individual case.
I now turn to the committee report. On 19 August government and opposition members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—on which I had the privilege to serve—delivered a bipartisan report on the bill. The committee made 13 recommendations for amendments to the bill. Subject to these recommendations being adopted, the committee recommended that the bill proceed. In response to these recommendations, the government has introduced a substantially amended bill. The amendments are once again proof of the value of the Senate committee process, and further condemn the Attorney-General's ill thought-out criticism of the opposition in the first instance for referring a bill such as this to the relevant Senate committee. The opposition believes that the current bill strikes a balance between the interests of national security and the right of a defendant to receive a fair hearing. The opposition also believes that the bill deserves to be read a second time.
I now turn to some of the substantive issues covered in the bill. We will touch on some of the more pertinent matters during the second reading debate and deal with the proposed amendments at the committee stage. The exclusion of persons from closed hearings is one of the more germane elements contained within the bill. In response to recommendations 6 and 13 of the Senate committee's report, the bill amends clause 29 of the original bill to ensure that the defendant and his or her legal representative will not be excluded from the entire closed hearing and that the court always maintains the capacity to stay proceedings if a defendant cannot be assured of a fair trial. Let us be clear about that: the bill ensures that the court will always maintain the capacity to stay proceedings if a defendant cannot be assured of a fair trial. 
The original bill gave the court the power to exclude the defendant and his or her legal representative from all of the closed pre-trial procedures if the court believed the presence of either of these persons would be likely to prejudice national security. An amendment has been inserted in response to the following finding by the Australian Law Reform Commission: 
Leading secret evidence in criminal matters clearly breaches protections afforded by Australian and international law for an individual to be tried in his or her presence and to have the opportunity to examine, or have examined, any adverse witnesses. Excluding a person's lawyer from a criminal hearing would appear to violate that person's rights under Article 14(3)(b) and (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—
that is, the ICCPR—
to communicate with, and be defended by, counsel of his or her own choosing.
The amended clause stipulates that a court can only exclude the defendant or the defendant's legal representative from `any part of the hearing', where the defendant or their legal representative's presence in the court would be likely to prejudice national security. The capacity of a court to restrict access to closed pre-trial procedures is further restricted by an amendment to clause 29(3)(c), which states that a defendant's legal representative can only be excluded by a court for the reason that the representative has failed to be `given a security clearance at the level considered appropriate by the Secretary in relation to the information concerned'. 
Clause 19 of the current bill is also amended to expressly state that, irrespective of any pre-trial ruling, a court maintains the discretion to stay federal criminal proceedings. It should be clear in this instance that, irrespective of any pre-trial ruling, a court maintains the discretion to stay federal criminal proceedings in the event that the defendant would not be guaranteed a fair trial.
In response to recommendations 7 and 8 of the committee's report, clause 31 of the bill has been amended to provide that a court must, when making an order in relation to the disclosure of information or a witness, take into consideration `whether any such order would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair hearing, including in particular on the conduct of his or her defence'.
In making its decision a court is still required to give greatest weight to the risk that the disclosure of information or a witness could prejudice national security. However, a court retains the discretion to stay proceedings if the court believes that the order made under clause 31 would unfairly prejudice the defendant. In particular, clause 19 has clarified, by way of additional provision, that any order made under proposed clause 31 in a closed hearing does not prevent the court from later ordering that the criminal federal proceedings be stayed on a ground involving the same matter. In respect of the timing of closed hearings, in response to recommendation 9 of the committee report, clause 27 of the bill has been amended to allow the trial court to hold closed pre-trial hearings in relation to information which is the subject of an Attorney-General's certificate. This amendment gives the defendant more time to prepare his or her defence in the context of the court's ruling on the certificate.
I now turn to the issue of admissibility of redacted evidence. While a pre-trial ruling on the Attorney-General's certificate cannot be challenged before a court conducting the criminal proceedings, the court retains its discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence and to generally determine the course of the trial. As the Law Council noted in its submission to the original ALRC inquiry, while situations will arise which demand that access to sensitive national security information be prohibited or restricted in courts and tribunals, `any such limitations remain the responsibility of the courts, that the onus be always upon those seeking to limit access, and that any permitted limitations upon access always remain consistent with the principles of a fair trial'. That is consistent with Senate committee recommendation 2. 
I now turn to another issue that was dealt with during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—reasons for court orders following a closed hearing. The Senate committee report recommended that the bill be amended to include a provision requiring the courts to provide a written statement of reasons outlining the reasons for holding closed hearings. The current bill does not act upon this recommendation, because the bill requires that a court hold closed hearings for all proceedings in which the Attorney-General's certificate is challenged. Therefore, a court's only reason would be that the court is required to hold a closed hearing by the relevant act.
Instead of adopting this amendment, new clause 32 has been inserted into the bill to ensure that the court is now required to give reasons for decisions it makes admitting, excluding or redacting information or excluding witnesses following a clause 31 closed hearing in which the Attorney-General's certificate has in fact been challenged. This can be found at clause 32(1). Given the potential of any information in those reasons to be prejudicial to national security, clause 32(2) requires the court to give a copy of its proposed statement to the prosecution. If the Attorney-General is a party or if the prosecution or the Attorney-General consider that the proposed statement may disclose information that may prejudice national security then either of those parties may challenge the proposed publication. The court must then make a decision about this request to refrain from publishing its reasons and again give reasons for acceding to or rejecting the request. 
New clause 33 in the bill ensures that the prosecution or the Attorney-General—if he is a party to the closed hearing—can request that the court delay publishing its statement of reasons to allow those parties to appeal a decision under new clause 32. Clause 38 has also been added to allow the prosecution and the Attorney-General—if the Attorney-General is a party to the closed hearings—to appeal a decision under clause 32. The court that hears the appeal is the court that has jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from the judgment on the trial. That statement can be found in clause 38(2).
The bill also contains technical amendments that impact on the lapsing of the Attorney-General's certificate, the required form of notice to the Attorney-General regarding an expected disclosure, the impact of the bill on extradition hearings and a definition of `likely to prejudice national security'. All these amendments are consistent with the intent of the Senate committee report.
We have a federal protected disclosure regime. A Labor government will introduce a new federal protected disclosure regime, which will include appropriate protection for national security information as per recommendations 3-1 to 3-3 of the ALRC's report. As indicated in the opposition's second reading amendment, whilst not objecting to the second reading of the bill, the opposition believes that the Senate should call upon the government to implement a new federal protected disclosure regime, which will include appropriate protection for persons working with security sensitive information and national security matters consistent with the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. In light of the amendments outlined above and the opposition's support of the purpose of the bill, it is now fair to say that we can speak in favour of granting the bill a second reading; however, we note the opposition will also move amendments to the bill in the committee stage. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-11-30,"—These national security bills seek to clarify and streamline the way in which information affecting Australia's national security is dealt with in the criminal justice system. Of course there are a number of mechanisms which currently exist to protect highly sensitive information in the courtroom, including closed hearings, the editing of documents to be tendered, confidentiality undertakings and the doctrine of public interest immunity. With all of these mechanisms available, it is not entirely clear why a new regime is required. Indeed, the Law Council of Australia has expressed the view that the current regime is adequate. However, there does appear to be independent support for the government's proposition that further clarification might be needed. Mr David Weisbrot, the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, which conducted a comprehensive inquiry into the handling of national security information within the criminal justice system, concluded:
At the moment, it isn't clear how far our courts can go to accommodate legitimate national security concerns. As a consequence, the government may be forced to drop or reduce criminal charges against an individual or to settle a civil claim—even though the result is unsatisfactory—because ultimately this better serves Australia's strategic interests.
If we accept then the view that legislative clarification would serve to combat this uncertainty, the challenge is obviously to ensure that any legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the need to protect Australia's national security and the need to ensure that those charged with crimes are afforded a fair and open trial. Unfortunately, the government appears to have the balance wrong in this legislation. The Democrats' view of this bill is perhaps best summarised by Mr Bret Walker SC, former President of the Law Council, who made the point:
This bill is not all bad—far from it. A very conscientious attempt has been made to balance some very difficult things. It is just that, in the upshot, I think one of the prevailing views is that trade-offs have gone too far.
We acknowledge that the government faced some complex issues in the drafting of this bill and we welcome some of the improvements that have been made in response to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee; however, the balance in our view is still not right. The bill applies to all stages of proceedings relating to a crime under Commonwealth law or to a matter arising under the Extradition Act. If in the course of such proceedings the prosecutor or defendant believes that they or one of their witnesses will disclose information that relates to national security, they must notify the Attorney-General of that fact. The Attorney-General may then issue a certificate either preventing the disclosure of the information or the calling of a witness or permitting the partial disclosure of the information. If the Attorney-General's certificate relates to pretrial or extradition proceedings, it will operate as conclusive evidence that the disclosure of the information would be prejudicial to national security. The court must then consider whether to allow or disallow the disclosure of the information, taking into account the adverse effect of the defendant's right to a fair trial.
One of the more controversial aspects of the legislation is that the court may make an order permitting the hearing of evidence in the absence of the defendant. Such a hearing may also exclude the defendant's lawyer if he or she has not been granted security clearance at the appropriate level. Although we acknowledge the difficult issues with which the government has had to grapple in drafting this legislation, we Democrats do have some outstanding concerns regarding aspects of it.  
We are concerned that the proposed new regime hinges on a definition of national security which is incredibly broad and contentious. The definition includes defence, security, international relations and law enforcement interests, all of which are also defined very broadly. While it is notoriously difficult to come up with a working definition of national security—and we acknowledge the government's exploration of other options—we remain of the view that the definition is problematic. A range of organisations expressed similar views during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. For example, the Australian Press Council argued:
The sweeping nature of this definition has the potential to include within its scope a broad range of types of information which not only relate to matters of public interest but which are appropriate matters for public debate. Just a few examples would be contracts for government tenders, analysis or forecasts of the Australian economy, proposed trade agreements with foreign governments, planned changes to Australia's telecommunications infrastructure, or reports of mismanagement within Australia's immigration detention centres.
Some of these issues will now be excluded by the government's intention to remove national interests from the definition of national security. The Democrats welcome those amendments. However, even despite the removal of that element from the definition of national security, the definition remains incredibly broad. As the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network has argued:
... almost any matter involving a non-Australian citizen could be covered by the definition of `international relations', namely `political, military and relations with foreign governments and international organisations'.
One of the problems associated with such a broad definition is that the bill places disclosure obligations on the prosecutor and the defendant in relation to information regarding national security. With such a broad definition of national security, it will be difficult for a defendant, in particular, to determine whether a piece of information genuinely relates to national security. This is all the more concerning given that penalties of imprisonment apply for nondisclosure and that an increasing number of defendants are choosing to represent themselves before the courts. 
It is important to remember that, although the government may focus on the need for this legislation in the context of security related trials, the legislation is not limited to that context. Indeed, it applies to any proceedings involving an offence against the Commonwealth. It is entirely possible that information relating to national security could emerge in the course of a trial which does not, at first, appear to have any association with issues of national security. Because the definition of national security is so broad, it would be possible for a defendant to unknowingly commit an offence by failing to advise the Attorney-General. The defendant would then be liable to two years imprisonment. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee shared this concern, stating:
... in light of the broad and vague definition of national security, the Bill may place a heavy and unfair burden on the defendant to comply with its requirements.
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of this legislation is contained in clause 27, which enables a court to hear evidence in the absence of the defendant and his or her lawyer if the lawyer has not received the appropriate security clearance. In this respect, the bill differs markedly from the regime proposed by the ARLC. As Professor Weisbrot explained to the committee: 
We saw that the most important thing was for the lawyer to be in there and for the person to be properly represented ... our proposals made no recommendations for criminal proceedings to go ahead absent the accused and ideally the person's counsel.
The Law Council specifically referred to the ALRC's recommendation that `the fact that a hearing is taking place should never be kept from the party whose rights are being determined or affected by the hearing'. A fundamental element of our criminal justice system is that a defendant has the right to be present during his or her trial. Given the potential deprivation of liberty which can result from a criminal conviction, it is vital for a defendant to have the opportunity to contest all the information to be heard against her or him. Amnesty International has expressed concern that the operation of this provision will mean that the defendant is not in a position to rebut the evidence or to provide instructions to their legal representative. The Senate committee indicated that it held: 
... strongly to the view that defendants, as guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ... are entitled to be present at trial and to defend themselves in person or through legal representation.
Another contentious aspect of the bill is the requirement for lawyers to submit to security clearances if they are to have access to national security information. A large range of organisations, including the Law Council, have expressed concerns about this provision, which has implications for both the defendant and his or her lawyer. Firstly, it compromises the right of a defendant to choose their lawyer given that the lawyer of choice may not receive security clearance. This would place the defendant in the position of choosing their lawyer, who will not be given access to all the information, or resorting to another who will be given access. Secondly, the process could slow the trial down—the time needed not only for a security clearance to be undertaken but also for the defendant to instruct a new lawyer if that becomes necessary. Moreover, it is unclear whether there is likely to be any fee associated with the security clearance and, if so, who will pay that fee. It is certainly a possibility that the cost of this process could be added to the defendant's legal charges. 
Of course, the requirement to undergo security checks also has significant implications for lawyers. As the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties has argued, lawyers are officers of the court and are regularly required to give confidentiality undertakings, so the need for security checks is questionable. It went on to argue:
... it is sufficient that the Bill creates an offence for contravening a certificate of the Attorney-General or an order of the court. Any lawyer convicted of such an offence would be subject to the discipline of the court and risks being struck off.
I understand that the proposed security checks are very extensive, covering things such as the lawyer's place of residence, travel and overseas contacts over the previous decade. They may even incorporate a form of personality testing relating to the lawyer's trustworthiness—an interesting concept. On this basis the Law Council has highlighted this concern, saying:
The prospect of the government holding detailed private information about lawyers who regularly defend in contentious cases always creates the appearance, if not the actual risk, of a misuse of that information. Such a prospect exists no matter how secure and how separate the relevant sections within government are from each other.
The conduct of security clearances will be in accordance with the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual, which is not a public document and can be changed at the will of government. While I am informed that lawyers who receive an adverse security assessment would have the opportunity to seek a review of that decision, there is no provision to compensate a lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of such assessment.  
The final concern which I want to highlight is the fact that an Attorney-General's certificate granted in relation to pre-trial or extradition proceedings—in other words, the vast majority of Attorney-General's certificates—will operate as conclusive evidence that the information in question is prejudicial to national security. As Australian Lawyers for Human Rights have argued, this amounts to the Attorney-General making a finding of fact without any opportunity for the defendant to be heard. Given that the court may rely on the Attorney-General's certificate in order to exclude the evidence, which may have a significant impact of the fairness of the trial, the defendant should have the opportunity to be heard. The potential unfairness associated with the Attorney-General's certificates is compounded by the fact that an Attorney-General's certificate is not liable to judicial review nor can any action taken by the Attorney-General be investigated by the Ombudsman. As the Ombudsman noted in evidence before the committee:
Essentially, the only method of accountability of action taken by the Attorney-General that is preserved by the bills is the requirement imposed by clause 42 for the Attorney-General to make an annual report to the Parliament.
In closing, there is clearly a range of outstanding issues in relation to the bill, issues which are not only of concern to the Democrats but also have been identified by a diverse range of reputable organisations within the community. We do acknowledge that the government has made a genuine attempt to formulate appropriate legislation but in the end we feel that the balance is wrong. It is our hope that we may be able to address some of these issues through amendment during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-11-30,"—The Greens are highly concerned by this legislation and will not agree to it passing the Senate without extensive modification. We therefore will bring forward a number of amendments to return basic and long-held political, legal and other rights which would be excluded by the legislation. The right to a fair trial in open court and trial by jury, the right to a lawyer of a defendant's own choice, the separation of powers, the independence of the courts and the independence of prosecution decisions are all threatened by this National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004. The rights that I have listed are fundamental principles of Australia's common law as well as international law, in particular article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The right to a trial by jury is recognised in section 80 of the Australian Constitution. Amnesty International, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Press Council and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee have all expressed serious concerns in opposition to the bill as it stands.
While there has been some modification of the original bill by the government, most of the amendments proposed by the Senate committee have not been implemented. The Greens are proposing amendments that will give effect to important recommendations of the committee, so ensuring, at the very least, increased discretion on the part of the courts that would otherwise be forced by this legislation to exclude evidence from the view of the defendant, the jury and the public on the grounds of national security in certain circumstances.
What qualifies as national security in this bill is defined and determined by the executive—that is, effectively, the Attorney-General of the day. The government claims the bill is necessary because there is a need to prevent information important for national security from entering the public domain in the course of criminal trials. At the same time it says that it is desirable that the fact that such information or evidence cannot be tested in the open court in front of the jury or tested by a defendant and their lawyer should not prevent such evidence being used to prosecute and convict an accused person. In other words, the evidence should be available but not necessarily to the defendant or the defendant's legal representatives. Such an approach to criminal proceedings gave rise to many of the struggles for the current fundamental principles underlying Australian criminal law going right back to the Magna Carta and the repudiation of the Star Chamber. 
The government says that the bill seeks to establish a process for strengthening `the procedures for protecting national security information' and to provide a court which has found that `sensitive security related information should not be disclosed with an alternative to simply dismissing the charge'. The government's bill enables the Attorney-General to determine that particular information or witnesses may prejudice national security. Both the prosecutor and the defence are required to notify the Attorney-General and the court `if they know or believe that they, or one of the witnesses they intend to call, will disclose during the proceeding information that may affect our national security'. Upon receiving notification under this bill the Attorney-General may simply issue a certificate preventing disclosure of that information or precluding an individual from being called as a witness. 
There will be a closed hearing of the trial court. The court will decide whether the information can be disclosed or whether the witness can be called. As a priority, the court is to consider whether disclosure of the information or the calling of the witness would create a risk of prejudice to national security over that of the right of the accused to a fair trial. The defendant and his legal representative may be excluded from the closed hearing. If the court confirms that the information should not be disclosed then the information may not be disclosed except in permitted circumstances. This order by the court may preclude disclosure of information to the defendant and their legal representative. Disclosure can lead to penalties of up to two years in jail. Amnesty International said that the bill, in its current form, creates a process whereby an accused person may be tried and convicted on the basis of information never seen or heard by the accused or their lawyer. Amnesty International went on to say:
The rules of evidence ... in the criminal justice system have been prescribed in order to minimize the risk of innocent individuals being convicted and punished. Making information secret denies people facing ... serious allegations and potential jail sentences, the right to effectively defend themselves.
Currently, the Australian courts are able to ensure classified or sensitive material is used appropriately by confidentiality undertakings from parties and their legal advisers, by restricting access to documents or parts of documents, by court proceedings closed to the public and by restricting publications of those proceedings. This is recognised by international law and the international covenant, which allows internationally closed trials in some circumstances where national security is an issue.
However, the current definition of `issues of national security' is so broad that it encompasses an area way beyond that which would be envisaged by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This bill empowers the Attorney-General to determine what matters might be considered prejudicial to national security, with national security defined as `Australia's defence, security, international relations, law enforcement interests or national interests'. Such a definition could encompass an extraordinarily wide set of circumstances, leading to situations in which principles of fair trials are unduly compromised and where the transparency and accountability of the legal process could be at risk. As the Australian Press Council pointed out in evidence to the Senate inquiry into this bill, the definition is of such a wide scope that it could include: 
... a broad range of types of information which not only relate to matters of public interest but which are appropriate matters for public debate. Just a few examples would be contracts for government tenders, analysis or forecasts of the Australian economy, proposed trade agreements with foreign governments, planned changes to Australia's telecommunications infrastructure, or reports of mismanagement within Australia's immigration detention centres.
Amnesty International is also concerned that this bill requires the court to hold closed session hearings, which may detract from one of the requirements of justice—that it is both done and seen to be done. Depriving the court of the discretion to hold hearings behind closed doors if it believes it to be necessary but instead giving the Attorney-General the power to make that decision without written justification will undermine public confidence in the courts of Australia. It will enable the timing and course of proceedings to be determined by political considerations rather than the requirements of justice as assessed by the courts.
This bill breaks down the separation of powers and the independence of the prosecution from political interference. It gives the Attorney-General the ability to determine which witnesses should be allowed, what evidence can be tendered and if hearings should be closed—all on the nebulous grounds of national security. Again, national security is defined as widely and as loosely as `matters in the national interest'.
The Australian courts' discretion is limited under the bill, with judges required to place national security above fairness to the accused—whatever `national security' may mean. The main concerns of Amnesty International and other human rights and legal groups include—and I sum up here—the right to adequate time and to all evidence available to prepare a defence. This bill allows the Attorney-General to issue a certificate preventing the disclosure of certain sensitive information which may have a bearing on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself.
There is also the right to call and examine witnesses. This bill provides that the Attorney-General by certificate and the court by court order may limit or prevent the defence's access to witnesses whereby security-sensitive information may be raised. I again go back to that wide definition of what security is, which includes matters like international relations, national interests and law enforcement interests. There is the concern of the right of the accused to be present in all aspects of any trial against him or her, the right to a lawyer of the defendant's choosing, the right to a public hearing and the erosion of the right to a trial by jury. On that last matter, the exclusion of the jury from seeing all the evidence and the testing of that evidence is written into this legislation.
I am sure the public has supported measures brought before this parliament to increase surveillance, police powers and punishment of people who are contemplating, are involved in or have carried out terrorist acts, but this legislation is not about that. It is much wider. It is about truncating a citizen's right to a fair hearing when they are accused of infringing national interests. It is as wide as that. As the representatives of the Press Council—not known for being radical, I might say—point out, the national interest could include matters such as government tenders, forecasts on the Australian economy, proposed trade agreements, changes to telecommunications infrastructure or mismanagement of detention centres. I would add that it may include such matters as protests on environmental issues, Indigenous issues or cultural issues—a whole range of things in which, in the Attorney-General's view, the national interest could potentially be compromised, because the definition of national interest runs very clearly into what the government of the day considers is of interest to itself. 
This is dangerous legislation. It is broadly scoped. It is not narrow or confined, for example, to matters of protection from terrorism or criminal activities. Inevitably, we must assess in considering legislation that, given time, unless it is tightened it will be used unfairly against Australian citizens, Australian legal representatives and Australian courts by the government of the day. It is the duty of legislators to define exactly what they mean and to be very clear and specific about it. The government has failed to do that. There is no cogent argument in what the government has brought forward for the wide and sweeping changes to hundreds of years of development of law and justice under British law and development over more than a century in Australian law which are contained in this legislation. I guess, whatever the Senate may do, that this is a forerunner to what we are going to see in the coming three years, as the government cuts across time-honoured civil liberties, rights and jurisprudence with legislation like this—totally unjustified, unwarranted and against the national interest.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-11-30,"—by leave—I move the second reading amendment which I foreshadowed during my speech on the second reading and which has been circulated in the chamber:
At the end of the motion add:
	“but the Senate calls upon the Government to implement a new federal protected disclosure regime, which will include appropriate protection for persons working with security sensitive information and national security matters consistent with the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission.”",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—At the outset, I will comment on the second reading amendment moved by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the opposition. The amendment refers to a new federal protected disclosure regime, which was the subject of comment made by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Whilst the government will not support the amendment, the government will look closely at this when it considers its response to the report by the Australian Law Reform Commission. By not supporting this amendment, the government is by no means dismissing the issue out of hand, but it is perhaps premature at this stage for the government to be indicating its position in relation to that without first having considered in detail the report of Australian Law Reform Commission and, more importantly, the response to that report.
I note that the issue of national interest has been mentioned by various senators in the debate on this national security legislation. I can appreciate the comments that were made about the application of national interest to the bill. It was the subject of comment by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and it is an issue that the government has taken on board. There is a government amendment which we will be addressing shortly in committee, and I will not take it further than that other than to say that we have responded to the Senate committee's recommendation positively. 
More widely, of course, the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004 is very important in the government's overall strategy of protecting our national security. The bill will strengthen the procedures for protecting information that may affect our national security. The bill will also protect an individual's right to a fair trial. A court which has found that sensitive security related information should not be disclosed will have an alternative to simply dismissing the charge. It will be able to admit documents and information in a redacted form that protects national security but preserves the essence of the information. Consequently, the Commonwealth will no longer have to choose between risking the disclosure of sensitive information that relates to national security and protecting this information by abandoning the prosecution, even when the prosecution relates to alleged crimes that could have grave consequences for our national security.
The bill will significantly change the way that information that may affect our national security is used in federal criminal proceedings. It will not, however, jeopardise the very principle on which our legal system is based. The Australian Law Reform Commission submitted its final report, Keeping secrets: protecting classified and security sensitive information, to the government on 31 May this year. The ALRC was asked to inquire into measures used to protect classified and security-sensitive information in the course of investigations, legal proceedings and other relevant contexts. The aim of the reference was to examine whether existing mechanisms adequately protect classified and security-sensitive information or whether there is a need for further regulation in this area. The Attorney-General tabled the ALRC report on 23 June this year. The report, of course, made a number of recommendations, including the development of a legislative scheme to protect classified and security-sensitive information during court and tribunal proceedings.
The release of the ALRC report follows the release of a discussion paper, No.67, entitled Protecting classified and security sensitive information in January 2004. In developing this bill the government had the benefit of considering the ALRC's recommendations regarding proposals for reform as outlined in the discussion paper. In light of the importance of having safeguards in place, the government decided to introduce the bill prior to receiving the final report. The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported on 19 August this year. The government has adopted several of the Senate committee's recommendations. Among other changes, the government amended the bill to clarify that the courts will only exclude defendants and their legal representatives from closed hearings in limited circumstances and will retain the power to stay proceedings if the defendant cannot be assured of a fair trial.
The government recognises the importance of maintaining an independent judiciary and an accused's right to a fair trial. The government believes that this bill strikes a balance between these fundamental principles and the Commonwealth's duty to protect information that may affect our national security. This bill is much overdue. For some time now questions have been raised as to how information that may be sensitive to national security can be dealt with in a criminal prosecution. It is high time that we have this legislation in place so that there can be certainty for all. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2004-11-30,"—I rise this evening to speak about one of the great historical and cultural frauds perpetrated against the Australian people. It has been noted before on many occasions, but the coming 150th anniversary of this event provides a good opportunity to start reclaiming from the left-wing pantheon one of Australia's most historic and iconic events. In the United States the Grinch might have stolen Christmas, but in Australia the Labor Party stole the Eureka Stockade. And now is the time to take it back. 
It never ceases to amaze me how this simple yet powerful story has been stolen by those on the left of Australian politics and how a giant myth was created to portray the events in Ballarat those 150 years ago as some sort of watershed in the history of the labour movement, socialism and radicalism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yet the fact that many Australians think of the Eureka Stockade as class warfare turned particularly violent tells us less about what actually happened than about the Left's dominance in shaping our country's perception of itself.
Let us look briefly at the facts. The Ballarat miners who assembled at the Eureka Stockade were not downtrodden workers rising up against their capitalist oppressors; they were all entrepreneurs, many of them shareholders in small mining companies and syndicates. They rose up not against ruthless employers—for they were all self-employed—and not over long working hours or unsafe working conditions. No, the target of their anger was the government, and their grievances were oppression by the authorities, heavy and unfair taxation, and lack of political representation. One cannot imagine a more—dare I use the present day labels—liberal constituency pursuing more traditional liberal objectives.
The Eureka Stockade miners could be described, in terms the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, would understand, as our country's very first aspirational voters. Except, of course, they were not voters yet, and that was one of their grievances. Mr Latham talks about the need for the Labor Party to reclaim the army of the self-employed—contractors, franchisees and entrepreneurs—who over the years have drifted away from the Labor Party. The miners of 1854 were exactly these people. Yet only yesterday, Mr Latham described Eureka as `the struggle of the workers'. The Labor Party, sadly, still does not get the past, just as it does not get the present and just as it does not get the future. So the Left has succeeded in turning the Ballarat miners—those unsung heroes and pioneers of the fight for freer markets and smaller government—into the spiritual forebears of the AMWU, the painters and dockers union, and the BLF. That is what has happened, but the bottom line is: were those people alive today they would vote for the Liberal Party—the party of small business, the party of enterprise, the party of less government intervention and the party of less regulation. 
The Eureka miners were not unionists with chips on their shoulders; they were, to borrow from Robert Menzies, the `forgotten people' of the mid-19th century. In today's language, they were the Howard battlers. That is why I appeal to my colleagues on this side of the chamber: do not be afraid of the Eureka Stockade; do not give up on it and do not let one of our history's great moments remain the Left's plaything. See the Eureka Stockade for what it really was, and not what our left-wing cultural gatekeepers have proclaimed, and reclaim the night of 3 December 1854 as one of our own.
Let us have a closer look at the grievances of the Ballarat miners to see why today's Liberal Party would wholeheartedly support their struggle for justice and a fairer deal. As the pre-eminent historian of the Australian gold rushes Professor Geoffrey Blainey argues, at the heart of the miners' struggle was the system of unfair licensing and taxation that they had to work under. The size of land they could dig was unfairly and unreasonably restricted. They were forced to pay high licence fees to the government—what Professor Manning Clark called `that bloody licence tax'—and they had to pay it regardless of whether they found gold or not. The ham-fisted enforcement of the licence regime was causing constant inconvenience and interruption to the miners' work. And worst of all, the Ballarat miners found themselves frustrated without any possible recourse. They were at the mercy of laws made by the government in distant Melbourne, by men who were not accountable to them and whose decisions they could not influence through democratic means.
Thus, the Eureka Stockade has nothing in common with the Paris Commune, the Bolshevik revolution or even the Queensland shearers strike which gave birth to the Australian Workers Union and the Australian Labor Party. In fact, the miners had much more in common with the American revolutionaries of 1776, whose rallying cry of `No taxation without representation' was echoed almost exactly 78 years later in Ballarat. The Ballarat miners were revolutionaries too, but just because you are a revolutionary does not mean you are a leftie. In fact, participants in all the successful revolutions—those of England's Glorious Revolution, the American Revolution and Eastern Europe's Velvet Revolution—were certainly not. 
It would be tempting to see the Eureka Stockade as a quintessentially Australian celebration of heroic defeat, a sort of Gallipoli in the dusty Victorian bush. Some 30 miners died that night while fighting the police and many more were imprisoned and dragged through the court system. But although the stockade was pulled down their revolt bore an almost instantaneous fruit. Within a few years the demands of the Ballarat miners had nearly all been met.
The 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade is much more to me than simply a historical milestone. My great-great-grandfather, Edmond Condon, who in 1852 sailed to Australia from his native Ireland, was one of the miners inside the Eureka Stockade. Edmond Condon took part in the uprising at Eureka along with, among others, his friends Darby Dwyer and Jack Walsh. On the fall of the stockade the three of them ran to Broan Hill and, as they told the story, they were `bunged at all the way', but only Jack Walsh was wounded. Although he regularly smoked in bed, Edmond Condon lived a long life. His obituary in the BealibaTimes in 1922 recalled: 
He was one of the defenders in the Eureka Stockade at Ballarat under the late Mr Peter Lalor on that memorable day in 1854 when the exasperated miners made such a stubborn fight against what they considered the tyrannical conditions under which they were compelled by the mining regulations of that time to obtain their licences.
Thus, you can see that my family has a long and proud tradition of bourgeois revolutionaries fighting for the rights of ordinary Australians. So it is not just for the sake of historical justice and accuracy but also for the sake of the memory of my great-great-grandfather that I want to reclaim Eureka from its left-wing sectarian imprisonment and give it back to Australia's mainstream, where it very proudly belongs.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Eureka Stockade: 150th Anniversary</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-11-30,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Yes. Customs conducted an open Request for Proposal procurement process for a Strategic Partner for the development of automated border control in late 2003, which resulted in a Head Agreement being signed with SAGEM Australasia Pty Ltd in May 2004.
(2)	11 companies submitted proposals.
(3)	Tim Chapman, National Manager Passengers Branch, Australian Customs Service approved the evaluation committee's recommendation of the preferred proponent.
(4)	SmartGate is a trial, not a production system. The trial commenced at Sydney International Airport in November 2002 and will be extended to another airport and additional users in late 2004.
(5)	The agreement with SAGEM Australasia that resulted from the Request for Proposal procurement process provides the framework for specific contracts to be formed but it does not guarantee any work. Under the Head Agreement there is a notional amount of $500 000 for works in 2004/05.
(6)	SmartGate was designed to be very intuitive and new users are provided with a Help Card at the time of their enrolment. All Customs officers working at the related airports attend SmartGate briefing sessions and those directly related to the operation of the kiosk undertake specialised training.
(7)	In the event of any failure of the system, the backup is to revert to existing manual processing systems utilising the passenger processing IT system.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Customs: SmartGate System</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,28,1,answer
