"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-08,"—This parliament has come to the end of the longest debate since Federation on a particular measure, namely, the Native Title Amendment Bill. The length and intensity of this parliamentary debate and consideration of the matter were completely justified because this bill deals with the rights of the Aboriginal peoples of this ancient land and deals with the interface of those rights with the rights of other Australians.
The parliament was given a challenge by the High Court of Australia in the Mabo decision. The Mabo decision, as we all know, did away with the legal fiction of terra nullius. The parliament responded to that by the 1993 legislation. We, of course, have since found that there are difficulties with that legislation. The legislation is not delivering justice as it was intended to do. It is not 
 delivering as it was intended to do for the indigenous people of Australia.
The High Court in the Wik decision has presented the parliament with another challenge—that is, a challenge to consider the implications of the possibility of native title rights co-existing with the rights of pastoral leaseholders, and to do so in a manner that reflects the decision of the High Court.
As has been said in this debate, it has not been a matter of the High Court granting native title. It has been a matter of the High Court acknowledging the underlying existence of native title. Our response, I believe, has been in the finest traditions of this parliament. The parliament has exercised its true functions—the House of Representatives and the Senate.
I stand here, as a member of the Senate, acknowledging the fact that we in this chamber have exercised our true function of review. We are not the government. The government is elected to govern, but we are elected to review legislation and particularly to do so against the requirements of our function to uphold human rights. We have done so, and the government has responded. The government has responded by accepting 314 amendments to their original Native Title Amendment Bill. I believe, as a result of this, that the purpose and effect of the bill have been radically altered.
The result is that, after this vote, we will have legislation which upholds and preserves the common law native title rights of indigenous people and provides the mechanism for the practical realisation, the efficient realisation, of those rights, in a way that also provides fairness and certainty to the other stakeholders, particularly for the miners and for the pastoralists.
I am personally pleased that we have come to a satisfactory end, a satisfactory legislative conclusion, about this matter, on the basis that I have said. I am personally pleased for many reasons. I will just give you two: first, because of my familial relationship with a particular indigenous group; and, second, the fact that I have been a supporter of indigenous rights over many years.
I sometimes feel a little upset when you hear dogs barking at your heels. I can recall, when I was Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Tasmania and a member of the ACTU executive, being intimately involved with the activities in the mid 60s to achieve wage justice for the indigenous people of Australia. Where were some of these people who are accusing me of selling out indigenous rights? Where were they? I believe that this outcome is a most important outcome.
—Madam President, on a point of order: Senator Harradine is making a very significant and in many respects—
—You are not in your correct seat, Senator Alston. You cannot be heard.
—Sorry, Madam President. It is now, I think, just over six minutes into this speech, and we have had 13 separate interjections from Senators Brown and Margetts. I would ask you to be strict in ensuring that Senator Harradine is accorded the respect that he is entitled to in this chamber.
—What about respect for Aboriginal people? Where's that?
—Senator Margetts, cease shouting! I call Senator Harradine.
—The parliamentary debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill has now concluded. It has ended. It is now up to the stakeholders, to the indigenous peoples, to the miners, to the pastoralists, to the state governments and to the federal government to see that this legislation works in the best interests of all.
It is gratifying that the miners, the pastoralists and the state governments have indicated a willingness to work with the legislation. That really is a remarkable situation—as those who have been intimately involved in the discussions would be able to tell you, if they could. I say that it is remarkable because these very same people objected strenuously to Mabo and to Wik. I give credit, frankly, to them—although they have come to the realisation late in the piece—for agreeing to try to 
 work with this legislation to see that it works properly.
My hope is that the indigenous peoples will see that this legislation can work to their advantage and that they will see that it does. Already, the Chairman of ATSIC, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, has expressed that he is comfortable with what I have done in this particular matter. He and other members of the indigenous communities are, of course, concerned about substantial aspects of this legislation. One of the constant concerns has been expressed as though I am responsible for it; that is, the wholesale validation that will take place as a result of the actions of a Labor Premier in Queensland, Mr Goss, and his successor, Mr Borbidge. That was not a matter that was determined by my vote. It was a matter of agreement between the government and the opposition.
I would like to remind the Senate that, after the last debate, it was agreed, it was acknowledged, that there were four sticking points. There were more, of course, but the four principal sticking points have now been resolved in a manner that upholds the native title rights of indigenous people. That is absolutely clear, and history will prove that. There were a number of other significant amendments and improvements to this legislation which I am grateful the government agreed to.
I think there were about 88 amendments in this particular series, but I will mention just a couple. There is the crown to crown grant situation: have a look at what happened there. There is the question of extinguishment when rights are determined between pastoral leaseholders and native title holders or claimants. Of course, in accordance with the Wik decision, the former takes precedence over the latter. It was proposed in the legislation that those interests be extinguished. This bill does not extinguish them; it simply suspends them until the lease ceases, runs out. We have left to the common law the decision as to what occurs then. Hopefully, the common law will determine that they are to be revived.
Madam President, I put to you that there are a number of Caucasian Australians who will benefit in unexpected ways. For example—I 
 will not mention the state—the government accepted my proposition that when it comes to compulsory acquisition, the decision as to whether the acquisition is meritorious or not will not be left, as is now, for Caucasian residents of that particular state, in the hands of a public servant, but must be dealt with by an independent tribunal. This will benefit no doubt not only the indigenous people of that state but also the Caucasian residents of that state.
There were a number of other matters which were dealt with, but I will not go into those. Suffice it to say that a huge amount of work has been done on this matter right from the beginning. I know that there were substantial discussions, negotiations, et cetera by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others with stakeholders leading up to the introduction of this legislation. There were also a large number of discussions with other people last year and this year. I was very disappointed at the outcome before Easter, but I had been thinking of the matter all of those days since Easter, and a great deal of work had been done.
I want to acknowledge a few people. I thank my wife and family for their support, and I am sure all honourable senators feel that way with their families. I want to also thank the officers of this Senate and the way I have been advised by them. Indeed, the way that this legislation was able to be dealt with in only two days is the result of the advice given by Mr Harry Evans. I want to thank all of those who contacted my office. Unfortunately, the mainframe was jammed on a number of occasions because of the emails that were coming in. Because of my small staff, I cannot possibly acknowledge them in writing, but I do so now. I want to thank my small but dedicated staff.
The professional advice given to me by John McCarthy QC and Jeff Kildea has been shown to be absolutely first-class. I have not of course always followed that advice, but I take responsibility for that. I would like to thank Philipa Horner and Robert Orr, members of the government's Wik task force, and Catherine Murphy, and Senator Minchin. Nobody around this place can deny that 
 Senator Minchin has an absolutely accurate and deep knowledge of this issue. I want to thank the Prime Minister as well, because I believe the Prime Minister has shown that he put the interests of this country above sectional interests or political interests. I know Senator Lightfoot will not mind my thanking him. At a particular stage, he said something publicly which threatened `to throw a spanner in the works'. I can assure him that that strengthened my resolve and after that I got a couple more things out of the government which I did not think I would. So I thank all of those people. I also thank Father Frank Brennan. Actually, he had not been involved in the preparation of the amendments, but I have had a great regard for his writing on Aboriginal matters over many years.
Before I conclude I would like to put this matter all into context. If my negotiations with the government had not achieved an honourable, just and workable outcome, then I would not have voted for or supported the bill. I was motivated to reopen the discussions. Put yourself back to three weeks ago: we were heading headlong into a divisive double dissolution election which would have torn the fabric of our society and set race relations back 40 or 50 years. That is where we were heading and everyone around this chamber knows that is where we were heading. But I wanted to avoid that, but I was not prepared to purchase that avoidance by sacrificing the native title rights and interests of indigenous people.
We now have an opportunity to move forward from the bitterness which has divided the nation over the last few years. If we give the amended Native Title Act a chance to work, I am confident that in time indigenous and non-indigenous, country and city, will be reconciled on this issue. The community's recognition of native title after 200 years is not the panacea which some people believe it to be, nor is it the demon that others have tended to characterise it as. It is a crucial aspect of the ongoing process of reconciliation which we must continue to pursue with justice and fairness. With these amendments to the Native Title Act, we can put in place a firm foundation for our future.
—So we come to the end of what I believe—
—There is no reply to an amendment, Senator.
—Are we in committee?
—We are not in committee.
—Well I—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator, we are not in committee. That is the end of the debate, and there is no provision in the standing orders for a right of reply to an amendment at the end of debate on an amendment.
—I raise a point of order. Once we move off the amendment, I presume we can still debate the motion that Senator Minchin moved.
—No, the debate is concluded at that point. There are two motions now to be put. I put the question that the amendment moved by Senator Bolkus be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Adoption of Report</title>,Bills,0,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—In the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998  on the last occasion, there was some discussion with the minister about the exact effect of this amendment. Frankly, there seemed to be a lack of certainty about what it meant. I was wondering whether the minister could elaborate further about the effect of this amendment.

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-08,"—I 
 think the amendment to which Senator Neal is speaking now is a consequential amendment. The more substantive one that she is really addressing is in the bill itself. She is addressing the government amendment.
It is more relevant to her own proposed amendment contained on sheet 1010, which proposes to amend schedule 2 in the bill itself. The government's amendment now before the chamber on sheet B98AD370WB, to which we refer, is a consequential amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to insert a drafting refinement to make it clear that the reference of part IV—restrictive trade practices proposed to be added to subsection 87(1B)—concerns applications made by the ACCC on behalf of persons who allege a contravention of part IV. This particular amendment does, however, include a reference to subsection 87(1B) in part IV but only in the context of the operation of subsection 87(1B) itself, which is amended by schedule 2 of the bill. The opposition is opposed, I understand, to this amendment, not because of what it does in legislative terms but because it has a nexus with subsection 87(1B), which is the real focus of Senator Neal's objection.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—The reason I ask, Minister, is that in some of our informal discussions on the last occasion, you advised that an amendment you were moving—and I thought you were referring to this one—took away the capacity for retrospective action to be taken by the ACCC. Is that the case?",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-08,"—That was certainly the intent at the time, Senator, but I understand that the Democrats themselves have moved an amendment which has that effect, and which we will support.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-08,"—No, Senator, this is a consequential amendment. The one that you are objecting to is actually in the bill. It is a schedule to the bill. This is only consequential on that.
The amendment that I was referring to informally with you was an intention on our part because of concerns that had been raised in the other place that maybe there should be some retrospectivity. Of course, there was ultra-sensitivity, as you know, on the part of the Labor Party, with regard to the ACCC being able to take action on behalf of small business, that that may have applied to actions taken in the past by the MUA. We had indicated in those informal discussions that we were prepared to correct that because that was not the intent. However, in the meantime, the Democrats indicated that they would be proposing an amendment which would remove retrospectivity from the schedule to the bill, and we indicated we would support that.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—My difficulty is that, as the government seems to be well aware, we are opposed to schedule 2 items 3 and 5 and I outlined our reason for that in some detail in the second reading debate, though there will be further debate on it. But it is a bit difficult having a consequential amendment before the vote on the substantive matter is actually dealt with. Maybe I should have picked this up when the running sheet was first circulated. In fact, I think we got it only as the debate began on the last occasion. Would there be any difficulties for the government in deferring this matter until we actually resolve the issues of items 3 and 5 entirely?
—No, Senator; no difficulties.
—I am not exactly certain of the form but I assume I move that this matter stand until all other amendments are dealt with.
—Is it the wish of the committee that government amendment 1 on sheet 370 be deferred? There being no objection, it is so ordered.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-08,"—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 2, page 11 (after line 19), after item 2, insert:
2A  Subsection 80(1)
Before ""(1A)"", insert ""(1AAB),"". 

2B  After subsection 80(1AA)
Insert:
(1AAB)	 A person is not entitled to make an application under subsection (1) for an injunction by reason that a person has contravened section 45D, 45DB or 45E unless the first mentioned person is adversely affected by the alleged contravention.
This amendment modifies section 80 of the Trade Practices Act to regulate who may apply for an injunction under the secondary boycott provisions of the act. The amendment is, in our view, necessary because of a significant change in policy within the ACCC in respect of boycott actions.
The Democrats' position is quite clear and has always been quite clear: unless a secondary boycott involves competition issues, we do not believe that the ACCC should be involved. That was the longstanding policy of the ACCC's predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission, from 1977 to 1996. Not once in that period did the Trade Practices Commission engage in a secondary boycott action. Indeed, the TPC made its views known to the Senate employment committee's inquiry into secondary boycotts in late 1993 in its policy stance. I quote:
It is the anti-competitive class of case that the commission, as a competition authority, is primarily concerned with. The company damage class of case, without substantial lessening of competition, is better left to private action.
From 1994 to 1996 this position was also reflected in law, with section 45D, covering secondary boycotts in the Trade Practices Act, restricted to boycotts involving substantial lessening of competition and other boycotts in the Industrial Relations Act. In 1996 the secondary boycott provisions were transferred back to the Trade Practices Act.
In our discussions with the ACCC and the government when we were considering the Workplace Relations Act, it was made pretty clear to us that the ACCC's primary interest would be the competition class of cases, and that is its specific brief. Its brief is not industrial relations; its brief is competition. The ACCC chair confirmed to the then leader of the Democrats that he had no interest in 
 industrial-type boycotts not involving competition issues.
We accept the role of the ACCC on competition matters, but not on industrial relations matters. Indeed, one would have thought that the objects clause of the Trade Practices Act, which expressly refers to competition, would have restricted the ACCC's role in any case to dealing with boycotts involving competition issues. This was particularly drawn to our attention by the government at the time in its arguments why the ACCC would not assume some new role in secondary boycotts beyond its historical role.
However, over the last year the ACCC has, without any public announcement of a change of policy, changed a 20-year precedent and started going after secondary boycotts that do not involve competition issues. The issues concerned were industrial relations issues. This is, in our view, an inappropriate use of ACCC's scarce resources. If a company want to use the secondary boycott provisions against a union, in our view they should use their own money and not get public funding through an ACCC action. It is open under the law for a company to take action, but in our view it is not appropriate for the ACCC to be doing so where the issue is not one of competition.
Our amendments seek to reinstate in law the distinction between competition and non-competition secondary boycotts and make it clear that the person suffering the damage must instigate boycott action if there are no competition issues involved. This is done by stating that the only person who can apply for an injunction in respect of the secondary boycott provisions other than 45DA, which deals with competition issues, will be the person or company affected. This will ensure that unions, often with limited financial resources, will not find themselves facing a publicly funded opponent in what is essentially a dispute of employee rights between a company and a union.
The ACCC and even the minister have argued that secondary and primary boycotts like the waterfront dispute did involve competition issues. They say the issue was competition between union and non-union labour and 
 that the so-called monopoly of the MUA to represent workers was wrong. We believe this argument is spurious. The so-called monopoly of the MUA is a right to represent workers. That is a right granted by the Industrial Relations Commission and granted under the Workplace Relations Act. It is a decision by waterfront workers to all belong to one union, and under the freedom of association rule that is entirely lawful. They are entitled to do so. Similarly, the right of workers not to join a union is also enshrined in the Workplace Relations Act and regulated by the Employment Advocate. But you cannot force people in one direction or the other; it is a free choice. That is what freedom of association means.
There is, in my view, no role for the ACCC in these sorts of disputes from a competition angle. The industrial relations issues are to be dealt with by the Industrial Relations Commission and the ACCC has to focus on competition issues. If there were a competition argument, the ACCC should have used section 45DA as its tool. It did not; it used section 45DB, which refers to the primary boycott provisions. As we all know, primary boycotts are related to employment issues. I think that choice in itself shows a spurious argument from them. Accordingly, we have moved to make the matter explicit. In our view, it does not take away from the proper role of the ACCC. It confirms what that role has been over a 20-year period, and I think will put industrial relations issues back where they belong, and that is as a matter for the IRC to deal with and not the ACCC. I commend my amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-07-08,"—I thank Senator Murray for his thoughtful contribution. However, I must say, on behalf of the opposition, that we still have difficulties with the Democrat amendment, whilst accepting that it is substantially ameliorates the government's position. I am particularly heartened to hear that the government will be supporting the Democrat amendment with regard to retrospectivity. We would have opposed that retrospectivity in the provisions of all the amendments that have been moved.
Whilst I do understand and appreciate Senator Murray's position, the problem that 
 the opposition has got is essentially the definition of `anticompetitive'. As has been seen, this government is prone to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal in industrial relations, most notably and seminally displayed in the waterfront dispute. Our difficulty remains as to the definition of `anticompetitive', and our genuine fear is that it may be misused. I believe that fear has been borne out in what can only be described as the partisan activities and partisan attitude of the ACCC in the waterfront dispute. One of the articles I read described Alan Fels as a warrior in terms of the MUA and the industrial relations regimen. Our concern, therefore, is that we do not want to give the ACCC any further powers.
Whilst I understand the Democrats' position and I understand where they are coming from in terms of the small business constituency, our concern is a much broader concern, which is that the government and the ACCC may be tempted to use this for a similar action down the track. Here again, it very much goes to the definition of what is anticompetitive. As I said before, the ACCC has taken a wide brief with regard to its activities and its capacity to act of recent times, and there appears to be very little indication that it will not take a similarly wide approach in the future. So, whilst understanding and appreciating the sentiments of the Democrats' amendment, we are more sceptical than the Democrats about assurances that they may have got from the ACCC. We are even more sceptical about the likelihood of this government misusing this in a way that does disadvantage organised labour, in a way that does go to de-funding unions, in a way that does substantially diminish people's capacity to be represented by unions, by taking actions in the guise of this initiative through the ACCC.
Accordingly, we do not support the Democrat amendment because of that, and because of the potential breadth of the definition of `anticompetitive'. We think the ACCC has got enough on its plate. As Senator Murray rightly pointed out, we do not wish to stretch its scarce resources with additional work. Putting aside those somewhat facetious comments, we are genuinely concerned that 
 we are giving it yet another string to its bow in relation to what has been recently a very partisan organisation.
Whilst I understand the sentiments, our concern is that the Democrat amendment is narrow. I would reiterate the point that, if this type of initiative was to have been taken, it should have been done in the context of the fair trading provisions rather than what seems to be a strange and peculiar place to put this initiative—that is, in this bill. We do not support the Democrat amendment. Whilst understanding the motivation is sound, we have fears which continue to be unallayed with regard to the ACCC and the government. We will continue our opposition with regard to this and we will not be supporting the Democrat amendment because, failing a very prescriptive definition of what is anticompetitive and precisely how the ACCC and Professor Fels would use this in prospective action, it is very difficult for us to provide any assent.
We do not trust the government anymore on industrial relations matters and I do not think anybody in Australia trusts the government on industrial relations matters. This government has, by its actions, empirically proven that it is not to be trusted. We do not believe that it is in the interests of working Australians to give the ACCC more power that is potentially unfettered, if you look at the breadth of the potential definition of anticompetitive. We do appreciate the Democrat sentiment and what the Democrats are intending to do, but we do not trust this government and we do not trust the ACCC. Events over the last 18 months have borne this out. We will not be supporting the Democrat amendment.
I would urge Senator Murray to perhaps rethink this. It may well be, Senator Murray, that this section of the bill in relation to schedule 2 could be laid aside to allow further discussions as to the nature of what is meant by anticompetitive. I understand Senator Neal had some indication from some sections of the government that they were prepared to do this because this, essentially, is our major sticking point on this bill. We are keen to expedite it in other areas, but this is a major sticking point. We think it is very strange that 
 it has been popped in here when it should have been part of the fair trading package. We will oppose the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-08,"—This amendment moved by the Democrats would limit the power of the court to grant an injunction against a breach of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act unless the person was adversely affected by the alleged contravention. At present, the court can issue injunctions before the action occurs. The Democrat amendment therefore diminishes existing rights and the power of the courts to take preventive action. The government opposes this amendment on the grounds it unreasonably fetters the direction of the Federal Court to grant appropriate injunctions against alleged secondary boycotts and, I repeat, diminishes the existing rights of small business.
The amendment would reduce the existing rights of small business and would limit the options available to a court when dealing with alleged secondary boycotts. Since 1977, the court has expressly recognised that an injunction should be available regardless of whether an applicant's interest is affected by conduct contravening part IV. In particular it would remove the ability to seek a pre-emptive injunction to prevent an industrial dispute involving one firm from directly involving firms totally unrelated to that dispute.
Removing the discretion of the Federal Court to grant such an injunction places unreasonable uncertainty on the carriage of industrial disputes and forces firms to wait until they suffer loss or damage before they can seek relief. This is a recipe for escalating disputes, with the only winners being the lawyers. Those supporting the amendment obviously believe the Federal Court is not able to use its discretion wisely with respect to its ability to grant injunctions. The government rejects this, believing the longstanding powers of the Federal Court in this area should continue.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-08,"—I move:
(2)	 Schedule 2, item 3, page 11 (line 21), after ""IV"", insert ""(other than sections 45D, 45DB or 45E)"".
As you would expect, the Democrats generally support granting the ACCC the right to take representative actions—those that are appropriate. But we do not believe that that right should extend to secondary boycotts not involving competition issues, as I have already spelt out. The Reid committee report on fair trading did recommend that the ACCC be given the power to undertake representative actions, particularly in respect of section 46, which is the misuse of market power provision. In its report, the committee argued that this power `will marginally improve small business access to justice'. That report was a particularly impressive one. It was unanimous, for a start, among all the major party participants. Secondly, it was a particularly thoughtful report in many respects.
When it writes that it is a `marginal improvement', you have to be alert to the fact that a small business positive report was not going overboard about the potential impact or effect of these provisions. Therefore, to my mind, we have to weigh up what I think Senator Mackay fears would be the intended consequences of what we are seeing here. But there may be far greater consequences on other issues in other areas, and that is why we have to be particularly careful. It is a pity that the representative actions provisions should therefore be at risk. But they are rightly at risk in this debate because of the particular concerns we and other parties have with the other alternatives. Under representative actions, the report said the following:
4.54	 The ACCC submitted to the Committee that it should have the power to take representative actions for breaches of the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Trade Practices Act, including section 46, notwithstanding there is already provision for seven or more businesses to take `group proceedings' in the Federal Court.
4.55	 This proposal would not change the law on restrictive trade practices but, rather, would marginally enhance enforcement of the law.
In other words, they had enlarged it and improved it. The report further stated:
4.56	 For example, if the ACCC's proposals were to be adopted, the ACCC would be empowered to 
 take action on behalf of a number of small businesses hurt by a corporation's misuse of market power.
That was obviously supported by the ACCC. For those who wish to refer to the report, the relative sections were 4.54, 4.55 and 4.56. It went on right through to 4.59.
The Democrats support the general proposition of ACCC representative action powers as recommended by the Reid committee, and we broadly support the provisions in the act, but the Labor opposition has properly raised an important concern with these provisions, arguing that it will also give the ACCC the power to take representative action on secondary boycott provisions. Rather than oppose the provisions, the Democrats would instead prefer to address the concern about secondary boycotts by removing the right of the ACCC to take representative action in respect of non-competition secondary boycotts. Amendment 2 specifically, therefore, excludes sections 45D, 45DB and 45E to make it explicit. Accordingly, I commend my amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—This Democrat amendment tries to some extent to limit the negative issues that arise from schedule 2, items 3 and 5 of the government's bill. I talked at some length in the second reading stage about the concern that the opposition had about this bill, which is essentially about country of origin, having slipped into it in a fairly underhand manner these provisions which allow the ACCC using taxpayers' money to pursue unions in industrial disputes in what is a private dispute between representatives of workers and their employers about their terms and conditions.
It has been a matter of some discussion between me and some members of the community who see some great benefits coming from this bill. They are obviously concerned that a disagreement over matters that are entirely industrial relations are going to delay the progress of this bill. Yesterday I was contacted by Mr Bonanno from the sugar board. He was very concerned to see that this bill was being delayed, particularly in relation to an amendment that is being proposed that he believes is necessary to ensure that the sugar board does not collapse overnight.
Because he is an expert in the field, I accepted his view of it and informed him that, that being the case, the opposition would like to cooperate as best we could to ensure that this did not occur in relation to the sugar board. But we had difficulty with this industrial relations matter that had been introduced in a fairly underhanded way by the government. Certainly we would do our best to get the bill through as quickly as possible, but this issue could not be resolved. We told him that he might want to talk to other people in the government about this issue. I understand that he had some discussions with Senator Boswell, who I understand is the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. Despite my having had some discussions with Senator Boswell, there seems to have been some misunderstanding between us. I thought that, by saying that items 3 and 5 of schedule 2 would be withdrawn, it meant that they would be withdrawn. Apparently that was subject to an unspoken rider about getting the agreement of the Liberal members of the coalition.
—Like Telstra.
—Yes. I understand that, even though the National Party's vote is declining at the moment, the senior partners in the coalition are not so concerned about their views on these sorts of matters. I understand that Peter Reith's dispute with the MUA and his commitment to pursuing the MUA and other unions to the death overrides any concern they have for the National Party. It certainly overrides any concern that the sugar board and those people in rural areas who rely on the sugar industry might have.
I am disappointed that this is holding up the bill; that it is holding up some important provisions for manufacturing in relation to the country of origin labelling. It is also holding up a very important provision in relation to preserving the sugar board. Despite my best efforts and it seems the best efforts of Senator Boswell to try to speed up this process, the Liberal Party, the senior partner in the coalition, is not listening. They are quite prepared to sacrifice the sugar board in terms of their ideological commitment to union busting. I find that very disappointing. I understand that Senator Boswell also finds that very disap 
 pointing. I know that he has a real commitment to the rural community, but it seems that that commitment that he has personally is perhaps not reflected in this government.
I suppose I cannot give the National Party advice about how they operate within the coalition, but if I were a member of a coalition that acted in that way I would be extraordinarily concerned, particularly in light of the situation at the moment where there are many people who have traditionally supported the National Party who feel that they have not really been given the due consideration that they should be in light of their fairly traditional support.
There is every indication at the moment that the traditional National Party base is transferring to the new One Nation Party. To some extent it arises from the National Party not being given proper regard within the coalition and not being allowed to pursue policies that protect the people that it tends to represent.
We are proceeding with items 3 and 5 of schedule 2. I find that disappointing. This government put before us a bill that is titled the  Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . When I was having a flick through the standing orders—something I try not to do too much—I noticed that there is some suggestion that amendments should not be moved that actually are not in accordance with the name of the bill. I could not find anything that said that all sections of the bill proposed by the government should have some relationship to the name of the bill. It does not appear me to be in breach of standing orders.
I would have thought that, in the general spirit of the way in which legislation is presented, there should be some relationship between the content of the bill and the name of the bill which gives the general public and the chamber some indication about what is contained in it. Certainly, this section of the bill—the section that the Democrats' amendment and also our later amendment relate to—has absolutely nothing to do with country of origin representations, although it does relate to the Trade Practices Act.
My concern about this aspect of the bill is that, even though it ostensibly uses the Trade 
 Practices Act as a vehicle for introducing this mechanism, it substantially changes the intention and spirit of the Trade Practices Act as it has always existed, in that it relates to industrial relations disputes. Senator Murray has already alluded to the fact that the ACCC since its creation has always seen fit—and I think quite properly—to steer away from industrial disputes and use the Trade Practices Act for what it is properly there for, and that is to deal with disputes between competitors and commercial parties.
It is a matter of great concern that Professor Fels has seen fit to branch out in this way. Some people might say unfairly that Professor Fels should not have acted in this manner and I agree with that. I do not believe it is appropriate for the ACCC to venture into industrial relations. This body is essentially meant to be a fair arbiter and referee and it is suddenly weighing in as an enforcer, strongarm man or bouncer for employers in an industrial relations dispute. When a body that is meant to be an independent referee ventures in in this way not only is it improper in terms of the powers of the ACCC within the Trade Practices Act but also it erodes some of the areas that the ACCC is traditionally and properly involved in. It reduces the esteem which the community holds for the ACCC as that independent body.
I suggest that Professor Fels should be cautious in extending the use of his powers into industrial disputes. Also I indicate to the government that, if we want to preserve the good things done by the ACCC and its role as an independent referee, perhaps they should not use the ACCC in this fashion.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-07-08,"—Senator Neal made some reference to me and basically what she said was right. Last Friday I approached Senator Neal and said that there was an urgency particularly for the sugar acquisition amendment, and I asked her whether she could hurry the bill through. Her reply was, `If you get the amendment regarding industrial relations taken off, we will get it through quickly.' 
I then saw Senator Hill in another place and Senator Neal repeated her request. I said I would try; maybe I went a bit further than that. I did try. I approached the people who had responsibility for it and was unsuccessful. I want to make the point that what Senator Neal said is basically right. She approached me and I said that, in the interests of getting this legislation through quickly—because there is a great deal of urgency in it—I would try to get that amendment taken off, but that was not to be the case.
I want to take up some of Senator Neal's responses. The reason why this bill is up now, in a line of 70 or 80 bills in a logjam in the Senate, is due to the National Party continually pushing the leadership of the Liberal Party to give this bill clear passage through the Senate. To say that I am not doing anything for our constituents is quite wrong. As you would know, every minister in this place would be clamouring to get their legislation up in the closing stages of this session. The fact that this bill is up now is testimony to my action in getting it jammed in between two major pieces of legislation—native title and Telstra.
I have just about worn out my welcome in Senator Hill's office in order to get this bill up. I know the urgency of it. And it is not because we are being blackmailed by One Nation. The Labor Party have suggested to me that some of our constituents are going over to One Nation. Let me say that their blue-collar workers in the towns, particularly in the sugar areas, have gone over to One Nation. I suggest to the Labor Party that they should reconnect with their people, as we are going to reconnect with our people up there. But let's not say things about One Nation and that we are not standing up for our people. That is basically wrong. We are.
I want it to be noted that this amendment is urgent. I have proved that. I have even gone to Senator Neal, because she is the spokesman for this particular area, asking if we could get the legislation through urgently. She responded in a positive way. I do not normally seek out the spokesmen on the various bills, but this legislation is urgent. If it does not go through within a certain time there will be 
 very significant ramifications. In conclusion, I am committed to the sugar industry, as is the National Party. That is why we are getting the bill through now.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-07-08,"—The government opposes this amendment on the grounds that no justification has been made for treating the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in any way different from the other provisions of part IV. Those secondary boycott provisions provide a very important remedy for persons who suffer, or could suffer, loss or damage resulting from an industrial dispute in which they are not involved directly.
There are many sectors of the community who can be affected by secondary boycotts to a greater or lesser degree, but many of those affected will not have the legal resources to seek relief in the courts. Representative actions by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission are an important mechanism to assist those people who do not have legal resources to have their cases heard by the courts. Preventing the ACCC from taking representative actions against secondary boycotts in the manner that this amendment would do would mean denying their people their legal rights simply because they cannot afford to take action. This would affect small business, in particular. It is something that the government does not wish to see happen. Therefore, we are opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-08,"—I think I got my answer from my colleague. I know that we are debating the Democrat amendment at the moment. I wanted to make sure, in relation to the two government amendments, that when we vote we will be voting on the two government amendments separately and not together.
—The question before the chair at the moment is Democrat amendment 2.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-07-08,"—I just have a couple of comments on Senator Boswell's contribution. I appreciate that he is absolutely genuine and appreciate 
 the efforts that he went to to talk to my colleague Senator Neal on the expedition of the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . It is interesting that, despite positive representations or a positive hearing from Senator Neal in terms of expediting the bill, the government still remains intent on pursuing the ACCC initiatives. I think that basically bears out concerns that both Senator Neal and I have already articulated—that is, this really is not about what it seems to be about.
These initiatives should not be in this bill, as Senator Neal has indicated. They should have been part of the fair trading packages, or they should have been in a separate bill. The fact that the government did not accede to Senator Boswell's quite reasonable request to withdraw the schedule 2 amendments is an indication and vindication of our position as to what the agenda basically is.
It is not our wish to unduly hold this bill up because the legislative program is very heavy. We are very keen, as you know, Madam Chair, to get onto the Telstra debate. If the government ever gets around to sorting out its position on it, we may end up debating it—hopefully today. We are extremely suspicious. I appreciate that Senator Boswell's actions were utterly in good faith, and I do not question in any way at all his commitment in relation to his comments, but the response that he got from the government does add to our suspicion as to what this is about. Our position, as Senator Neal has already indicated, remains the same—implacable opposition.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-08,"—It is a Democrat amendment to a 
 government provision which is in the government's legislation. The government says:
. . . the Trade Practices Act 1974 as amended by item 3 applies to conduct in contravention of a provision of Part IV whether engaged in before or after the commencement of that item.
I ask the government whether or not this means that a retrospective component has been built into this.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-07-08,—I am informed that item 5 is retrospective.,SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-08,"—In these circumstances, I oppose it and will support the Democrat amendment. With regard to Senator Boswell's contribution, I totally support the desk pricing scheme for sugar in Australia. It enables growers to get a decent price and not be picked off by the big players—not least the supermarkets in this country and people purchasing from overseas—one grower as against another so that primary producers end up with the lowest possible price.
I am forever amazed at the way in which primary producers spend months growing something and then end up with 10, 15 or 20 per cent of the retail price. The middle people and the city handlers, merchants and sellers who may have the product in their hand for a few hours or a few days, end up with the vast majority of the money that comes out of the sale of that product. There is something very, very wrong. This is not just a national problem; it is a global problem. The people who put the toil into the soil are not recompensed, and they are robbed by the economic rationalist policies of the government, including the National Party.
Senator Margetts has fought those policies from when the World Trade Organisation provisions first came into this parliament. She fought them item by item, but they went through. I might add that the press gallery totally ignored Senator Margetts when she took on that fight in this place. At the height of their economic rationalist subservience to the then Keating government, the National-Liberal parties decided that opposition to this 
 particular component of economic rationalism was not something that the Australian public should be interested in.
The press gallery failed to report on an extremely important change in the way Australia approached the protection of its home grown industries. The outcome was not only massive job losses but falling incomes for regional and rural people in particular. It has undeniably had an impact on regional towns and cities around this country. It was the Greens, long before One Nation was ever heard of, who were fighting this trend against the big parties. It is the Greens who will continue to fight this economic rationalist concoction, which says, `Disempower the people who are the producers and hand the rights across to the stock exchange, empower the stock exchange. Disempower the parliament. Get rid of rules—hand them across to people like Professor Fels who can ensure that nobody gets in the way of anything that is going to make a quick buck.'
Senator Troeth has talked about the impact the laws prohibiting secondary boycotts will have on people, but she has left out some—indigenous people, for example, trying to protect their lands against the Jabiluka uranium mine at the moment, who are effectively engaged in a secondary boycott. They are trying to boycott the establishment of a uranium mine for other purposes—so that they can keep their spiritual and physical attachment to the land. They are the people locked out, remember. It is ERA, the big mining combine, that has its bulldozers in there.
The 500 people protesting up there today are effectively running the risk of being hit with a secondary boycott suit. Senator Troeth, there are other people in the constituency besides those who might be contributing to Liberal Party coffers at the next election who are affected by the laws that you are talking about. Once again, the Greens, as our friends in the Democrats will know, have fought against the tightening of provisions to prevent unions as well as community groups taking part in protests which are for the wider good on social or environmental grounds. We have 
 not had the numbers to do that, but the chickens are coming home to roost. 
The Australian electorate is becoming more and more rested—it seems powerless to have a say not only about economic processes but also about life in general. So curiously enough, I support Senator Boswell as far as the desk price system in Queensland is concerned. I just wish that primary producers of everything from asparagus to—
—Zucchinis.
—Not zucchinis, but we will include those as well. I wish that primary producers of all the great primary products of this country were organised to defend themselves against being picked off by the big corporations which purchase their products and make the giant share of the profit out of those products, despite having put very little into the production of them.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-07-08,"—Thank you, Senator Brown, for that economic lecture. I would like to assure you that I saw enough truck drivers who suffered because of secondary boycotts during live sheep disputes to be quite sure that there are many people in the small business bracket who would wholeheartedly applaud what the government is doing under this section. They are not people who contribute to Liberal Party coffers. They are part of the wider small business community, and they will be the sorts of people who benefit from the support of this amendment. I would also like to say to Senator Brown that I understand that the Democrats will be moving an amendment shortly which will remove the retrospectivity of item 5 to which I have referred and that the government will be supporting that.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-08,"—Having had our repair amendments rejected by the Labor Party, they have, in a senatorial sense, manoeuvred me into a position where I am unable to do anything but support them in their amendment, because I am concerned that the government amendment will confirm what is, in our view, a misplaced new policy of the ACCC. Therefore, I advise the chamber that we will support the Labor Party's opposition to item 3, schedule 2.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-07-08,"—As I have said, the government supports representative actions as a way of improving the capacity of small business operators and consumers to obtain access to justice. Representative actions are already possible for breaches of part IVA, part V and part VA of the act. The Reid committee report recommended that the ACCC be given these powers to protect small business from unconscionable conduct and anticompetitive practices.
I remind the ALP that, when in government, it supported exactly this policy. In its response to the Law Reform Commission report Compliance with the Trade Practices Act, the ALP accepted the commission's recommendation that the act be amended to allow representative action for any breach of the act.
Opposition to this amendment would deny support of the ACCC to small businesses and 
 consumers who had suffered losses or damage for breaches of part IV. It would allow well- resourced parties to breach the act, knowing that ordinary Australians could not afford to enforce their rights through the courts. This would be a betrayal of the interests of consumers and small business.
I remind the committee that part IV is the key Commonwealth legislation dealing with anticompetitive practices, including such practices as price fixing, exclusive dealing and misuse of market power. These are broad provisions which are relevant to all Australian consumers and small businesses. The government will not agree to the opposition to this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—I dispute the assumption in that statement that this provision, item 3 of schedule 2, puts into effect the recommendation of that report. That is not entirely correct. To hold up that recommendation or make that assumption and then say that the ALP supported that recommendation and therefore they should support this provision is entirely incorrect. It goes a lot further and directs itself to many other matters that were not originally contained in the recommendation of that report.
—The question is that schedule 2, item 3, stand as printed.
Question resolved in the negative.
—Could you repeat what the question was, Madam Temporary Chairman?
—The question before the committee was that schedule 2, item 3, stand as printed, and it has been defeated. It is not standing as printed, as I understand it. Are you clear now, Senator Troeth?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-08,"—I will be tolerant about this, but the government should be a bit sharper about the matter. It is necessary to be on top of votes such as this, where there can be double negatives. We, as single representatives—Senator Harradine will know about this—have to be able to do so. So it is important that the government is able to do so. These are important amendments. Essentially, what we are being asked to do is to resubmit this matter to a vote. I am happy to do that. It will save a much longer process later in the day. But the government needs to sharpen up a bit.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-08,"—Senator Troeth is quite understandably confused. I came into the chamber as the question was being put and I said to Senator Troeth, `I'm going to vote against this.' That is where the confusion was. What I meant was that I would vote against the item in the schedule.
—That's fine. That's what she called.
—Quite so. I am at fault here; I apologise for that. I am happy to see it recommitted, but I will be voting against the question that schedule 2, item 3, stand as printed.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—Very briefly, this amendment ostensibly prevents retrospective action in relation to items 3 and 5 on schedule 2. It only goes 
 so far as to prevent retrospective actions by way of injunction. It does not prevent retrospective actions being taken in relation to damages. Therefore, again, it is one of those fix-it clauses that really do not go far enough to solve the problem. Bearing in mind that we are opposing item 5, we will not support this attempt to fix the difficulties—we will contain our energies to opposing item 5. Hopefully, the Democrats may see the difficulties that we have raised in terms of damages.
—Senator Murray, can you make clear to the committee whether or not your amendment is necessary in light of the removal of schedule 2, item 3?

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-08,"—Madam Chair, I am always delighted when the chair and indeed the table pick up an obvious error. I actually knew it was an obvious error and I was just testing to see whether anybody else had picked it up. I would assume that your indication is correct, that in fact it does not need to be moved, because of the removal of the item. Would that be the opinion of the clerk advising you? I think it is correct.
—I think, Senator, we have a lack of clarity and maybe we could ask if Senator Troeth and her advisers might also assist you and us.
—Thank you. In the meantime, Madam Chair, would you like to me to continue with the earlier debate where we discussed sugar when we were in fact dealing with industrial relations?
—This chair sees no need to add sweetness, but we could—
—I am not an expert on sugar, but I do know something about bananas and I do recall that they were a moment of hilarity.

—I am informed that it is not necessary.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-07-08,"—I move:
(2) Page 11 (after line 29), at the end of the Bill, add:
Schedule 3—Amendment of the Trade Practices Act 1974  relating to section 51 authorisation
1 At the end of Part XII
Add:
173 Authorisation for the purposes of subsection 51(1)
(1)	 In deciding whether a person (including a corporation) has contravened section 50 of this Act, the vesting of ownership of primary products in the person by legislation is to be taken, for the purposes of subparagraph 51(1)(a)(i), to be specified in, and specifically authorised by, this section.
(2)	 In this section:
 primary products  means:
(a)	 agricultural or horticultural produce, including produce that has been subjected to a manufacturing process; or
(b)	 crops, whether on or attached to the land or not; or
(c)	 animals (whether dead or alive); or
(d)	 the bodily produce (including natural increase) of animals.
Note:	 An example of agricultural produce that has been subjected to a manufacturing process is sugar cane that has been transformed into raw sugar
This amendment removes any uncertainty that may exist as to whether the statutory acquisitions of primary products under state or territory marketing schemes relating to primary products are caught by section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 which governs the 
 prohibition of acquisitions that would result in a substantial lessening of competition.
This amendment confirms, once and for all, that the purchase of primary products by state or territory marketing schemes relating to primary products does not breach section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The government is proposing this amendment on the advice of the Queensland state government, which has indicated it believes the matter is not completely free from legal doubt. The intent of the existing section 50 exemption is clear and the government, seeking to act prudently on this matter, is merely reinforcing this intent through this clarifying amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-08,"—The opposition will be supporting this amendment. Once again, it is a provision that really has nothing to do with the primary purpose of the bill, which relates to country of origin. Essentially, primary produce was exempt from the provisions of section 51(1) and now we have had an marginal extension on that to include primary products that have been subjected to a manufacturing process.
The list of primary products seems trivial on the face of it, but in fact it is quite extensive for those people who have looked at those sort of issues. But, putting aside the fact that it is not really trivial, I have been contacted by Mr Bonanno from the Queensland sugar board, and I understand their concerns that the way this provision operates could put them in jeopardy, so I am certainly keen to assist them. I will support the government on this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-08,"—The Democrats will be supporting this amendment. As far as I am concerned, this really is a tidy up of a mess that the government made for itself. It really has to do with the whole debate about the restructuring of the sugar industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales in which there was a trade-off between a very minimal sugar tariff and the single desk selling operation which is unique to the sugar industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales.
This was very controversial at the time and caused a great division within the industry in Queensland and between the two organisa 
 tions in Queensland—the Queensland cane growers, which is the statutory body, and the Queensland cane farmers, which is a voluntary body—and I am not sure that that division in the industry has been resolved. The cane growers, being a statutory body and close to the government, of course, supported the abolition of the sugar tariff on the understanding that they would then retain the single desk selling authority. The cane farmers did not support the abolition of the sugar tariff. The Democrats were able to secure a hearing at which these issues were canvassed very widely, and then we had a strong debate in the Senate. We were supported by the Labor Party in seeking to retain the sugar tariff but that was lost.
Then, after all that happened, all of a sudden, the ACCC came into the equation and said, `The single desk is now under threat because it is anticompetitive,' which put the wind up everybody, particularly the cane growers, because they had gone out so much on a limb in agreeing to abolish the tariff in order to retain the single desk issue. There was a real panic on. In order to ensure that the government did not actually betray the whole basis for getting rid of the tariff, they then moved this amendment. Of course, the Democrats support it. We have had conversations with Mr Bonanno, who felt quite estranged from the Democrats and, I think, the Labor Party over the sugar tariff issue. But we believe that this is the appropriate thing to do. We ought to fix this up and make sure that that trade-off is in fact supported by legislation because it is critical that we do retain that ability in Queensland to market our sugar through the single desk authority.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-08,"—As I said earlier, I totally support the single desk scheme. I only wish that other primary producers also had the assured prices that this brings to Queensland sugar growers, and I think that other industries should look at that. If there is one further indictment of the ACCC, it is the fact that it sees this as a monopoly that should be broken down. Broken down in whose interests? Big confectionary manufacturers? Big supermarkets which want to trade off one sugar grower 
 against another and send them to the wall? It is certainly not in the interests of rural Queensland or, for that matter, in the interests, if the scheme was available, of rural New South Wales. I support the sugar growers and I support the House in making this move.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the financial interests of Senator Parer.
Yesterday, we discovered that Senator Parer's family trust holding company, IMPL, had purchased 2,600 Telstra shares. That was after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had expressly prohibited ministers, their staff or proxies from purchasing them. We still have not received the formal letter from the government, from Senator Hill. Hopefully, that will be forthcoming so that the situation will be indicated even more clearly. Senator Hill, after question time yesterday, at least gave some information to the Senate in relation to the instructions that ministers were given.
Senator Parer ran the defence that he did not buy them. He ignored the fact that he was Chairman of IMPL at the time and he owned eight of the nine shares. If that is not tantamount to actually purchasing the shares himself, I do not know what is. 	Today, we discovered that Senator Parer has ignored yet another of the Prime Minister's instructions—that is, that ministers' staff members should not purchase Telstra shares within 90 days of their first trade.
Mr Baudino, who purchased a certain number of shares at the time of the Telstra float, is a long-time media adviser to Senator Parer, a long-time Liberal Party hatchet man. 
 He has a history in the Liberal Party that goes back a very long way. He was linked very closely with the former Fraser government's information unit.
He is well known for excelling in media management. Earlier this year, on 20 March, he instructed a Commonwealth security guard to eject photographers from Senator Parer's press conference. He prevented press reporters from entering. He only allowed the TV cameras in. That was the press conference, of course, when Senator Parer declared he was considering the option of divesting his portfolio after being caught red-handed. Mr Baudino is well known for threatening journalists if they continue their pursuit of his boss, Senator Parer.
This is the same minister who ignored the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct not just once, in relation to having private interests in his portfolio area, but twice, in relation to divesting those interests to family members. He received three separate instructions from the register of senators' pecuniary interests about holdings in his family trust. He ignored all of them.
You have to ask the question: what does this latest revelation about Senator Parer really say about the way he runs his own office? What happens to Senator Parer's correspondence? Is it that he does not actually receive it? Is it that he receives it but he does not read it? Is it that he reads it and does nothing about it? Perhaps he just reads it and ignores it. Certainly, he indicated today that he passed these instructions on to members of his staff.
This is just another flagrant breach by Senator Parer of the Prime Minister's own guidelines. We heard the defence trotted out in question time today: `Oh, well, Mr Keating the former Labor Party Prime Minister was, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, responsible for certain actions four or five years ago. It was good enough for Mr Keating, therefore'—allegedly—`it is good enough for Senator Parer.' This from the government that, up until today, has mounted the consistent defence that they were going to put in place higher ministerial and parliamentary standards, greater accountability and 
 greater transparency. No, not any more. Now they are saying, `It was good enough for one of your number. Senator Parer does not have to conform.' Senator Parer has failed every test. He has failed every test on every occasion. The latest example of Mr Baudino on his staff proves this minister should resign.

"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1998-07-08,"—It is extraordinary for the Labor Party to come in here and go through the sort of cant that we have had here today when this is the very day on which the Labor Party's standards on prime ministerial and ministerial propriety are shown to be in tatters. They are in tatters because the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald  today revealed it all. It revealed the fact that the former Labor Prime Minister of this country misled the House of Representatives in his statement to the Registrar of Members' Interests.
What is the misleading conduct? It is very simple: the former Prime Minister said in a letter to the Registrar of Members' Interests that he had sold his family interests in the piggery in Parkville and other associated companies to one Mr Al Constantinidis. What is the truth? Did he sell these shares to Mr Al Constantinidis or was it something more devious? It was, in fact, something more devious, because the whole sale—the whole $US6 million sale—was negotiated between Mr Keating and one Mr William Soeryadjaya from Indonesia.
When was it negotiated? It was negotiated, it appears, some time around 2 March 1994. It was negotiated at a meeting at Mr Constantinidis's home between Mr Soeryadjaya and Mr Keating. As even Mr Constantinidis says, the whole deal was prepared by Mr Keating's financial advisers and presented to him as a fait accompli. In other words, the whole transaction was a sham. It was a sham to hide the fact that Mr Keating was disposing of this interest to a foreign investor from Indonesia for a US dollar sum of $6 million. If this transaction was above board, why would Mr Keating need to hide the identity of the person who was buying the asset? Why couldn't he just sell it directly to Mr Soeryadjaya? If this was a clean transaction, if 
 there was nothing to hide, why did he have to cleanse the transaction by putting it through Mr Constantinidis, who then on-sold the assets to Mr Soeryadjaya? The reason is very simple: Mr Keating had something to hide.
He was the Prime Minister of this country. He was involved in discussions between Australia and Indonesia at the very highest level. He had already been fingered in this place for being involved in secret negotiations to bring genetic material in from Denmark. Senator Ferguson recollects that very well. He had already been fingered in this place for the improper influence he had placed on those discussions. He was going to sell the asset to somebody from Indonesia at the very time he was negotiating with the Indonesian government.
What did he do? He entered into this sham transaction. Not only did he enter into the sham transaction; worse still, he misled the Registrar of Members' Interests by pretending this transaction was with Mr Constantinidis when, in fact, Mr Constantinidis was the patsy. He was the fall guy for the transaction. The truth is that Mr Keating did not want anybody—and certainly not the parliament, to whom he had an obligation—to know exactly what he was doing.
We get this cant from the Labor Party that somehow there is something wrong with Senator Parer because his wife may have happened to purchase some shares in a company. It was not Mr Keating's wife who did this transaction; it was Mr Keating himself, in a meeting with Mr William Mr Soeryadjaya, who just happened to step off a plane from Indonesia. How easy is it for somebody to get a meeting with the Prime Minister? How easy is it for somebody to step off a plane from Indonesia and, all of a sudden, have a meeting with the Prime Minister at the Prime Minister's accountant's house?
I would have thought it would have been a fairly difficult proposition, unless there was something more nefarious going on. That is exactly what happened: there was a very nefarious transaction. Do not forget that this was a transaction in which Mr Keating was paid $US6 million for a company that was 
 $13 million in debt. Maybe Mr Soeryadjaya needs a trip to the funny farm, but maybe this matter is more murky than anybody on the benches opposite is willing to admit.
That is the condemnation that the Labor Party deserves, and that is why the motion they have proposed in this chamber today is deserving of none of the time of this Senate. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-08,"—Madam Deputy President, isn't it a remarkable defence of Senator Parer for the other side to say, `We believe there are allegations against former Prime Minister Keating, therefore no-one should ever again ask a question about Senator Parer'? It does not work that way. Senator Parer is a public official.
Let me express my disappointment about the fact that Senator Hill has not tabled those relevant extracts from the Prime Minister's letter of August last year so we can judge the precise requirements. Extracts have been quoted in at least two newspapers by some of his colleagues. We would like to see them so we can measure what standards the Prime Minister put on this government and what their response is to those standards, because that is what we are examining here today.
We were accused by Senator Alston today, when he was not in his own seat, of the politics of envy. Senators should note the fact that Senator Alston took great note of the questions being asked of Senator Parer. He didn't make a big statement in this chamber, but he slipped out, sold all his shares and notified the registrar 28 days later. We will not catch out the slippery Senator Alston on any of these particular issues. He knows when to get out. He knows when to hide on these particular matters.
Senator Parer's performance today, apart from the normal sprint out of the chamber after question time—which I think he would win an olympic event at; he has won it every day for the last few months, but leaving that aside—was interesting. He was asked today whether he got the Prime Minister's letter. Yes, he did; he read it. That is a big improvement on his ministerial performance in the past—they did not lose it.
He also noted the prohibitions. He would argue there was no prohibition on his spouse buying Telstra shares. We have never argued that. He would argue that even though he was chairman of IMPL and controlled eight of the nine shares and they purchased 2,600, it was not his decision, this was his spouse's decision—the same sort of defence he ran over the East Court matter with Gashbar when, on call, $250,000 was supposed to be paid and it was not fronted up. Senator Parer, in the newspapers at that time, said, `Oh no, I don't handle any of those matters. Talk to the spouse, she handles all those particular matters.' But he then went on to say, finally answering the question, `Yes, I did note the prohibition on staff buying shares. Yes, I did inform my staff that they were not to buy shares.'
He did not answer the last part of the question, however: what did he do or did he take any steps to make sure his own staff complied with the Prime Minister's directive? What do we find? We find that his key member of staff, in fact, has gone out on 25 November and purchased 1,600 Telstra shares along with hundreds of thousands of other Australians. Why would Senator Parer's staffer defy him in that way, or was he to understand the sort of pattern of behaviour here meant that all those associated with this minister were going to get in for their chop? After all, 24 parcels went—
—Twenty-seven.
—Twenty-four parcels, not counting the others, went to people directly related to Senator Parer or his companies. So that culture existed that they would all get in for their chop.
We have Mr Baudino, the media adviser, defying the Prime Minister's edict. And we find out today—we are surprised, but we do not doubt it—he defied the minister himself. Could it be that the greatest gutter crawler in history up in the gallery—we were accused of it the other day, but no-one could exceed this media officer's record up there of dissembling various mistruths about this building; no-one in the history of the building has this bloke's record—is in there for his chop and he has defied Senator Parer?
Senator Parer, in these circumstances, only has one possible solution, and that is to give Mr Baudino the pink slip and then at least expunge that one thing off his record, because ultimately the minister is responsible for his own staff's performance. If he has instructed them not to do something and if they have defied him, then some of his responsibility is ameliorated. But he can only do that by saying to his staff member who has defied him, `I am sorry. You will not follow orders. You are out.'

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-07-08,"—It is interesting to note that the two participants in this debate today from the Labor Party side have been Senators Faulkner and Ray, who sat around the cabinet table with former Labor Prime Minister, Mr Keating. The revelations in today's Sydney Morning Herald  must leave them feeling very betrayed or they had full knowledge about it. On either account, they must be feeling very nervous. It has been quite clear amongst journalists and amongst others in the public arena that the story on Mr Keating was about to break. So what was the Labor Party's tactic? It was to try to distract attention from the story that broke today and so they have had another pathetic attempt on Senator Parer.
Let me simply say this to the people of Australia: there is a fundamental difference between Senator Parer's financial situation and Mr Keating's financial situation. Senator Parer got all his money prior to politics by working hard, honestly and diligently. Mr Keating made his money whilst he was the Prime Minister. Those of us who know the salary that pertains to the office of Prime Minister can do our sums. At the end of the day, even if he did not have to spend a cent on food, and he invested all his prime ministerial salary at the best possible interest rates, he could not have the degree of wealth that he has today. So the question has to be asked: from whence did that wealth come? That is why Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray, no doubt, are no longer in the chamber—because they feel the pressure.
That is the very big difference in this debate: Senator Parer was known to be a wealthy, capable businessmen before he 
 entered this place. Indeed, he has prejudiced his wealth by coming into this place. Mr Keating made his wealth by coming into this place, by doing the sort of deals that have now been highlighted in the Sydney Morning Herald, and the Labor Party, the so-called party of the battlers, is willing to accept and defend that sort of behaviour.
I would have thought, if the Labor Party had some political smarts, that today they would have been trying to get onto some policy areas and not leading with their chin in relation to the question of ministerial standards. When one compares the ministerial standards required of Liberal and National party ministers with what the Labor Party has done, especially in relation to the man they chose to depose Mr Hawke and who they supported—when you make that juxtaposition—the absolute duplicity in the standards that the Labor Party would seek to apply clearly becomes apparent?
I look forward to the time, possibly tomorrow or the next day, or even in a month or two's time, when the Labor Party might devote itself to and take up issues of policy—issues such as unemployment.
—They can't.
—They can't, Senator Ferguson, you are right. Why? Because if they were to do that, we would remind them of the one million people they left in the unemployment queues because of Mr Keating's excellent economic management. Isn't it a pity that his own personal economic management could not be translated into Australia's economic benefit? Why is it that he could not turn these dollars into millions instead of leaving Australia a $10.5 billion deficit? He was able to do it, miraculously, in relation to the piggery—he was able to get $6 million for a $13 million debt. If he could have had the same sort of return on the $10.5 billion deficit he left Australia, we would now have paid off all our federal debt. But, unfortunately, the pursuit of personal wealth was greater than his pursuit of his responsibilities of public office. I look forward to the next policy debate whenever the Labor Party want to bring it on—be it on unemployment, be it on budget deficits or whatever.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-07-08,"—Madam Deputy President, you would recall that, on 11 March this year, Senator Parer was asked to respond to a question in regard to the explanatory notes for the registrable interests that he was required to put before this parliament which require disclosure of:
. . . any other interests where a conflict of interest with a Senator's public duties could foreseeably arise or could be seen to arise.
Senator Parer had indicated, under that section in his declaration, that he was a person who was married, that he was a ratepayer and that he was a Christian. But he failed to indicate in that register that he, in fact, had a significant shareholding in coalmining interests to the tune of $2 million.
Since that time, we have discovered that perhaps the only thing that was accurate, the only thing that was true, with regard to that declaration of pecuniary interests made before the Senate was that Senator Parer was married, a ratepayer and a Christian. No other aspect of that declaration appears to have been borne out by an examination of the facts. Since 11 March, we have discovered a network of shareholdings and arrangements with regard to various investment agencies that demonstrates that Senator Parer's share trading activities make Gordon Gekko look somewhat like a saint.
We have to ask at this time whether this millionaire resource company share trader, this part-time Minister for Resources and Energy, actually does understand the difference between what is legal and what is ethical. It is quite apparent from his actions before this chamber that he has some difficulty reaching that conclusion. That may be a little harsh. There is evidence to suggest that other views could be put that Senator Parer does understand the difference. I am sure his defenders on the other side will one day get up and explain that to us, but we will wait for that event to occur.
On 17 October last year, Senator Parer went to some length to big-note himself, to explain that he had written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to indicate that he had disposed of the CSR shares that he held through the Warwick Parer family trust because CSR had 
 an interest in the bauxite mine Nabalaco. He indicated that he thought it was appropriate for him to dispose of those shares because there might be a public perception of a conflict of interest.
We do understand that noble gesture was not followed through in all other actions taken by the resources minister. We have come to understand that there were, in fact, a whole series of other share transactions undertaken by this minister through various investment agencies. For instance, there was the purchasing of shares through Argo Investments such as Energy Resources of Australia Ltd, which has a direct and specific interest in the uranium mining at Jabiluka—a mine that required the support of this minister and particular actions taken by him as the minister for resources.
So we ask ourselves what is the difference between the actions taken by this minister in the public declaration of the disposal of CSR shares in regard to a bauxite mine, and his own actions with regard to the purchase of shares, through an investment vehicle, in Energy Resources of Australia and their actions in uranium mining. That is a pattern that seems to have emerged not just in the case of uranium. It is action we are now seeing in share transactions involving Ashton Mining and the diamond industry, Broken Hill, North Ltd, the coal trust of Queensland, Rio Tinto and various other diversified miners. We see it in the gold industry and in oil and gas.
In fact, there is a whole range of industries in which this minister has quite obviously a substantial benefit. It may be said, as he indicated here yesterday, that he sought to use these investment agents as a vehicle to establish some sort of hands-off arrangement towards his share trading. It seems to me more likely to be the case that he understood the benefits that could be derived from the decisions to be taken by him in each of these sectors and, in due course, that he personally would secure the benefits to be derived from his decisions as the minister for resources in all of those industries.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-07-08,"—It is 
 interesting that not one of the Labor senators has chosen to defend their former leader Mr Keating against the allegations that have been made against him in the Sydney Morning Herald . In almost an unprecedented way, no-one from the Labor Party seems to be bothered to stay in this chamber to try to defend Mr Keating. I know why Senator Carr did not stay: it is because he was a factional opponent of Mr Keating. He is probably encouraging us to raise these issues. But I am surprised that neither Senator Faulkner nor Senator Ray had one word of defence in favour of the man who led their party for many years. That brings into question the motives of Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner, and perhaps I will return to that later.
There was a suggestion made by one of the Labor senators that Senator Parer had increased his wealth. That is certainly correct. He has done it by his own hard work and efforts over his lifetime. One might ask about Mr Keating and his increase in wealth. I know that, under Labor, inflation rose dramatically, but not dramatically enough to explain why Mr Keating's investment of $430,000 seemed to convert, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, to an asset of $A10 million. How could that possibly occur, and why is it not being explained?
I cannot believe that the ministry under Mr Keating, which included such inquisitive minds as Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray, did not inquire of the then Prime Minister as to what happened. You know, Madam Deputy President, as we all know, that Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray have trawled through everybody's statements of interest. They have gone to inordinate lengths to check out every one of us on this side. We know that that is happening. They have very inquisitive, investigative minds. But why weren't they put into play when all this furore about Mr Keating occurred? You might recall that our former colleague Senator Michael Baume consistently attacked in this chamber Mr Keating for what he alleged were shonky dealings over that piggery. Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray defended the Prime Minister 
 at every occasion and called Senator Baume all the names under the sun.
Senator Baume mentioned it outside this chamber because he is a courageous man, and Mr Keating sued him. He got him to shut up because he sued him for defamation. He said that he would make Senator Baume pay. On 12 June this year, as I am informed by the whip, former Senator Baume indicated that Mr Keating has withdrawn that defamation action. One might think that the reason for that was that the last thing Mr Keating wanted exposed in a court case were the real facts of this issue. Fortunately, the Sydney Morning Herald appears to expose those facts in any case. But Mr Keating did not want it. Perhaps an expose of those facts might also have implicated some of the people who were in cabinet with Mr Keating at that time.
We on this side will have to take a leaf out of the book of the current Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and his cohorts and start looking through the statements of interest of Labor senators and work out why Labor senators who were for the last 13 years ministers in the government, which means that they were getting fairly big salaries, and who do not seem to have any commitments—and people who have been cabinet ministers on even higher salaries—do not seem to have any assets to disclose in their statements of interest. They do not seem to have dependants. One might wonder what has happened to all of them. That is something that we on this side, although we do not like doing that, might have to do. While we are at it, we will look at the allegation that John Brown, a former minister in the Labor government, received a gift of $1 million when he left this place. Someone else said that it was a payment of a commission. Why he was paying a former minister a commission one would have to wonder about. But that probably needs looking into as well. We should perhaps also look into the redundancy payment paid to David Hill, now a candidate for the Labor Party, when he was General Manager of the ABC. (Time expired)

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-08,"—I move the following amendment to the motion:
Add the words: ""and, in respect of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, the bill be referred to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry and report on 7 October 1998."". 

I will speak briefly to my amendment. This is a very important but complex bill. It is really the first major reform of Commonwealth environment law in the last 20 years. It should be considered by the Senate committee before debate in this place. It not only is a good vehicle to pick up the fine points, but I have always supported that process as an opportunity for the wider constituency to have a public opportunity to contribute to the legislative process.
The appropriate committee is obviously the legislation committee, because the bill has been tabled and that is what we are considering and that is what legislative committees were set up for. I have suggested a report on 7 October 1998. That might seem to be a long time, but I have deliberately allowed a considerable time in order that all interested parties can have a full opportunity to contribute to the process. It would mean that there would still be the opportunity to debate the bill in this chamber during the spring session following its return to this place on 7 October.
The government is obviously keen to get that bill debated as it is pursuant to a COAG agreement that was reached last year. It has been a long, complex process. The COAG agreement was followed by a consultation paper and now the bill, and it is time for the legislative process to take place. Nevertheless, I think that a period of consideration by the Senate committee that was set up for this purpose—that is, the environment legislation committee—can improve the bill further and, as I said, give all stakeholders a fair, public opportunity to contribute their views.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-07-08,"—I move:
(1)	 Omit ""Legislation"", substitute ""References"".
(2)	 Omit ""7 October 1998"", substitute ""the last day of sitting in November 1998"".
The reason the Democrats wish to see this legislation sent to the environment references committee is, as Senator Hill rightly points out, that this is a very important and a very complex bill. It is some 400 pages. It is perhaps the most significant change to the federal environment legislation in the history of this parliament.
We are suggesting that, since the references committee  has been examining for the past 18 months or so the powers of the Commonwealth in terms of the environment, it is very well placed to take this reference. It has been gathering expertise and investing a great deal of time and effort to this purpose. I remind honourable senators that, in the past, bills of such complexity and such enormity—such as the workplace relations bill and the sale of Telstra bill—have been supported by the Senate to go to a references committee. I think this is another example of where such a referral should go to that committee. I commend this amendment to the Senate and ask that it be supported.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-08,"—I support Senator Allison's amendment on behalf of the Democrats in regard to the environmental legislation. Of course this legislation should be going to the references committee rather than the legislation committee. It should be going to the references committee because of the enormous impact that is inherent in this legislation not only on Australian politics but on the future of the environment in this country.
When in 1972 Lake Pedder was facing imminent flooding—in fact, it was inundated during the winter of 1972—with the Hydro Electric Commission in Tasmania and the Reece Labor government of the time rolling right across the top of public sentiment, the Whitlam government was voted into power in Australia—in December of that year. The Prime Minister, particularly under the influence of the very esteemed member of the House of Representatives, Mr Tom Uren, and also Dr Moss Cass, moved to see what could be done in the national interest to stop this great act of destruction of a prime piece of Australia's natural heritage, Lake Pedder being one of the most gently beautiful places on the face of this planet. They found that there was very little in terms of federal ability—
—On a point of order, Madam Deputy President: we are debating a motion about referring this to a legislation or a references committee. My point is on the matter of relevance. I think Senator Brown is 
 debating the subject and getting away from what we are supposed to be talking about.
—Senator Brown, if you could make your comments relevant to the amendment to the amendment, please.
—Certainly. I am, Madam Deputy President. That is twice in a couple of days that Senator Calvert, who is unlikely to make any contribution to this debate, has—
—Senator Brown, please don't reflect upon another member of this place. Make your comments in relation to the amendment, thank you.
—That he has sought to cut across the development of my argument, and I am going to continue.
—On a point of order: Senator Brown is clearly and graphically defying the ruling you have just made, Madam Deputy President. I know you really don't need my help, but I remind you that he is clearly and aggressively ignoring your ruling.
—Senator Macdonald, I was about—before you interrupted me—to ask Senator Brown to please continue to debate the amendment that has been moved by Senator Allison or Senator Hill. Senator Brown, do not indulge in your thoughts on the behaviour of other senators in regard to what you perceive that they are doing with your speaking time. Please continue.
—I will, Madam Deputy President. As I said, I will continue to develop my argument from where I left off before I was interrupted. The Prime Minister of the time, Gough Whitlam, then sought to intervene but found that there was very little Commonwealth power to do so. Out of that tragedy came the development of Commonwealth law for the protection of places of high conservation value which were of importance to the whole of the nation. These included the establishment of the Australian Heritage Commission, a number of environment acts and the signing of the world heritage convention in 1975.
Because of this development of national law which had the ability to protect environmental assets of national significance, the Daintree rainforests, which would otherwise have been vulnerable, have been protected.
—Senator Brown, we are debating two amendments to a Selection of Bills Committee report which relate to what will happen to a bill, which committee it should be investigated by and what the length of time for that investigation should be. I would appreciate it if you could tie your contribution to the variations in relation to the amendments that have been moved, please.
—To continue my argument, because of the development of those laws, the Australian environment has been much better protected. But here we have comprehensive legislation to unravel those environment powers, to divest the national government of the day of powers to protect the Australian environment and put them back to several maverick state governments which these days, at the end of the 1990s, show little more sympathy to the environment than Eric Reece and his destructive band of ministers did in Tasmania in the early 1970s.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Once again it relates to relevance. We are not debating the bill. We are supposed to be debating the reference of this bill to the references committee or the legislation committee and the amount of time involved—nothing else.
—Senator Brown, I would ask you to tailor your comments to the amendments that have been moved, please.
—Yes, I will continue as I was—
—If you continue, would you please continue tailoring your comments to the amendments that have been moved.
—As they were tailored before I will. The point of this is that the dismantling of these laws has massive ramifications outside the strict legal determination that the legislation committee can handle. Of 
 course, as Senator Allison has moved, it should go to the references committee. As she has pointed out, this is complex legislation like that for the sale of Telstra and like that for industrial relations in this country. It is no less important, so it should go to the same sort of committee. That is the point I have been trying to make. That is the point I have illustrated. I have given the reasons why, and I support this amendment from Senator Allison 100 per cent.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-08,"—In support of the argument that this bill should be sent to the references committee, I would like to remind the Senate that the first announcement that was made publicly in relation to the changing of these laws, or at least the first that I knew, was actually made by Senator Parer. It would appear that the announcement and the push for the changes of these policies that are exemplified by the legislation we are being asked to look at were not made strictly in terms of environmental legislation. It was made in terms of economic policy and promises to investors that the environment movement could be got off the hose of development; that is, that it could be made cheaper for investors if we could remove some of those nasty impediments to people making more money.
The implications are much wider than a particular piece of legislation, although the legislation probably epitomises a number of these elements. We have got the issue of whether or not we are actually unable to better assist and protect world heritage areas and areas of national significance. We are going to need to bring those issues in and debate them within a committee structure, and I think that would be quite difficult under the strict terms of a legislation committee. I would argue strongly that it is an issue of major concern. Any polling in Australia would indicate that it is a major concern, and the protection of environment and environmental qualities and future implications of the environment are considered to be highly relevant and highly important by the community and—this is something which should 
 make a difference to both the government and the opposition—by the electorate as well.
The issues are such that they must be looked at in the context of the changes that are occurring. Of course, we have got to look at it in the context of all the promises that have been made in relation to other issues that we have dealt with. On the RFA process, we are continually told that we have got to look to the state side of things. Every time we have asked questions about environment issues which have a federal connection, the answer is generally, `Well, it is the role of the states.' If it is land use, it is the role of the states. We have seen an entire policy shift. What we are talking about is the legislative changes in the context of the entire policy shift pushed by the corporate profit making dollar.
I would argue that that is the exact reason that those reference committees have been set up: to be able to look at complex, important legislation in the wider context and not be restricted to simply the wording within the particular legislation we are looking at. Quite frankly, in an issue as major as the one we are looking at here, you have to look at what has gone before, what is attached and what is happening in other policy areas. We are also looking at whether or not there are going to be jobs in the future. We are going to be looking at whether or not we are simply going down a very narrow path for a very narrow end, that is, increasing profitability for a very small number of people.
I would like to support the extension of time to acknowledge the important role that many people in the community—I would have to say the majority of the community—feel that environmental standards play. I would like to argue strongly that the legislation committee would not be the appropriate body to look at this. It is not a small, distinct reference; it is a reference about this legislation in the context of the wider policy changes. They are not just environmental changes, they are economic changes as well. They will have an impact for a long time in the future. I believe we need to cross-reference, I believe we need to put them in context, and I believe 
 the references committee is the most appropriate body to handle such an inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-08,"—There is no doubt that the bill on which we are debating reference to a committee represents very substantial and sweeping changes to the Commonwealth's environmental laws, perhaps the most significant for the past 20 years. I think that as a result of that the bill does deserve some detailed consideration. I notice that this view was supported by the minister, Senator Hill. He said on 26 March:
`
The proposed reform represents a truly historic initiative. In fact, the proposals represent the only comprehensive attempt in the history of our federation to define the environmental responsibilities of the Commonwealth government.
Perhaps those words are a little overblown, but I think this does indicate the significance which at least the government is attaching to this particular bill.
At the heart of the debate lies the argument about the extent to which the Commonwealth should exercise powers over the environment. Some would say that this is not so much an issue about legislation as much as it is an issue about federation and the nature of our constitutional arrangements. The bill would define the role of the Commonwealth with regard to environmental protection and management, affecting the level and extent of participation by the Commonwealth. It is difficult to say, from the information that is provided in the consultation paper, the extent to which the national environmental significance trigger would adequately protect the environment.
The bill ties in with a recent inquiry by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee on Commonwealth environmental powers. The period for public consultation and for input from the public on the consultation paper was very limited. Of course, the government said that that was because, after the bill was introduced, there would be an opportunity for full public consultation.
We have a technical issue here about whether the bill should be referred to a 
 references committee or to a legislation committee. In relation to legislative and general purpose standing committees, let me quote Odgers. I do not often quote Odgers, but Odgers claims that references to legislative and general purpose standing committees should relate to subjects which can be dealt with expeditiously. The bill does not really fall into the category of matters which can be dealt with expeditiously. This has national significance and far-reaching effects. References committees are in a better position to be able to conduct that sort of inquiry. That is the fact of the matter. I think it is more suitable in relation to this legislation for it to go to a references committee. It is important to consult as widely as possible because these are dramatic and far-reaching changes to Commonwealth environmental law.
This has not been a view often expressed by the opposition since we lost government in 1996, but on this occasion the arguments are strong enough for us to support a references committee inquiry as opposed to this matter being dealt with by the legislation committee. It is for that reason, on this occasion, that the opposition sees merit in Senator Allison's amendment, and we will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-08,"—I would indicate to the Senate that I have had a good look at this particular matter and I have listened to what has been said in this debate. One concern that I had was that the legislation committee may not be able to travel to hear what the states have to say or what, for example, the environmental groups have to say in the various states. I am assured by the officers of the Senate that that is not the case and that, in a matter like this, it is quite likely that, after advance notice being given of the reference of this matter to the legislation committee, there is nothing to stop that legislation committee from going around the states and collecting evidence from people within the states. They do not have to come here.
Normally speaking, when we have a legislation committee, they are pretty concertinaed jobs and people have to come to Canberra for that purpose. But, in respect of this matter, I have ascertained that the likelihood, depend 
 ing upon the committee itself of course, would be that the committee would go to the various states to examine witnesses and submitters. I have spoken to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) about that and he has indicated to me that that would be the likely result. If the matter was referred to the legislation committee then not only would that committee not be prevented from taking evidence from around the states on this very important matter but he indicated that that would be done.
—We did that with the Natural Heritage Trust Bill, and we went right around Australia.
—Senator Ian Campbell mentions that that was what occurred with another very important piece of legislation which was somewhat contentious. It is my intention to vote for the legislation to be referred to the legislative committee.

What we are talking about is the legislative changes in the context of the entire policy shift pushed by the corporate profit making dollar.
I would argue that that is the exact reason that those reference committees have been set up: to be able to look at complex, important legislation in the wider context and not be restricted to simply the wording within the particular legislation we are looking at. Quite frankly, in an issue as major as the one we are looking at here, you have to look at what has gone before, what is attached and what is happening in other policy areas. We are also looking at whether or not there are going to be jobs in the future. We are going to be looking at whether or not we are simply going down a very narrow path for a very narrow end, that is, increasing profitability for a very small number of people.
I would like to support the extension of time to acknowledge the important role that many people in the community—I would have to say the majority of the community—feel that environmental standards play. I would like to argue strongly that the legislation committee would not be the appropriate body to look at this. It is not a small, distinct reference; it is a reference about this legislation in the context of the wider policy changes. They are not just environmental changes, they are economic changes as well. They will have an impact for a long time in the future. I believe we need to cross-reference, I believe we need to put them in context, and I believe 
 the references committee is the most appropriate body to handle such an inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-08,"—There is no doubt that the bill on which we are debating reference to a committee represents very substantial and sweeping changes to the Commonwealth's environmental laws, perhaps the most significant for the past 20 years. I think that as a result of that the bill does deserve some detailed consideration. I notice that this view was supported by the minister, Senator Hill. He said on 26 March:
`
The proposed reform represents a truly historic initiative. In fact, the proposals represent the only comprehensive attempt in the history of our federation to define the environmental responsibilities of the Commonwealth government.
Perhaps those words are a little overblown, but I think this does indicate the significance which at least the government is attaching to this particular bill.
At the heart of the debate lies the argument about the extent to which the Commonwealth should exercise powers over the environment. Some would say that this is not so much an issue about legislation as much as it is an issue about federation and the nature of our constitutional arrangements. The bill would define the role of the Commonwealth with regard to environmental protection and management, affecting the level and extent of participation by the Commonwealth. It is difficult to say, from the information that is provided in the consultation paper, the extent to which the national environmental significance trigger would adequately protect the environment.
The bill ties in with a recent inquiry by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee on Commonwealth environmental powers. The period for public consultation and for input from the public on the consultation paper was very limited. Of course, the government said that that was because, after the bill was introduced, there would be an opportunity for full public consultation.
We have a technical issue here about whether the bill should be referred to a 
 references committee or to a legislation committee. In relation to legislative and general purpose standing committees, let me quote Odgers. I do not often quote Odgers, but Odgers claims that references to legislative and general purpose standing committees should relate to subjects which can be dealt with expeditiously. The bill does not really fall into the category of matters which can be dealt with expeditiously. This has national significance and far-reaching effects. References committees are in a better position to be able to conduct that sort of inquiry. That is the fact of the matter. I think it is more suitable in relation to this legislation for it to go to a references committee. It is important to consult as widely as possible because these are dramatic and far-reaching changes to Commonwealth environmental law.
This has not been a view often expressed by the opposition since we lost government in 1996, but on this occasion the arguments are strong enough for us to support a references committee inquiry as opposed to this matter being dealt with by the legislation committee. It is for that reason, on this occasion, that the opposition sees merit in Senator Allison's amendment, and we will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-08,"—I would indicate to the Senate that I have had a good look at this particular matter and I have listened to what has been said in this debate. One concern that I had was that the legislation committee may not be able to travel to hear what the states have to say or what, for example, the environmental groups have to say in the various states. I am assured by the officers of the Senate that that is not the case and that, in a matter like this, it is quite likely that, after advance notice being given of the reference of this matter to the legislation committee, there is nothing to stop that legislation committee from going around the states and collecting evidence from people within the states. They do not have to come here.
Normally speaking, when we have a legislation committee, they are pretty concertinaed jobs and people have to come to Canberra for that purpose. But, in respect of this matter, I have ascertained that the likelihood, depend 
 ing upon the committee itself of course, would be that the committee would go to the various states to examine witnesses and submitters. I have spoken to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) about that and he has indicated to me that that would be the likely result. If the matter was referred to the legislation committee then not only would that committee not be prevented from taking evidence from around the states on this very important matter but he indicated that that would be done.
—We did that with the Natural Heritage Trust Bill, and we went right around Australia.
—Senator Ian Campbell mentions that that was what occurred with another very important piece of legislation which was somewhat contentious. It is my intention to vote for the legislation to be referred to the legislative committee.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-07-08,"—It is unfortunate that, in her concluding remarks when we were debating the cut-off motion, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Troeth) decided to embark upon a rather derogatory attack on the opposition. On all counts, the parliamentary secretary got it wrong, badly wrong.
Let us have a look at a couple of things the parliamentary secretary said. She said that the opposition's arguments were a fabrication. The parliamentary secretary is saying that the considered arguments put most forcefully by the grower representatives from Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and, indeed, the Grains Council of Australia were a fabrication. Unfortunately, the parliamentary secretary did not have the opportunity to attend the Senate committee hearing. It was so glaringly obvious at the Senate committee hearing that—whilst there is a split within the grower ranks between, effectively, the eastern state organisations and the Western Australian Farmers Federation in terms of process as to whether or not this bill should go through the parliament at this stage—when put to the test, each of the organisations had serious reservations about the future successful operation of this proposed restructuring.
So it is not a fabrication at all. It is not a fabrication, for instance, if you go to the Hansard and find that each of the organisations expressed serious concern about the future of the single desk. We note that, in recent times, since the consideration by the committee—and fortunately this government has come to its senses and accepted the committee's recommendations—the government has had to back up its commitment to a single desk by amending this legislation.
As every senator knows—as I am sure Senator Boswell, who is in the chamber, knows and as senators and members from 
 Western Australia know—there has been consistent concern expressed until as recently as a couple of days ago that, if the legislation stayed as it was introduced into the parliament by the government, grave fears were held for the future of the single desk beyond the year 2004. In fact, the legislation made it almost inevitable that the single desk would disappear.
Given the performance of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in some of its deliberations, the likelihood was that the single desk would go once the competition review took place. That is something that has not just been raised with regard to the wheat industry but has been a major concern in other industries such as sugar.
That is not a fabrication. I would not doubt that there are still grave concerns that, notwithstanding the strong commitments made by both the government and, indeed, us in opposition—which we made when in government and continue to make in opposition—to support the continuation of the single desk for wheat export marketing, there are grave concerns out there in the industry as to what the future holds on that issue.
The parliamentary secretary also suggested that there is unanimous agreement among all the state grain growing organisations to support this package. That is not the case at all. The position is this: the Grains Council—the peak body, if you like—supports the legislation going through, but it still recognises that there are some problems that need to be resolved. It believes that, once the legislation goes through, that will provide an impetus, if you like, to bringing about a resolution of the other issues. It has also made it clear that it was seeking amendments to this legislation from the government before its complete adherence to the package would be forthcoming. The council told us that in the committee's inquiry—and, of course, the government, as it has now circulated amendments, has acted upon that.
So I resent quite strongly the suggestion that the position adopted and the arguments put forward by the opposition were a fabrication. We were reflecting in this chamber, quite accurately, the arguments and the 
 concerns that were put forward to the committee and had been put forward virtually since the first part of this legislation was introduced into the parliament, as I said, late last year.
I will just continue for the moment with where the industry groups stand as of today. There is always the chance that another letter might come through the post tomorrow. It seems to have been the case over the last few weeks that, on the day there appeared to be a chance that the wheat marketing legislation was going to be debated in the Senate, the phones rang, the letters arrived and the lobbying went on. I am sure my colleague Senator O'Brien and, indeed, Senator Woodley agree with me. That sort of activity does not demonstrate unanimous agreement.
Indeed, we had visits and phone calls from the various grain growing organisations almost one after the other over the course of the last couple of weeks. I have to tell you that they were not all coming in to tell me the same story. Each of them had a different attitude, ranging from complete opposition from the Western Australian farmers to urging us to hurry up and pass this legislation from the Grains Council, notwithstanding, as I said, some of the concerns that they had.
In New South Wales and Queensland, grain grower organisations are asking this parliament to pass legislation. They are committed to it. But they are not committed to this legislation—the bill that is currently before this parliament. They have sought amendments to it. For instance, they have sought amendments in regard to the single desk issue that I have already referred to. They have sought amendments from the government and indeed from the other parties with respect to issues such as proxy voting rights. They have sought amendments with respect to ensuring that the wheat board would be exempt from any unintended consequences of the common law review legislation—separate legislation that is to come before the parliament. They are seriously concerned about what impact that might have.
They have concerns about the final format of the memorandum and articles of association. Senator Woodley in his earlier remarks referred to this and acknowledged, quite 
 correctly, that ultimately it is not a matter for the parliament. The parliament is not in a position to draw up the memorandum and articles of association of the companies. That authority ultimately rests with the minister.
Whilst the organisations are supporting the passage of this legislation, they said to the Senate committee, `We are hoping that the memorandum and articles of association, when they finally get to us and when they are finally approved by the minister, will be in a form that we are happy with.' This is why we took the approach, in the debate on the cut-off motion, that those issues could be resolved hopefully over the next few weeks. As I said, those issues are not fabricated at all; they are real issues. There is also the issue of taxation.
At the other end of the spectrum, as I said, we have the Western Australian Farmers Federation. Whilst we acknowledge that they are but one organisation that appears to be more strongly opposed to the whole of the legislation in its current form, particularly the corporate structure, they have tried to develop and promote an alternative proposal based upon a cooperative model. We accept that they have not been successful in that. They felt that with a bit more time they might have been able to persuade other grower organisations in other states and the Grains Council to their position. I have to say that I doubt that. I think the position in terms of the ultimate corporate structure is firmly entrenched.
To suggest, as the parliamentary secretary did, that all states signed up to this is not correct at all. As Senator O'Brien quite rightly pointed out—and it was put in evidence to the Senate committee—Western Australia had never really accepted that position. You only have to go back and read the evidence that we heard in Western Australia last year to understand. They have had a consistent position of not being supportive of the corporate structure as put up by the Grains Council in the other states. Senator O'Brien explained the circumstances in which, apparently, an officer of the Western Australian Farmers Federation indicated acceptance without any authority. The Western Australian Farmers Federation have certainly made it clear since that occurred that 
 they do not support the corporate structure as it is proposed.
So where does that leave us? As I understand it, the government is going to propose certain amendments. I can indicate, in principle, that we certainly will be looking favourably at the amendments that go to the single desk issue. However, we will no doubt debate the amendments in more detail in the committee stage.
As I said in the earlier debate, we would have preferred—and I think it would have been ultimately in the industry's interest and in the parliament's interest—to have not applied the exemption. That would have, in turn, allowed the parties some few more weeks to reach a position. The Senate would then have a clear indication from the industry as to what their total position was. I do not believe that we have that at the moment. Be that as it may, the government with the support of the Democrats have seen fit not to adopt that course, so we now have to deal with the legislation as it is before us.
It should not be taken from the remarks that I have made, many of which have been critical of the government because of the process they have adopted here, that we do not support ultimately the restructuring of the industry. In fact, we started the process. It is the one thing that the parliamentary secretary did get right. We started this process 10 years ago. When we did so at the time, the then minister made it clear that this process of restructuring of the wheat industry—particularly marketing and exports—would have to be grower driven. The change would have to come about, we believed, ultimately, with the consent of and with impetus from the growers so that they were committed to that change.
Whilst there has been a lot of grower organisation involvement in the negotiations over the last year or two, as I said, our concern is that we do not yet have uniformity. The last thing we would want to see would be for legislation to be passed by this parliament and then, in a few months time, we were to find that the industry was still split and the promise of improvements that the restructuring holds was no longer forthcoming.
I cannot help but think of the approach adopted by the government in respect of aged care which Senator Woodley would remember quite well. One of the great problems which the government faced in that regard was that it did not have the industry on side with its proposed reforms. Ultimately, the government was required to back off and to walk away from its proposed radical changes.
On this occasion, part of the industry is supportive and one section of the industry is implacably or strongly opposed. That is not a good recipe for uniformity. But, as I said, because of the decision that has been made by the Senate, we are required to deal with this legislation as best we can. It is our hope that the legislation in its final form—I have no doubt it will be passed, but with amendments—will lead to some agreement in the weeks following the vote which is taken today.
In conclusion, as the Native Title Amendment Bill has been foremost in our minds for a week or two and was raised in the earlier debate, it is interesting to note that, at least in respect of this legislation, there has been a substantial amount of consultation with the key stakeholders—that is, the grains industry and the growers. In contrast, there was no discussion at all with the indigenous people and the recognised body, the National Indigenous Working Group, when we dealt with that legislation yesterday.
I ask senators, particularly those on the government side, to consider this: what do you think would have been the reaction of the grain growers, the pastoralists, the wheat growers, the farmers, the rural lobby, the NFF, if you had tried to pass legislation which radically altered the situation in their industry without even bothering to talk to them?",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-08,"—I think it is worth starting where Senator Forshaw ended. I did say, in my speech in support of the motion to exempt the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill from the cut-off period, a number of things that I had intended to say in my contribution to the second reading debate. I will try not to 
 repeat myself but I may do so, and I ask for the Senate's indulgence if I do that.
Senator Forshaw is right, but I do not think that this government has any monopoly on finding it difficult to find the models which would enable us to consult, to a point where those consultations would lead to ownership of the decisions made. That is a problem at the moment for governments of any complexion. Certainly in Australia that is true—be they state governments, local governments or the federal government.
I underline the fact that until a majority of people are able to own decisions made it undermines the ability of those decisions to have a smooth passage and the support of those who ought to be supporting them. So Senator Forshaw is right. 	The consultation process has not been perfect in regard to this piece of legislation either, but was certainly far more extensive than the process which did not happen in terms of the Wik bill. We have to do better.
I do agree that there has been consultation. I say again: if I thought that another month, two months or six months would produce any different result, certainly the Australian Democrats are always committed to that. I am convinced that at the end of that six months we would still have the same groups disagreeing, and I am not convinced that we would be any further advanced.
At this stage the government needs to make a decision. They need to get on with this model that they have set up. It is not necessarily one that the Democrats think is the best, but it is one that the industry has debated at great length. So I guess it is up to the government to make it work. We will be moving amendments which I think will improve the legislation significantly, and we look for support for those.
I think that the Grains Council and the Western Australian Farmers Federation have got to talk together. It really is not a suitable process that, when those talks break down, politicians in this place in some way become a substitute for negotiations between peak industry bodies. I would like to signal now that, really, this is not on. It is becoming too frequent in this place that, somehow or other, 
 we become the referees in fights between different groups within primary industry.
It is not only governments but also peak bodies which have to find better ways of resolving these issues amongst their members. I do not think that we can be effective referees in these sorts of disputes because we are too far removed from the issues. We are criticised often enough by people for being out of touch, and yet when people do not get the result they want within their own industry bodies, they come to us and want us to resolve it. That is a very difficult task. But having said that, and having repeated what I said in the previous debate, I do believe that we are getting to a point where the legislation is the best legislation we can get.
I really fear the fragmentation of the industry into two camps. There are all sorts of threats flying around. I do not know how real or valid they are, but people are threatening to pull out of the Grains Council, pull out of the Wheat Board, and all the rest of it. It seems to me that it would be a tragedy if that were to happen. I do not know how real the threats are or whether it is possible for people to do that, but that would be a bad outcome. I think the government would certainly agree with that—I think all of us would.
I turn to the amendments. The Democrats' first amendment to the bill negates Treasurer Costello's advice to the government that B class shares in the Australian Wheat Board cannot be treated as active assets. Our amendment ensures that B class shares can be treated as active assets. This whole issue and all its ins and outs have been batted backwards and forwards. I do not pretend that I understand all that the tax department said to us. I do not know whether anyone else does.
—You're not supposed to.
—If you do, then I would be happy to listen to an explanation. But I am convinced that what the Grains Council put to me about the need for this amendment is fair; that it is fair to treat B class shares in the Australian Wheat Board as active assets. That is why we will be moving that amendment. I know about their problem in trying to come to terms with it.
I say to the Labor Party opposition that, if you are listening to the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the Grains Council and the New South Wales Farmers Federation, et cetera, they all want the amendment that I will be moving. We are all being a bit selective in this debate, I think. We take advice when it is the sort of advice we need to hear or want to hear when we perhaps would not take that advice on other occasions. Perhaps, Senator Forshaw and Senator O'Brien, you might reconsider and support the Democrats' amendment, because it does have the support of all the groups. Our amendment on the tax issue is probably, from what I can find out, the only point in this debate on which there is support from all the peak bodies and all the farmers. It is the one point in the debate on which we have unanimous support. I know we have not got the support of the government. I look to the government to perhaps think about it. I am right: this is one point on which all the groups agree with us. We will be moving that amendment.
The Democrats' second amendment ensures that, whenever a quorum of the Wheat Export Authority is convened, three members, one of whom is a Grains Council nominee, shall constitute a quorum. That is a slight amendment, but it is one that we think is important. It is one which has the support of the Grains Council.
The single desk issue is a very significant issue. Again, in debate on this issue it has been kicked from one end of the football field to the other. In consultation with the Grains Council and other bodies I projected an amendment. I then discovered that that amendment had itself become a football in some party rooms. I found that to be interesting.
—It wasn't ours?
—No, it wasn't yours. I am glad that the government has come up with an amendment. I think that it is a sensible amendment; it is one that the Democrats will certainly support. I do not know if it satisfies everybody—my phone does not stop ringing. We keep having this football match over it. But it looks to me as though the 
 government amendment does cover the issues that we are concerned about.
I want to raise another issue. This does not go to the legislation, it simply raises a concern I have, and that is that, where we have corporatisation of public assets, the Democrats are always concerned to ensure that any new structure will not leave the Australian Wheat Board open to predatory takeover. That is certainly a concern which has been raised. I believe that the legislation does protect against that, but it is certainly something that has been raised. In the global grain market this is the experience of many countries. It is the single desk which, I believe, protects Australian wheat growers from this predatory activity.
I have named them here before. One of the big international operators, Cargill, has a reputation for this kind of activity. I might have mentioned before that if you want a good book which analyses its worldwide activity, there is one called Invisible Giant by Brewster Kneen. It is scary to read it—a very careful analysis of the activity of that particular transnational corporation.
Nor do we wish to see a concentration of ownership in the hands of even a few grain growers, even Australian grain growers, and we trust that the support of the industry will ensure that the ownership has a wide coverage. In supporting the passage of the legislation with our amendments, the Democrats do urge the Grains Council and other industry bodies representing farmers to find ways of actively communicating with grassroots members so that those bodies become a point at which members can feel they are being represented—that is a complaint that we often hear—and so that their grower members feel they have ownership of the process as well as the end product. That is a very important issue.
To keep faith with some people who have spoken to us at great length, even though I do not necessarily accept all the arguments, I seek leave to table a letter from Vern Dempster, who is the Western Australian Farmers Federation's grains vice-president. I have not had a chance to copy this; if that is required I can do that and get it around to 
 members. The letter contains his arguments as to why he believes the grower corporate model will not protect growers. I am not necessarily accepting his arguments, but it is useful for the government and all of us to have a document tabled in this debate which sets out those arguments in a very clear way. I seek leave to table that, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Senator Woodley, we will not give leave now, but if you could give that to the other parties, by the end of the next speech you can seek leave and we will then do the tabling.
—Thank you very much. I failed to do that and I accept your rebuke, sir. I will fulfil the requirements. If the other senators feel so inclined, they can give me leave to table that document.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-08,"—The Greens are appalled at the lack of time the Senate has been given to properly consider this bill. It is one of a series of bills that the government has tried to rush through the Senate during the last fortnight. Senator Woodley mentioned the potential, or the threatened potential, for fragmentation, and of course some of that call has come from the Western Australian Farmers Federation. The responsibility for that kind of fragmentation will clearly lie with the minister.
Senator Woodley also is concerned or expresses doubt as to whether or not the extra 33 days will give an opportunity for some of the other models to be considered and for that potentially to be a problem. I ask whether or not the problem is the minister and whether or not he has shut his mind off, or has indicated that he has shut his mind off, to other models? If that is the problem, then it is a political issue we are dealing with in terms of rushing the bill through and trying to protect the minister from having to change his mind. That seems to me to be a concern, because it would be an extraordinary situation if the farmers of Western Australia were busy campaigning against the National Party in the Western Australia electorate.
I would also remind the Senate of situations that have occurred in the past in relation to industry groups like the Western Australian Fruit Growers Association, where they had a quite different view on where their funds should be put from the view of the national body. I am Western Australian. I understand the parochialism, but I also understand the importance of participatory democracy, and that is an important basis upon which the Greens stand. If we have a situation where people are forced into a situation by dint of numbers or by someone stamping their feet, including the minister, then that is not going to work. Industry bodies are not going to work or stick together under those circumstances.
The timetabling of this bill has been absolutely outrageous and it undermines the proper scrutiny of bills in the Senate. It has been mentioned that the minister only issued initial drafting instructions for the bill in early April. The first draft of the legislation was only available on 28 April. The bill was not even introduced to the House until 14 May this year and, of course, was passed by the House only on the first day of the last month.
The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 24 June, and that was just a measly two weeks ago. The process with the committee left a lot to be desired. The committee did not have the time to advertise the inquiry. Interested parties had a whopping three days to write and present written submissions. The written submissions were not even available to the committee members until after the hearings had started on 29 June. The single—one—committee hearing was held on 29 June, a day during a sitting week of the Senate, so it was really difficult for many senators, including me, who were interested, to participate.
The government gave the committee a reporting time to the Senate of just over a day and a half. That is a ridiculously short amount of time to properly consider all the written and oral evidence submitted. Indeed, the Hansard of the oral evidence was not officially available until a few hours before the report was due. How are the committee 
 members supposed to be able to consider even a fraction of the evidence in a rigorous fashion under those conditions? This was a joke of a process—an insult to the concept of proper parliamentary process.
There is a reason that standing order 111 or the cut-off is in place. It is to try to circumvent this exact situation occurring. It is an express recognition by the Senate that this kind of fast-tracking is unacceptable. Indeed, the current government is on record as supporting that standing order, yet they are now pushing—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, we have debated the cut-off motion, and I would ask Senator Margetts to confine her remarks to the actual legislation under consideration.
—On Senator Troeth's point of order,  the first part of my presentation is on the process leading up to this legislation. It is quite in order for me to talk about the lack of process in considering this bill.
—Senator Margetts, I think that is fair, but I just remind you not to reflect on a vote of the Senate.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I was not intending to do that. I believe it is demonstrably clear that this situation provides insufficient time for the Senate to properly assess this bill. As a result—and this is what I am getting to, and perhaps Senator Troeth might listen to why I was leading up to this—I will move a second reading amendment that postpones the consideration of this bill. That is what I have been trying to talk about for the last few minutes, but Senator Troeth might not understand that.
I will be seeking to postpone the committee stage of the bill until the first sitting day in November 1998. It will be the only sensible way to proceed with this bill. Far from reflecting on the Senate, I am asking that we consider what we have not considered properly so far. After the range of arguments presented in the debate on the exemption, I had 
 hoped that that might happen, but I now hope that the amendment is supported.
I want to talk about the government's ideological push behind that. Some senators may have seen Monday's 7.30 Report, which put to Graeme Samuels from the National Competition Council that many people leaving the Queensland election polling booths expressed the view that competition policy was behind a lot of their concerns in the electorate. Graeme Samuels's reply was that that was ridiculous because competition policy had not yet affected rural and regional Australia, which probably just goes to prove how out of touch Graeme Samuels is with his own—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I point out to Senator Margetts that Mr Samuel's proper name is without the `s', and that perhaps she should check her authorities first. For the Hansard  record, it is `Samuel'.
—It is not a point of order, and I am not sure of the person's correct name myself.
—I thank the parliamentary secretary for that very helpful interjection. This bill exemplifies the ideological zealotry of the government and the farce that is their national competition policy. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary will jump up and say, `This is not a bill about national competition policy,' but let me explain a little further so it might become clear. The government announced that a review of the wheat industry under national competition policy will be conducted in 1999-2000. The NCC have criticised this timing and have expressly cited this decision as `an example of failure to schedule an early review of important legislation'.
With the commencement of the review still over a year away—honourable senators will know I am not a great fan of the National Competition Council—the government has clearly laid its expectations for the outcome of the review on the table. Would the government be prepared to admit that the National Competition Council's legislative reviews are such a foregone conclusion that they can, or should, alter legislation before the review 
 even happens? If so, I wonder if the government sees any problems with this kind of process. Is Graeme Samuel saying that national competition policy is not happening because he is not pulling the strings, or is he saying that if state governments or federal governments are using national competition policy as a reason for making major changes in the bush, without reviewing it, then that is not national competition policy?
The emphasis seems to be on deregulation and the disciplines of the market, regardless of the reality of the outcomes on the ground. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims that all mums and dads in Australia will benefit from being shareholders—that is, being involved with the private market and, largely, the private speculative market. He has a vision of a nation of shareholders, and the emphasis of that is on the profit maximising aspect of a corporate structure. There do not seem to be any other values considered important except profit maximisation. A very clear example of that can been seen in the conflict and tension we had between the public interest and the bottom line considerations of the shareholders with the Telstra sale bill—and we know how concerned many people in Australia are about that tension between profit maximisation and public interest.
But here we have the same problem presented again in this bill—the strong conflict between the bottom line emphasis on profit maximisation of the shareholders and the needs of the growers in the industry who would potentially like to have some say in what happens to their own money in their own corporation. This is the same kind of focus we see in competition policy and in the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of GATT—that is, the emphasis on narrow goals at the expense of real evidence and concerns on the ground. The impact is on pursuing a narrow line, the bottom line, without looking at the wider impacts on real people.
This bill is of considerable significance. It will determine the future structure of one of Australia's major export industries with sales worth billions of dollars each year. This bill provides for the establishment of the Wheat 
 Export Authority, WEA, on 1 July 1999, which replaces the Australian Wheat Board and will have the function of controlling the export of wheat from Australia and monitoring nominated country B's performance in relation to the export of wheat. It has already been mentioned how large a player Western Australia is; it is bizarre to suggest that you can cut those growers out and suggest that you are going to have a board or an entity that will function harmoniously.
The bill also provides for B class shares in nominated company A to be issued to Wheat Industry Fund equity holders, and for such shares to be issued at the rate of one B class share for each WIF unit. It also provides nominated company B with the power to export wheat under the Wheat Export Authority until 1 July 2004. The support by the industry and the Australian Wheat Board for this bill was significantly qualified. The time frame that the Senate has to work with does not provide time to adequately attempt to address or reconcile these concerns.
It has been mentioned that Western Australia is the largest wheat export state in Australia. The Western Australian Farmers Federation has 5,550 members. With 5,000 of them growing grain, it is the most representative body in Australia. The Western Australian Farmers Federation has major concerns with many tenets of this bill, especially the huge conflict between the growers' and the shareholders' concerns.
The entire industry, as we have heard, has major concerns about the sunset clause of 1 July 2004 on the single desk export monopoly of wheat. The industry wants this to be deleted from the bill. This issue is seen as of the utmost importance by a range of organisations around Australia, including the New South Wales Farmers Association, which argues that if this issue is not resolved it will not support the passage of this bill. I understand that the government and Democrats may be coming up with an amendment to potentially address this issue. I will assess that during the debate.
On top of the major concerns by the industry, there is a significant number of legal uncertainties associated with the bill. The 
 Grains Council has expressed concern about the possible consequences of the new company law review legislation passed by the Senate this sitting period. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, has expressly stated that he is unsure of the potential impacts of the recent  Company Law Review Bill 1997  that may impact on the use of the AWB of proxy voting. He has stated:
The new Company Law Review Legislation requires very close examination and detailed legal opinion before legislative amendments can be introduced.
Have we seen those opinions? Going back to some of the major concerns expressed by the Western Australian Farmers Federation and many other growers at grassroots level, the grower corporate model as facilitated by this bill has been criticised significantly. There is immense uncertainty as to whether this model will adequately address the concerns of growers and the wheat industry as a whole. The WA Farmers Federation has suggested an alternative grower cooperative model to address its concerns. Its concerns have had no sounding board. There is a strong conflict between maximising returns to pool deliverers and providing a commercial rate of return to financial shareholders. This clear conflict of interest has been recognised and there has been an attempt to address concerns by a number of measures: firstly, the majority of directors elected by growers; secondly, the pooling subsidiary; and, thirdly, the directors' obligations.
Let us look at how these measures are still inadequate. First of all, the majority of directors are elected by growers. Is this in the best interests of the company as a whole? The growers corporate model has seven A-class directors, four B-class directors—this may change to two B-class directors and two appointed for special expertise—plus the CEO. Growers elect seven of the 12. To change this requires a 75 per cent majority of A-class shareholders to vote in favour. The implication is that, because the company is grower controlled, the directors will always act in growers' best interests. However, the articles and Corporations Law clearly state that the obligations of all directors are to 
 promote the best interests of the company as a whole and not to the people who elect them. Thus, the grower elected directors must always act in the best interest of the company as a whole. If they act in a partisan manner, they are acting illegally and are potentially liable to the shareholders. The reality is that the `best interests of the company' is equated to high profits and high share prices. This emphasis, however, will not necessarily result in outcomes that are in the growers' interests.
Let us look at comparisons with similar companies. How do other publicly listed grower controlled companies behave? Wesfarmers is still grower controlled. The cooperative has the governing shares in Wesfarmers Ltd. Only growers can vote for cooperative directors. However, Wesfarmers undoubtedly is totally investor driven. The grower elected directors always make decisions in the shareholders' best interests—at least that is what they appear to do. The consequences of doing otherwise for the company in terms of market capitalisation would be seen as disastrous.
What about GrainCorp, the privatised New South Wales grain handling authority? Growers have the governing share in this company as well as many of the ASX listed shares. Last year, they returned over 140 per cent on their capital. When faced with the best interests of the grain industry or the best interests of the shareholders, it is patently obvious who came first. Without a grain of doubt—sorry about that—AWB Ltd will face the same conflicts of interest. Is it reasonable to expect the grower elected directors of AWB Ltd to act any differently from the grower elected directors in Wesfarmers or GrainCorp? I do not think so. In time, I believe that they will act in exactly the same way and the next generation of wheat growers will pay the price.
In relation to the pooling subsidiary, the theory is that, by separating the function of the pooling into a separate pooling subsidiary, the profit driven parent company is kept at arms length from the grower focused pooling section. However, it is a wholly owned subsidiary. A quorum for a general meeting is only for the parent company to be present. 
 Providing its actions do not conflict with the requirement of its own M and As, it can change the subsidiary M and As at will. For instance, the pooling subsidiary has a requirement to obtain permission in writing from the parent before it is allowed to borrow. It is conceivable that all major functions could have similar requirements if the parent so wanted.
The parent company appoints four of the seven directors. These include the chair of the parent board, the managing director of the parent, one A-class director and one other director. Is it really very likely that these four would go against the parent company directions? I hardly think so. We have to conclude that the pooling subsidiary will only be as independent as it is allowed to be by the parent. In any case, the major services of marketing the wheat as well as underwriting the first advance payment to growers are to be done by the parent. Therefore, the parent company will choose how much profit to include when it sends the bill to the pool subsidiary for services rendered.
What are the directors' obligations? The memorandum and articles of association are supposed to ameliorate the conflict in directors' obligations between shareholders and growers. The memorandum and articles of association contain the following requirements:
The business of the pool subsidiary is managed with the objective of maximising the net return for growers who sell wheat into the pools run by the Pool Subsidiary by securing, developing and maintaining markets for wheat and minimising costs as far as practicable.
And:
. . . the directors may have regard to the desirability of providing B class shareholders with a reasonable rate of return over time and the possibility that further capital may need to be raised but nothing in this clause removes the obligations of the directors to manage the business with an objective of providing services to the Pools Subsidiary efficiently and at competitive prices.
These are clearly motherhood, or parenthood, statements that we can make as little of or as much of as we like. Who is to define what `minimising costs as far as practicable' is? What is `a reasonable rate of return'? These 
 are clearly expressions that are very nebulous and difficult to put your finger on. Basically, it would be possible to justify any position that the directors are likely to take as being within these parameters. Within the context of a publicly listed company whose success is measured by its profit, it is unlikely these obligations will be interpreted by the directors in the same manner as the wheat growers would always like.
The Australian Wheat Board management has share option schemes available under the memorandum and articles. Where is the incentive to act? It is effectively saying to management that, if you adopt as loose as possible an interpretation of these obligations, you will be rewarded by a lot of money in your pockets. Ultimately, the power of the dollar will emerge triumphant. It is patently clear that all the concerns surrounding the passage of this legislation have not been addressed in a satisfactory manner—that is hardly surprising considering the ridiculous fast tracking of this legislation.
The legislation should not have come up this quickly. I will certainly be attempting to ameliorate the legislation in the committee stage, but I do not think it can be fixed properly in the time frame that we have been given. I move:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""further consideration of the bill be postponed and be an order of the day for the first day of sitting in November 1998"".",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-08,"—I seek leave to table a memo from the junior grains vice president, Vernon Dempster. I believe it sets out clearly his objections and the WAFF objections to the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 . I do not necessarily agree with it but I think it is useful to have it tabled as a succinct statement.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-07-08,"—This is the second tranche of legislation relevant to the corporatisation, an effective privatisation, of the export marketing arrangements for Australian wheat. The legislation for the first part of this process was introduced into the Senate last year and 
 was the subject of a legislation committee inquiry in which the committee took evidence in Perth and in Canberra. This led to a debate in this chamber about the passage of that particular bill.
During that debate the opposition's position was that it was more appropriate to deal with both aspects of the legislation together—that is, not to deal with this legislation in two parts, or tranches as it has been described, but to await the full proposal from the government and to deal with that full proposal in one hit. At that time I did raise the question of being pressured to pass the second tranche of legislation were we to pass the first—in other words, to be faced with the proposition that the situation created by the passage of the first part of the legislation and not the second part would be held out to be a worse evil than not passing the legislation at all.
The evidence from the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry of Mr Mortimer, contained in the Hansard of Friday, 26 September 1997 on page 203, was drawn to my attention by Senator Crane and Senator Troeth. I asked Mr Mortimer this question:
If the second tranche of legislation did not pass, would we automatically revert to the situation as it is now, or would we have a hybrid?
Mr Mortimer responded:
We would have a hybrid. We would have a Wheat Board that would still be an exporter with a monopoly and it would still be operating with a government guarantee until 1999. But, instead of operating as a statutory board with trading divisions, it would operate as a statutory board with a holding company to subsidiaries underneath it that would be able to do the job just as well as the Wheat Board does now and possibly, in some regards, better. You will just simply reallocate some of the responsibilities within that broad structure.
That was the passage which was relied upon by the government—by Senator Crane, the chair of the committee—in relation to the opposition's argument at that time that this matter ought to be dealt with in one part rather than in two.
The reason I am raising that is that response—the basis for the government's argument—was contradicted by the depart 
 ment's representative at the Senate inquiry held on Monday of last week. Mr Thompson said that he was not aware of the basis for that statement but was not able to support it—in other words, he was telling the committee that, if we did not pass the second tranche of legislation, we would be in an untenable situation.
That is a matter of concern, because the committee either was misled in September 1997 or it was misled last week. Given the importance of this legislation, I wonder whether the government now has a position on that matter that we will deal with when we deal with this legislation, given that it may have inadvertently misled the Senate, through Senator Troeth, as to the potential consequences of the passage of the first tranche of legislation in the absence of the passage of this piece of legislation.
What has emerged since that time is that the committee was given a proposed timetable for the passage of the two tranches of legislation. On that same page of Hansard, Mr Mortimer said of this second tranche of legislation that it would be drafted, finalised and introduced into the House early next year. He said that in 1997, meaning early in 1998. We now know that it was introduced into the House of Representatives on about 15 May and passed on 1 June, so the timetable was blown out considerably. Whether there were reasons or not, that left this chamber with five days to consider the committee stage of this bill and 12 to 13 days, depending on whether this bill passes today or tomorrow—if it does pass—for the bill to be before this chamber. It was introduced on 26 June and, assuming its passage either today or tomorrow, if that is the will of the government, its passage would take 12 or 13 days. They are concerns which the opposition has about the process, about the way in which we get to the point of dealing with this legislation.
I am concerned also that we appear to be processing this legislation, because of the numbers in this place, on the basis of the view of the Democrats. Be that a good or bad thing, in most circumstances it is certainly not what the government would wish. On the last occasion the Democrats supported the passage 
 of the first tranche of legislation, the justification ultimately was that it was supported by the Queensland grain growers. We have had significant evidence that the bulk of export wheat is produced in Western Australia and New South Wales. It is unfortunate, therefore, if that is the motivation for the Democrats to make their decision—that is, the decision of the Queensland grain growers—that the interests of the predominant growing states are not being properly reflected in the decision.
Whatever position we take in the consideration of this legislation, it is inevitable that we have to hear the views of one or other vested interest in the debate. Whether they be the representatives of grain grower organisations or grain growers themselves, and in many cases the representatives are also grain growers, it is inevitable that questions arise as to which particular vested interest that organisation or that particular individual is representing. It has been suggested on one side of the debate that those who do not support the grower corporate model take that position because they see themselves as disadvantaged, perhaps because they no longer have as significant a Wheat Industry Fund holding as they might have done in the past. It is suggested on the other hand that those growers who have a high level of Wheat Industry Fund holdings now have more of an interest in the grower corporate model than in the cooperative model that has been supported by the West Australian growers.
I am not suggesting that we should be looking for base motives in this matter but rather that we should understand that all growers look at this debate in terms of what they perceive to be their best interests. In the case of organisations, the organisations look at it on the basis of what the best interests of the members of the organisation are. That is the only proper way that we can look at these matters.
But we do have to recognise, as Senator Woodley said, that this has become a fragile process. We have seen in February this year a unanimous position taken by the Grains Council of Australia to support the grower corporate model. Subsequently we have seen 
 the Western Australian Farmers Federation effectively disown their representative's role in that unanimous decision. They pointed out to the legislation committee that inquired into this bill that that person was specifically instructed not to make a commitment without authority from the Western Australian Farmers Federation, which is a stepping back by that organisation from the position taken by its representative in the Grains Council consideration in February. If it is true that grain growers' representatives are proposing to withdraw support from the Grains Council, that would be a rather negative and unfortunate consequence of this proposal.
I understand that there are officers of various organisations, and I do not want to name any, who have been involved in this process for a considerable period of time. I can understand their view that they would rather this matter finished sooner than later; they would rather the matter be resolved so that they can get on with implementing a new model for the industry. If the consequences of that desire to resolve the matter are that we end up with a model which is less than satisfactory or which has the consequence of creating greater disunity than otherwise would have occurred, I would suggest that the haste with which we are proceeding will have consequences which no-one desires and that it ultimately will be to the detriment of the industry in this country.
The opposition's position is that we can hardly be seen to be assisting the unity of the industry if we crunch this bill through, if we pass the legislation in the face of significant opposition by what appears in this case to be a state which represents something like 40 per cent of grain exports in terms of production capacity, on the information that I understand was presented to the committee initially in 1997 through Senator Crane. That is a matter which is of concern to the opposition. We hope that, whatever happens, that is not a consequence. It would be of concern if that did eventuate because we are in the position of crunching through this legislation.
In terms of some of the amendments, in the previous debate I intimated what the opposition's position was on the Democrat 
 amendment on the tax issue—that is, the treatment of the WIF funds as active assets for the purpose of rollover relief. As was presented to the committee by officers of the Australian Taxation Office, when the Australian Wheat Board Ltd is corporatised and its value expressed as shares, the WIF funds will be transferred to that organisation, together with the moneys which have been earned or accumulated to those initial contributions. We have been given to understand that approximately $400 million of WIF contributions are in the pool and that an additional $221 million of earnings have accumulated to those funds. That $621 million will be part of the initial capital of the Australian Wheat Board Ltd.
In addition to that, the value of the Australian Wheat Board—its assets, its goodwill and, potentially, the value of the single desk export monopoly—will be reflected in the value of the shares. What Senator Woodley's amendment is asking of the Senate, and indeed the Australian people, is that the situation continue where the first $400 million of that value, not having been taxed when it was deducted, be paid by growers, as with contributions. The opposition supports that and, as I understand it, the government supports it. That is the advice from the Australian Taxation Office and that is the basis of our support for that position. Senator Woodley's amendment seeks that the $221 million, which are the earnings of the WIF, be treated as active assets even though they have been converted to share value for the purpose of rollover relief under capital gains tax legislation.
The opposition is not prepared to support that. We have taken the view that the WIF contributions being tax free—and recoverable tax free—together with an amount to reflect the depreciated value of those contributions, is a fair result for wheat growers. We would therefore not support the proposition which has been put by the Democrats and which, I understand, has some support within government circles but not the support of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in this case. 
In relation to Senator Margetts's proposal that the committee stage of this bill be deferred until 1 November, we do not think it is necessary to delay the matter until 1 November, although we would have some sympathy with a delay. However, we can see that the numerical position of the Senate, as we understand it, would be to not support that position. We would support some delay because we believe this matter has not been given sufficient time, but we would not be supporting a delay until the beginning of November because we think this matter can be adequately resolved in a shorter period. Were some compromise position to emerge, we would support it.
We do support Senator Margetts's view on the difficulties faced by the grower corporate model in relation to the responsibilities of directors and the accountability that might arise in future. Indeed, we raised this matter in considering the first tranche of this legislation. Our views have not changed. We have received some assurances that there is a contrary legal view; however, we believe that there will potentially be problems in this area.
As to the amendment that is proposed to be moved in the committee stage by Senator Margetts to change the grower corporate model, the opposition's position is that whether it be a grower corporate model or a cooperative model is more a matter for the industry. The opposition would not be keen to impose one model over another. It appears that, whatever the wish of the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the majority of industry support is for the grower corporate model. In those circumstances, whatever sympathy we might have with the Western Australian position, we would not seek to impose that on the majority of the industry. If they cannot win the argument within the industry, they have to raise it on their own behalf in whatever way they can. Ultimately, we will support the views of the majority of the industry.
The matter that remains to be considered is what the opposition would do if, following the committee stage of this bill, a significant sector of the industry were to advise that they no longer supported the bill because the 
 amendments which they wished to be carried were not carried. The opposition reserves its position in relation to that eventuality. We heard, during the committee stage, that the Queensland and New South Wales farmers representatives required certain amendments on tax and indicated they would withdraw their support for the bill if they were not carried. The Grains Council were non-committal on that matter. The opposition is not in a position to make a definitive statement on its position on the third reading of this bill given that we cannot be sure whether, at that stage, this bill will have the support of the industry.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-07-08,"—In rising to speak to the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 , I begin by declaring that I do have an interest in this particular piece of legislation, being a member of a family partnership that both grows wheat and has WIF funds. Having said that, I would like to put a few things on the public record with regard to the process. I get rather intrigued when I hear senators from the other side saying that we have not had enough time, we should have had more time, we should delay it, we should do all these things. This started back in 1989. It started when the then minister for primary industries, John Kerin, introduced legislation to put in place the WIF to fund the domestic trading arm of the Wheat Board with the advent of deregulation on the domestic market.
In 1992 the then minister for primary industries, Mr Simon Crean, took the process one step further—at that particular time it was not very well received by growers—when he announced that the government guarantee would end in 1999 and that the WIF would be expanded to cover and raise the capital base for the new privatised Australian Wheat Board, which was to occur by then. There have been a number of attempts to get to the position where there was a privatised wheat board, the most notable being Newco, which was an abject failure and was totally rejected at the end of the day right across Australia by growers.
I think it is very important when we deal with these issues and the history behind it that 
 we put on the record that this has been a process going on over a long period of time. That said, there is no doubt that the last couple of years have been very difficult. There is a fundamental reason for that which people need to understand: that is—and I put these figures down before, as Senator O'Brien said—almost all the domestic trading is done on the eastern seaboard, and in terms of importing 50 per cent on average since the WIF has been in place has come out of Western Australia. If you add South Australia's contribution to that, which I believe runs at around 18 per cent—I do not have the exact figures before me—almost 70 per cent since the WIF or since 1989 has come from Western Australia and South Australia.
You almost have two forces against one another and you have competing interests in terms of that. In saying that, I am not saying that South Australia have adopted a difficult position or have been quite as concerned about some of the issues that concerned Western Australian growers and their organisations. But I do need to put on the public record that, when you have a divide so stark as that in terms of trying to satisfy two different propositions, it creates a lot of pressures in terms of getting it there.
I turn now to 1996, when this process began. In doing so, it is important to put on the record why there are pressures. The estimation is that, when the WIF winds up and finally gets transferred to shares in 1999, something like $300 million—maybe not quite that much but close to it—will be held by Western Australian growers. The other $350 million from the $650 million will be held by other growers throughout Australia. When you consider that that the $300 million is in the hands of about 8,000 Western Australian growers and the other $350 million is in the hands of 60,000 growers, you understand that there is obviously a lot of pressure. All of a sudden the WIF becomes a very important component of the total picture when you are dealing with growers and their rights in terms of their cash investment—which has been compulsorily acquired since 1989 through legislation passed at that time and then compulsorily transferred into shares in 
 1999, albeit that a small amount has been withdrawn by WIF holders.
There is pressure when 8,000 growers with big investments are holding $300 million as against 60,000 growers holding $350 million or thereabouts. I am rounding the figures off. When we get to 1999 we will know exactly what they are, but that is the ballpark that they are in and that is where it sits in terms of production across Australia. In terms of exports, WA was 50 per cent. In terms of total production during the WIF period, WA has been almost 40 per cent. So there are different pressures, huge pressures.
Two things have been raised with me consistently by growers in Western Australia. First of all, they want the single desk to continue and to continue in the hands of the Wheat Board. The second issue is that, bearing in mind that this fund has been going for 10 years, another 10 years down the track the estimation is that something like 30 to 35 per cent of growers will want their money because they are getting to retirement age and they want to hand the farm on to their children. They have said, `We want to make sure we get full value for our money. We can take our money, get the hell out of the way of our children and let them get on with the business and build our home to retire in or have in our superannuation fund or what have you.' To me, that is a perfectly reasonable proposition.
I listened to Senator Margetts and her contribution on behalf of the Greens, and it made me wonder. They would  gladly close every acre of wheatlands in Western Australia and replant it with flowers. That is their fundamental position. Their fundamental position is also to put tariffs back on farm inputs in this country. That is their position, as it is the position of One Nation. I will deal with that at a later time in a later debate. It makes you wonder when you hear this bleeding heart across the road trying to put to us that she is concerned about Western Australian wheat growers. It is the biggest load of rubbish that I have heard in a long time, and you do hear a lot of rubbish in this place from time to time.
I would like to run through a number of the issues that have been dealt with since 1996. 
 There was no question that at that particular time Western Australia was about as far away as you could get from the model that was presented then. The proposed model was an ordinary share model. The Grains Council at that particular time was also about as far away as you could get from it, or it certainly appeared that way.
Now there has been a change to a dual class model. When it started, A class directors—that is, the grower component—could be elected from anywhere. Today in this process we find that, of the directors, two will be from WA, two from New South Wales, one from Queensland, one from Victoria and one from South Australia. Not so long ago Poolco had no external directors; today it has three. That is a fundamental movement which has been taken in the direction of the Western Australian position.
Let us now look at the Wheat Export Authority. That authority was to have three members: one independent, one grower and one representing the department. In recent months there has been a change. There are now five members: one from the department, the head of the department—that is the best way for me to put it so that I do not get it wrong; two independents, one to be the chair; two growers, one from the west and one from the east. As I understand it, up to the time which followed our hearings the other day, there was to be a quorum of only three. After this legislation goes through, that quorum must now include a grower. That amendment will be moved by Senator Woodley.
Initially the AWB trading arm had unlimited access to finance. As a result of representations not only from Western Australia but principally from Western Australia, that finance will now be capped at $150 million. However, I must say that the Western Australian position is that of preferring it to have remained at $100 million.
Let us look at B class investor-directors, particularly with regard to the corporate model and the composite model. At the hearings the other day, we were told by representatives from the Western Australian Farmers Federation, led by its president, Mr Iffla, that now with the changes that have 
 occurred the further change could be accommodated within the terms of the memorandum and articles of association. That is on the public record. I believe I see Senator O'Brien nodding; he was present at all the hearings.
The Western Australian Farmers Federation wanted no B class directors. We looked at that position, weighed it up and recommended that they be limited to two. Before that number can be increased, there first has to be a recommendation by the board, which will now contain seven and two, to an AGM. That has to be carried by 50 per cent of the A class shareholders apart from being carried by 50 per cent of the B class shareholders, who cast separate votes. So the only way that B class shareholders can increase their directors is by having the growers themselves support that proposition.
This means that we will now end up with a board comprised of seven directors from the A class shareholders. The original proposal involved having a total board of 12. It will now have 10, comprised of seven growers, two investor directors and the executive director. That in itself gives greater grower control.
One point about the cooperative model that came out of these hearings must be made here. As I said, Mr Iffla has assured me that it can be dealt with in the M&As. I want to make a point about grower control and grower ownership. The advisers to the Western Australian farmers at our hearings last Monday, when questioned by me, spelt out quite clearly that there was no protection against outside people coming in and buying the new shares or securities or whatever they are called. As such, the share structures for that model were exactly the same as those for the dual purpose model that is in front of us. Once again, the evidence of the experts is on the public record.
We now see that there will be a loyalty program. That did not exist a short time ago. It means that there will be an incentive scheme for new wheat growers. The government made a commitment last week that it would allow the carrying of proxies under the same conditions after 1999.
I cannot go through all the issues today, but I have looked at a number of them. We now have a model that will service the wheat industry into the future. It will allow it to become one of the great grain traders in the world. It is based very much on the Saskatchewan wheat pool, which is one of the most well-known grain marketing organisations in the world.
I will quickly pick up a couple of other points before I wind up my comments on this legislation. The first one concerns what became known as the sunset clause, which we dealt with in our recommendations in the report. Committee members made recommendations after discussion amongst themselves. In particular, I had lengthy discussions with Senator Woodley and we proposed an amendment, which the government has accepted in this arena.
I had no problem with the original position. It would have been reasonable—I am talking personally now—for the Wheat Board to have known that unless it performed and got the big tick it would have lost the single desk. Nonetheless, we listened to what the various organisations had to say. Their intent became crystal clear just as the position of the various committee members became crystal clear. In addition, we recommended that there be a full-scale inquiry by the Wheat Export Authority and that a report be given to the minister prior to 2004. I think that is incredibly crucial.
One could raise many other additional matters. However, I want to wind up my comments by saying that the wheat industry has been examining this for a long time. I received today a short letter addressed to me from Minister Anderson. I will read it into the record:
Yesterday you raised with my office the concern expressed to you by the Western Australian Farmers' Federation Grains Section president that their Memorandum and Articles of Association for AWB Limited and its subsidiaries could be approved by me without adequate time for consultation through Grains Council of Australia.
You asked whether I would agree not to approve the M&As prior to 30 November 1998.
I assure you there was never any intention on my behalf to rush development of the M&As and 
 therefore I am happy to provide you with the undertaking you have sought.
I would be pleased if you could convey this to the Western Australian Farmers' Federation on my behalf.
Madam Deputy President, I have done that today. I faxed the letter to the President of the Western Australian Farmers Federation, Mr Iffla. His comment to me was, `While we would prefer you to wait until August'—and I will be quite honest about that—`we are now satisfied that we can get up what we require through the M&As by 30 November.' It is worth putting that on the public record. The Western Australian Farmers Federation is not the only grower organisation in WA, although it is the principal grower organisation. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association is in WA as well. The PGA said this in their submission:
The Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill of 1998 should be allowed to pass immediately in its current form. It has been formulated after a two year industry consultation process which has been at great expense to the industry.
I will not read any further, because that submission is there on the record for everybody to see. Even though the PGA has a much smaller membership than the Western Australian Farmers Federation, when its representatives appeared before the committee at our previous hearings back in September of last year they made this point: `We might be small in Western Australia but our members still produce more wheat than the whole of Queensland.' The point I make is that, while they are small in the context of WA, they are a relatively significant producer in the overall Australian grain industry.
I wind up my comments with a commitment regarding the M&As that I passed to the Western Australian Farmers Federation today. I will continue to work with them to try to develop them to a point where it is satisfactory not only to Western Australia but also to all grain growers across Australia. I believe we have a first-class piece of legislation that is based on the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and that is controlled by growers—albeit with some expertise in terms of the investor directors—with the capacity of the growers to decide that they want more directors if re 
 quired. I commend this legislation to the Senate. I think that it has been well and truly belted around Australia with the assessments that have been done.
In my final comments, I wish to recognise the significant contribution that our former colleague Senator John Panizza made in this particular debate going back from not only 1989 but far and beyond that. I guess one of the sad things for me today is that he is not here to see the fruition of something that he sought and pursued at length for such a long time.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-07-08,"—In this speech on the second reading of the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 , I would like to cover the restructuring of marketing arrangements for the export marketing of Australian wheat based on the objectives of grower ownership and controls, self-reliance and a fully commercial approach to marketing. Industry and government, in spite of the comments that have been made, have both agreed that a structure based on these objectives would best meet the needs of industry into the next century. From Senator Margetts's comments, one might have thought that this was indeed a decision made by the different ministers over time. This has not been a decision made by ministers or governments; it has been a decision made by the industry on the model that would suit them best.
 In April 1997, the government agreed to industry's recommendation for the establishment of a grower owned and grower controlled company to assume responsibility for wheat marketing from 1 July 1999, when the government guarantee of the Australian Wheat Board borrowings ends. The new grower company will operate under Corporations Law in accordance with its memorandum and articles of association. It  will have two classes of shares:  A class shares will be issued only to growers and will give control of the company; and B class shares, issued on the basis of wheat industry fund equity, will form the capital base of the company.
As a transitional step towards these arrangements, the government agreed that the Australian Wheat Board establish a wholly owned company to carry out all the commercial activities of the board. The new company, AWB Ltd, with separate subsidiaries to undertake pooling and domestic trading, became operational on 1 June 1998.
In March 1998, industry put to government, and government endorsed, the final details for the new arrangements to commence on 1 July 1999. This bill before the House completes the legislation necessary for the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board. It addresses the following key areas:  the conversion of the wheat industry fund to shares and thereby providing the capital base of the new company structure; provision for managing the continuation of the wheat export monopoly—and I foreshadow the government amendment that I will move in the committee stage to remove the sunset clause on the single desk and to provide for a review of the pooling subsidiary company—and, lastly, other transitional matters to finalise the new arrangements.
 Firstly, the conversion of the wheat industry fund to shares: almost a decade ago, the wheat industry commenced building up funds for a capital base for a future grower owned Australian Wheat Board via a levy on wheat sales. These funds were paid into the wheat industry fund. Under this bill, from 1 July 1999 the wheat industry fund will be returned to growers in the form of B class shares. B class shares will be issued to fund equity holders on the basis of one share for every fund unit and will provide the new company's capital base.
The issue of shares to growers to replace wheat industry fund equity is a significant financial transaction. Growers have been rightly concerned as to the taxation implications. The taxation treatment to apply to the conversion of the wheat industry fund to shares is covered by tax legislation. So that there can be no doubt, I would like to reiterate the taxation arrangements agreed to by government.
As announced in November 1997, shares in the new grower company are to be treated as 
 capital for taxation purposes. Automatic rollover relief from capital gains tax on conversion of the wheat industry fund units to shares means that capital gains tax on the shares will apply only when they are disposed of. For capital gains tax purposes, the cost base of the share is to include levy contributions made by growers prior to 13 May 1997, indexed for inflation. However, levy contributions made after 13 May 1997 will remain immediately income tax deductible and will receive the benefit of capital gains tax indexation until disposal of the asset. On disposal of the asset, the cost base is to be reduced by levy contributions made after 13 May 1997.
In addition, the government has decided that the capital gains tax small business rollover provisions, as announced in the 1996-97 budget, will be available to growers where a wheat industry fund is disposed of and the proceeds applied to the purchase of another small business `active asset'. However, this rollover relief will cease to be available after the wheat industry fund units are converted to shares.
The bill also provides for the retention of the wheat export monopoly from 1 July 1999. The bill provides for an independent statutory authority, to be known as the Wheat Export Authority, to manage the export monopoly on wheat. To give growers the certainty that they have been asking for, the bill also provides that the new grower company pool subsidiary, called `company B', has an automatic right to export wheat for five years. I have already indicated that there will be a government amendment to that.
Requests to export wheat from other than the grower company pool subsidiary, as currently happens, will be managed by the Wheat Export Authority in consultation with the grower company pool subsidiary. The Wheat Export Authority will oversight the pool subsidiary's use of the export monopoly to ensure it is being used in accordance with the intentions of parliament. It will also examine and report on the benefit to growers.
The rest of the speech would, I imagine, be well known to those people who are interested in the subject of the bill. I will just comment on Senator Margetts's second reading amend 
 ment to say that the government will not be accepting that amendment to delay the passage of the legislation until at least November. It is very disappointing, to say the least, that amendments such as this are presented at the last minute. I would be very interested to know whether the Labor Party was consulted, the Democrats were consulted, or indeed the Grains Council of Australia—which is, after all, the peak body representing the wheat industry—was consulted. I believe that none of those people have been consulted. This restructure has been going on solidly for two years with the involvement of industry. Given Senator Margetts's comments about legislation being rushed through with no consultation, it is an indictment on her that she has chosen to present this amendment in that way. Not only do we have the substantial agreement of the industry, but also we have the recommendation of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which recommended that the legislation proceed as a matter of urgency.
There is very good reason to move forward. This is a very important piece of legislation. The consequences of this legislation being delayed would hit hard every one of Australia's 60,000 wheat growers and therefore that amendment must be strongly rejected. I think what is being forgotten very much in this debate and the arguments that have been put forward by the opposition is that this is not an academic treatise on the way to run a primary industry company; this is about real people earning their living from the proceeds of the wheat industry. We should have their interests at heart. That is why we need to proceed with this legislation now. I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-07-08,"—Serious allegations raised in the Sydney Morning Herald  today, and aired in the Senate today, concerning business transactions of the former Labor leader, Mr Keating, whilst Prime Minister need to be answered. It was therefore devastatingly disappointing for the Australian people to learn on the news bulletins this evening that the former Labor leader had no comment to make about these serious allegations. It must also be disappointing for Mr Beazley and other Labor luminaries who sat around Mr Keating's Labor cabinet table.
The allegations that surfaced today are not completely new. Honourable senators would recall that these issues were raised and pursued by former distinguished Senator Michael Baume. He raised them quite properly and quite relentlessly. Given those allegations, one must ask the question: did Mr Beazley ask his then Labor leader whether there was any substance to the allegations? If he did ask the question, it raises the further question: was Mr Beazley the recipient of another Keating lie? Or was Mr Beazley told, and did Mr Beazley do nothing about it, making him, as the then Labor finance minister, potentially complicit in the cover-up?
The further alternative is that Mr Beazley may well have been too weak to ask the question. Mr Beazley has form for being unable to ask himself and Labor the tough questions in the area of policy, so we may need to give Mr Beazley the benefit of the doubt on this. But failure to ask the question would just add further to the mounting perception in the community that Mr Beazley is a weak leader. He will not confront the tough issues. 
The reason that this issue has continually been on the public agenda is that Labor has this reputation of putting trade union officials, such as Mr Keating, into parliament and turning out millionaires—a metamorphosis that cannot have been achieved no matter how far and wide the parliamentary salary was spun. The thread used to spin this financial cocoon to turn this poor trade union official into a multimillionaire during his parliamentary life was not the thread made of parliamentary salaries. The thread clearly has an origin from elsewhere. We now know it hailed from Indonesia. The threads are coming together and are now weaving a tapestry revealing deception and potential abuse of office.
Why does a business figure, especially from overseas, not having had any major dealings in Australia before, seek to relieve a Labor Prime Minister of a $13 million debt and pay not only for the debt but also an extra $6 million for the privilege of so relieving him of that debt? It stretches credulity beyond even Labor's low standards to expect the Australian people to believe that this was an arms-length, above the board deal. It raises, indeed demands, the question: what else was involved in the deal? What was the true consideration that passed between Mr Keating and the foreigner? Labor seems to have this fatal attraction for funny money deals. Remember the Khemlani loan scandal of the 1970s? The big difference in this case is that Mr Keating's funny money deal was solely for his own personal benefit.
If it was all above board, why would the former Labor leader declare only 10 per cent of the gain if there was nothing to hide? It really is a pity the Labor leader could not use his now legendary economic wizardry of turning a $13 million debt into a $6 million profit for the benefit of the Australian people. If making money is that easy, why couldn't he have turned the legacy of Labor's $80 billion federal government debt that he left the Australian people into a $36 billion government surplus? Indeed, One Nation could well be interested in the Labor leader's expertise, because it seems he made money quicker than it could be printed.
These revelations today demand an answer from Labor's dynamo of the 1980s and 1990s. To say, as he was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today, that, `My private business affairs are private to me,' is acceptable if this happened before or after his political life. But it is totally unacceptable to say, `They are my private business affairs and they are private to me,' when they occurred during his occupation of the Lodge.
Issues raised are plentiful. This morning, Mr Alan Jones spoke with one of the investigative journalists. I will read from part of the transcript of that interview. Mr Jones asked:
How does someone with an investment, as I understand Mr Keating's was, of $430,000 return, when it's $13 million in debt, at least $600,000 and the argument that he got some millions over and above that in separate payments?
Answer: 	 It's the question we asked many people throughout our inquiries and I guess I'm still waiting for an answer on them.
That, of course, all happened while Mr Keating was the Labor Prime Minister. Another question asked was:
Do you have evidence that $6 million or a figure of that amount was transferred from Mr Soeryadjaya's company trust to a trust account that had held Mr Keating's and Mr Constantinidis' piggery's interests?
Answer: Yes, yes, we did.
Question: What amount?
Answer: 	 Well, the amount that Mr Soeryadjaya's company initially put in was definitely over $6 million, there's no question about that.
Question: 	 And you have evidence that that was transferred from Mr Soeryadjaya's company trust to a trust account that held the piggery interests of Mr Keating and Mr Constantinidis?
Answer: 	 That's right, that's right, and we have that document and I spoke to, you know, because you can never fully trust documents, but I did speak to people that confirm that over $6 mil 
 lion had gone into the trust account of the piggeries.
Of course, it is now on the public record that Mr Keating's business partner, Mr Constantinidis, and Mr Keating are no longer on speaking terms. Their only communication is now through solicitors' letters.
The issues that I have raised this evening are issues of great moment for Australia. It is the first time that I can recall in Australia's history that such a terrible shadow has been cast over the person who has held the very top office of this country. Therefore, my submission to the Senate tonight is that the allegations posed, the questions raised, need to be answered by the former Labor leader. Further, Mr Beazley, Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray and the others who have so unsuccessfully sought to pursue current ministers need to come clean and tell the Australian people what they know about these sordid dealings. Their failure to respond will speak volumes, especially in the weeks to come.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Paul Keating: Piggery</title>,Adjournment,16,1
