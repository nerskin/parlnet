"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-08-29,"—I rise to continue my speech on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill (No. 2) 2001. We have seen over the past few months in centres such as Woomera, Curtin and Port Hedland the increasing willingness of illegal criminals to hold both other inmates and centre staff to ransom with the increasing use of threats, violence and rioting. Considering that these people are here illegally and by no stretch of the imagination by invitation, it needs to be made abundantly clear that Australia will not be intimidated by this and that it is willing to use all means at its disposal to quell such unsavoury and undesirable uprisings.
In relation to the situation that we have off the Western Australian coast at present, I think we need to put on record very clearly that some of the people who are aboard that ship may have been in safe havens for up to five years accumulating the funds that they needed to pay the people smugglers to get them to Australia. Under those circumstances, I do not believe that anyone can claim that these people are refugees. Some of them may have been duped by the people smugglers and been shown boats tied up at wharves and had it indicated to them that they would be travelling on them only to find themselves walked across the deck one at a time to a rust bucket tied up on the other side and set sail for Australia. So, yes, we do have compassion for these people who have been literally taken for a ride by the illegal people smugglers. We also need to put on record that some of these people have paid between $A16,000 and $A40,000 to be on those boats. We need to look at this in the context of this legislation that is going to provide for the custodians of these illegal criminals when they arrive here in Australia. We have a duty of care to them.
With the problem of the increasing numbers of arrivals and the origins of these illegal migrants arises the tendency of these people to use less acceptable means of persuasion when the circumstances do not suit them. The inmates of these centres have to have explained to them in no uncertain manner that the use of violence and the use of weapons will not be tolerated. This bill goes part of the way at least towards helping to mitigate the problem of hidden weapons that have the potential to be used for self-harm, against others or in a riot situation.
The authorisation by senior officers to issue search orders to be carried out when an officer judges that the circumstances warrant and the process of obtaining this search order are commendable. The need to have all parties involved in the obtaining of this order removed from each other instigates a level of remoteness between the authorisation and issuing of the order that will ensure impartiality. 
The aim of these measures is obviously the care and responsibility for everyone within the centres. The provisions within proposed section 252B, which incorporate dignity and privacy issues and set limits as to what level of search is acceptable by stating the criteria necessary before a search can proceed, give recognition to Australian standards of human decency and will allay any concerns about impinging of basic human rights. Proposed section 252B of the bill recognises the differences between searching adults and searching minors between the ages of 10 and 18. This proposed section ensures that the age of these young people is taken into consideration and puts in place provisions relating to this. The sensitivity of this search scenario also stipulates that the officer be of the same sex, thus helping to alleviate any unnecessary embarrassment that may arise.
There is, however, one section that appears to be overlooked within the bill, and that is the potential for desperate people to manipulate the system and use children under the age of 10 as a means to hide weapons. I have no doubt that this is an avenue that will be exploited and I would suggest to the government that it may have a future problem there. This bill will enhance the abilities of staff at detention centres to hopefully be able to limit the opportunities for people to endanger all within a centre. This bill will assist in curbing unacceptable behaviour within these centres, and this is obviously of necessity.
The bill enhances the ability of detention centre management to discourage undesirable actions by detainees to hide weapons for future use and at the same time incorporates the principles of respect for human dignity and safety for all involved. The bill also incorporates guidelines for auditing the actions that will be taken, so limiting the opportunities for abuse. The bill requires that, when a search is instigated and carried out, the Senate receive a report on the number of times this has been implemented. I strongly support the government on its stand with this bill and on the direction it now appears to be taking over the highly contentious issue of illegal migrants.
In conclusion, I would like to quote Exodus 23:3, which says, `Do not follow the majority when they do wrong or when they give testimony that perverts justice.' I think we need to take that into account in our deliberations in relation to this bill. And Leviticus 19:15 says, `Be honest and just when you make decisions in legal cases. Do not show favouritism to the poor nor fear the rich.' I think this is part of the problem that we are facing in this highly emotive situation with these boat people. We do not need to look at them as being rich or poor; we need to very clearly assess where they are and what they have done to actually get to that point. It is only then, when we look at those instances and we remove the emotions and look at the reality of the situation, that we will find an answer to this perplexing question.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-29,"—Years ago when I was a schoolboy we had a sports master—it is so long ago that I can mention his name—called Steve Hart who used to train us. He used to make general invitations for people to come down and see him at his house. If you were the centre half-forward in the football team or indeed in any position on the goal-to-goal line, he would make you welcome. But there was one boy that I was at school with called Philip Ryan—I can mention his name now, because it is so long ago—who turned up in response to the invitation and got very bad treatment indeed. What he did not know was that, although there was this general invitation to come to his house, Steve was not really sincere about that—except for a limited number of people. So, although he wanted to get high kudos for being a generous-hearted sports master who invited all of these people down to his place to enjoy his hospitality, he did not want the result of that kudos, which was that he would have to get everyone that he invited and not just some. 
Unfortunately our immigration policy has become like that, because we have made a general proclamation in section 36 of the Migration Act 1958 which says:
(1) There is a class of visas to be known as protection visas.
(2) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is a non-citizen in Australia to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.
Let us go to those instruments. The first is the convention relating to the status of refugees of 28 July 1951, and that is affected by the protocol relating to the status of refugees of 31 January 1967. According to those protocols, there is a definition of what a `refugee' is. It is a definition that is often put forward in this chamber and in the community as a whole. Australia says—and I think Australia ought to be given great credit for this—`We will take people who are refugees who claim that status on the shores. If they do that, we will accede to it, because we are good international citizens and we have signed the convention and the protocol.'
There are other provisions in these two instruments I want to refer to which say that these instruments can be denounced. Article 44 of the 1951 Geneva convention relating to the status of refugees says:
(1) Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The same is said in the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees. Article 9 of the protocol says:
Any State party hereto may denounce this Protocol at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of United Nations.
What we really want to do is denounce these two instruments, but because we want to be seen as a good international citizen—because Australia is a place of compassion—we will not denounce them. So we have legal obligations under our domestic law—the Migration Act and in particular section 36 of that act which incorporates these instruments—which require us to give succour to refugees who come to our shores and claim that status. We very reasonably want to take that position, but we also want to take up a position where not too many people come: we want only the centre half-forwards and the goal-to-goal line; we do not want the others who do not quite make the team and are not people that we really like. So, even though our invitation extends to that group, we do not really want them. 
So we say, `Look, how can we keep the law as it is but, nevertheless, not accept the consequences of what that law says?' What we do is build detention centres to keep people in and we say—this was particularly true earlier on and it is still true to a great extent—that we want them there so that we can process these people to see whether they are genuine refugees. This is a very proper process. If somebody is not a genuine refugee but uses the cloak of being a refugee to come here, that person ought to be condemned and dealt with appropriately, because the status of `refugee' is a very serious matter. We give protection to refugees so they are not shot, persecuted or otherwise disadvantaged and, if somebody wants to use that status as a disguise for something else, we should have no sympathy for them. But if they are refugees then we have to apply the law. We are concerned about that, so we take people into detention and we see whether or not they are genuine refugees and whether they have diseases which might be communicable to the population. 
Those are legitimate reasons, I suggest, for having people in detention, but it is not legitimate to have people in detention to punish them for coming and claiming protection under our law as set out in the Migration Act incorporating these conventions. That is not a legitimate exercise, because we are then using detention not as a means of keeping people in a confined space while we work out what should happen to them but as a means of punishing them to stop them from using the provisions of our law. If people are refugees, then we ought to apply our law to them as it is written and not punish them for coming here to discourage them from making a claim according to the provisions we set out. We cannot, in other words, set up a scheme and then discourage people from using it. It is better to get out and denounce the treaty and say, `Righto, that's the end of it, our hospitality is exhausted and that's that.' Unfortunately, that has to be given consideration because what is occurring here contains real corrupting and corroding elements to our civil society. 
We have already curtailed the cover of our courts because of our immigration system and there is the suggestion that the courts be curtailed even more because of this system. The courts are being brought into disrepute by careless and florid criticisms of them for simply doing their work. The situation is becoming serious. Unless we preserve the court system and preserve the integrity and reputation of the judges we will be in trouble. The judges deserve their reputation—we have a magnificent legal system—and yet those judges are brought under attack simply to obtain an end that we have not got the political courage to face. What do I mean by that? Because judges apply the law and because we do not like the way that they apply the law, we criticise them even more—we do not change the law—and we take away the judicial oversight that there should be in any decent society.
It is not only in this area that we tend to criticise the victims; it is also in the area of social security that we tend to blame the person who is the victim, the person who is receiving the pension. We tend to prosecute them. So it is not just in the area of immigration that this happens but in other areas as well. I think it is a dangerous tendency that is occurring in the community and one which, as legislators, we ought to be moving to reverse. Because we lock people up and detain them, we get a reaction from them that anybody who is locked up might have. We keep having to pass laws that become more and more draconian and that create more and more offences. People who have not committed offences in the first place are put in the situation where an offence is created. This piece of legislation is necessary because we keep people in custody, but it creates further offences that were not there before. This is another indication of how, in chasing a result that we want but that is not in keeping with our high reputation and is not supported by our legislation or by our adherence to the convention, we arrive at a different outcome from what that legislation should give us. And we now pass laws which have become necessary because we keep people locked up.
It is said that these people who come by boat and who land on our shores are queuejumpers. I have never quite understood that, given the provisions of section 36 of the Migration Act, given the provisions of the convention and given the provisions of the protocol. It is not the people who come here by boat who write these laws it is us. It is the Australian people who, through their government, have taken this on. How can you be a queuejumper for obeying the law? How can you be a queuejumper if you are a refugee and you have come here to claim refugee status? People who talk about queuejumpers have the concept that somebody in Afghanistan has to get permission from the Taliban before they can make an application. That is an extraordinary proposition, if you ask me. 
If we are going to have the scheme that is in place, we have to accept the consequences of that scheme. Do we want to adhere to the conventions? Do we want to adhere to section 36 of the Migration Act? If we do, then we should not punish people who want to use that law, but that is what we are doing. We call them `queuejumpers', we call them `economic refugees'—and all this without really looking at each individual case. People are on the high seas and we say, `They could be this. They could be that.' We make little suggestions here and there. We degrade their reputation. We take away from their humanity. They are not people any more. They become queuejumpers and illegal immigrants. This includes children who, I would have thought, did not have much say about the matter. 
We are now in a situation of deciding whether we are going to follow our own laws, whether we are going to adhere to the conventions to which we have signed up. That is the sort of issue we have before us. The problem is this: if we are going to have the laws we do, if we are going to have section 36, if we are going to have an adherence to the convention and the protocol, we have to see that we carry out the consequences of those laws in a proper, decent and civil way. If we are not, I suggest we look at the whole program again. I have great sympathy for refugees. How you feel about something is a matter of choice. If you do not have great sympathy for refugees, so be it. You do not always have to act in a moral way. There is no legal compulsion to do that. If you are like me, and have great sympathy for refugees, you are likely to get to the point where you say, `If we have laws in reference to them, why don't we carry them out?'  
This legislation seems not to be a significant piece of legislation on its own. It says that in prisons you should be able to strip search people. That is a reasonable proposition. But when you start asking why it is that these people are in prison and why it is that it has come to this, you become more concerned about what is going on. I would like a civil society which is run according to the law. The law is made by this parliament. International conventions are brought into operation by domestic legislation. The Geneva convention and the protocol to that convention have been brought into domestic law by this parliament. That is something we have created. In my view, we cannot then criticise people who use our law, who come here on the basis that we have a particular set of laws. We cannot, decently in any event, have a legal system, a rule of law, and then not only criticise people for using it but punish people for using it. I think that is an absurd and an unfair position to reach. 
We hear a lot of criticism of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. It is parliament's laws that they have to carry out. It is our laws that the department have to operate. They have to do two things: first, they have to run a refugee program according to the act; secondly, they have to keep people locked up until they are determined to be a refugee, and that is an impossible decision.
I will just close on this. Refugees are not made by decisions; refugees are made by situations. We do have refugees locked up. It is an absurd proposition to put that a refugee does not become a refugee until somebody declares him or her to be a refugee. A refugee is made by the situation in which people are placed in their own country. The last thing I want to say is that it is an absurd proposition to say that people do not become a refugee until they are told that they are.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-29,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill (No. 2) 2001, which, as other speakers have said, relates to increasing the powers for guards in detention centres. It raises some very important issues in terms of basic human rights and also in terms of the powers that should be provided to people who are managing, running and operating detention centres. There is also the broader issue, which is unavoidably linked to the issue dealt with in this bill, and that is Australia's mandatory detention regime. 
There is some argument to be made that it is important to have adequate powers to ensure the safety of not just staff but detainees themselves. The Democrats are sympathetic to that argument. But we need to look at the context in which these extra powers are being introduced, and that is a context where there is enormous, widespread, wide ranging criticism about how our detention centres are run at the moment as well as criticism of the absurdity of our policy of mandatory detention. 
Any decision relating to increasing powers of guards in detention centres has to be put in that context. The Labor Party themselves, along with the Democrats and many others in the community, have considered that the situation in our detention centres is sufficiently concerning that we should be having an independent judicial inquiry. Malcolm Fraser, amongst others, has called for such an inquiry. The range of concerns are so significant, the number of unanswered questions is so great, and the allegations from detainees and from staff and others about what actually happens in detention centres are so significant that many, including the Labor Party, believe we should be having an independent judicial inquiry.
In such a context, when there are already so many question marks hanging over how things operate at the moment, it seems absurd, from the Democrats' perspective, to be supporting legislation that increases the powers for guards in detention centres. Surely we need to clear up and clarify the existing situation before we give further powers to people who are running detention centres. There are sufficient concerns about how they are utilising the powers that they have at the moment. 
In that context, the Democrats believe it is completely inappropriate to support legislation that increases these powers to conduct strip searches on immigration detainees, including to children as young as 10, as well as powers to conduct screening procedures and apply search powers in state and territory legislation to immigration detainees held in state or territory prisons or remand centres. Again, I think that last extra power highlights that any suggestion that our detention centres are now not equivalents of jails is just subterfuge. We are even equating the powers of the guards in detention centres with those in state or territory prisons or remand centres in relation to search powers.
It is important to note the criticisms of our approach on detention. We have thousands of people now in immigration detention centres around Australia in situations that are generating incredible pressure. This bill is in some ways being portrayed as a response to the rising tensions in our detention centres. Yet it is just one more step in a whole range of measures over the last few years by this government to crack down more and more on asylum seekers and on people who, as Senator Cooney quite rightly just pointed out, are indeed refugees. We now have many refugees imprisoned in Australia, some for quite long periods of time. 
When you generate such an enormous pressure cooker situation, when you put people in a pressure cooker environment and turn up the heat, it is not surprising that you get upheavals and disturbances. To suggest that you respond to such a situation by turning the heat up even further is an absurdity. It highlights the insistence of this government in refusing to acknowledge the failures of their mandatory detention policy and basically going further and further down the wrong path. It is a path that is leading to immense suffering and trauma for many people, including refugees, as has been documented in a number of media reports in recent times—indeed, stretching back quite a while now. 
It is also increasing antagonism out in the Australian community through the continued demonisation of these refugees and asylum seekers. And it is, of course, costing the taxpayer millions and millions of dollars—hundreds of millions of dollars—unnecessarily. That is being used as a way of again increasing resentment towards asylum seekers and refugees when this level of expenditure is a direct result of the government's insistence on having this unprecedented level of mandatory non-reviewable detention, a regime that is unparalleled elsewhere in the world and that has come under heavy criticism from UN agencies and human rights groups in Australia and internationally. It is important to emphasise that. The government from time to time point to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as somehow supporting their approach in relation to asylum seekers, yet there have been any number of criticisms made about our mandatory detention regime. 
We must recognise that the problem of asylum seekers, the problem of displaced people—which we are seeing in graphic detail at the moment with the situation off Christmas Island—is an international problem. It is not specific to Australia. We are not getting bigger waves of people than anywhere else; indeed, in proportion to many other countries, our numbers are relatively small. To suggest that somehow Australia needs to be more and more hardline and more and more tough to ensure that we are not seen as some sort of soft touch ignores the reality of the situation. People are not coming here because we are an easier touch than everybody else. They are going everywhere else as well, and whilst there are varying degrees and varying approaches in different countries about how to deal with these issues, nowhere else has some of the approaches that Australia does in terms of its harshness, particularly in relation to our detention centre regime and our system of mandatory detention.  
Again, I think that is the context in which this bill needs to be recognised, because it is an extreme response, an inhumane response and one that, in the Democrats' view, will almost inevitably lead to the sort of distress and disturbance that is presenting itself in our detention centres from time to time. I do not know if senators recall a movie called Ghosts of the Civil Dead, which highlighted a private prison establishment in the US and the inevitability of extreme upheavals when pressure-cooker tactics are applied to people in a prison-like environment. It was a maximum security jail that was portrayed in that film and I am not suggesting that this is an exact equivalent, but the fact is that denying people freedom, imprisoning them, having prison-like environments, does provide the same opportunity and the same almost inevitability, particularly when you add on to that the trauma that many of the people in the detention centres have already been through, the trauma they are experiencing in there, their isolation and their disconnection from family and often from other people. 
There is certainly a lack of certainty about what is actually going on and about what the future holds for them—in some ways, much more uncertainty than for people who are in prison. These people in our detention centres have not been convicted of any crime, have not even been charged with any crime and yet they have an incredibly stressful concern for their future and uncertainty about their future. At least people who are in prison are sentenced to a term. They know how long they are going to be there and when they are likely to be able to get out. They have some idea of what their future holds. People in detention centres often do not. It is important not to underestimate the sort of distress that that can generate in people. 
You do not respond to these sorts of scenarios by turning the heat up further. It is about time we looked at how other countries approach the issue of unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers, particularly some of the models in Europe. Sweden is one particularly good example. People there are allowed out into the community after initial assessment. Obviously, you have to assess security and health concerns, but then you have people out in the community in a monitored sense and you provide them with ongoing assistance and information about what is actually going on, what their rights are and what their future might hold. That system, I believe, has proven to be quite successful, not just in terms of people who are judged to be refugees but also those whose applications are refused and are then deported. 
We need to look at some of those approaches that are far more humane, that reduce the heat much more, that cost less for the taxpayer and also generate less resentment from the community. We need to accept the reality that a significant proportion of people that we are currently locking up in detention centres will end up being released into the Australian community as members of the Australian community. We do not want them ending up in the community in a circumstance where they are seen with great hostility by the community that they are now part of and the society that they are now part of. 
To that extent I would like to commend the West Australian on an article it published yesterday, I think, by Steve Butler, which highlighted in a more personal sense the reality of the experience of some Afghan refugees and the constructive contribution they are now making to the economy and the community in the north of Western Australia, providing a useful labour force at the end of the pruning season in a vineyard there. I think when we have more opportunities to look at this from a human angle, rather than from some sort of blanket condemnatory, demonisation approach, then we will avoid some of the unfortunate levels of antagonism that are appearing in the community. Again, it is a worldwide problem, a worldwide issue, and it will not be solved and it has not been solved by simply cracking down harder and harder. That again is the context in which we need to look at this piece of legislation. 
When the approach of mandatory detention is clearly not working, then you do not address the failure by cracking down further and further. I think it is appropriate to draw attention to the comments of Mr Chris Sidoti who is a former Human Rights Commissioner. When he was Human Rights Commissioner, he conducted a number of very critical examinations into specific incidences in our detention centres. He is renowned for his work in human rights and is assisting the federal government at the moment in human rights work with people from Burma, in a contentious but interesting exercise. He has shown by his involvement in that that he is willing to work with the government where he thinks a positive outcome can be made, despite some of the dangers involved in that work. But he has been unequivocal in his commentary on and condemnation of our policy of mandatory detention. He has called it `bloody-minded, unnecessary and a costly failure that violated human rights,' and I think that sums it up very succinctly.  
So if we have a policy of mandatory detention—which unfortunately is still supported by both Labor and the coalition—that is clearly a costly failure, that is unnecessary, that is bloody-minded, that does violate human rights, then let us recognise that. Let us change our approach and go down a different pathway. These policies deliberately put in place by the government, with the support of the ALP, are costing taxpayers millions of dollars and are not working. We are in breach of our human rights commitments by adopting and pursuing this policy of mandatory detention, and I do not think any amount of legal sophistry can overcome that reality. As Mr Sidoti said:
In most cases it's ... unnecessary. There will always be some who need to be detained for reasons of public security or public health, but we don't have any opportunity for case-by-case assessment.
We just lock everybody up—unequivocally and without review—indefinitely. Apart from the human rights concerns with that policy, it is simply not working. The government has said, time and time again, `We are doing this because we are showing that we are not a soft touch. We are doing this because we are sending a message.' This is the same way that the government are keeping more than 400 men, women and children in limbo, floating around off Christmas Island, in deteriorating conditions, because of some international stand-off. The government has said, `We are doing that because we want to send a message.' Refugees and asylum seekers should not be pawns in the efforts of governments around the world to send messages to each other about who is the toughest.
The message that we are supposedly sending through our mandatory detention regime is clearly not working, because people are arriving despite it and, as the government likes to portray, the numbers are increasing—although the numbers are still not equivalent in proportion or in totality to those with which many other countries are having to deal. Even by the government's own criteria, this policy is not working. This is demonstrated when you add their insistence on mandatory, non-reviewable detention to some of their other ongoing efforts such as an extraterritorial interception agreement between Australia, Indonesia and the UNHCR, which sees people en route to Australia detained and processed but does not offer the same procedural safeguards as we see in Australia. 
They have made efforts to limit access to the courts, which would make it the only area of administrative law with such limitations, despite the fact that it is the only area of law where an incorrect decision can cost people's lives. I do not think we should forget that basic fact. They have made unilateral efforts to limit obligations under the refugee convention, and more legislation was introduced just yesterday in relation to that. They have refused to cooperate with the UN human rights monitoring bodies, and they have made a range of changes to visa conditions for refugees, which are deliberately aimed at making their lives as unpleasant as possible.
All of these harsh actions are part of trying to send the message that we are not a soft touch. We are not a soft touch, and we are clearly a harder touch than plenty of other countries. But people are still arriving here, and that is because of what they are fleeing. That is the reality, and that is what I think we need to continue to remind ourselves of. The Democrats oppose the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill (No. 2) 2001. We believe that, in a context where we have so many question marks over how our detention centres are operating presently, it would be inappropriate to further expand the powers of guards in detention centres. Indeed, there is currently, as I am sure the government is aware, a matter before the Federal Court in New South Wales regarding allegations of assaults at one of our detention centres. There are ongoing concerns about the circumstances surrounding that incident and, indeed, the ability to adequately and properly ensure scrutiny of those allegations through the legal processes.  
I will ask the minister a couple of questions about that circumstance in the committee stage because it relates to the legislation in terms of how things are happening in our detention centres at the moment, the sorts of safeguards in place for people when they make allegations of misconduct and the sorts of mechanisms in place for ensuring that adequate cooperation is in place. Surely, if we are expanding the powers for people in detention centres to areas such as strip searching, we are expanding the potential for people to raise complaints about those powers being improperly exercised. We have to make sure that adequate processes and safeguards are in place when complaints are made—particularly in circumstances such as the case in Sydney—and when actual court proceedings are undertaken in relation to allegations of assault or other inappropriate conduct. Without wanting to hold up the legislation indefinitely, I will ask a couple of questions of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in the committee stage of the legislation.
It is an important issue. It is one where, I think, political leadership is needed to recognise the reality of the situation and to try to find a response that will not just link into and play on short-term political opportunities, but will actually explore mechanisms and options for finding positive solutions to a difficult issue. There is no magic solution that will stop people arriving, whether in Australia or in other parts of the world. We need to work with the reality of the situation rather than keep our head in the sand and just make life harder and harder for people, many of whom have already suffered enormously.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-08-29,"—I am filling in for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Patterson, who has had to attend an Executive Council meeting. She will be taking the committee stage of the debate. Having listened to Senator Cooney this morning, to Senator Bartlett just then and having been given some notes on the contributions of other speakers, I want to say a few words in concluding the second reading debate on this bill.
Nobody disputes that state-sourced persecution is horrific, that it is extensive around the world and that civilised societies should seek to do what they can to assist those who are persecuted. They do that in a number of different ways, in particular, by seeking to use the international mechanisms available to deter the states that engage in such practices from continuing to do so—in some instances with some success and in some instances without success. In addition, we are part of an international response to the refugee issue—to those who are seeking to escape that persecution—in terms of the international convention. Australia, under successive governments, has accepted its responsibilities under the convention because we believe that doing so is part of a humanitarian international response to this particular issue.
Australia has been generous in its response to the issue of refugees over the years. As you know, Madam Deputy President, we have a policy of setting a number of places that we believe Australian society can absorb on an annual basis under our humanitarian program, which includes refugees and some other categories of people who are in humanitarian need. We have been taking about 12,000 a year in an orderly way under that program since this government has been in office. If there is an undershoot for some reason in one year, this government has been prepared to make up that undershoot the following year. So this year, for example, it is believed that the intake under our humanitarian program will be about 13,500.  
The first issue is that we accept that it is important that Australia be part of a civilised international response to these humanitarian tragedies. However, in relation to those who arrive on our shores unlawfully, we also have a sovereign responsibility to the Australian people to protect our borders. We do not believe in open borders in Australia. It is not open to anyone to enter Australia and take up residence. That has been the view of successive governments as well. Listening to Senator Bartlett on behalf of the Australian Democrats, my interpretation of what he was saying is that the Democrats would support an open border—that basically anybody who arrives in Australia is entitled to stay. That is certainly not the position of the Australian government. 
If people arrive in Australia unlawfully, then we believe we have a responsibility to Australian citizens to deal with these unlawful arrivals as unlawful non-citizens under the Migration Act. When the Labor Party was in government and it was faced with increasing numbers of unlawful arrivals, the Labor Party believed there was no real alternative but that they should be detained whilst they were processed. Unlawful arrivals were occurring and basically disappearing into the Australian community. To allow that to occur was a failure of government to meet its responsibility to Australian citizens, so the law was changed. 
The law was changed in 1992 and remains that, if somebody arrives unlawfully, they are detained. Senator Bartlett was suggesting that they are detained indefinitely. That is not the law. They are detained until their status is determined. If they are found to be illegal, they are deported. If they are found to be entitled to a form of visa, which may be refugee status, if they are found to be a refugee in terms of the international convention that we are a party to, then they are released into the Australian community. But on the occasions when there are a large number of unlawful arrivals there can develop something of a backlog, and the processing is not always easy. We do not know the background of these people who are arriving. In some cases they have been demonstrated to have criminal backgrounds. It is difficult to source information. We do have a responsibility to Australian citizens to ensure that those who are released into the Australian community are genuinely refugees in terms of the convention. That is this government's policy. It has been the policy of previous governments and we are going to maintain it. 
I thought it was the position of the current Labor Party but, listening to Senator Cooney, I am not too sure because he was expressing the process of detention as being a punishment. In other words, he seemed to be saying that at least his part of the Labor Party—it is the same old Labor Party sending up multiple messages, I suspect—are indicating that these people are being held in detention because of some desire of the Australian government that they be punished. We have no wish to punish these people. Our responsibility is to determine, when they arrive unlawfully, what their status is and whether they are entitled to be released into the Australian community. That is the position we intend to maintain. We intend to maintain an orderly humanitarian program. We intend to accept our reasonable share of this international responsibility. 
This legislation is not really about whether or not there should be within Australian domestic law an obligation to detain. This legislation is about processes that are needed to ensure safety and security within the establishments in which these people are being detained. What we have seen is that, without an increase of powers in relation to searches and the like, people—whether they are detainees or whether they are staff—are being put in an unsafe position. That is intolerable. We have a responsibility to act in the circumstances that have become apparent. We therefore bring this legislation to the parliament today to introduce a power to strip search immigration detainees. Nobody wants to do that. But if, for the security of those who are within the establishments—whether they are detainees or whether they are staff or whether they are visitors—it becomes a necessity to strip search detainees, the government should have the power to do so. The bill also introduces a power to conduct a screening procedure in relation to a detainee. It also applies search powers in state and territory legislation to immigration detainees held in a state or territory prison or remand centre. 
So this legislation is an example of this government acting to protect Australia's long established immigration laws, this government maintaining the law as it stands to detain an unlawful arrival and this government acting to ensure that those who do arrive unlawfully are kept in a humane environment in which their personal safety is protected. That is this government respecting those individuals, whether they have arrived unlawfully or not. On that basis I would urge the Senate to support this legislation to enable the government to continue to manage this difficult problem in both a humane and an orderly way.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-29,"—by leave—I move Labor amendments Nos 1 and 2 as circulated on sheet 2349:
(1)	Schedule 2, item 55, page 61 (line 29), omit “5%”, substitute “1%”.
(2)	Schedule 2, item 55, page 61 (after line 30), at the end of the item, add:
	(6)	An employee may make an application for further amounts of compensation under subsection (5) only if Comcare has made a final assessment of the degree of permanent impairment of an employee constituted by a hearing loss at least 3 years before the further application is made.
As senators will recall, on the last occasion we were dealing with No. 5 of the opposition's amendments, and we deferred further consideration there. Following the discussion that occurred in the committee stage on that last occasion, we have responded to the government's criticism of our position at that stage, where we were proposing to delete a provision that would require an additional five per cent hearing loss in order to claim for hearing loss after an initial application has been made. The intent of that amendment was that it would allow a further claim for hearing loss to be made at any time. Subject to the criticism that Senator Campbell made on that occasion, we undertook a review of similar provisions in other state jurisdictions, and the two amendments that I have just moved reflect reform that occurred in Queensland under the Beattie government in 1999. Further to the debate on this issue on the last occasion, the useful things that I think these amendments deal with are a couple of criticisms. 
I understand that one of the government's criticisms was that administrative problems arise if you allow claims to occur at a one per cent level in an uncontrolled manner. This is why we have moved amendment (2) here, which indicates:
An employee may make an application for further amounts of compensation under subsection (5) only if Comcare has made a final assessment of the degree of permanent impairment of an employee constituted by hearing loss at least 3 years before the further application is made.
It is our view that that three-year break which applies in Queensland, will deal with any significant administrative problems that might arise from people making claim after claim in this area.
The other significant concern raised by the government relates to the measurement of one per cent of hearing loss. It is claimed that it is hard to indicate whether the loss is one per cent or two per cent and that the differences can be somewhat blurred. What we are seeking to do with these amendments is to ensure that a worker who ends up with an additional four per cent hearing loss, for instance, is not permanently disadvantaged. If we accept the government provisions here, under the five per cent proposal you could have a worker whose hearing loss does not deteriorate any further than an additional four per cent but who is in a position where they can never make an additional claim. You can say one per cent is difficult to measure, but we do not believe that four per cent or three per cent is and we do not believe that workers should be permanently disadvantaged on the basis of that. We have not just plucked these proposals out of the air; we have looked at where recent reform has occurred in relation to hearing loss in this area, and that is in Queensland. Senator Murray might appreciate my drawing to his attention the last occasion that the Senate relied on Mr Beattie's reforms, when the Democrats supported the government proposal of a three-month probation period, which Mr Beattie had introduced in Queensland. I hope the Democrats will support us on this occasion, also relying on the Beattie government's approach.",SENATE,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-29,"—This is a very important issue because hearing loss is a very important issue; as I recall, the Senate passed a motion yesterday relating to Hearing Awareness Week. As the son of a former ear, nose and throat surgeon, I have had a long understanding of these issues. My dad actually owned his own hearing testing booth, so I have a better understanding of these issues than most others. The government proposal requires that a person suffer a further five per cent hearing loss before they can receive any further compensation payment. This further threshold of five per cent is proposed as it is the threshold at which further hearing loss can be effectively assessed. This is the nub of the matter. It is not a figure that has been plucked out of the air; it is a figure we have taken advice on from the National Acoustic Laboratories. I think most people would agree that theirs is the most expert advice available, and their advice is that, if the threshold is any lower than five per cent, it is difficult to medically determine whether a person has actually suffered a further hearing loss. The National Acoustic Laboratories' advice to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission is that the threshold should be five per cent. Both the commission and the government have accepted this advice. If a lower threshold is set, not only would the level of hearing loss be more difficult to determine and the potential for error be greater but there would also be a significant increase in administrative costs, which would surely outweigh the benefits.

I have always thought that doctors have to look into many strange and unpleasant places, and I have always thought that ears are probably better than many. I will not comment further on his choice of profession. Senator Collins, you were slightly wicked about Premier Beattie. He has many admirable characteristics. I do not agree with everything he does and I agree with many things he does. I particularly do not agree with him on land clearing.
Not to detain the Senate, the Australian Democrats were delighted when the government agreed to drop the rate to 10 per cent and we thought that the opposition's adjustment to five per cent was warranted. It was, in fact, the substantive amendment. We think this further set of amendments does not advance the cause, given the nature of the government's remarks or observations.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-08-29,"—I indicate at the outset of the debate that the opposition will be supporting the Family Assistance Estimate Tolerance (Transition) Bill 2001. I also wish to speak at some length about the issue that this bill seeks to address. I particularly wish to highlight the government's inability to formulate, administer and implement policies to support families.
This bill is technical in nature. It amends provisions in the Family Assistance Administration Act that deal with the waiver of debts. The amendments will allow the government to introduce a disallowable instrument and this will give effect to the government's announcement that it will waive the first $1,000 of debts accrued by families following the introduction of the new family tax benefit and child-care benefit payment system in July last year. Though the disallowable instrument is yet to be tabled, we understand that only debts attributable to parental and dependent child income estimation, as well as shared care, will be included in the $1,000 waiver. Further, it is a one-off waiver, applying only to overpayments in the 2000-01 financial year. The government has estimated that some 400,000 families will be affected by the waiver and $220 million in revenue from debt recovery will be forgone.
In outlining the opposition's position on this bill, I wish to refer to the second reading amendment which has been circulated in the name of Senator Evans. I now move that amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate condemns the Government for:
	(a)	bungling the design and implementation of the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Benefit (CCB) payment systems;
	(b)	attempting to hide the scale of the FTB and CCB family debt problems; 
	(c)	failing to articulate any comprehensive measures to fix the long-term problems of FTB and CCB family debts;
	(d)	claiming that the family debt backflip and the resulting $1000 waiver will come at no net budgetary cost to the taxpayer, and;
	(e)	failing to adequately compensate families for the impact of the GST”.
 I turn to address the points noted in our second reading amendment. This bill, and the waiver it will ultimately provide for, is the culmination of a sorry saga for the government. After repeated denials of any problems with the family tax benefit and child-care benefit system introduced as part of the ANTS package, we now have a massive backflip from the government.
It is important to be clear that this bill and the $1,000 waiver it will facilitate have nothing to do with the government's genuine concern for families. It is clearly all about political expediency. The government simply does not care that their new family benefit system acts as a debt trap for families. If they were so concerned, we would be here today debating amendments to the income estimation system. What the government do care about is how families will vote in the forthcoming election. The government have been inept at formulating policies for families. A closer examination of the new family payments and child-care benefit system provides further proof. The new system is flawed in design. Like any benefit, the level of assistance provided to families is determined by income, with lesser benefits made to those with greater means.
The new payment system introduced by the government as part of the ANTS package relies on calculating family benefits based on an estimate of income in the current financial year. Around March of each year, families are asked to estimate their future income for the forthcoming financial year—that is, more than one year in advance. Under the new system, at the end of the tax year the payments made on the basis of the estimate—and any updates—are reconciled with actual income over the course of that year. If actual income exceeds the estimated income, a debt for any overpayment is raised. Under the previous system, family and child-care payments were based on the previous year's taxable income—the base tax year—and there was no reconciliation that could then give rise to a debt. A small number of families could elect to provide a current year estimate. Importantly, the family payment system allowed a 10 per cent buffer between the estimated and actual income upon reconciliation. This buffer, which has been abolished with the new system, gave some leeway for families when their income fluctuated.
With the new system, all families must provide an income estimate and there is a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the end of year reconciliation. As a result, far more families are increasingly being drawn into the debt net. Lower income families—those who must claim their benefits fortnightly rather than on an annual basis—are most at risk. This group is more likely to have fluctuating incomes due to the fact that many of them are involved in part-time or casual work or need to work overtime to improve the income they receive. It violates all principles of social equity and justice that those whose work patterns are the most precarious are also those at greatest risk of accumulating FTB and CCB debts.
The government cannot claim that it was not warned. The history of this saga goes right back to the introduction of the new tax system family assistance legislation. In June 1999, the shadow minister for family and community services made the following remarks in relation to family income estimate debts during the second reading debate:
Provisions in this bill can make things only worse as all families applying for assistance will be required in the future to estimate their income and not to go on their past taxable income. Currently, many families elect to base their assessment on previous tax returns. For many, this is the safe option. Surely, as a result of these changes, more families will unwittingly incur debts.
At that time the government denied that that was the case. As far it was concerned there was, and would be, no problem. Labor has since issued a number of press releases and statements highlighting this issue and other flaws in the FTB and CCB system. At every step the government has denied the existence of any problems. For instance, in a press release dated 5 April 2000, Senator Newman, the previous Minister for Family and Community Services, said: 
Australian families should not be scared by Labor fear campaigner Wayne Swan in his attempt to claim that increased debts will be raised by Centrelink under the New Tax System.
She went on to say:
Of the 2.1 million families to receive FTB part A, around 1.75 million will not have their rate affected by an under or over-estimate of income. Of the remaining 350,000, few are expected to incur a debt because of the improved system.
How wrong was the then minister. The current Minister for Family and Community Services has continued to run the government's line, strenuously denying that there were any problems. In a press release dated 18 April 2001, Senator Vanstone—and I note that that press release is apparently no longer on Minister Vanstone's web site—asserted:
The suggestion that many low income families might face overpayments of $1000 or $2000 is ridiculous ...
She says further:
Low-income families have been the big winners under the new scheme ... comments to the contrary are self-serving in the extreme and serve no purpose but to scare low-income families away from a scheme that can greatly assist them.
That air of denial continued during the last sitting weeks before the winter recess, but then new information came to light. A leaked document from the Department of Family and Community Services showed the government had been busily making preparations to claw back family payments from up to 500,000 families after they lodged their tax returns this year. Families were to have the money stripped from their tax refunds without warning. If their tax refund was insufficient to cover the debt, families were to be sent bills for the outstanding amount. Contingency plans to deal with the debts have been detailed in the memo for Centrelink and the Family Assistance Office. The measures that are being pursued include the formation of a national command and control group, Saturday morning office openings, flying squads, a boost in call centre staff above the levels during the introduction of the GST, delays to tax return processing to moderate the impact on Centrelink, instructions to avoid normal work and the cancellation of staff leave.
These revelations pointed to the size of the problem, but the minister continued to deny that plans were being made and argued strongly that all overpayments be repaid. On 27 June 2001, just a few weeks back, the minister said in this chamber:
The people who understand about getting no more than you are entitled to are the families who are in need. I do not think that they are going to be unhappy, if they have been overpaid, to pay it back into the till.
She went on:
... if a family understates its income and as a consequence has received higher benefits that it would otherwise have been entitled to, it will have to pay that money back.
Three days later—and just two weeks before the Aston by-election—the Prime Minister announced another backflip, another roll-back, by this government. The government, through the measure that we are debating today, would waive debts of up to $1,000. This would apply to some 400,000 families who would otherwise have received debt notices this year. It was a clearly a grand political fix.
This was a last minute decision. All the facts point to that. No government would have taken the steps that it had put in place to recover the debts if it had any plan to waive them in the first place. But I can understand why the government would not want hundreds of thousands of families being hit with massive debts during an election campaign. Let me explain why. The government had previously argued that families would understand that they had overpayments and would be happy to repay money. While the government's disallowable instrument has not been tabled, internal Centrelink memos confirm that families will be able to obtain waivers of up to $2,000 in total—that is, up to $1,000 for FTB and an additional $1,000 for CCB. It beggars belief that 400,000 families would accumulate debts of up to $2,000 deliberately. It beggars belief that the government would waive debts of this magnitude if it was convinced that the families were receiving payments to which they were not entitled. 
What the government's backflip confirms is that the family payment system is generating erroneous debts for families. The system is flawed because it raises retrospective family payment and child-care benefit debts for periods of the year when families were actually entitled to the benefits. The government is having difficulty in coming to terms with this. Indeed, its only advice to families, to keep Centrelink updated on income changes, is flawed because debts may still accumulate. Families who complied with all their obligations to advise of changes in income are still candidates for debts. The system is simply not responsive to fluctuations in income.
The situation is best put by a Mrs Bryant who wrote to the opposition about her family's situation. Mrs Bryant had been at home raising her children for the last seven years, but in April 2001 she was offered three months casual work. She immediately notified Centrelink of the change to her family's annual estimated income. However, because her income earned over the three months would be taken as an amount earned over the whole tax year, she was required to repay benefits received from July 2000 to April 2001. Mrs Bryant asks a simple question and comments:
Where is the incentive for me to work? It seems I will be working to pay back social security $2400.
Perhaps the Minister for Family and Community Services might be kind enough to provide an answer to Mrs Bryant.
The estimation system—and the annual income reconciliation—as it currently works is bad public policy. We know that the new family payment system is unable to recalculate payments to ensure there is no net debt at the end of the year. The government's announcement to waive debts up to $2,000 this year, an election year, does not fix the systemic problems that will saddle average families with debts next year and the year after. The coalition is sitting on a family payment system that is a debt trap, and it is refusing to do anything about it. We ask: why does the coalition want to place ordinary, struggling families deeper in debt? Maybe the minister would like to articulate the government's strategy to fix this problem. There has been none forthcoming to this time. This is the key point: after debate on this bill concludes, we will still have a family payment system that will trap families next year. This bill offers no substantive or corrective changes to address long-term problems. The government seems to think it is fair to ask families to carry the risk and to pick up the tab for its flawed design and administration of the FTB and CCB payments system.
Taxpayers will also question the government's handling of this matter. The backflip has financial implications for all of us. New staff were employed to collect the debts, but most will not be required. Perhaps the minister could advise the Senate how many staff were trained only to be let go. How many staff were diverted from normal work to devise debt recovery procedures for debts that will now be largely waived? What did all of this cost? The minister might also outline the government's plan to utilise some of the remaining staff to make personal phone calls to people who have debts waived. Apparently people need to be personally advised of the government's generosity. Apparently it matters little that no lasting solution has been found. Apparently it matters little that the government's advice to families, that they will be immune from debt so long as they update their income estimates, is erroneous.
In light of the government's mismanagement of this issue, it defies belief that the backflip comes at no net cost to the taxpayer. The government estimates that $220 million in debt recovery will be forgone, yet it argues that there is no underlying cost because the government overestimated outlays in the last financial year. This is difficult to accept. The government knew that there would be substantial debt recovery well before the 22 May budget. Indeed, Senator Vanstone told ABC Radio on 2 July that she knew about the issue as early as February. We know the government's decision to not recover the debt took place after the budget. It is not mentioned in the budget papers. To put it bluntly, the government knew about the issue well before the budget. It took the decision not to collect the money after the budget was tabled. Perhaps the minister could explain to the Senate why the budget almost certainly included the additional resources for the debt recovery operation but did not attribute any savings associated with the recovery of money. 
If we are to accept the government's explanation, then the following admission must be made. In a world of accurate income estimates, families would have received $220 million less in GST compensation than the government has budgeted for. So the government overstated the GST compensation in the new payment system by more than $220 million. This is 10 per cent of the total compensation claimed by the government. In other words, the government has paid families 10 per cent less than they were promised as compensation for the GST. It is little wonder that many families are telling us that the GST has placed them under greater financial pressure.
In summary, as I said at the outset Labor will support the bill because it takes the immediate pressure off most, but not all, families who have been unwittingly caught in the government's debt trap. However, I have moved the opposition's second reading amendment to highlight the bungling in the design and implementation of the family tax benefit and the child-care benefit payment systems, the attempts to hide the scale of the family debt problems with FBT and CCB, the failure to articulate any comprehensive measures to fix the long-term problems of FTB and CCB family debts, the claim that the family debt backflip and the resulting $1,000 waiver will come at no net budgetary cost to the taxpayer and the failure to adequately compensate families for the impact of the GST.
Labor has been arguing for a long time that we need to fix the government's flawed income estimation system, a system that has seen families in receipt of family tax benefit and child-care benefit accrue substantial debts. These debts will be partially waived, but the government has not fixed the fundamental problem. In the absence of any change to the method of estimating income, families will be at risk next year and the year after that. I would ask the minister to state for the public record how many families will have their debts fully waived, how much revenue has been lost from the public purse and how many families will still receive debt notices after accumulating debts in excess of $1,000? Labor supports the bill, but it does not get to the heart of the matter. A future Beazley Labor government will be more interested in removing the debt trap from the family payment system than in simply buying some political time.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE ESTIMATE TOLERANCE (TRANSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-29,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on the Family Assistance Estimate Tolerance (Transition) Bill 2001. I, firstly, should indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the bill, although I do have one amendment that I will move in the committee stage which will address an issue that I think is worth addressing by this bill. I should also address the opposition's second reading amendment. As I will outline in this speech—and, indeed, as I have outlined via questions and speeches in this chamber in the past—the Democrats also have concerns with how the family tax benefit and child-care benefit have been designed and implemented and with the impact they are going to have on many Australians in terms of inadvertent overpayments. For that reason, we are quite supportive of the bulk of the opposition's second reading amendment—the parts of it that actually deal with the substance of the bill at hand.
However, the second reading amendment does have a final item to do with the compensation aspect of the GST which I think, firstly, goes outside the main scope of the legislation and, secondly, makes a statement that the jury is still out on the adequacy of compensation of families for the GST. That issue is broader than just whether or not someone supported the GST; it goes to what its impact has been and the adequacy of the compensation measures. I think there have been differing assessments of that, and further assessment of that needs to be undertaken over the course of the next six or more months before such a statement could be made. So I will seek to amend Labor's second reading amendment simply by deleting part (e). 
This bill follows up the government's announcement recently that the amount of $1,000 will be waived from overpayments of family tax benefit which have occurred because recipients failed to correctly estimate their taxable income for 2000-01 or because of shared care arrangements, which is a new arrangement in relation to many aspects of family payments. A waiver of $1,000 also applies to child-care benefit debts where families underestimated their combined taxable income. It is worth emphasising that it is a difficult business for many people to try to estimate their income, and this is why many people are likely to get into overpayment difficulties inadvertently.
The family tax benefit and child-care benefit arrangements were introduced from 1 July of last year along with the new tax system arrangements. They represented a significant change in the way in which payments for children were administered. Prior to 1 July of last year—indeed, going all the way back to 1984—family payment, family allowance and family assistance were based on the previous financial year's taxable income. In limited situations where circumstances had changed, current year estimates were used as the basis for entitlement with adjustment once taxable income was known. While this was a genuine effort to link the family payment with the current circumstances, it had one very clear outcome: families experienced significant difficulty in estimating in advance their taxable income for a financial year.
Indeed, I recall from my own experiences as an employee of the Department of Social Security back in 1989-90 the number of people who had difficulties in relation to overpayments. As a social worker in that role I occasionally came to meet and speak with people who were faced with that difficulty. Quite clearly, from my experience, almost without exception people found themselves in that difficulty without any intent to rort the system or any of those sorts of pejorative claims; they had merely fallen foul of the complexity and difficulty that was part and parcel of the way that the system operated. 
Notwithstanding how the system did operate at that time, there was a 10 per cent leeway given in the estimate. Many families could not do manage to estimate their income even with that 10 per cent inaccuracy leeway. As a consequence, many debts were raised and families found themselves having to repay thousands of dollars. This is the situation that many Australians will shortly find themselves in—that is, owing thousands of dollars of family tax benefit because of complex changes to payments to families.
The 1 July 2001 arrangements certainly simplified the range of payments to families, and that aspect is welcome, but it had a barb the tail in that it required all recipients who wished to receive payment fortnightly to estimate their taxable income for 2000-01 and they were required to provide this information in March 2000. The requirement to accurately estimate total financial year income some 16 months in advance is difficult at best, impossible at worst and likely to be beyond even some of us. It was certainly difficult for disadvantaged Australians moving in and out of casual employment, those earning overtime, those with limited English or literacy skills or those whose socioeconomic factors render them vulnerable to multiple economic changes at any time. Indeed, some of us in this chamber or in the other place may well find our income levels dramatically reduced in a few months time as a consequence of job loss. This highlights the difficulty of predicting what one's future income is likely to be.
The legislation, for the first time, removed the `date of event' assessment. When a person or partner started a new job or returned to work, the total taxable income from that job was applied retrospectively to the beginning of the financial year. How can a person possibly know in March 2000 that after the birth of a child not yet conceived a person might return to work in April 2001 and, furthermore, provide an estimate of that income at that time? The reality is that many Australians were unable to estimate their annual taxable income accurately, let alone factor in unforeseen events. 
In addition, the impact of the changes to the family tax benefit were not well understood by many recipients, and in my view departmental publications did not make this adequately clear. I recall alarm bells ringing when constituent inquiries to the Democrats made it clear that the message had not been effectively communicated to recipients that a valid estimate must be not only given but also regularly updated throughout the year. In my view this requirement was simply not communicated to many parents, who now find themselves penalised by its outcome.
This is especially the case for shared care payments. This was an issue debated in this chamber and concerns were raised even before the payments came in around, I think, April or May 2000. Senator Evans and I both raised concerns with the then minister, Senator Newman, about how this would operate with the new shared care arrangements. For the first time, from July last year non-resident parents who had care of their children for 10 per cent or more of the year could claim a share of family tax benefit. It was well established prior to that date that at least 30 per cent care was the minimum standard for payment.
While the legislation was supported by all parties in this place, I think its implementation, that aspect of the change, was not clearly recognised at the time, as was raised subsequently by Senator Evans and me in this place. For that, I guess we can bear our own responsibility for not properly assessing it at the time and recognising that this change was part of the many other changes that were being brought into play. But it was crucial and we certainly got undertakings at the time that the changes would be not only monitored closely to see what the impact would be—because there were not any clear assessments done of what the potential impact would be—but also very clearly and effectively communicated to recipients.
We believe that has not occurred adequately. Some separated parents were not told that their partner who had care of the children for alternate weekends had only claimed family tax benefits, resulting in an overpayment to the primary parent. Historically, if the non-resident parent could not claim FTB because of income, the primary parent could claim the full rate of FTB. This was no longer the case from last year, but in my view this received only a vague reference in departmental publications. Publications such as Assistance for families by the department certainly did not make clear the impact of the new legislation. It was only after concerns were raised earlier this year by the Democrats and others that a flurry of activity began, with the department sending out letters about shared care and estimates in a last effort to better inform Australians of the significant changes that had been occurring up to six months earlier. By then it was already becoming too late: families had begun to accrue debts, unbeknown to them.
In the view of the Democrats it is not a valid defence to argue that families could wait until the end of the year and claim family tax benefit retrospectively against their actual taxable income. That is simply not practical for many people. Payments to families have been made fortnightly since the late 1970s and, prior to that, monthly in the old days of child endowment. Families live on this money; it is generally not saved or put away for later. The reality of today's economy is that families rely on family tax benefit to provide for the day-to-day needs of their children, including food, clothing, accommodation and education—needs which cannot be held off until the end of the next taxation year.
No person likes to receive a debt notice from Centrelink or from anybody else, I am sure. This government has regularly labelled persons who have been overpaid as `rorters' and `cheats', totally disregarding the fact that, even with the best effort, it can prove impossible to estimate one's income to the nearest dollar and thereby avoid a debt. The values of family tax benefit overpayments are included in the debt figures regularly publicised by the department. Failure to accurately estimate taxable income because of unforeseen events or circumstances is not a crime. It is certainly not cheating or rorting the system; it is for many people simply unavoidable. Stigmatising social security recipients who inadvertently act in this manner is frightening and demeaning to Australians and completely unwarranted in the view of the Democrats. So it is entirely appropriate that consideration be given to families who have inadvertently fallen into the trap of misunderstanding the major changes in legislation that occurred last year. 
I turn now to the $1,000 waiver, which is the centrepiece of this legislation. A debt of $1,000 will arise if a person or family underestimated their income by $3,300. Allowing for unforeseen events such as return to work, increased hours, higher duties, overtime, drawing down on superannuation, lump sum employer payments and harvest yield and crop return, it seems that $3,300 is likely to be on the lower scale of the estimate inaccuracy spectrum. Historically, I recall many appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where rural families in particular, being understandably unable to predict the weather and therefore the crop yield or wool clip, ultimately received more taxable income than they had estimated. It seems more than mere coincidence that the $3,300 estimate leeway provided by this bill aligns with the 10 per cent leeway for estimates allowed by the previous legislation and removed by this government last year. Perhaps it is time for the government to consider reintroducing a 10 per cent leeway for estimates in the legislation.
The impact of the $1,000 waiver for family tax benefit and child-care benefit is not consistent. While the Democrats acknowledge that a waiver of $1,000 will apply to each family tax benefit and each child-care benefit, for child-care benefit only one waiver of $1,000 will be made, regardless of the number of children in the family. Families with more than one child in child care may incur a greater debt for the same level of estimate inaccuracy simply because they have more than one child. This legislation and, I understand, the draft regulations do not allow for this variation, with the result that families with children in child care are effectively penalised for having more than one child. The government might claim that families in this situation receive a higher rate of fee relief. However, this overlooks the reality that the family would also pay more child-care fees.
The one payment of $1,000 is also inconsistent as it applies to shared care assessments. A common pattern of shared care in separated families—that is, alternate weekends and half of school holidays—equates to about 30 per cent of shared care. This can result in a debt of about $1,000 to the primary parent for one child, and this will be more if there is more than one child in the family. So the Democrats call on the government to fairly consider families in these situations where one payment of $1,000 is not commensurate with a debt that will be greater in families where there is more than one child and to consider increasing the waiver proportionately.
As I indicated at the outset, there exists an anomaly between the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and the Social Security Act 1991 in relation to the waiver of debts arising from administrative error. Given that this legislation deals with debts, I think it is appropriate to move an amendment to address this issue. I have circulated an amendment to bring these two elements of legislation into line, and I will speak to that amendment later in the committee stage. I reiterate that the Democrats are supportive of the opposition's second reading amendment, apart from part (e). I move to amend the opposition amendment as follows:

"Senator ALSTON,",LP,2001-08-29,"—Almost three weeks ago, Senator Faulkner came into this chamber late on a Thursday evening when many senators had already left Canberra and made an extraordinary statement or, more accurately, confession. After bagging Senator Heffernan and me, he told the Senate and then the media about an `argy-bargy' he had had with Sydney Water over the extension of a sewer main from his private property to an adjoining undeveloped and unsewered lot. Senator Faulkner's statement raises many more questions than it answers. Senator Faulkner said: 
When the house was partly demolished and open to the weather, Sydney Water insisted that I put the sewer main under my house to connect a vacant block of land next door.
This statement suggests that Senator Faulkner did not approach Sydney Water prior to commencing his renovations in respect of the sewerage precautions that he needed to take. But Sydney Water's interest in this matter should be totally unsurprising to Senator Faulkner, given that he had already engaged the services of a professional builder who would be very familiar with Sydney Water's requirements.
Senator Faulkner should make clear what advice he received on this matter from all sources, including in the course of applying for any building permit before the renovations commenced. In his statement to the Senate, Senator Faulkner also said that he paid:
 ... $3,000 for the sewer pipe to go under my house so that my renovations could go ahead. 
This is not surprising, given that Sydney Water's guidelines clearly state that `you will be responsible for meeting the cost of your building-over-sewer precautions'. But Senator Faulkner also told the Senate:
At the end of this particular argy-bargy, I had to pay a lot of money for five metres of sewer pipe to run under my house to a vacant block of land.
This is a totally different situation. Here Senator Faulkner is referring to a sewer extension to an adjoining vacant lot. For the uninitiated, it seems that Sydney Water's normal policy is to insist that, when renovations are made to a home sewer, the sewer pipe is at the same time extended to at least the boundary line of an adjoining unsewered lot to make it sewer ready. This means that, if the adjoining block is subsequently developed, the sewer line can be connected quickly and relatively cheaply. This is a sensible policy based on Sydney Water's experience that, if the sewer line ceases under the renovated property, all sorts of difficult and expensive access issues can arise later, involving major disruption to garden layout and buildings obstructing the sewer pathway.
A number of documents have been provided to me regarding this matter. One of these documents refers to an application by Senator Faulkner's plumber for the disuse of the sewer, meaning that Senator Faulkner would not have to pay any extension costs. However, this document also makes clear that Sydney Water denied this request for a disuse because of the overriding importance of extending the sewer to the adjoining lots owned by Energy Australia. 
Another document is a 28 August letter sent by Sydney Water to Senator Faulkner's representative at his private residence. The letter refers to two issues: namely, the need to protect the sewer main from the weight of renovations and the need to address the likelihood that the two unsewered blocks would require a point of connection to the sewer. The letter attaches three options to resolve these issues. Option 1 extends the sewer to the adjoining lot at the cost of Senator Faulkner. Sydney Water would recover these costs and refund Senator Faulkner when the adjoining lots were developed. In addition, the sewer main and part of the vent line on Senator Faulkner's property would be concrete encased, the former at the cost of Senator Faulkner, while the memo does not say who would pay for the latter.
Option 2 disuses the sewer on Senator Faulkner's property at his cost. A new point of connection and maintenance rodding would be provided and the house line connected all at Senator Faulkner's cost. The existing vent line would be relocated at Senator Faulkner's cost and Senator Faulkner would have to get written agreement from Energy Australia for the disuse, which would mean extremely expensive servicing of the adjoining blocks in the future involving two manholes and 16 metres of sewer through Senator Faulkner's and the next door property. Option 3 extends the sewer to the adjoining lot. This would be initially paid for by Senator Faulkner, but he would be reimbursed by Sydney Water if it was found that the extension was commercially viable for Sydney Water. Sydney Water would again recover the cost from the future developers of the adjoining lots. As with option 1, the sewer main and part of the vent line on Senator Faulkner's property would be concrete encased at his cost. 
The first point to be made in relation to the options is this: Senator Faulkner would have to pay up front for any extension. If such an extension was commercially viable, Senator Faulkner would be reimbursed by Sydney Water under option 3. If option 1 were taken up, Senator Faulkner would only be reimbursed when future development occurred. The second point is that any disuse of the sewer was not considered to be sensible by Sydney Water because of the future costs and impacts involved. This is confirmed in a Sydney Water file note dated 28 August which states that, while the applicant was initially advised that the sewer could be disused, from a site visit it is clear that the land is quite steep and sewer serviceability would definitely be out of the question. This file note states that a minor five-metre sewer extension would be the most feasible to provide a connection to the adjoining lots. Nevertheless, the file note states that the owner should seek written advice from Energy Australia stating that the disuse of the sewer would not have any effect on any existing or future use of the land.
The next document is a file note of a 29 August meeting with Senator Faulkner's representative. It states that the owners' main concern is the cost of servicing future development and why this condition should be placed upon them. The file note states that the possibility of a Sydney Water contribution was raised and the conditions on this explained. Senator Faulkner or his representative was to contact Energy Australia about the possible future development of the adjoining lots. And Sydney Water was to run a rough calculation for a possible contribution under a so-called minor extension contribution policy.
On 30 August, Senator Faulkner received a letter from Energy Australia, stating that it had no plans to change the usage of its properties and no requirements for sewerage provision. In effect, what this meant was that it was not possible to demonstrate that an extension to the adjoining lots was a commercially viable proposition for Sydney Water. It also meant that a disuse, regardless of the later major cost and disruption that it would cause, remained a possible option.
So what was the end result of all this, in Senator Faulkner's words, `argy-bargy'? The end result is outlined in another crucial Sydney Water document titled `Executive Summary' dated 1 September 1996 although printed out on 17 September. The overview of that document refers to the:
 ... design and construction of 7.5 metres of sewer main at a cost of $7,900 located within—
Senator Faulkner's address—
in order to service adjacent unsewered lots owned by Energy Australia capable of future development.
The customers are listed as `Mr John Faulkner (Federal MP) and Energy Australia'. The reason given is: 
A lead-out constructed now would be the most cost effective approach to providing a service to possible future development of the adjoining land. It is quite likely to be the most cost effective solution for Sydney Water and the owner of—
Senator Faulkner's property—
due to the need to relocate the ventline and the associated reconnection costs. An alternative option potentially commits any future developer(s) of the two unsewered blocks to extremely expensive servicing at a future date, likely to involve two access chambers and 16 metres of sewer main to be laid through—
Senator Faulkner's and the other sewered lot. In other words, the disuse option had been rejected and an extension or lead-out was being provided. So who was paying for this and on what basis? The document makes absolutely clear that the extension was being paid for entirely by Sydney Water to the tune of $7,990—rounded up to $8,000. There were no other financial contributors to the project. The document lists the aims of the capital project as:
... ensures serviceability to an unsewered property. Creates a new rateable property. Customer satisfaction, owner of (Senator Faulkner's property). Recovery costs of any future redevelopment of Energy Australia's land.
The document states:  
It is recommended that option 1—a contribution of $7,990 for the lead-out to be paid to ... 
And then lists the contractors. The internal Sydney Water utilities business submission for a capital item or project refers to the capital investment criteria. The boxes titled `Meeting Regulatory Requirements' and `Earning 7% target return' are not ticked, but the box titled `Service Charter Requirements' is ticked. Another document demonstrates that the total Sydney Water budget for this project increased from zero to $8,000, while a further document states that in relation to option 1, the cumulative net present value by 2026 is minus $4,092, the benefit-cost ratio is no higher than 0.61, and the internal rate of return is a mere 0.1 per cent. All of these figures assume annual sewer rates for the adjoining lots of $272, despite the fact that none of the documents indicate that any sewer has actually been connected to these lots or indeed that there was any likelihood of doing so.
So we have a situation where, in the three days between 28 August 1996 and 1 September 1996, Sydney Water rejected the disuse option and both the extension options they had previously put to Senator Faulkner—options where Senator Faulkner as the owner of the renovated lot would pay up front for the extension. Instead, Sydney Water opted for a variance of the original option 1, where rather than Senator Faulkner paying up front and being reimbursed upon the development of the adjoining lots, Sydney Water paid the entire capital cost up front and would recover costs from any future development of the Energy Australia land.
Sydney Water's own figures demonstrate this was not a commercial proposition. The Energy Australia letter to Senator Faulkner states:
Energy Australia has no plans to change the usage of its substation property and accordingly does not require you to provide any sewerage provisions for Energy Australia's adjoining property.
In other words, there is no likely recovery by Sydney Water of its capital costs. The end result is that Sydney Water expected—presumably based on its practice and past experience with many owners undertaking renovations—that the owner would bear up-front responsibility for the cost of the extension works, in this case, $8,000. As a result of `argy bargy', which Senator Faulkner admits engaging in, Sydney Water appears to have completely capitulated and allowed Senator Faulkner off scot-free. Why? Wouldn't many other ordinary citizens like to secure such an outstanding result? How loud does a senior member of parliament have to yell to bring about the desired result?
Three weeks ago, Senator Faulkner told the Senate that he paid a lot of money for a sewer pipe to run to a vacant block of land. While I do not dispute that Senator Faulkner may have paid for the concrete encasements on his own property, none of the documents demonstrate that he paid a cent for the lead-out or extension to the adjoining lot. Senator Faulkner puts this serendipitous result down to `frustrating argy bargy' with bureaucracy. I am sure that anyone in the chamber who knows Senator Faulkner can only imagine what a man renowned for his short fuse and his endless and unremitting capacity for personal abuse could mean when he refers to `frustrating argy bargy'. The whole affair has an odour about it akin to Senator Faulkner's unventilated sewer. Senator Faulkner, who has spent his entire parliamentary career in the gutter, now has some very serious questions to answer about his own sewer. What exactly does his reference to `frustrating argy bargy' with bureaucracy mean?
 (Senator Crowley)—Senator Alston, I ask you to withdraw that last comment, please.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I withdraw it. Did he use his public position to exert political influence for private gain? Whom, if anyone, did he talk to in the New South Wales Labor government to get this result? Was there a political fix? Did the man who threatened Senator Eggleston at a Senate estimates committee threaten or abuse anyone at Sydney Water? Who did he put the weights on at Sydney Water? Did he go to the top, even possibly to the board? Did he contact the ministerial section of Sydney Water and, if so, why? And why did Senator Faulkner tell the Senate that he paid a lot of money for a sewer pipe to run to a vacant block of land when the documentation clearly shows that this was not the case? It is time that a man who has spent much of his time in the gutter asking questions of others started answering some important questions himself. 
—Senator Alston, I have asked you to withdraw that reference. Would you withdraw it again, please.
—I withdraw that reference. Senator Faulkner told the Senate three weeks ago that he had `documents, letters and receipts concerning all aspects of this matter'. He told the Senate that `anyone who wants to see these documents is welcome to come to my office and go through them'. I think he excluded Liberal Party people. It is now time that Senator Faulkner laid this material on the table of the Senate. It is time that Labor's spokesman for public administration was accountable for the public administration of this matter. It is time that the man who insists upon open and transparent government applied the same rules to himself that he applies to others. I seek leave to table the documents I have referred to in this speech.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-29,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
Given the recent public statements from both Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, expressing their opposition to discrimination against gay and lesbian people, and noting the absence of comprehensive Commonwealth laws to redress this, the necessity for Parliament to enact national laws against sexuality discrimination.
In recent days, as stated in my letter, both the Prime Minister and Mr Beazley have said that they oppose discrimination of gay and lesbian people. This is not the first time that both leaders have said this, but it is the first time that their comments have gained such prominence in the media. However, in doing so, it struck me that both leaders were being exceptionally hypocritical, and that is the issue I want to address here today.
To be fair, exactly what Mr Howard said when he was asked recently on public radio by some students what his views were should be noted. He said, firstly, that he was strongly opposed to the concept of gay marriage—a concept, I hasten to add, that has never been advocated by any gay or lesbian group in Australia or by me and a concept that is not indicative in my motion. However, having thrown up that red herring, he went on to say:
Consistent with that view, I don't think people should be penalised or discriminated against if they are homosexuals. 
The media then went to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and asked him what he thought. Amongst other things, he said that same sex couples should be recognised under laws that apply to heterosexual couples. He said that he reckoned it was a reasonable thing that all normal laws that apply to the operation of couples for things like their superannuation arrangements should give recognition to gay couples. That is what Mr Beazley told the Seven Network a couple of days ago. Hypocrisy, I would cry, given that both leaders have repeatedly opposed, blocked or frustrated all attempts at ending this discrimination—even very recently on a range of superannuation issues.
As it happens, Australia has no Commonwealth or federal laws to address sexuality discrimination and remains one of the very few Western countries in that situation—Canada, New Zealand, Britain and South Africa all having such laws in place. The United Nations Human Rights Committee provided the opportunity in 1994 for the then Labor government to enact these laws when it came down with its finding in the Toonen case, being the case where Tasmanian resident Nicholas Toonen took his claim of discrimination to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in relation to Tasmania's antigay laws, but by implication Australia's antigay laws.
The UNHRC responded by saying that, yes, Australia was in breach of article 17, arbitrary interference with privacy, but the committee went further. It stated that, as far as it was concerned, article 2.1 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights, which provides a schedule of circumstances and status that is protected by the UN Declaration on Human Rights, includes sex—that is, gender—in terms of those groups of people who must not be discriminated against. In its view, the committee said that `sex' ought to be interpreted by the Australian government as including sexual orientation. With that marvellous opportunity to introduce national antidiscrimination laws on those grounds, the ALP sadly chose not to do it and squibbed that opportunity. To date, the Commonwealth has failed to protect Australian citizens from sexuality discrimination, despite having both the mandate and authority to do so. Australian law experts agree that there is international precedent and jurisprudence and a need for such laws and has argued that this discrimination ought to be ended.
It is interesting to note that Nicholas Toonen, that wonderful Australian who changed international law through his activities in Tasmania and then internationally, now resides in New Zealand. It is worth explaining why. As it happens, Nick Toonen established a long-term continuing relationship with his Filipino partner. When he sought to allow his Filipino partner to come here and live as an Australian citizen, he discovered Australia's antigay immigration laws and the hurdles that are placed in front of same sex couples trying to immigrate here. As a consequence, he and his partner now live effectively in political exile in New Zealand—an indictment of our country. 
So what is needed in sexuality discrimination laws? Many people, including me, would advocate—and my motion proposes—that we can address discrimination in areas like employment, housing and the provision of goods and services in the same way as most states and territories have already done, including through various forms of legal recognition for relationships in such matters as superannuation, property settlement, wills and estates, hospital visits and coronial rights. Despite that, Mr Howard and Mr Beazley both have acted or voted against such rights and their rhetoric is hugely hypocritical. Neither party will support the Democrats' sexuality discrimination bill or allow time to even debate it.
The issues which most affect gay and lesbian people in same sex couples are superannuation, taxation, social security, immigration, aged care, the Australian Federal Police, veterans' affairs, the defence forces and the Commonwealth Public Service, amongst others. To flesh out a few of these issues, let me explain some of them. In the Defence Force, for example, personnel are required to relocate every two years to other Australian bases. If they are married or have a de facto partner, the department pays for the relocation and provides accommodation for that couple. That is not the case in a same sex relationship. But, worse still, if one partner in a same sex couple is a member of the Defence Force and they are working overseas under dangerous circumstances and are killed or injured, their partner is not formally notified, they are not entitled to any superannuation death benefits or compensation and they are not even entitled to grief counselling.
There has been much debate on superannuation, some of it misguided, but we understand that there is no automatic right for same sex partners to leave their superannuation contributions to their partners in the event of their death, and surviving same sex partners are specifically denied death benefits and reversionary pensions. In immigration—I have touched on this a little—the antigay administrative hurdles greatly limit the opportunity for same sex partners to come to Australia. The entrance quota—that is, the number of same sex couples allowed to emigrate here—is smaller and tighter than it has ever been.
There is a lot of hysteria and misinformation about the notion of gay marriage. I make the point repeatedly that my motion and my argument have nothing to do with that. Only today, Minister Kelly released guidelines to deal with sexuality discrimination and homophobia in sport but will not answer the question why the government will do nothing about sexuality discrimination and homophobia within government policy and legislation. While the government is attempting to address homophobia on the sporting field and youth suicide related to sexuality through its comprehensive youth suicide and sexuality related problems policies, these are simply bandaids on symptoms and do not address the underlying causes. We need comprehensive national antisexuality discrimination laws much the same as the ones that currently exist in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and will hopefully exist soon in my home state. But federal laws must mirror, and not contradict, those laws at a state level so that all citizens can be treated equally and fairly.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-08-29,"—This motion, moved today by the Australian Democrats, calls for national laws against sexuality discrimination. I emphasise `sexuality' discrimination as opposed to `sexual' discrimination. In the Commonwealth parliament, we have passed legislation in relation to sexual discrimination—that is, between the sexes—but we have not passed any in relation to sexuality discrimination. Having said that, the position of the government is that we nevertheless condemn discrimination in all its forms. We advocate a tolerant and fair-minded society and a respect for the sexual preferences of individuals. 
The issue, however, is how we should within our federated system deal with issues of prejudice on the basis of sexuality. You will be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that most of the states and territories have already legislated to protect against discrimination on the basis of sexuality. I understand that there is legislation in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the ACT that prohibits discrimination on grounds such as sexuality, lawful sexual activity and sexual orientation. I understand the legislation varies from state to state, but that is not surprising. That is often the case with our federation, with a range of sovereign governments. I am also advised that Western Australia has announced its intention to draft similar legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexuality.
Already the states have substantially moved in this area. The issue is whether, if there are still gaps, it is the appropriate role of the Commonwealth government to seek to cover the field. Apart from that argument, if there are gaps in the sense that there are matters that relate to federal powers and responsibilities, the issue is whether the Commonwealth has responded, or should respond, legislatively to those gaps. The approach of the coalition has been that we do not leap in to seek to cover the field where we might perceive some shortcoming in a piece of state legislation. We genuinely believe that each tier of government should accept the responsibility that it has. It is one thing to encourage the states to adopt certain standards with their legislation in areas that are their responsibility; it is another thing to attempt to cover the field through Commonwealth legislation. On that basis, we have not been supportive of an all encompassing national law passed by the Commonwealth.
In relation to matters that fall within the Commonwealth's responsibility there has also been action in this area. I remind the Senate that government amendments to the superannuation law, which commenced in May 1999, now allow trustees to accept binding death benefit nominations from members. These amendments allow the trustee to pay death benefits to a person nominated on the beneficiary form where that person is a dependant of the deceased member or his or her personal representative. 
The government has also recently introduced the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998, which would facilitate same sex couples to choose a fund that accepts binding death nominations. That bill, I might remind honourable senators, was defeated by the Democrats and the opposition. However, we remain committed to its passage. 
As well as the Commonwealth having passed laws that take into account same sex relationships, there are Commonwealth laws that protect against discrimination on the basis of sexuality. The Workplace Relations Act contains a range of provisions intended to help prevent and eliminate discrimination, including on the basis of sexual preference. The Workplace Relations Act provides that it is unlawful to terminate a person's employment on the ground of their sexual preference. Again, discrimination in employment on the ground of sexual preference has been declared as a basis for complaint under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act of 1996. Complaints can be made to the Human Rights Commission about discrimination on the ground of sexual preference in employment or occupation or about Commonwealth acts or practices that may breach human rights, which would include discrimination against someone on the basis of their sexuality, and the commission will attempt to conciliate the complaint and reach a settlement between the parties. If this is not possible, the commission can prepare a report to the Attorney-General that is tabled in the parliament. HREOC can also investigate and attempt to conciliate complaints that an act or a practice of the Commonwealth breaches a human right, which can include discrimination on the ground of sexuality.  
Apart from that, there has been further debate as to whether there should be change in relation to the superannuation law. I remind the Senate of the report by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services on the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 2000, tabled on 6 April 2000, which makes a number of related recommendations, including the establishment of an IDC to examine same sex issues across the Commonwealth. The government is considering this Senate report and will report back to the Senate on all of the recommendations in due course. 
So what I am saying is that on a case by case basis, where the issue of discrimination on the grounds of sexuality falls within an area of Commonwealth responsibility, this government has accepted to address that particular issue and to assess whether the relevant piece of Commonwealth legislation adequately covers that matter. We do not believe in covering the field. Therefore, we are not supportive of a national law against sexuality discrimination. Rather, we accept the states' laws in that regard in relation to Commonwealth matters that fall within our jurisdiction. We address it on an issue by issue basis. 
Let me conclude by saying that this debate has been to some extent confused with the debate in relation to marriage. The Commonwealth constitutional interpretation of marriage is that marriage is `a union of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'. That definition is reflected in the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act. It is the view of the Australian government that that is the appropriate definition, and should remain so. Having said that, it does not mean that we do not recognise that the rights of same sex couples should be respected. They should be respected and we should endeavour to see that they are not disadvantaged in any way as a result of their sexual preference.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-29,"—The opposition will support this urgency motion that stands in Senator Greig's name. The position of the Labor Party is clear. We strongly oppose discrimination against gay and lesbian people, as we oppose discrimination against anyone else. The Labor Party's platform on this matter is unambiguous: 
Labor supports legislative and administrative action by all Australian governments to eliminate discrimination, including systematic discrimination, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, religion, sexuality, disability, genetic make-up, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 
We recognise the right of all Australians to live and work in an environment free from vilification or harassment, and will provide an accessible and effective means for all Australians to protect themselves from such behaviour. 
Finally, another plank of the Labor Party's platform: 
Specifically, Labor supports the enactment of legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of a person's sexuality.
The Labor Party strongly believes that meaningful steps should be taken to address the systematic discrimination against gay and lesbian people. That is why we have not supported the piecemeal—and sometimes I have described them as grandstanding—amendments to legislation that have at times been moved by Senator Greig on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We believe that those amendments have been attached to legislation that is completely unrelated to this important issue before the chamber. I am pleased that Senator Greig has twigged that piecemeal amendments will not address the injustices and discrimination that both the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party aim to rid Australia of.
It is fair to say that the Labor Party has been on the front foot on this matter, introducing legislation in relation to superannuation rights for same sex partners. When the Labor Party first raised the issue of equal superannuation rights for same sex couples, some thought that this was not a mainstream issue—some thought that this was quite an obscure issue. But an injustice to any individual, to any section of society, is an injustice that undermines our society as a whole. The member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, introduced the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 1998. We are disappointed that the government will not allow that bill to be properly debated. The Labor Party would prefer a full debate and vote on the bill, but it appears to be something that the government seems determined to prevent. 
Labor's bill in relation to equal superannuation rights is not about introducing special rights for gay and lesbian couples. It is about introducing equal rights—rights that every other Australian worker would be entitled to expect. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are clearly discriminated against. Since introducing that bill, we have seen a groundswell of community support for law reform. The issue of recognition of same sex relationships has received coverage on programs as diverse as the ABC's World Today and Mike Gibson's morning radio show on Sydney radio station 2GB—I do not want to show all my prejudices in relation to what I might or might not listen to on the radio. I even noted that the Australian Financial Review columnist, Mr Christopher Pearson, not—it is fair to say—noted for his radical or Labor supporting views, has also written a column supporting Labor's bill.
The community concern at the discrimination currently suffered by people in same sex relationships saw the Body Shop join this campaign. The Body Shop distributed information and collected signatures on petitions calling for Labor's bill to be debated and put to a vote. I should acknowledge that the launches of the Body Shop campaign in Sydney and Melbourne were attended by coalition MPs. I do not normally quote the Body Shop in debates in the Senate, but today I will. I am not going into the question of their motivation, nor, might I say, am I promoting the Body Shop. I do not happen to own shares in the Body Shop. The Deputy Clerk is pleased to hear that, but she would have known that because she would have examined my pecuniary interest return. Let me quote the Body Shop:
Why is The Body Shop involved? 
Our mission statement reads: 
`To passionately campaign for the protection of human and civil rights.' We believe that current laws discriminate against same sex couples and that it is important for politicians to address this issue now! Not because we have a `gay and lesbian agenda', as some would accuse, but because equality in the law for all Australians is significant to all Australians.
I have quoted that because the Body Shop, on this occasion, got it right. That statement is spot on. Dealing with discrimination is not about a gay and lesbian agenda, special rights or gay marriage. It is about treating people fairly and equally. Equal rights regardless of sexuality are, in my view, as fundamental as equal rights regardless of class, gender or ethnicity. In the view of the opposition, it is vital that the government show the same level of bipartisan support that we recently saw in the New South Wales parliament where the Legislative Assembly carried—without dissent—support for same sex rights in the Property Relationships Legislation Amendment Bill. Only three members of the Legislative Council—Mr Nile, Mr Oldfield and Mr Tingle—opposed the legislation in that chamber. This is a step forward. Here we have a situation where the Labor government and the Liberal opposition in New South Wales supported the legislation in both chambers. They appear to be ahead of their conservative colleagues in this parliament.
The opposition will support this motion moved by Senator Greig. We are pleased that the motion addresses the need for comprehensive Commonwealth laws against discrimination. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, I will finish by saying this: we will work with all parties and groups that support meaningful change in the way I have outlined to the law in this important area.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2001-08-29,"—Could I say at the outset that the National Party does not persecute or deny respect to those who enter freely into a minority lifestyle, but we do not want to promote it. We do not want to promote it to our children as an equally valid or acceptable way of life. We have before us an urgency motion that says, in effect, that the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, and the Prime Minister, John Howard, express their opposition to discrimination against gay and lesbian people. It further says: 
... and noting the absence of comprehensive Commonwealth laws to redress this, the necessity for Parliament to enact national laws against sexuality discrimination.
I listened very carefully to Senator Greig's speech, and Senator Greig acknowledges that he chose his lifestyle. I do not challenge that. That is his right. I have never, to my knowledge, discriminated against him or done anything either to Senator Greig or Senator Brown. That is their life; that is the way they choose to live. The National Party accepts that. But where we have a difference is that, when I listened to Senator Greig's maiden speech some time ago, it struck me that one of Senator Greig's missions in coming into this place was not just to acknowledge that he chose this particular way of life but to say to the Senate, `I want to normalise this way of life. I want to condone this way of life. I want to use this parliament of Australia to move legislation that will show, if the Parliament of Australia accepts this and registers laws, that it will condone it and naturalise it.' That was what I thought the main point in his maiden speech was about.
I say to the Senate that many people on the opposite side, in the Labor Party, will be put in a very embarrassing position on this. I am very pleased to say the National and Liberal parties are not going to vote for this. But if the Senate, overall, does vote for it—and it looks as though that is the way it will go—the Senate fails in its duty if it allows a single interest group to dictate the legislative agenda. This motion is all about Senator Greig trying to impose a social agenda which is not acceptable to the majority of Australians. 
As my leader, Senator Hill, has said, I can remember debating the sex discrimination legislation when I first got into this place. That legislation very clearly says that discrimination is not acceptable in Australia. You cannot choose a person on their sexuality when you are choosing a person for a job; you cannot dismiss a person on their sexuality. So I would have thought we had comprehensive antidiscrimination laws. But every time there is a bill going through Senator Greig gets up and tries to tack on an amendment. I say that what he is doing is very clear: he is trying to use this parliament to do that. If this parliament, which is the highest office in the land, condones or accepts this way of life we are clearly saying to the people of Australia, `If it is good enough for the parliament of Australia to pass laws, it is good enough for us to accept that this is a right for our children, if they choose to go this way.'
I say to Senator Greig and Senator Brown, with absolutely no malice because I have no malice, that this is not what the Australian people want. This is a lifestyle that a minority group have chosen, but do not push it onto all Australians. If that is the way that you choose to live, the majority of Australians accept it. They do not discriminate against you. They do not say, `You are a homosexual so we are not going to vote for you.' You are both in the parliament, so you must be accepted. The Australian people do not vote on those things. Some would, but you have been chosen for the parliament. You have both disclosed your chosen way of life. But please do not try and use this parliament to condone a way of life that is not accepted by a majority of people. There is no discrimination against you in this parliament. 
We have antidiscrimination laws that are effective. We have passed those laws. If we choose to vote for this, we start to get ourselves on the slippery slide, and no-one knows where we will end up. It is the same with the euthanasia debate. You start to move a little bit, then you move a little bit more, and then you have every piece of legislation that comes through having an amendment tacked onto it that condones this particular way of life.
It is clear to me that this motion will be passed. The Democrats will support it; they have always supported it. Up until now, the Labor Party have not supported it. Senator Bolkus, you have always knocked the Greig amendments back any time they have been tacked onto a piece of legislation—and Senator Greig acknowledges that—up until today. It appears that today you have changed your policy on these issues and you are going to support this motion. Clearly, in the event of our losing government and your taking over government, with a combination of the Labor Party and the Democrats, we will have amendments that condone or normalise this way of life tacked onto legislation going through this parliament. 
The National Party has to oppose this motion because it undermines the primacy of the family unit. If we support this motion, we start to get on the slippery slide. Senator Greig, I have listened to your speech. You acknowledged that you were not pushing for same sex duos to marry and adopt children. I accept that. But where do you stop once you start? 
—Adoption is a state issue.
—Adoption is a state issue. If you are after the adoption of children—and Senator Greig has said that he did not push marriage, but adoption is a state issue, so I presume that he is looking for adoption of children—and then have access to reproductive technology, you are undermining the family: the basic unit of society. People elect us to go into the parliament and oppose this. We want to cherish families—and marriage between men and women—and we see them as the essential building blocks of this society that the nation must be committed to and protect and defend. We believe that adoption of children in same sex couples is basically wrong. The family is a very special unit. We have to enshrine marriage, protect it and uphold it in the face of those who would want to downgrade it. Accepting this motion is the start. Where is it going to end? No-one knows. If we pass this motion, we are sending a message. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-29,"—I rise also to support this motion. I make it clear from the start to Senator Boswell—and I have got to say that his contribution was a rather sad one; having known him for quite long time and knowing that he has been here for a long time, it is unfortunate that he is still using the same old arguments that we have heard quite often—that we made a commitment in 1994 in our national platform to support legislation and admin action against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. We recommitted ourselves to that in our national platform in 1996 and have done it since. We are committed to the sort of action that this motion before us today embodies. For us, this comes within a long tradition of promoting action against discrimination, whether it is on the basis of race, sex, colour or creed. We have been at the forefront of sponsoring legislation on those grounds. Can I say to Senator Boswell before he leaves: every time we have done that, every time we have introduced legislation against discrimination, it has been Senator Boswell and his old troglodytes in the National Party who have come in here with the slippery slope argument—`once you get on the slippery slope'. The fact is that we have legislated consistently over the years and that slippery slope that Senator Boswell is concerned about has not led to the dire consequences that he fears.
The other part of Senator Boswell's contribution that I found offensive was the way he has tried to personalise this issue in respect of Senator Greig and, to a lesser extent, in respect of Senator Brown. That does not help public policy formulation. It does not help policy debate. The issue we are talking about here is bigger than one that could be personalised in respect of Senator Greig, and I hope he found Senator Boswell's assertions in this area as offensive as I did. Senator Boswell claimed that Senator Greig is pursuing a social agenda not acceptable to many Australians. The fact is that in this national parliament we have a responsibility to all Australians. We have got to recognise the reality of life in this country. There are minorities and there is discrimination against those minorities. Senator Boswell would have us basically legislate to recognise a majority culture, a majority lifestyle, and have it imposed on the rest of us. That is not a long bow to draw from what he was saying, because that in essence is what he was asserting.
We are an enormously diverse country, including religion and culture. We have black and white and every shade in between and we have diversity of lifestyle. It is the responsibility of this parliament to actually generate mature debate and not fall into those stereotypical arguments that we have had from the National Party again today, arguments which basically demean the minority groups in our community. To personalise them is also a way of demeaning not just the arguments but also those who propose protection for minority groups in our society. 
Let me say to Senator Boswell and anyone else listening: this is not a question of promotion; this is a question of recognition and a question of respecting our fellow citizens. The sorts of activities that we are talking about protecting here are not my cup of tea, but I do recognise that we have a responsibility in this place in building a civilised society to respect lifestyles, cultures and diversity within our society. To demean continually those who propose these sorts of policies, to threaten and to run the scaremongering campaigns based on the slippery slope argument are things that this parliament should have long gotten out of.
As I said, we made our initial commitment in respect of discrimination on sexuality in 1994. In 1995, in response to the Toonan situation, we both proposed and passed the human rights sexual conduct bill of that year, protecting the rights of people in their own bedroom. Subsequent to that, in 1996, when Senator Spindler left this place, we did have before us a live piece of legislation—the Sexuality Discrimination Bill. The Senate spent quite a long time addressing that legislation—dissecting it and having a public inquiry in respect of it. In fact, it was a long inquiry and an exhaustive one, and the work done in that inquiry by people like Senator McKiernan should not be underestimated. It was an inquiry that actually raised the issues that are still of concern to people today—the issues that I am sure have driven the motion before us this afternoon.
What we did in that inquiry, in crossing the country to take advice, was to not just focus on the principle of antisexuality discrimination legislation but look at where the Commonwealth had responsibility and determine what sorts of issues were the most sensitive ones that had to be addressed. I assumed some responsibility for that legislation in 1996 because we felt that there were areas of Commonwealth law and Commonwealth responsibility that had to be addressed by the national parliament. We felt an obligation to protect people of transgender status and to protect people who were going through gender reassignment. All those issues were important.
At the same time, we felt an obligation to address some of the issues of concern that people had had over the years. For instance, the roles and responsibilities of religious schools was one issue raised at the time in the deliberations of that committee. The problem of religious schools and their employment policies was addressed to the extent that at the end of the process the legislation was recognised as having been developed in such a way that it would have allowed adequate exemptions for not just Christian schools but also Islamic schools. There was a mythology spawned by some senators on the other side about transgender in sport. It was recognised during that committee process that that was one of the issues that needed to be addressed. It was an issue that was addressed in a way that basically recognised that sporting organisations had and have a capacity to exclude those whose physiology gives them an unfair advantage. That mechanism was appropriate to handle that particular issue.
We have had a range of issues raised over the last five years in respect of this broader discrimination issue. One of the most important ones raised over that period and during that committee process was the question of superannuation. Superannuation was an ongoing concern to an ever growing number of Australians. It is a critical area that was addressed initially in the legislation sponsored by Anthony Albanese, the member for Grayndler, in the House of Representatives. In introducing a bill to make the government confront the issue, Mr Albanese said:
I have argued throughout this debate that my bill is not about introducing special rights for gay and lesbian couples. It is about introducing equal rights, rights that every other Australian worker would be perfectly entitled to expect. This private member's bill allows for a gay or lesbian worker to properly provide for their surviving partner and children in the event of their death, which is a perfectly reasonable expectation for any couple. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are clearly discriminated against. 
That was the driving force—and that is the driving force that I think has pushed Labor over intervening years—in respect of this legislation: not special treatment but recognition. As we said in 1996 in respect of the Sexuality Discrimination Bill, we are in the business of eliminating discrimination on the grounds of sexuality in Australian society. We believe that all people are entitled to respect, dignity and equitable access to participation in society, regardless of their sexual preference, and we are committed to protecting and promoting the human rights of gay men and lesbian women. It is an argument that drove that inquiry's deliberations and it is an argument that I think should drive our considerations now. In saying that, I do recognise that there are a lot of people in the community who do not want this sort of recognition and protection given to minority groups. If we are in the business of legislating only for the majority, then we are not doing our job in this place. 
In the deliberations on the legislation we went on to look at the provisions of state and territory legislation in this area. We found that it was not consistent and not sufficiently widespread with respect to state and territory laws. At that stage, there were two jurisdictions that did not have prohibitions on discrimination on sexuality. Now we have one—and gladly, with WA intending to legislate, we could overcome that particular problem. But there is inconsistency, and that inconsistency is not irrelevant, particularly when you are talking, for instance, about the impact of national markets and policies that are run nationally by organisations that may in fact discriminate against the people we are concerned about here.
We need to recognise that Australia is becoming more of a national community and a national market. Legislation needs to be consistent because of the fact that so many different organisations operate across states. Having inconsistent legislation—inadequate legislation in some circumstances—is not the most efficient way to go. We have had the argument consistently from the other side of politics that this is an issue best left to the states, but that is their tired old formula. It is a formula that I think the public is getting sick of. I suppose it is the first commandment of Howard's prime ministership; it is the first commandment of Senator Hill's approach to a whole lot of issues, particularly the environment. The fact of the matter is that we cannot keep flicking these issues off to the states. That is an abdication of national responsibility. We support this motion before us today.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-08-29,"—I congratulate Senator Greig on this motion and I am very pleased to see that it may well get through. I also want congratulate a 12 year-old student named Nick Robinson who brought the matter up on Triple J's talkback classroom segment a week or so ago. He and his fellow students talked with Mr Howard in a way which showed the change of attitude that has come with a new generation—a relaxed and easy attitude towards subjects that were once taboo and damaging.
I do not feel that we should be too harsh in responding to what Prime Minister Howard had to say or, indeed, what Senator Boswell has just had to say, because to a degree we are all captive of our own background and our own cultural as well as genetic make-up. It is very hard to escape from that and I would hate to be involved in reverse discrimination. Prime Minister Howard himself very often very subtly expresses the views of the 1950s and did so when he was questioned by Nick Robertson about the matter of homosexuality. He began by talking about the disappointment he would feel if, in a hypothetical case, a child of his were to be homosexual. That is a genuine, honest answer, but the message that goes to the girl in Geelong who is finding out just now that she is lesbian or to the boy in Toowoomba or Broome or wherever who is finding out he is homosexual is that the leader of the country is disappointed in you because of your sexuality. That is a very deeply damaging message and we have got to get past it. We need to be able to say to people, `Look, celebrate your left-handedness, celebrate your brown hair, celebrate your sexuality, be it heterosexual or homosexual, celebrate your talent, your own make-up, in its magnificent diversity as part of the natural spectrum.' That applies to homosexuality as much as it does to any other part of one's characteristics. We have to get away from the message to youngsters that, if they are one of the one million or so Australians who happen to be homosexual, they should in some way or other think that that is a matter for anything other than celebration—the same as sexuality if you happen to be heterosexual. 
That is the interesting part about this debate. I was talking to young people about this recently and was quite pleasantly astonished to find that they just do not feel that it is really an issue—that is, an attitude difference towards people on the basis of their sexuality. I know that that is not universal, but the very fact that youngsters chatting amongst themselves—bright, intelligent young Australians—feel that way shows what a sea change there has been in just my lifetime. I celebrate that, that is a great thing; it is just fantastic. It is making a huge difference to the right to be happy that so many young Australians have been denied in the past because they discovered that they were not heterosexual.
On the matter of discrimination, I think that we should end it wherever it applies in the statute books. It is as simple as that. A growing number of Australians feel the same way. When it comes to a partnership between same sex couples, whether or not they have children, is that any different to a partnership between opposite sex couples in terms of the investment that people put into it, the benefits they get from it and the contribution that that partnership of itself, let alone the individuals, makes to the wider society? Of course not. So things have changed mightily for the better. Congratulations to the young Australians who saw this as an issue worthy of bringing up when they chatted with the Prime Minister and congratulations to him for his response.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-29,"—The Senate has before it an urgency motion which notes the absence of comprehensive laws against sexuality discrimination. I presume that means that the motion seeks comprehensive laws against sexuality discrimination. The parliament, through its committees, has had a number of submissions before it, and these submissions from various groups have expressed concern about employment discrimination, about violence and harassment and about superannuation. Let me make it perfectly clear that I oppose and have opposed for many years unfair discrimination in employment. It goes without saying that I reject and vigorously oppose violence and harassment. 
On the question of superannuation, you have got to be careful that you do not discriminate against persons in a similar position, the only difference being that they do not have sex together. You could, for example, have two workers who die. Both were employed in the same place. One worker had a homosexual partner. The other worker lived with his brother—or it might be two sisters living together—and that person was dependent upon the worker for shelter. Under a proposed automatic rights scheme for superannuation to go to the homosexual partner, the relative of the deceased worker would get nothing. It would be a real twist in sex discrimination, would it not, if a person were denied these rights just because they did not engage in homosexual sex with the other person?
What is the homosexual lobby agenda? I have been trying to work that out since I heard about this motion. It seems that, whilst they do not seek homosexual marriage, they want to make it compulsory that homosexual couples be recognised and treated the same as those who are married. That is what this is about and that, of course, undermines the importance of marriage in our society and undermines the importance of having children in our society. If everyone were homosexual, there would be no family. They want to make it compulsory that the homosexual lifestyle be taught to our schoolchildren as desirable and as equally valid as marriage—let Senator Greig deny that—and they want to lower the age of consent. That increases the vulnerability of those adolescents who are in a confused state of mind, especially those who experience temporary homosexual tendencies—and that is not unusual. What about a pastor in a pulpit? Is he going to be tackled by the proposed laws that are being suggested by the homosexual lobby group? Does he run a legal risk if, from the pulpit, he condemns homosexual practices and quotes the Bible in his support of his condemnation? That has happened in Canada.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-29,"—In the three minutes I have remaining, it is very difficult to respond to all the things raised in the debate. I thank those senators who contributed, both for and against. I think this debate is important. I will recap by touching on a few things. Senator Hill's contribution was perhaps as audacious as it was disingenuous. He argued, essentially, that this was a state issue—effectively ignoring the fact that there was a raft of Commonwealth discrimination, much of which he did not address. He did mention that superannuation might be addressed sometimes by gay and lesbian superannuants leaving their superannuation to a trustee, but he failed to mention there are tax imposts and other discriminatory practices that take place in that, and he failed to mention that that did not fix anything in relation to death benefits or reversionary pensions. 
He accused the Democrats of sinking the super choice bill which would have allowed, he argued, this discrimination to end, thereby promoting the repugnant argument, in my view, that market forces should determine human rights. Wrong. We specifically voted against that legislation purely on the grounds that the government would not accept a simple human rights amendment relating to same sex couples. He went on to say that the Workplace Relations Act included unfair dismissal provisions for gay and lesbian people. True. That happened because the Democrats amended it to do so. What he failed to point out was that unfair dismissal is the only aspect of employment relations that deals with this form of discrimination, not others. He also said that his government was looking at a whole-of-government approach. I point out that the Attorney-General said exactly the same thing at the last election and has done nothing since. 
I thank Senator Faulkner for his contribution, although it was wrong of him to accuse me of making piecemeal amendments to the legislation rather than addressing it in a wholesale fashion. I point out, once again, that we Democrats have introduced a wholesale bill—the Sexuality Discrimination Bill 1995—which has been on the Notice Paper since 1995 and which Labor today will not support nor allow time to debate. He promoted the Anthony Albanese superannuation bill but again failed to point out that it is simply one part of one section of the Sexuality Discrimination Bill 1995.
Senator Boswell effectively argued that gay and lesbian people choose to be so. I utterly refute that, both from a psychological point of view and from a personal point of view. This is not about choice, and therefore discrimination against gay and lesbian people on the grounds of sexuality is as repugnant as racism or antisemiticism. Senator Harradine raised a number of issues which time really does not allow me to respond to other than to say that he is wrong. This is not about marriage; it is not about age of consent. I would argue that the discrimination promoted through policy breeds much of the homophobia and violence to which he says he is opposed. I thank senators for their contribution. I think it is important that this Senate does send a strong message to the parliament, to the House of Representatives and to the Australian community that this discrimination is not acceptable and that it should be addressed and must be addressed with overarching national comprehensive sexuality discrimination laws which mirror the states and which do not contradict the states. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-29,"—Pursuant to standing order 154, I move:
That the resolution just agreed to be communicated by message to the House of Representatives for its concurrence. ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-29,"—I do not know the reason that this ought to be transmitted to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives members will no doubt consider the matter if it is referred and if they have time. They have plenty to do with their time. This is a very important issue, and I would like to see the House of Representatives deal with the matter in a manner that gives people time to debate the issues in full. Senator Greig did not have time, as he said, to respond to some of my issues. I challenge him to deny that the homosexual lobby group's agenda includes the compulsory teaching of our children in schools that the homosexual lifestyle is equally as valid as marriage. That is on their agenda.  
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Harradine has not made clear what particular standing order he is using to make this speech and has not sought leave to speak.
 (Senator Watson)—He is just debating the motion you put forward. 
—I ask Senator Greig to deny that. Let the people of Australia say whether they would like that—that is, that the homosexual lifestyle be taught to our schoolchildren as desirable and valid. Does Senator Greig say that promiscuity or sex outside of marriage, for example, should be taught to our children as being a desirable and valid lifestyle? Is that what is being said? I certainly know lots of people with homosexual tendencies. Lots of people going through adolescence do have homosexual tendencies. They might have a crush on a mate at school or something like that, but very often they grow through that. But should we have this lifestyle taught to our children compulsorily on the grounds that if it is not taught to our children compulsorily it is discrimination? The Labor Party have to face up to this. I did not interpret the Labor Party's policy as meaning that, but does it? These things need to be considered very carefully indeed.
On the question of access to IVF for lesbians, again this is a matter of great concern amongst the community. There is a great deal of angst in the community about that, particularly as the rights of the child should be pre-eminent in all of these considerations. Their best interests should prevail. It is not that you should have a person say `I want a child' like they say `I want a new car'. The pre-eminence of the rights of the child and their best interests should prevail. What we have to ask ourselves is whether it is in the best interests of a child to be denied from the word go their right to know who their father is and their right to be cared for by their father. That is what this means. Let us face it: that is what this means. I for one believe in fatherhood, and what is being proposed in respect of the access of lesbians, for example, to IVF is the denial from the word go of the child's right to know who their father is and their right to be cared for by that father—as well as by the mother, of course. We are dealing with very important issues here. I actually support the motion that it go to the House of Representatives so there will be a decent old discussion about it. Let us get out into the open what this means and let us see what the agenda is. It will not be denied by Senator Greig. 
Regarding the adoption of children, again, the best interests of the child must prevail. Senator Greig in the previous debate talked about what is happening in Canada. He mentioned Canada in an approving way. But what was the recent case in Canada? A pastor who happened to be speaking from the pulpit expressing opposition to the homosexual lifestyle—and I deliberately say `homosexual lifestyle' to distinguish it from being a reference to a person with homosexual tendencies—quoted biblical passages to support what he was saying. Legal action was taken against him and it was then found that he could not do that. Is that the way people want to go in this country?
There are lots of other areas that I would like to discuss at the present moment but this is obviously not the time nor the place. I support this motion going back to the House of Representatives, and I will be very interested to hear the debate there if time is given to it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-08-29,"—I will make two brief comments. Firstly, the House of Representatives no longer need to deal with this message. They changed their standing orders a few months ago because that inveterate sender of messages, Senator Carr, did it once too often, so no matter what we do today this will not get much of a mention. Secondly, Senator Harradine—it has been rare for me to criticise you—in all the time Senator Carr has been here and sent messages down, until this moment he did not realise he could make a 20-minute speech. You have let the cat out of the bag and we are all going to pay a horrible price! ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-08-29,"—I join with Senator Ray. I draw his attention to the fact that, as I understand it, a notice of motion has been given in the House of Representatives to change its standing orders. I am not altogether convinced that that has been carried, so it may well be there is a need for this motion to go forth. Of course, now that Senator Ray has drawn my attention to this omission on my part, I think it would be only too kind of me to take up this matter for him.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1

But we will not oppose this motion of Senator Greig's.,SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Sexuality Discrimination Legislation</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-29,"—I do not propose to speak at great length, but Senator Harradine did throw a few rhetorical questions to me and I take this opportunity to reply. The one which most offends me is the accusation that there is some kind of agenda, either from myself or `the homosexual lobby', whatever that is, to promote or encourage homosexuality in schools. I want to reiterate the point that you cannot promote or encourage something as innate as a person's sexuality. 
What is happening in some schools, to their great credit, is antidiscrimination and antihomophobia education. Interestingly, most of that is being done in Senator Harradine's home state of Tasmania, which I would argue leads the world in terms of the way it addresses discrimination and harassment against gay and lesbian people in schools. In fact, the education department has issued a directive to all of its state schools that this form of training and antihomophobia education is compulsory, and I applaud that. 
I also make the point that the Howard coalition government is the biggest spending government on programs for the prevention of youth suicide related to sexuality. Prime Minister Howard has spent more than any previous Labor government on addressing youth suicide related to sexuality, and has initiated a range of wonderful, largely rural-based programs aimed at reaching young gay and lesbian people and teaching them that their sexuality is valid, that they are not second-class citizens, that they ought to have human rights and equality and they should not live in fear and isolation, and I applaud that. 
The principal pilot program for the project and its funding again is based in Senator Harradine's home state of Tasmania. I would encourage him to have a close look at that and I would ask him the rhetorical question: if he is so fearful of what he calls education and promotion, why then is his home state leading the way in this? Of course, the answer to that is because there has been tremendous community debate in his home state of Tasmania on this issue and that has led to wonderful community education and excellent parliamentary responses. 
I am pleased that my home state appears to be on the verge of also adopting antidiscrimination laws and same-sex couple laws. In the event that that happens in the comprehensive way that is proposed, that too would include curriculum changes that would deal with sexuality education and antihomophobia training in schools. That too is a wonderful thing. It is very damaging and very wrong for people like Senator Harradine—he is not the only one—to continue to promote the myth that sexuality, and homosexuality in particular, is some kind of lifestyle choice, as if people wake up one morning and say to themselves, `Gee, I think I would like to be discriminated against in social security, taxation, immigration, superannuation, Commonwealth defence forces, employment, housing and provision of goods and services. I would like to make myself vulnerable to abuse and vilification. I would like to make myself subject to verbal abuse, harassment and violence at much greater rates that anybody else. I would like to expose myself to the possibility of being hugely more at risk of suicide than other people. Yes, I will suddenly become homosexual and adopt a homosexual lifestyle.' It is patently ridiculous.  
I repeat the words of, I think, Justice Michael Kirby, who has been very brave in this area, and has argued that discrimination on the grounds of sexuality is as morally repugnant as racism and anti-Semitism. I would echo that. In principle, what I am trying to do here today through this legislation—and I paraphrase the wonderful words of Martin Luther King Jr during the civil rights movement in America—is to say, `Judicial decrees may not restrain the heart, but they can restrain the heartless.'

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2001-08-29,"—The Family Assistance Estimate Tolerance (Transition) Bill 2001 follows through on the government's announcement of $1,000 tolerance for families with a family tax benefit or child-care benefit overpayment for families that incorrectly estimated income or shared care in 2000-01. The tolerance will apply to overpayments from claims made through Centrelink during 2000-01. The incorrect estimate might be adjusted taxable income, maintenance income, child income, shared care or an incorrect multiple-child rate. The tolerance is a transitional measure to help families who have had difficulty with the estimates make the adjustment to the new family assistance system. It is available for the 2000-01 income year only.
The Family Assistance Office is working closely with families to help them with their estimates for 2001-02. If a family has both an FTB overpayment and a CCB overpayment, the $1,000 tolerance will apply to each overpayment. Some customers may have more than one FTB overpayment or more than one CCB overpayment subject to the $1,000 tolerance. For these people, any tolerance amount remaining from the first overpayment will apply to the second. Any family that still has an excess payment after the $1,000 tolerance may have it recovered by adjusting their future payments.

I understand that there are differing issues and differing opinions in relation to this matter and, in particular, to the difficulty that some families have faced in the first year of this new system. Some people want now what they see as longer term solutions and do not accept that, in fact, the difficulty that was faced in the first year will not be faced in the following year. We can have that debate, and no doubt we will do so. Since this is an election year, I am pretty confident that Senator Evans and others will take quite appropriate political opportunities to make their points, and so will Senator Bartlett. That debate, I think, is for another day. This debate is about giving legislative approval for a $1,000 waiver on the first $1,000 of an FTB overpayment and the same for the CCB. I thank senators for their contributions. We have disagreements, I am sure, and I have no doubt that we will continue to have them.

This is an unusual process at this time of day, but these are unusual times. The government has formed the view this afternoon that it should seek the passage tonight in the parliament of legislation to protect Australia's borders. That draft legislation has now, I understand, been given by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and it is the government's intention to introduce and proceed until passage with that legislation in the House of Representatives tonight and then bring it to the Senate and seek passage in this place as well. This legislation obviously relates to the circumstances of the Norwegian ship which has, against the instruction of Australian authorities, entered Australian territorial waters, and it reasserts certain powers particularly in relation to the removal, if necessary, of the ship.
I have tried to contact Senator Harradine, unsuccessfully, and left a message on his answering machine. I regret that I was not able to contact anybody until Mr Howard had spoken to Mr Beazley. I have similarly tried to contact Senator Brown and left a message on his answering machine. So if they got their message they know what is going on; if they have not they may not, and I regret that.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-29,"—Can I, first of all, indicate in this brief contribution that I will be making that I will be limiting myself to certain process issues. I can indicate to the Senate that Senator Hill rang me some few minutes ago and indicated the government's intentions on this matter. I have had an opportunity only for the briefest of conversations with the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, Mr Beazley, and I can confirm, as Senator Hill has indicated to the Senate, that Mr Beazley has in his possession a draft bill that I understand goes in general to the issues as explained by Senator Hill to this chamber a few moments ago.
In my conversation with Senator Hill I indicated to him that clearly on a matter like this all political parties—but I can, of course, speak only for the Australian Labor Party—have internal processes, and I think Senator Hill appreciated that this legislation has not been seen by me or by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and obviously there would need to be, and I think there is, an understanding that before matters are finalised our internal processes need to take place. I think I am not putting words into your mouth, Senator Hill, if I can publicly indicate that you accept that principle in relation to this or any legislation. 
—Yes.
—Thank you for that acknowledgment. The decision that the Australian Labor Party has at this point as I speak is whether we cooperate with the government to allow the Senate to sit tonight to deal with the matter that Senator Hill has indicated needs an extraordinary degree of legislative priority. That is what I am indicating, on behalf of the opposition, that I am agreeing to. The Labor Party is cooperating with this approach. I suggested to Senator Hill in the phone call he made to me that the sensible way of dealing with this matter would be for a motion to be prepared and if it were agreed certainly the opposition would be granting leave and that is what is occurring at this point.
I would reinforce with Senator Hill the need for all senators to be apprised of what is occurring in this chamber tonight. The government should undertake the most strenuous effort to contact non-government senators. We do not expect you to take any efforts at all on behalf of the opposition—that is our responsibility—but there may be other senators, and Senator Hill has named Senator Harradine and Senator Brown, to whom there is a real responsibility here.
—Senator Brown is here.
—I am sorry, Senator Brown, I was not aware that you had come into the chamber.
—I came in to find out what was happening.
—Join the club. I was making the point, Senator Brown, that the government ought to make a serious effort to have contacted you and Senator Harradine in this extraordinary circumstance that we find ourselves in. It is on that basis that I have indicated that not only would we give leave for this motion to come forward but in terms of the process outlined in the motion—for the reasons that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, has outlined—the opposition will be agreeing to the motion before the chair. We will be voting accordingly within the next 13 minutes to allow the Senate to sit tonight to debate this issue.
But I do reiterate that we have our own internal processes in which to consider the legislation that has been provided to the Leader of the Opposition and, obviously, we would reserve our right to do that and reserve our right to take any decision on this bill that we deem appropriate. But the issue before the chair at the moment is whether we give the government an opportunity to allow the Senate to sit and bring forward this legislation. It would be churlish not to, even though I have not seen the legislation, and we are not going to be churlish about this. That is the immediate decision to be made, and it is made with the support and the cooperation of the federal opposition.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,26,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-08-29,"—Certainly the Australian Democrats have given leave to the government to bring on this extraordinary motion this evening. But, in relation to supporting the motion before us and the variance in sitting hours, we do not believe it is churlish to oppose it. We would like to have had more information, as I am sure is the case for everyone in the Senate, about the legislation that is being contemplated and indeed debated. The preference of the Australian Democrats is not to support this motion before us until we have a stronger argument and justification from the government as to why this needs to come on tonight.
I understand from the comments of the Leader of the Government in the Senate that there is a draft bill available. I do not know if it is actually in circulation, but I do acknowledge that the Manager of Government Business made it clear that the government and, I think, the Prime Minister were going to attempt to contact my office and also other senators to outline the circumstances. I agree with Senator Hill that this is an unusual circumstance. It is indeed a very unusual process. That is why the Democrats would have preferred more information about the policy matter being debated, as well as about the process that was about to be pursued. 
I am curious about and I ask the government whether this is in relation to legal and technical matters. Is this a case of retrospective justification for actions that we have seen over the past 48 hours in relation to the asylum seekers on the Norwegian vessel Tampa? Is this a case of retrospective legality that we are dealing with tonight? Is this legislation necessary tonight in order to do what Senator Hill has outlined, and that is to `protect our borders'? Forgive me, Mr Acting Deputy President, but that makes it sound a little like we are at war. I was not aware that our borders were in need of protection.
When the government refer to the need to reinstate some policy—or some legal provision, I presume—and reassert certain powers, I would have hoped that they would have made it a little clearer in their opening remarks what they were referring to. While this is an extraordinary and unusual situation, both in process and policy terms, that we are confronted with this evening, I would like a little more justification or information as to why it is so urgent that it must be done now. It may be the case that the government have to justify and need some legal protection for action that they either have undertaken today or are about to undertake, in which case I would appreciate that being made clear to the Senate.
The Australian Democrats recognise the numbers in this place. Senator Faulkner has indicated, on behalf of the opposition, that they will be supporting the motion before us. Like everyone else in this chamber, I am unaware of the position of the other non-government senators in this place—Senator Brown and Senator Harradine, presuming Senator Harradine has been contacted and is aware of the situation before us. But we are not aware of, and therefore cannot be convinced of, the need for urgency for the sitting times tonight and the possible introduction of a bill and passage of that bill through both houses tonight when we do not actually know specifically to what that legislation refers.
If there is a good case for urgency, we look forward to hearing about it from the government. Like Senator Faulkner, we in the Democrats also have internal processes, and I have not had an opportunity to talk with my colleagues. My colleagues are aware that we are having this debate only now and they are not aware of the policy content. So, if I can issue a request, a plea, to the government, it is that we have some argument, some justification and some policy specificity in relation to the need for this debate tonight.
I certainly hope that this is not policy making or legislation on the run. I certainly hope that it is not simply a belated attempt by this government to justify its actions of the past 24 to 48 hours. I certainly hope that it is not a political beat-up by the government in order to compound or increase support for actions that the Prime Minister has taken over the past 48 hours in relation to the asylum seeker issue, particularly in relation to the deployment of Defence personnel, in order to stop asylum seekers from entering Australia and being assessed and applying for asylum seeker status. And I certainly hope that this is not a knee-jerk political reaction that is policy making on the run.
I would like to hear from the government some justification as to the urgency for this debate now and for an extension in the sitting hours this evening. But, having said that, I recognise that Labor will be joining with the government to support the motion before us. I acknowledge Senator Brian Harradine, who is entering the Senate now. I will be curious to hear what he as an honourable senator and what Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens have to say on this matter, but certainly the Democrat preference is not to support the motion before us. I reject any notion put forward by the opposition leader in this place that it is churlish not to. I think it is an extraordinary and unusual debate, and I want to hear some justification from the government as to why we are dealing with and confronting such an extraordinary and unusual process.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-08-29,"—The government is in a shambles now over the Prime Minister's action to turn back the asylum seekers just two days ago. In trying to address the potential illegalities of its own actions—in trying to cover the failure of its own actions—it now finds itself required to change the hours of sitting of parliament to get what is effectively an emergency sitting of parliament. The Prime Minister is leading this nation deeper into international opprobrium in the way in which he is handling what has now become a crisis.
Let us not have any doubt about this. Prime Minister Howard has led Australia into the greatest crisis of international reputation that this nation has seen for decades in a matter of two days, and he has done it, I believe, because of political expediency, because he felt that domestically it would be a good thing for him in the run to the election. The terrible thing about this is that Her Majesty's opposition has become the Greens and the Democrats, because the Labor Party is failing to provide opposition on a matter as important as this. The humanitarian reputation which this nation holds true to its own bosom is being ripped apart by the government's actions while the opposition stands lamely by.
I am not going to block leave here. The matter is too important for that. We have huge responsibilities on our shoulders. But, prima facie, the government has got itself into a mess: it has sent military personnel—men and women—into this situation without having done its homework first, and now it wants the parliament to do the homework afterwards. What a deplorable situation! What a shambles the Howard government has got this nation into over the 438 people on this boat! With difficulty we have been handling these boats, but this one the Prime Minister turned back and it is this one that this nation is being damaged by.
It is the failure of the Prime Minister to be able to relate to the people on the ship that is causing the damage. He has put his interest before theirs and so we have this shambles. What a deplorable situation for this nation of ours! What a failure of leadership! What a failure of foresight! When cabinet made this decision a little over 48 hours ago it should have known what the consequences would be. But now the Howard government is into damage control to the point where the national parliament is being suborned to try and cover up for the government's failure to see what was coming down the line. Well, so it has to be, but I can tell you that it is a failure of process of the highest order by the government. Internationally, Australia is now coming under enormous condemnation by commentators and people right around the world because of Prime Minister Howard. That the parliament should now be being called to sit an extraordinary hour to cover up for the failure of his foresight shows the degree of his own failure of leadership.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,26,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-29,"—I know that this vote has to take place by 10 minutes to seven. I just want to indicate that, as I understand the standing orders, we will need at 8 o'clock, when we come back, to delete the cut-off time. We can debate the issue again then. I would most respectfully request the government to provide us with a draft copy of the bill by then.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-08-29,"—I will continue my remarks from earlier. I was in the midst of talking about market failure in relation to this government and education policy, and I was drawing the Senate's attention to an extraordinary statement made on 15 April 2000 by the Prime Minister who said:
We believed that every problem could be solved by the unrestrained operation of market behaviour and some naive notion that trickle-down economics from that unrestrained operation would solve every problem. 
To an extent, PELS, along with other measures in Backing Australia's Ability, can be understood as the closest we are likely to get to an admission from the government that their naivety and their simple-minded beliefs about markets have been enormously destructive in terms of higher education. I say that I am continuing these remarks because I was interrupted earlier by the extraordinary change in proceedings in relation to the border protection bill that is coming on tonight. I will save that debate for a later hour. 
In relation to PELS and broader policy considerations, in its own terms PELS is quite a clever proposal. The Democrats are the first to acknowledge, as we did in January when the statement regarding Backing Australia's Ability was made, that it will enable some students who are currently unable to access a postgraduate course to do so. Hence, the response of the sector that PELS is better than nothing if it is the only support or relief for lifelong learning that the government is willing to provide. However, we are obliged to look at the broader policy context. The submission by CAPA to the Senate inquiry into PELS pointed out that:
At the most basic level, PELS misses the point. The crisis in postgraduate coursework education is not primarily a function of student liquidity; it is a function of a deregulated, market based fee regime.
The primary concerns that the Australian Democrats have with PELS are, firstly, that it is premised on postgraduate education being solely a private benefit for the student; secondly, it avoids the real problem of insufficient funded places; and, thirdly, it cannot overcome the substantial cost differentials among disciplines. PELS is conceptually quite different from HECS. While both are income contingent loans, HECS is also a private contribution to a publicly funded place, which explicitly recognises that there is a considerable public benefit from higher education. PELS, on the other hand, simply advances the full cost of tuition and thus assumes a private benefit only. 
Full fees in conjunction with a substantial drop of HECS places have led to a declining number of students in disciplines with little or no private benefit. The Democrats believe that students in such disciplines are not likely to enrol just because they can get a loan. Thus, a real problem is falling enrolments in disciplines such as education, nursing and science where there is considerable public benefit but not necessarily private benefit. These issues remain unaddressed by PELS. The representative of the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee told the Senate inquiry into the original bill that:
... we agree that we do need a better mix of HECS and fee paying in a range of these postgraduate areas ... That broad policy position is one we have argued. It is not one, at this stage, that the government has chosen to address ... 
The government's persistent failure to seriously tackle the massive distortions of markets in education is actually playing quite a significant part in my party's rejection of PELS. Senators will be aware that universities are still required to offer a HECS place for initial vocational entry qualifications in nursing and in education. However, there is a serious anomaly whereby an increasing number of vocations including psychology, social welfare, museum studies and librarianship require a postgraduate qualification for initial vocational entry. Yet universities are not provided with, or required to offer, HECS places in these disciplines. PELS, of course, does not address this policy madness. 
In 1990, the government introduced the relative funding model. This is a weighting scheme that explicitly acknowledges that different disciplines have different delivery costs. Science and engineering, for instance, need expensive laboratories and, say, humanities and law do not. Differential HECS works on a similar basis, although the inclusion of law in the top band is predicated, of course, on potential private benefit. I think we are the only country in the world that has this bizarre mix of predicted or future earnings plus course costs in trying to determine where courses fit in certain tiers. However, PELS does not and cannot take cost of delivery into account as it simply relies on markets. This will create enormous problems in high cost areas with high industry and/or public benefit but comparatively low private benefit—for example, in science and in some areas of engineering.  
Quite simply, PELS locks in a full cost recovery, full fee system that actively discriminates against students in the sciences because necessarily they will be charged higher fees than students in disciplines with lower delivery costs. The Democrats will continue to insist that PELS must be accompanied by supplementation to universities for postgraduate course work places in high cost and/or high public good areas, including science and engineering. 
It is bizarre that just one week after Science Meets Parliament Day we have a government initiative that once again sadly ignores the strategic significance of science and engineering in our future. Sadly, this is yet another example of this government's incoherent approach to innovation and to the knowledge economy. The government claims that PELS is designed to encourage lifelong learning and to help Australians upgrade and acquire new skills to keep at the forefront of their profession, but the real policy message of PELS is to say that the government no longer has significant responsibility for or interest in lifelong learning after undergraduate study. This is certainly out of step with changing employment patterns and the need I guess not only generally in Australia but globally for a more flexible labour force.
I think it is also important to see the market failure in postgraduate course work in the broader context in terms of the crisis in our university system. Postgraduate fees are an increasingly important part of university income and provide some cash flow in an environment where the cutbacks in public funding by this government have created serious problems in our universities. Dr Kemp makes much of the fact that since the cutbacks in public funding to universities that were announced back in 1996 by his predecessor, Senator Amanda Vanstone, total revenues going to universities have increased, and we have acknowledged publicly before in this chamber that indeed those revenues have increased. However, the increased resources from private sources have not replaced diminishing public resources and they have not gone into the core activities of teaching, learning, scholarship and, of course, fundamental research. Rather, the increased revenues from private sources have primarily gone into marketing, recruitment of international students, offshore campuses and commercial research. 
This reflects the changes in universities whereby they are doing additional activities to their core teaching, learning and research functions. So, despite increased total revenues, the decline in public funding has resulted in course closures, cost shifting to students, increasing staff-student ratios, cutbacks to libraries and significant casualisation of the academic labour force. This damage has been particularly acute in the core enabling disciplines of physics, chemistry, mathematics, philosophy and history, and of course everyone would agree that these disciplines are crucial for an innovative culture, for critical thinking and for innovation in Australia. 
Therefore, for this government to simply look at the total revenue and then divide it by the total number of students, to show an increase in funding for students, is a gross distortion designed to mislead and obfuscate what is really happening in our university sector. It is not good enough for the government and its apologists to simply throw their hands up in the air and say that it is each university's own decision as to how they allocate their resources. What they manifestly fail to grasp is that public funding delivers varied types of educational and research goods to those from private sources. While there is an overall increase in revenues for universities, the fundamental public good functions have been seriously damaged by this government's insistence on marketisation. And why? Because, as the Prime Minister has acknowledged, this government has been obsessed with a naïve belief in unrestrained markets. I should note that postgraduates well know the consequences of this government's naivete.
In my opening remarks in this debate, I mentioned that the Democrats had some sympathy for the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition, but I did suggest that it would be more appropriately worded if it included the role of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the deregulation of the postgraduate sector when they were in power. I thought it was interesting to see Dr Kemp on a news programs this evening trying to justify this government's blatant cost shifting from the public sector to the private sector in the form of schools funding and, of course, now we have Dr Kemp and his colleagues trying to argue that there is sufficient funding—in fact, increased total revenues—to universities as a consequence of this government's activity when in fact our university systems are in crisis.  
They require more resources—$100 million immediately, as identified in the report by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee that came out in December last year. Not only that, we also need to address the issue of academic wages. Once again I point to the changes in this piece of legislation that will have an impact on the work force and industrial relations, particularly for those academics. I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party will actually be supporting those changes, particularly with their purported concern not only for education generally and academics specifically, but also for good industrial relations practices. I will be curious to hear in the committee stage, I presume from Senator Carr, how his party justifies support for some of the changes in the legislation that is before us. 
The Democrats do not support PELS in its current form. We believe that it is a short-sighted approach by this government. Although we do acknowledge that it may give relief to some students—we recognise the numbers in the chamber; it will be passed—we urge the Labor Party, should they enter government after the next election, to seriously reconsider their position on PELS. If they are committed to income contingent loans-type systems, perhaps they could model a postgraduate system along the lines of HECS that might actually genuinely give more opportunity to those students wanting to pursue postgraduate course work in the current framework. I reassert the Australian Democrats' strong commitment to publicly funded education and, of course, accessible education at all levels, and hence our concern with any form of fees and charges, once again acknowledging that this may bring some relief but it is not a good enough response. We expect more from this government, particularly in those key disciplines to which I have referred.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-08-29,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 and to remind the Senate that this is a reintroduction of a change in the way in which postgraduate education will be offered to people around this country. It reintroduces the postgraduate education loans scheme which was previously introduced into the Senate through the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001.
As we know, when that bill was introduced some months ago, it was an omnibus bill which sought to incorporate a number of other measures, including measures in that bill to fund schools. It was an adjustment to the SES funding. It was to look at establishment grants and it was money for literacy and numeracy. When the omnibus bill was introduced and debated in this Senate—if I remember rightly, in the early hours of the morning in the last week of June—it was the first time that a bill had been introduced into the Senate that included a combination of higher education and schools funding activities. 
The Australian Labor Party and the Democrats objected to a number of measures in that bill, and to the way in which this government tried to sneak through some of those provisions by wrapping that bill up in a nice neat little parcel, pretending they could disguise its contents in that way. That bill was rejected by the Senate and the Senate made the government split the bill into its three separate areas. We are dealing tonight with the second of those bills. Last week in this place we dealt with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001, which looked at the literacy and numeracy funding aspects of that bill.
This is a bill which predominantly seeks to reintroduce the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, as it has now become known throughout the industry. The PELS scheme is intended to provide loans to Australian students for non-research postgraduate courses. These loans will cover the full fee and will be repaid through the tax system in the same way as the HECS debts. I sit on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and today we had a look at the reintroduction of this bill. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee made comments this morning in its meeting that this is just another one of those ways in which a government seeks to use the tax system, through the students providing their tax file number, as a gateway into ensuring that this loan is paid back.  
It was the view of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee this morning that there are occasionally times when this is needed, and there is probably no other way in which to assess and monitor the repayment of these loans, but we did note that, when the tax file number system was first used and introduced into this parliament, there was a guarantee that that would be a one-off and it would never be used again in that way. But we have gradually seen over the years—and members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee this morning made comment about the fact—the way in which the tax file system is gradually being used more and more by governments. Nevertheless, we know that the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme will provide around $995 million in loans over five years and it is anticipated that it will assist around 240,000 students. The planned start date is 1 January next year.
This bill provides me with an opportunity once again to talk about the chronic state of the higher education industry in this country. I am a member of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee currently conducting an inquiry into the higher education system in this country and looking at whether universities have the capacity to meet Australia's future needs. On 17 July at a committee hearing in Sydney, we had that classic statement from Professor Ian Chubb that this was a sector that was `in crisis'—his words, not mine. This admission by Professor Ian Chubb, representing the peak body in this country, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, was alarming proof on their part that Australia's higher education system was in serious decline.
He provided evidence to the committee that the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee had some serious concerns and reservations about what was happening in that industry in this country. They are concerned that, of the $2.9 billion promised by this government for investment in higher education and research, under this bill 60 per cent of that will not be provided until at least year 4 or 5 of the plan—that is, the Backing Australia's Ability plan. This bill emanates from that statement in January and, while that statement does—as I say—commit to $2.9 billion, most of that money is not realised until the end years of that plan.
Commonwealth funding in the higher education sector has fallen every year under this government, under this Prime Minister and under Minister Kemp's oversight of this area. For example, in 1996 the funding for this sector was $4.875 billion. By 2002 that funding will have reduced to $4.223 billion. So, in total, we have seen nearly $3 billion slashed from public funding for Australia's universities since this government came into office in 1996.
In addition to that, we have seen $2 billion taken from incentives for private research and development. This adds up to a record $5 billion taken from universities and from private research, development and incentives, $5 billion from the higher education sector since this government came to office in 1996; yet the government had the audacity to announce an innovation statement in January known as Backing Australia's Ability after they had ripped the spine out of Australia's higher education system during the first four years of office. So it is no wonder that the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee admitted to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee conducting an inquiry into what is happening in higher education that this system is in crisis. What did Professor Chubb have to say during that week in Sydney? He said things like there had been a slow and steady decline in funding—we know that, as the evidence is there—and that universities had been forced to substitute public funds with private funds. In the inquiry, we have heard evidence time and time again of  universities establishing private arms, private operations, or even private universities in the case of Melbourne IT Ltd. Evidence has been gleaned through this inquiry that in order to establish those private arms—which is done to attract more students—public funds are being used to substitute for those operations. 
The Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee went on to say that any assistance to pay salaries for the staff is appalling. The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 provides $27.6 million in 2001 to fund pay rises for academic staff at universities—universities which have met the requirements of the government's workplace reform program. I remind the Senate of the workplace reform program, which was released back in 1999 by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp. It was first mooted in Minister Kemp's well-known and renowned leaked cabinet document that this government would provide two per cent in funding to universities that signed up to certain conditions in their workplace bargaining operations. In other words, if universities, during renegotiations of their enterprise agreements, could sign on to at least nine of the 14 conditions, they were entitled under the workplace reform program to get assistance with staff salaries. 
We know now that the National Tertiary Education Union Australia has taken this government to court. The union is trying to prove that the government have breached their own Workplace Relations Act 1996 because the government are coercing universities to sign on to at least nine out of 14 conditions of service—conditions that should be incorporated into enterprise bargaining agreements and conditions that may not even be in a log of claims provided by the universities or by the unions but conditions that the universities are forced to look at and will have to look at. Because the sector is being starved of funds to assist university salaries, the universities will have no option, and have had no option, but to look at these conditions and try to incorporate them into their enterprise bargaining agreements. The National Tertiary Education Union is in court trying to prove that that act in itself has the government breaching its own Workplace Relations Act.
What hypocrisy this is on behalf of the government. They trumpet flexibility in the workplace and they try and trumpet the idea that workplaces should be entertaining enterprise bargaining negotiations on a case-by-case basis. Members opposite stand up on the other side of this chamber and lambast the Australian Labor Party for supporting, in particular, pattern bargaining where there is a demonstrated case that that should be happening. On one hand, they criticise the use of pattern bargaining and coercion by the unions but, on the other hand, they believe that it is okay for them to say to their universities, `Here's a bucket of money to help you pay for salary supplementation, but you are going to get that money only if you can prove to us that you have nine out of these 14 conditions in your enterprise bargaining agreement.' If that is not pattern bargaining, what is? If that is not coercion, what is? I say to the National Tertiary Education Union: good on you for trying to prove that this government have breached their own Workplace Relations Act. On the face of it, it would certainly seem to those people who have any knowledge of industrial relations that that is the case.
Let me go back to the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee's evidence before the committee. Professor Chubb, on behalf of the AVCC, said that staff are working harder and that resources are diminishing. The question put to us throughout the inquiry was: as universities are public institutions and are classified and valued as public institutions, what is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government if universities are to be held in high esteem and are to be recognised as public universities? 
Standards are being maintained in universities but at the expense of the quality of the experience. This will not last. How much longer can staff and students in those universities, under the funding cuts that the Commonwealth government have inflicted on this sector, exist in overcrowded lecture rooms and with the underresourcing of libraries? We heard time and time again during this inquiry that university libraries have up to $1 million less each year to spend on resources. Equipment is outdated not only in computer areas but also in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science and engineering. We have a chronic situation that is turning into a bottleneck. 
No doubt the current policy position needs to be reversed. That has been said to us time and time again by academics, by the vice-chancellors, by postgraduate students and by students in the sector. In fact, it is interesting to note that per student the Singapore government funds the Singapore university four times the amount of any university here in Australia. The university system is under strain and really can no longer be expected to carry out the function that the Australian public expects. 
Last week, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs made announcements about university places. We had the announcement last Thursday that 2,000 places were to be allocated through the innovation statement—2,000 extra places for maths, science and information technology. And on top of that we had the 670 places that were set aside to be allocated for regional universities in booming economic areas. When I got to the web site and I scanned what was happening around the country, I could not help but notice the spotlight shining on the poor old Northern Territory University once again—the poor second cousin of the higher education industry in this country, which once again is being sorely neglected. This minister has turned his back again on this vital university in Darwin and Palmerston, an area of Australia that is growing faster than any other area. Palmerston is nearly 20 kilometres out of the Darwin CBD and now has a population of 20,000-plus, the fastest growing area in this country. We have a university that is just crumbling under the bad policies of this federal government.
The university tell me that they put in two submissions in the maths, science and information technology area. They were hoping for some extra places, and they got none. They were hoping for some of the 670 places for the regional universities. If the Northern Territory University is not a regional university, perhaps someone could clarify for me what would be. They got none—not two, not five, not 10, minuscule amounts compared to some of the places I see here of 50, 35 and 60. Charles Sturt University got at least 20 places in Dubbo for a regional university. None went to the Northern Territory University. 
The university is currently undergoing a review of its financial situation and operations, a review that is being conducted by KPMG, supported by the Commonwealth government and the former Northern Territory government. I am sure the new Northern Territory government will continue this support of the Northern Territory University. In the meantime, the NTU misses out again.
If we did an analysis of what has been happening in higher education, we would see that Commonwealth direct funding for universities in 2002 will be $652 million less than it was in 1996. Without these funding cuts, the Northern Territory University would have 494 more places than it currently does. Not only does the Northern Territory University have to keep struggling without any assistance or recognition by the Commonwealth government, and be down 494 places because of cuts by this government since 1996, but, when there is a bucket of places out there to assist this university, it gets not one zack, zilch, zero. It gets nothing to assist it in its growth and its development.
We have in this country a situation where this government has turned its back on the higher education sector. There is a deliberate policy of privatising the university sector. I just wish the minister would come clean and be honest about that instead of pretending that everything is fine and that we do value public institutions. The announcement last week confirms what every Territorian knows: that it is time for this government to provide a clear direction, particularly for regional universities. It is time for this government to restore public funding and to restore in the community—particularly in the Northern Territory—confidence that this government wants a university in the Top End of Australia and is prepared to inject the funds and inject the places that this university deserves. ",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2001-08-29,"—In rising to speak on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, I must say that the thing that has somewhat confused me is what the government want to do with education. They talk about innovation and education. Innovation in itself is something that this government do not seem capable of understanding or implementing in any bill that they put before this Senate. 
We need to be innovative if we are to move ahead in the new millennium that we face and to give our young people opportunities to use to the maximum our universities and higher education institutions. We need, too, to ensure that people who are involved in postgraduate studies, people who are involved in taking us through higher education and contributing to the nation in the future, have the opportunity to properly go about their studies, not fearing what this government is putting to them in the form of fees and restrictions to numbers. 
I was somewhat taken by the submissions by Professor Chapman. In particular, he argued that the subsidies implicit in the PEL scheme will reduce the effective cost of students. He said this will increase the demand for postgraduate courses, which in turn will lead to pressure for universities to increase nominal fees. As the same tendency will apply to all universities, competitive pressures are likely to diminish the likelihood of fee increases. 
In Whyalla, where I live, we have a university campus. It is a campus of the University of South Australia. At that campus, they are struggling with their allocation of fees and their ability to compete in attracting students from overseas and from other states. Yet they offer some very valuable and worthy education streams. They are constricted by their funding levels and the requirements put on students through the loan repayments schemes. I think this is something that needs to be addressed, if we are to move forward into this new millennium we have just entered. If we are being truly innovative in what we are trying to do in a world that is changing around us so quickly, with new technology, with a lot of energy being put into information technology, as far as funding for universities goes we are not moving in the manner in which we should be moving. 
Professor Chapman identified three possible policy responses to what is being put: capping the total amount a student can borrow, capping the fee levels, or introducing a discount for up-front payments. All have merit, and we should examine each very thoroughly, but the cutting of Commonwealth funding for universities by $3 billion since 1996 does not go very far to assist with any of these alternatives to allow us to become the innovative and highly educated nation we need to be. We are isolated. We need the assistance of government in the area of universities. The whole idea of innovation in education is something we need to examine very thoroughly.
The government has adopted the least desirable approach to dealing with the question of payments. I think what hurts so many people in the higher education sector is the fact that the government, rather than looking at the best option, took the option that suited them better, without giving any real consideration to what our universities can deliver and what is in the best interests of university education for our young people and those who are doing postgraduate education.
By cutting funding to universities by $3 billion since 1996, the government has reduced the number of places by some 81,500. I think the amendment that was put forward by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition is one that should be supported. It is unlikely to be supported by the government, but I think the rider that Senator Carr put on that amendment encapsulated all the nasties that can be found within the bill we are debating. The amendment takes in four very important components, adding the phrase, `but the Senate condemns the Government for damaging Australian universities through massive funding cuts'. That is not just Geoff Buckland or Kim Carr saying that; that is what the universities are saying. They are saying that they have been damaged by the funding cuts. The government has overseen the reduction of 3,278 enrolments of Australian university students in the year 2000 alone. Nothing good can be said for a government that has the audacity to reduce the number of students by a grand total of 3,278, while cutting the number of research training places by 3,336 and cutting HECS postgraduate course work places by 60 per cent since 1996. To call it innovative is a joke. This Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 is incorrectly named by suggesting innovation and education; there is no innovation at all in the government's intentions. Its innovation was to cut funding to save money, once again dudding the universities of Australia. It is no wonder that the universities are so openly critical of the manner in which the government is handling this very sensitive issue. It is handling it with no thought to the future and with no thought to the work that is done in higher education facilities that contribute so much to the nation to which we belong. 
The extra funding for research and higher education was the subject of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act 2001, which was introduced on 7 June this year and assented to on 18 July. Subsequently, the government has introduced the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, which contains the school funding provisions of the original bill, and this bill, which deals with PELS, student debt and electronic communications. The bills were split, and that is a bit of a victory for the Labor Party, because it clearly shows that the government is not capable of getting its own legislation through, unless it does some fancy backward footwork. The Labor Party can hold its head very high here, and I think the amendment condemning the government's actions for damaging universities is one that is properly focused.
The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 contains two new funding measures that will provide an additional $39.35 million for higher education grants in 2001-03, increases to universities' operating grants of $24.589 million in 2001 and $2.499 million in 2002 to reflect new estimates of expenditure under the Higher Education Workplace Reform Program and an additional $6.131 million for superannuation expenses in 2002-03 to cover the Commonwealth's liability from the Victorian government's Beneficiary Choice Program, but it does not quite equate to the $3 billion that has been taken out of the system since 1996—there is a bit of a deficit there. This government stands condemned for overall reducing the contribution it makes to our university education scheme.
The workplace reform program provides $259 million over three years to fund pay rises for university staff if the universities implement sufficient reforms in workplace relations arrangements, management and administration. That is really a bit of a bribe: `You will get the money, but'—and it is the `but' that counts here—`you must implement significant reforms in workplace relations arrangements.' How can you do that properly if, in fact, the workplace relations reforms need to be worked through with the staff? Even by doing that, the $259 million is insufficient to properly reward those universities that can make changes. It is, in fact, quite discriminatory against the smaller universities and the smaller campuses that cannot make the changes that can be made in the bigger institutions that can attract far more overseas students to their campuses. 
So when the government talk about the workplace reform program providing additional money to universities, they are doing it only as a bit of the threat: `You have to make significant changes.' Many of those changes will mean cuts in staffing numbers, cuts in programs and cuts in the amount of work and money that can be set aside for research programs to be carried out by postgraduate and other university staff. So there is nothing in this bill at all that does very much for the credibility of this government.
Whilst we may be supporting the second reading of the bill, with of course the amendment moved by Senator Carr, I think it is very difficult for some of us to swallow that there is discrimination against the smaller campuses in their ability to offer true and professional university education for our young people and those wishing to go on with their education in later years. The last five years have seen an expansion of total non-overseas fee paying postgraduate students. It has grown from 10,839 equivalent full-time student units in 1995 to 24,000 equivalent full-time student units in 2000—an increase of 129 per cent. These students now constitute about a quarter of postgraduate places. But again that is nothing to be overly proud of. 
The most popular courses for postgraduate fee payers are coursework masters programs and postgraduate diplomas. The full-time duration of these courses is generally one to 1½ years for a masters degree and one year for a graduate diploma. The most popular subjects at the moment—and I suppose these are ones for which the universities cannot plan too far ahead because they are cyclic in their nature—are business, economics and law, followed by health, science, maths and computing. Last year, I was interested to be talking to one of the scientists, who is also a mathematician, from the Adelaide University. It is a crying shame that young people are moving away from maths as a preferred subject to study. Much of that can be because of the availability of courses with a genuine input from the government and the fact that it is not the sexiest course to be pursued by many of the young students today. It is one of those courses that needs the most attention, but attracting young people into the areas of maths and computing is not as easy as it could be.
Only just a few years ago I had personal experience of this with my son. He was very keen to study law and thought that that would be the way to go—and that is where I come back to it being a very cyclic thing—but, after talking to a number of solicitor and barrister friends of ours and being counselled by his school counsellor, he found that it was not in fact the way to go. By the time he would have finished—which would have been last year—there would have been an overload of young people looking for positions in legal firms where they could get a start, so he changed his career prospects and went into information technology. Again, that can go for so long.
I think the government are only pretending to be innovative, because I do not think they understand what innovation is. If they are serious, I think the government would in fact have been a little more forward thinking and made genuine funding available to the universities so that people are not faced with these great fees at the end of their studies. This bill, whilst it has a lot going for it—and I do not think it has everything going for it; it has quite a lot going for it in that there are some improvements—does miss the mark by not dealing with what has already been taken out of the system by this government since it has been in office. For those reasons, I would certainly be supporting the amendment put forward by Senator Carr.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2001-08-29,"—It really is quite striking that the Labor Party should be adopting the opposition it does to the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 when the very point of the legislation is to improve access to advance equality of opportunity amongst students wishing to study for postgraduate degrees. At the moment, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is no provision for a Commonwealth subsidy by way of an interest free loan for students who wish to undertake postgraduate degrees. The very purpose of this legislation is to provide such a subsidy broadly on the model of the HECS scheme. The HECS scheme, as has been pointed out, was an initiative of the Hawke Labor government. The PELS scheme, which will extend similar principles to assist postgraduate fee paying students, merely takes up that same principle and applies it in substantially similar terms for the benefit of postgraduate students. I ask rhetorically: what is wrong with that? How can one possibly object to a scheme which provides a benefit for people wishing to study for a postgraduate degree and which gives them an entitlement that will improve their access to those degree courses where no such entitlement, no such facilitation of access, exists at the moment? 
It really beggars belief that, for all the rhetoric with which our Labor Party friends so often entertain us about equality and equality of opportunity, they often set their faces dead against those very principles. What do you say, Labor senators, to the student who today may wish to pursue a postgraduate degree and who may wish to improve their qualifications above the undergraduate degree level but who, under current arrangements which this government inherited from the previous Labor governments, has to pay a full fee component and has no assistance from the Commonwealth and who may for that reason be unable, because of their financial circumstances, to afford it? What do you say, Labor senators, to that student when you are setting your face against a proposal that would give that student an interest free loan not repayable until an unspecified date in the future and contingent upon capacity to repay at that time in the future and that will enable them to pursue that postgraduate course? If you support the HECS scheme, as presumably you do because your government introduced it, why do you deny the application of a similar benefit, structured on a similar method, for the benefit of postgraduate students? The Labor Party's position, it seems to me, with great respect to them, is almost incoherent. 
Let me, if I may, run quickly through the broad principles of this legislation. Its principle purpose is, as we know, to create an income contingent loans scheme for fee paying postgraduate coursework students. The scheme, which will be called the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme—or PELS—was announced by the government in the Backing Australia's Ability statement, a statement which, I might interpolate to say, was the greatest single investment in higher learning and research in one single policy initiative ever taken by any Australian government. That was an achievement of the Howard government. And now to enable more good postgraduate students to come into the system who for reasons of economic disadvantage may hitherto have been prevented from coming into the system, we are providing the support to enable them to take advantage of the Backing Australia's Ability policy. Among other features of the legislation, the bill will give the minister the discretion to cap the total amount of indebtedness that an individual is able to accrue in aggregate under the HECS scheme, the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme and the proposed Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme.
May I explain the rationale for that. The experience throughout the life of HECS has been of many students incurring debts far beyond their capacity to repay, even when they reach the income threshold in the later years of their career. As a prudent measure, the legislation enables a cap to be placed on the extent to which students, many of whom of course are inexperienced in the management of their own financial affairs, are exposed to debt under the scheme. It is a protective and a beneficial measure.
Among other things, the legislation allows higher education institutions to accept electronic communications, including an electronic signature, consistent with the requirements of the Electronic Transactions Act, and to elect to communicate electronically with students without seeking the student's agreement, provided the student has access to the appropriate technology and services. I think we all know, and I do not understand this to be controversial, that one of the greatest innovations in Australian higher education in recent years has been the explosion—not just the expansion but the explosion—of online services. I recently had the opportunity to visit in my own state the University of Southern Queensland, based in Toowoomba. The University of Southern Queensland is not only a national leader but a world leader—arguably the world leader—in distance education and in the provision and delivery of courses, not just within Australia but internationally, online and by electronic means. Last year that university was awarded the gold medal of the International Institution for Distance Education as being the most advanced and successful practitioner and deliverer of distance education in the world. That is something that Australia, and in particular my state of Queensland, can be proud of. It is the provision of facilities in that manner, the provision of facilities online, that is one of the many features of higher education that this legislation is designed to facilitate.
The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 provides for the variance of the maximum amount of financial assistance payable to higher education institutions in 2001 to reflect revised estimates of planned expenditure under the Higher Education Workplace Reform Program. The bill also provides for the variation of the maximum amount of financial assistance payable to higher education institutions in 2002 and 2003 to reflect revised estimates of the Commonwealth's overall superannuation liability resulting from the introduction of the beneficiary choice program in Victoria. 
The last few features of the legislation that I have mentioned are, of course, not the core or centre of the legislation. The core of the legislation is an equity provision, the provision where none existed before of a scheme for interest-free loans to enable students to undertake postgraduate study. As I said before, and it cannot be said often enough, how can the Australian Labor Party oppose an equity measure? How can they in all conscience oppose a measure that opens the doors of postgraduate learning to all Australians, irrespective of wealth, financial circumstances or financial disadvantage? It enables people who want to take postgraduate courses to undertake those courses and fully indemnify the cost with an interest-free loan, a subsidy—there is no interest of course—and the principal is not even repayable until there is a capacity to repay in later years in the student's career when they have an income level commensurate with the capacity to make the repayments.
In the minutes remaining to me, I want to turn more broadly to the question of the Howard government's commitment to the higher education sector in this country. I speak as a member of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee, which is, as honourable senators would be aware, currently conducting a major set of hearings into the funding of Australia's public universities. The statement we heard from Senator Buckland earlier in the evening that university revenues have fallen during the life of the Howard government is simply false. It is not even correct to say that the Commonwealth contribution to the operating grant of Australia's universities has fallen during the life of the Howard government.
The position is that during the life of the Howard government the Commonwealth's university operating grants have remained stable in real terms at around $5.2 billion in constant prices. What has also occurred—and I suggest that in this we see the germination of a real revolution in Australian tertiary education—is the growth of funding from additional sources so that today Australian universities are enjoying record real revenues from all sources, not just from Commonwealth grants, in the sum of $9.5 billion this year, an increase of $1.24 billion in their revenue from all sources when the Labor Party last controlled the education portfolio. Why is this? The reason is that more and more revenue flowing to universities is being generated from collaborative research partnerships with the private sector and other private sources of university funding. In the Senate higher education inquiry we have heard so much evidence from universities, from industry and from academics from overseas universities that has tended to suggest that there is a great untapped potential in the university sector for revenue streams generated from private capital.
We have heard evidence of the economic miracle in Ireland—we heard this recently from one of our witnesses at our Sydney hearings—which has largely been driven by the Irish universities. That, in turn, has largely been driven by the establishment of collaborative research partnerships between industry and university faculties which have driven the Irish economy and have provided a golden age among Irish universities.
We have also heard evidence about the elite American universities, of which perhaps—and I have said this in the Senate quite recently in the debate on other legislation—Stanford University is the outstanding example. The great American universities, particularly in their science, applied science and engineering faculties, are long accustomed to collaborative partnerships with private capital, with private sector laboratories and private companies which have poured many hundreds of millions of dollars into individual American universities and underwritten financially huge swathes of university faculties in the elite American universities, Stanford in California being an outstanding example of that, of which our committee heard much evidence. 
Australian universities are yet to accommodate themselves to the culture of collaborative partnerships with the private sector. They are yet to accommodate themselves to the culture that recognises that much of the great research and development work is done not in universities but in private laboratories. If one can marry the two, there are not only real synergies but tremendous opportunities for increasing the revenue flowing to the university sector from those partnerships.
Some bureaucrats—and, indeed, some vice-chancellors, I am sorry to say—in Australian universities are still locked into the old mind-set of dependency exclusively upon Commonwealth grants. That cannot continue. It cannot continue to be the case that, when one has rich opportunities for revenue streams from private capital, rich opportunities for revenue streams from the philanthropic sector, rich opportunities for revenue streams, for instance, from private laboratories and elite private research facilities, Australian universities turn their backs on the opportunities to grow increasing proportions of their funding from those sources and maintain this welfarist dependency so that they are maintained almost exclusively by Commonwealth grants.
There is so much controversy about Australian higher education, but we do well to remind ourselves that there are a number of things, a number of aspirations, that most parties in this chamber have in common. That is why it surprises me so much that the Labor Party would oppose an equity measure like this bill. We all are proud of our universities. We all believe that they ought to aspire to excellence both in teaching and in research. We all believe that universities should have more, not less, revenue to enable them to embrace more, not fewer, students to engage in more, not fewer, research projects. We all believe that the burden on students has to be kept as low as feasible. In particular, the burden on students has to be kept low so that any student, irrespective of the modesty of their economic circumstances, can aspire to and can earn the best education this country has to offer.
Notwithstanding the commonality of view between the government and the opposition on those three principles, we sadly still see this mind-set, as in so many things, sadly, the Labor Party stands for, the product of a blinkered social vision, which regards the introduction of private capital as something to which they ought to evince the deepest hostility and suspicion—the introduction of private capital as an additional revenue source for university teaching to be an evil thing, a corrupt thing, something that will deflect universities from the purity of their scholastic pursuit. We hear this all the time in particular from Senator Carr, whose ideological blinkers are perhaps more obvious that those of most.
What a tragedy it would be if, because of the dated, blinkered ideology and dogmatism of the Labor Party, Australian universities were to be mediocritised. What a tragedy it would be if they were to be deprived of the opportunity to aspire to the kind of excellence which European universities, universities in North America and, increasingly, Australian universities too have been able to embrace by embracing collaborative research partnerships with the private sector and bringing onto their revenue streams more and more private capital. What a tragedy it would be if, as a result of the Australian Labor Party's opposition to this legislation, Australian universities were unable to provide equality of opportunity and freedom of access to postgraduate courses to the best and the brightest of our students, if the best and the brightest of our students—supported through their undergraduate studies through HECS, the Labor Party initiated scheme—were then to be denied the opportunity to reach their own level of excellence as postgraduate students because they could not afford it.
It is to address that problem—essentially, as I said at the start, an equity problem—that this legislation has been introduced by the Howard government: to guarantee that no Australian student who wants to undertake postgraduate study, no matter how modest their resources may be, is denied the opportunity of doing so and thereby contributing to this nation's pursuit of excellence.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-08-29,"—I rise also to participate in this discussion on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001. Senators will remember that this bill originally came into the house as the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. I think it was a very good decision of the Senate—albeit made in the very early hours of the morning—that the mishmash of legislation that was contained in that bill originally was not appropriate.
Senators will remember that we eventually broke that bill into four parts that covered a range of issues. It is interesting to note that that bill originally contained ARC funding measures. It also had the section of the legislation that we are dealing with tonight—that is, the PELS legislation—as well as schools literacy and numeracy and the states grants capital works legislation. They were all compiled and rolled into one omnibus bill, which I do not think allowed for true debate of the variety of education issues that were packaged in it.
The government agreed with the Labor Party at that time and decided to break the bill into its separate parts. We have dealt with some of those pieces of legislation already, the literacy and numeracy section and the ARC bill, but there are two to go. One is the legislation we are dealing with tonight on PELS, and tomorrow I understand—maybe it will not happen, given the events of this evening—that the states grants bill to do with capital works funding is on the list for debate. This bill, which I know Senator Carr will talk at length about—not at length but rather in detail about later in the discussion—
—And at length.
—At length as well. We know that Senator Carr always has lots to say about education, and we value the contribution that he makes. But we have moved an amendment to the bill tonight to add these words:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate condemns the Government for damaging Australian universities through massive funding cuts, and reducing opportunities for Australian undergraduate and postgraduate students, in particular by:
	(a)	cutting Commonwealth funding for universities by $3 billion since 1996, thereby reducing student places by 81,500;
	(b)	overseeing a reduction of 3,278 enrolments of Australian university students in 2000;
	(c)	cutting the number of research training places by 3,336; and
	(d)	cutting HECS postgraduate coursework laces by 60% since 1996”.
This evening I want to address my remarks essentially to the second reading amendment. Since 1996, over $3 billion—that is a lot of money—has been stripped from higher education in Australia. Whilst this is a money bill—it does contain some funds—it does very little to peg back the attack that has been made not only on young people but on higher education per se in our country. This year is the first in a decade that we have seen the numbers of Australian students in higher education fall. That simple fact alone is something that this government has to recognise it is directly responsible for. 
The other statistic that I find particularly disturbing is the fact that this year is the first one ever in which indigenous participation in higher education has fallen—and there is a direct reason for that. No only have the Abstudy rules been changed but there has been a lessening of people's capacity to participate comfortably in an education system that is under so much stress that indigenous people, who do not naturally move towards higher education, are not being encouraged to be part of the education system.
Perhaps I could just digress for a moment. Indigenous leaders in our nation are saying a lot about what education means to their participation in our country. Noel Pearson, for example, is saying that the way forward for people on Cape York Peninsula is through their having good education. Education does not stop in grade 7, as it does for many people who live on Cape York Peninsula. Education hopefully will go more and more to year 12 for those young people, especially since the state government is looking at some innovative secondary education programs on the western part of Cape York Peninsula. But for indigenous people to truly participate in our community and our society they need to have access to higher education. It is a true indictment of this government that indigenous enrolments in higher education for the first time in history have fallen. 
The government talks about research and education in its Backing Australia's Ability statement. But unfortunately this bill is simply make-up—it is Max Factor. It does little at all to remedy the cuts of over $3 billion that we have had in the last 5½ years. But I can understand why we have a bill like this at the moment. We know that we are probably less than three months out from an election. We also know that people in Australia know that their higher education system is suffering. So there had to be a response from this government. This government has brought in this piece of legislation in an attempt to salve that wound—to say to the Australian community, `Yes, we do care about education.' I am sorry, but the people in the education sector and the parents of those young people who are in higher education will not be duped by such a poor go at remedying the hurt that has occurred.
This bill apparently is about postgraduate places and research, and the government, as I said, in its innovation statement is talking about their benefits. The reality is that it is reducing and continuing to reduce research training places. The recent white paper on research and research training places said that 3,500 places had been lost across Australia. We know that, of all of them, regional universities have been hit the hardest. For example, Ballarat has lost 41 per cent of its research places and James Cook University in my part of Queensland has lost 20 per cent of its places. The new places that have been announced recently do not make up in any way for these losses. As I said earlier, with these recent announcements not only of the earlier issue but also of the places in regional universities, the government made a great fanfare of telling us about how it is caring for regional universities. I am sorry, but that is also politically driven. We know that this government has recognised that regional and rural Australia is not as enamoured of it as a government as it used to be and that there had to be a little bit of pork-barrelling in that area as well. I am sorry, but country people are not that silly.
The big cuts of 1996 happened right across the board—we all know that—but there were 21,000 university places lost in 1996. Universities had to respond in some way and they responded by cutting differentially the number of postgraduate places. This was most evident in postgraduate course work in the humanities, the arts and the general sciences. While a lot of focus in our community is on the technical and on the vocationally based, it is these general subjects, especially in the postgraduate area, that lead on to greater and greater knowledge and understanding. As a humanities student myself, I am disturbed that we are not valuing the humanities, the arts and the general sciences as much as the vocationally based learning and training that we are doing now.
I would like to share with the Senate some statistics which I think are quite relevant to this debate. In 2000 in Queensland there were 100,213 actual university places. There are 14,643 people who should be in universities today but are not because of the cuts in 1996—14,000 young people who could have been given a higher education but, because of those cuts and the continual inability of the government to remedy that situation, were not. We have now heard that next year the government is generously going to provide the state of Queensland with 825 places! We as a state welcome that—of course we do; it would be silly not to—but it is a little disappointing when you know that 14,643 could have been given a university education. It is no wonder that people who understand the education issue are very concerned.
I would like to move to James Cook University based in Townsville and Cairns. The actual number of students at James Cook at the moment is 8,576. There are 1,253 people who could have had an education at James Cook University had this government maintained the funding levels that the former Keating government had in 1996. The government is going to reimburse the people of North Queensland: it has recognised that there has been a loss and it is going to give us 125 places at our university. Once again we welcome it, but really when you compare 125 to 1,253 and recognise that that is about 10 per cent you realise the damage that that has done to our community in North Queensland. 
In the remaining time that I have, I would like to talk about the role of regional universities in regional areas. In the mid-1980s, James Cook University was based only in Townsville, although it did have some outreach capacity, training teachers in both Mackay and Cairns. A group of community members in our city decided that it wanted a university because it could see the value of it. In the campaign to get a university based in Cairns that I was part of in the mid-1980s we talked about why we would need a university and what value a university would bring to a city like Cairns. We recognised that, by having a university in your city, you can actually build capacity within your own community, that leadership is developed through learning and that there is an ability for a community to work together, to plan together and to form a vision. There was also a group of people who put a submission to an inquiry at the time that said, `We want to keep our young people in our region. We want our young leaders to stay in a regional community like Cairns.' In particular, we recognised that many young women, especially women of migrant families, were not encouraged to attend higher education, because they would leave their community to do so and their families did not support that.
We heard today the Deputy Prime Minister talking about a lot of those things: that regional Australia needs to build capacity, that we need to develop leadership and that we need to plan together to form some vision, especially within regions. If you know that we have lost that many young people—1,253 young people—out of the higher education facility based in Townsville and Cairns, it will put a pretty big dint into our capacity as a community to build that leadership and to plan together.
The campaign that we ran to establish a Cairns campus of the James Cook University was successful and it was established in 1989, I think it was, at the TAFE campus in the city area. Eventually that moved to the Smithfield campus. The effect of having academics and students working in the community of Cairns—a city of 100,000 people—was evident fairly immediately. Very quickly you could see that there was greater engagement, especially by young people, in local issues. We have a number of very significant environmental issues based around Cairns—Cape York Peninsular, the wet tropics area and the Great Barrier Reef—and lots of young people started to become involved and engaged in those issues. The change was very evident and remarkable.
There was increased knowledge brought to local debates. That occurred directly, I believe, out of having our university in the city. After a few years, we saw the benefit of having a university in the city when we started to have our graduates employed locally. A number of courses that the university operated had placements where young people would work in community organisations as part of their course work. I remember a great piece of work that was done when third year students did oral history with older people in our city. That was a great community building exercise. Action research activities were done, especially with community organisations. Over the last few years I have noticed, as I know our community has, that that participation—that reaching out of the university—has actually dissipated. There is more pressure placed on teaching staff to use their time in directly teaching and not in doing that broader education work that teachers are very good at. 
We have had an ongoing enterprise bargaining process at the James Cook University that has resulted, unfortunately, in industrial action. It is one of the only campuses in Australia that has had to resort to industrial action in order to get some wage parity for our lecturing staff. I remember the library opening at the Cairns campus where there was a large demonstration against this government organised by the teachers and the staff in protest of funding cuts to regional universities. Increased numbers of experienced staff are not being replaced on retirement. When a number of very experienced people in our history department—two in particular that I can remember—came to the end of their careers, they were not replaced. As I said, there has been less participation by academics in community life.  
There has been restructuring of departments—this is a very concerning issue—for economic reasons, not educational reasons. The history and politics department has been collapsed into a broader humanities department. The history and politics department was one of the very first departments of the Cairns campus of the James Cook University and something which was very much valued by our community. We have also seen fewer courses offered on the Cairns campus, with students having to undertake a mixture of Cairns delivered courses and distance delivered courses from Townsville. 
Concerningly, courses are increasingly being offered on weekends. Cairns campus has a lot of women students and this weekend option for course lecturing time is forcing students to make choices for the wrong reasons. Mature women students find it very difficult to attend lectures on the weekends due to family responsibilities. I know that there are students who are making choices about their education that are based on their ability to access the course and not their desired learning, and I think that is unfortunate. 
James Cook University is a great university. It is the university that I went to and I am extremely proud of it, but it is a university that is under stress and it is a university that requires recognition of the funding constraints that it is under. It is a university that requires recognition of the quality of people we have as staff. We require recognition of our place in our community so that our university can truly participate in broader community life. I look forward to a time when there will be a government in this nation that will recognise the value of regional universities, and I hope that will be very soon.
