Senator BUSHBY:
  I move:


That the report be adopted.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (11:52):  I move the amendment circulated in the chamber in my name:


At the end of the motion, add ''and in respect of the:


(a) Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 November 2016; and


(b) Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill 2016, the Education and Employment Legislation Committee report by 13 October 2016''.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is now that the amendment moved by Senator Dastyari be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (11:52):  I move the following amendments to Senator Dastyari's proposed amendment:


No. 1—Paragraph (a), omit the paragraph.


No. 2—Paragraph (b), omit “13 October 2016”, substitute “10 October 2016.


In speaking briefly to my amendment as proposed to Senator Dastyari's amendment as proposed to the Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill 2016, what we are seeking is for the inquiry to report at the start of that week, so three days earlier. I would hope that that might be something that the Senate could see its way clear to supporting.


The other aspect of my amendment relates to the proposition for another Senate inquiry in relation to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016. Colleagues who were in this place before the election would be aware that the Senate did have an extensive inquiry into the government's proposed media reform legislation and that inquiry reported just prior to the election. Obviously, I appreciate that there are a number of senators who have joined this place since the election and I appreciate that that is one of the rationales put forward by those opposite for another Senate inquiry. But what I would put to the Senate for its consideration is that the work of the former Senate inquiry into media law is available for all senators, including new senators, for consideration.


If there were to be another Senate inquiry into this legislation, there would not be any new evidence presented by those parties and those organisations who gave evidence at the former Senate inquiry. So all of the evidence that was made by way of submissions is available for the consideration of new senators. All of the Hansard of that Senate inquiry is available for the consideration of all senators. I do not believe that another Senate inquiry going through that formal process would elucidate any issues that have not yet been canvassed. As I indicated earlier, I think that the work of the previous Senate committee is a good and valuable resource for those senators who have recently joined us. All of its work, all of the submissions, all of the Hansard transcripts are available for those senators who have joined us.


Obviously, as a government, we place ourselves in the hands of the Senate chamber but I did think it was important to emphasise just how recently that body of work of the Senate committee had been completed and to make sure that all colleagues are aware that that body of work is available for their perusal. I also know that there will be no shortage of media organisations seeking to make times to catch up with those senators who have recently joined us. There probably is almost no area of policy that has been more inquired into than media law reform. It is an area that has been well traversed. I thought I would make those few comments for the benefit of my colleagues here.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:57):  I foreshadow that I will move the following amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Dastyari:


At the end of the amendment, add, ""and,


(1) in respect of the provisions of the Budget Saving (Omnibus) Bill 2016, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 10 October 2016.


This is a bill that literally has dozens of clauses and amendments in it that need serious review. Some of those have not been considered by this chamber or by a committee inquiry and they deserve very close attention. For example, there are aged care amendments. The energy supplement was an amendment that came in through the 2016-17 budget. We had the ridiculous two-day estimates review where we tried to cram in two weeks of review. We know that is going to have a significant impact on people that are living on Newstart.


There are many other amendments in this Budget Saving (Omnibus) Bill 2016 that community organisations cannot possibly get their heads around, get their submissions in and be able to appear before a Senate committee in the time that the government wants them to. They need adequate time to be able to sit down and look at all the provisions in this omnibus bill. They only saw it this week. There is no way they can get their heads around all those different provisions, particularly as there will be so many stakeholders and there is so much contained in that one bill that the government is trying to ram through. We need adequate time in this chamber to review those provisions. The government cannot run the line that these measures have been reviewed before because many of them were contained in the budget that came through in May, which has never been properly subjected to any proper estimates scrutiny or any proper scrutiny by a Senate committee. It needs adequate time for review. That is why we foreshadow moving this amendment to Senator Dastyari's amendments. I will indicate—and I think Senator Di Natale will make a contribution—that we will be supporting Senator Dastyari's amendments, not the government's amendments, but we will be seeking to amend them further.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (12:00):  I just want to touch on the amendment that was proposed by the Manager of Government Business. When the opportunity comes we will be asking that they be put separately. The part of his amendment that suggested we change the Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill from 13 October to 10 October is, we feel, a reasonable compromise that will allow for that bill to be properly dealt with in coming sessions of parliament. However, we will be insisting on the first part of my amendment—that is, the provision that the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016 be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 November.


I note that Senator Fifield has outlined that, in the past, there has been inquiries or investigations through parliamentary committees for this type of legislation. We are dealing with a brand-new Senate with 11 new crossbench senators. This is a very complex piece of legislation. We want to make sure that ample opportunity is given for a full investigation and a full inquiry into the different parts of this bill and make sure that senators, when coming to vote on these matters, are able to be well informed of the debate and well informed of the specific nature of this bill. The Senate committee inquiry process is the appropriate process to have those questions investigated and those questions explored. And I say this for the newer senators: the suggestion here that we are referring it to the legislation committee does mean that we are sending it to a committee where, in high likelihood, the government will have the numbers. So it is not as if it is anything other than an opportunity to actually have this bill properly investigated and properly looked at.


I also note that Senator Fifield made reference to the report date of 7 November. After this date there will still be three full weeks of Senate sitting. There will be ample opportunity for senators and the Senate to debate this bill.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:03):  I think it is really important to understand what is going on here. What is going on here is that we have a piece of legislation that is going to result in a saving of $6 billion; it is an incredibly complex piece of legislation. For the benefit of the new senators, who have not even had the opportunity to look at this legislation in detail, the legislation involves the abolition of Medicare-funded dental care for young children—something that was negotiated as a result of the 2010 parliament. Medicare-funded dental care to the tune of $1,000 for young children: gone, under this budget savings measure. 


It involves the abolition of the clean energy supplement—something that will hit and target the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. That is something that, again, some of the new senators in this chamber may not be aware of—a billion dollars taken out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. It involves slashed funding for education. There is a budget measure in here that says: if you are on a disability support pension and you have a mental illness, you will have that support removed as a result of you being prosecuted for having committed a crime because you suffer from a mental illness. 


This is a wide-ranging, far-reaching piece of legislation that deserves scrutiny from the crossbench and from the Senate. It is remarkable.


I understand why the coalition would want to see this rushed through the parliament—$6 billion worth of savings; money taken away from renewable energy; money taken away from the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. The Labor Party, who with the Greens helped establish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, are now prepared to see it gutted. For the Australian Labor Party to take away legislation negotiated with the Greens to provide some support through the clean energy supplement to the most vulnerable people in the Australian community, that will be gone. And, of course, with the abolition of the child dental benefits scheme, there will be no more Medicare-funded dental care for young children. 


All this has been done under the cloak of secrecy and done in a week so that we do not have the opportunity for this Senate to interrogate why it is that we as a parliament should be seeking to achieve budget savings on the back of these regressive measures, and measures that take us backwards when it comes to addressing dangerous climate change. This is remarkable.


I call on the Labor Party to ensure that we have the scrutiny that this legislation deserves. This is an ominous sign. While the Labor Party have not said yet whether they will support these measures, the fact that they want them rushed through this Senate and dealt with as a matter of urgency says to me that they were going to join in with the coalition to slash funding for renewable energy and to take money out of the pockets of the most vulnerable people in this community. At a time when we have growing out-of-pocket healthcare costs, they are going to take $1,000 of Medicare-funded dental care from the over 3½ million Australians who are eligible to receive it.


So we urge and we plead with you: reconsider. Give this legislation the scrutiny it deserves. Have some respect for the new crossbenchers so they can properly do their job and interrogate the huge list of savings measures listed in this legislation—$6 billion. 


If you want to balance the budget, there are many other areas where we can do that. Let's take away some of the support that is given in the form of cheap fuel to mining companies. Let's make sure that we deal with negative gearing—and we agree with the Labor Party who indeed have supported our position on negative gearing. Let's ensure that we do not have property investors who are effectively getting subsidies while we see both the major parties wanting to take money away from the most vulnerable people in the community, slash publicly funded dental care and slash funding for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. 


Reconsider your position. Let's extend the time line for this inquiry and let's ensure that this Senate does its job. What we do not need is a rubber stamp from the Labor Party to the coalition allowing them to pass through these regressive and unsustainable measures.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2016-09-01,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:08):  I just want to say a few things here as a crossbencher. I would have hoped that you people over there would have learnt your lesson by now. Things were going to be different this time around, weren't they? Okay, you have got new crossbenchers in this Senate. You have shoved us a great big white folder. How do you think they are feeling right now? 


Give them the time to settle in. Give them the time to learn the ropes—and I want more time on this as well. Don't just go shoving this folder down my throat either. This is not the way we were going to move forward. Right now we are on what? Day 3. Show a bit of integrity and show some bloody respect, because we do not have the staff. We do not have the manning that you have. We want more time. Thank you. 



The PRESIDENT:  I will just let the Senate know exactly where we are. Senator Bushby moved a motion to adopt the Selection of Bills Committee report. Senator Dastyari has moved an amendment to that motion. Senator Fifield has moved amendments to Senator Dastyari's motion. Senator Dastyari has asked if the motion could be split into two questions. So the question now before the chair is that the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to Senator Dastyari's amendment—the first part; that is, paragraph 1—be agreed to. 


I will go through this again. The question before the chair is that paragraph 1 of the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to Senator Dastyari's amendment be agreed to. I am happy to take any points of clarification. I will take Senator Leyonhjelm first.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-09-01,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:10):  I understand Senator Fifield's amendment is simply to delete paragraph one—isn't that right? 



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, but the question is to omit paragraph 1. Senator Dastyari—and it is his right to do so—has requested that I split the question. Senator Fifield's amendment has two elements: paragraph 1, which is to be omitted according to Senator Fifield's amendment; and paragraph 2 is a date change from 13 October to 10 October this year. I will put that question next. Is everyone clear on the question now before the chair? The question now is that paragraph 1 of Senator Dastyari's amendment be omitted. 


Question negatived. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that paragraph 2 of Senator Dastyari's amendment be amended to reflect the date change from 13 October until 10 October this year. 


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Siewert, you foreshadowed you also wanted to amend Senator Dastyari's amendment. My understanding is your amendment is to add at the end of Senator Dastyari's amendment a paragraph, which has been circulated. 

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:12):  I move the following amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Dastyari: 


At the end of the amendment, add: 


(c) Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 10 October 2016.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Just for complete clarity: Senator Dastyari's amendment has been amended by the result of the previous vote, so we are now adding, to the end of the amended version of Senator Dastyari's amendment, the amendment by Senator Siewert. Is everyone clear? 

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:12):  I move the following amendment to Senator Siewert's proposed amendment: 


Omit ''10 October 2016'' and substitute ''13 September 2016''.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to change the date in the amendment moved by Senator Siewert from 10 October 2016 to 13 September 2016 be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"PRESIDENT, The",,2016-09-01,"



The PRESIDENT
 (12:20):  The question now is that the amended motion of Senator Siewert's motion to now amend Senator Dastyari's motion be agreed to. Do I need to go through it again, or is everyone clear on where we are?

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:20):  Mr President, could you please read what the actual motion is that we are voting on?



The PRESIDENT:  I will go through it again: the original question was that Senator Bushby's Selection of Bills Committee report be adopted. There was an amendment moved by Senator Dastyari, then there was an amendment to Senator Dastyari's amendment by Senator Fifield, which has been resolved, that amended Senator Dastyari's amendment. Then Senator Siewert moved a further amendment to Senator Dastyari's amendment and we have just voted, previously, on the amendment by Senator Fifield to change a date in Senator Siewert's amendment. That amendment has now been amended.


That amendment now is seeking to amend Senator Dastyari's amendment. So, in effect, Senator Siewert is seeking to add a paragraph to the end of Senator Dastyari's amendment, and that has been amended by a date change. It is very simple. It reads: 'In respect of the provisions of the Budget Saving (Omnibus) Bill 2016, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 13 September 2016.' That is now going to be added, if the resolution is carried, to Senator Dastyari's amendment to the original motion.


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  We now have a completed amendment by Senator Dastyari. The question is that that amendment, as amended, be agreed to.


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  We now have an amendment by Senator Dastyari that will now amend Senator Bushby's original motion. The question is that amendment be agreed to. 


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is now that the original motion, as amended, be agreed to.


Question agreed to.


Motion, as amended, agreed to.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (11:52):  I move the amendment circulated in the chamber in my name:


At the end of the motion, add ''and in respect of the:


(a) Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 November 2016; and


(b) Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill 2016, the Education and Employment Legislation Committee report by 13 October 2016''.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is now that the amendment moved by Senator Dastyari be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (11:52):  I move the following amendments to Senator Dastyari's proposed amendment:


No. 1—Paragraph (a), omit the paragraph.


No. 2—Paragraph (b), omit “13 October 2016”, substitute “10 October 2016.


In speaking briefly to my amendment as proposed to Senator Dastyari's amendment as proposed to the Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill 2016, what we are seeking is for the inquiry to report at the start of that week, so three days earlier. I would hope that that might be something that the Senate could see its way clear to supporting.


The other aspect of my amendment relates to the proposition for another Senate inquiry in relation to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016. Colleagues who were in this place before the election would be aware that the Senate did have an extensive inquiry into the government's proposed media reform legislation and that inquiry reported just prior to the election. Obviously, I appreciate that there are a number of senators who have joined this place since the election and I appreciate that that is one of the rationales put forward by those opposite for another Senate inquiry. But what I would put to the Senate for its consideration is that the work of the former Senate inquiry into media law is available for all senators, including new senators, for consideration.


If there were to be another Senate inquiry into this legislation, there would not be any new evidence presented by those parties and those organisations who gave evidence at the former Senate inquiry. So all of the evidence that was made by way of submissions is available for the consideration of new senators. All of the Hansard of that Senate inquiry is available for the consideration of all senators. I do not believe that another Senate inquiry going through that formal process would elucidate any issues that have not yet been canvassed. As I indicated earlier, I think that the work of the previous Senate committee is a good and valuable resource for those senators who have recently joined us. All of its work, all of the submissions, all of the Hansard transcripts are available for those senators who have joined us.


Obviously, as a government, we place ourselves in the hands of the Senate chamber but I did think it was important to emphasise just how recently that body of work of the Senate committee had been completed and to make sure that all colleagues are aware that that body of work is available for their perusal. I also know that there will be no shortage of media organisations seeking to make times to catch up with those senators who have recently joined us. There probably is almost no area of policy that has been more inquired into than media law reform. It is an area that has been well traversed. I thought I would make those few comments for the benefit of my colleagues here.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:57):  I foreshadow that I will move the following amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Dastyari:


At the end of the amendment, add, ""and,


(1) in respect of the provisions of the Budget Saving (Omnibus) Bill 2016, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 10 October 2016.


This is a bill that literally has dozens of clauses and amendments in it that need serious review. Some of those have not been considered by this chamber or by a committee inquiry and they deserve very close attention. For example, there are aged care amendments. The energy supplement was an amendment that came in through the 2016-17 budget. We had the ridiculous two-day estimates review where we tried to cram in two weeks of review. We know that is going to have a significant impact on people that are living on Newstart.


There are many other amendments in this Budget Saving (Omnibus) Bill 2016 that community organisations cannot possibly get their heads around, get their submissions in and be able to appear before a Senate committee in the time that the government wants them to. They need adequate time to be able to sit down and look at all the provisions in this omnibus bill. They only saw it this week. There is no way they can get their heads around all those different provisions, particularly as there will be so many stakeholders and there is so much contained in that one bill that the government is trying to ram through. We need adequate time in this chamber to review those provisions. The government cannot run the line that these measures have been reviewed before because many of them were contained in the budget that came through in May, which has never been properly subjected to any proper estimates scrutiny or any proper scrutiny by a Senate committee. It needs adequate time for review. That is why we foreshadow moving this amendment to Senator Dastyari's amendments. I will indicate—and I think Senator Di Natale will make a contribution—that we will be supporting Senator Dastyari's amendments, not the government's amendments, but we will be seeking to amend them further.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2
"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (12:00):  I just want to touch on the amendment that was proposed by the Manager of Government Business. When the opportunity comes we will be asking that they be put separately. The part of his amendment that suggested we change the Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill from 13 October to 10 October is, we feel, a reasonable compromise that will allow for that bill to be properly dealt with in coming sessions of parliament. However, we will be insisting on the first part of my amendment—that is, the provision that the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016 be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 November.


I note that Senator Fifield has outlined that, in the past, there has been inquiries or investigations through parliamentary committees for this type of legislation. We are dealing with a brand-new Senate with 11 new crossbench senators. This is a very complex piece of legislation. We want to make sure that ample opportunity is given for a full investigation and a full inquiry into the different parts of this bill and make sure that senators, when coming to vote on these matters, are able to be well informed of the debate and well informed of the specific nature of this bill. The Senate committee inquiry process is the appropriate process to have those questions investigated and those questions explored. And I say this for the newer senators: the suggestion here that we are referring it to the legislation committee does mean that we are sending it to a committee where, in high likelihood, the government will have the numbers. So it is not as if it is anything other than an opportunity to actually have this bill properly investigated and properly looked at.


I also note that Senator Fifield made reference to the report date of 7 November. After this date there will still be three full weeks of Senate sitting. There will be ample opportunity for senators and the Senate to debate this bill.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:03):  I think it is really important to understand what is going on here. What is going on here is that we have a piece of legislation that is going to result in a saving of $6 billion; it is an incredibly complex piece of legislation. For the benefit of the new senators, who have not even had the opportunity to look at this legislation in detail, the legislation involves the abolition of Medicare-funded dental care for young children—something that was negotiated as a result of the 2010 parliament. Medicare-funded dental care to the tune of $1,000 for young children: gone, under this budget savings measure. 


It involves the abolition of the clean energy supplement—something that will hit and target the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. That is something that, again, some of the new senators in this chamber may not be aware of—a billion dollars taken out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. It involves slashed funding for education. There is a budget measure in here that says: if you are on a disability support pension and you have a mental illness, you will have that support removed as a result of you being prosecuted for having committed a crime because you suffer from a mental illness. 


This is a wide-ranging, far-reaching piece of legislation that deserves scrutiny from the crossbench and from the Senate. It is remarkable.


I understand why the coalition would want to see this rushed through the parliament—$6 billion worth of savings; money taken away from renewable energy; money taken away from the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. The Labor Party, who with the Greens helped establish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, are now prepared to see it gutted. For the Australian Labor Party to take away legislation negotiated with the Greens to provide some support through the clean energy supplement to the most vulnerable people in the Australian community, that will be gone. And, of course, with the abolition of the child dental benefits scheme, there will be no more Medicare-funded dental care for young children. 


All this has been done under the cloak of secrecy and done in a week so that we do not have the opportunity for this Senate to interrogate why it is that we as a parliament should be seeking to achieve budget savings on the back of these regressive measures, and measures that take us backwards when it comes to addressing dangerous climate change. This is remarkable.


I call on the Labor Party to ensure that we have the scrutiny that this legislation deserves. This is an ominous sign. While the Labor Party have not said yet whether they will support these measures, the fact that they want them rushed through this Senate and dealt with as a matter of urgency says to me that they were going to join in with the coalition to slash funding for renewable energy and to take money out of the pockets of the most vulnerable people in this community. At a time when we have growing out-of-pocket healthcare costs, they are going to take $1,000 of Medicare-funded dental care from the over 3½ million Australians who are eligible to receive it.


So we urge and we plead with you: reconsider. Give this legislation the scrutiny it deserves. Have some respect for the new crossbenchers so they can properly do their job and interrogate the huge list of savings measures listed in this legislation—$6 billion. 


If you want to balance the budget, there are many other areas where we can do that. Let's take away some of the support that is given in the form of cheap fuel to mining companies. Let's make sure that we deal with negative gearing—and we agree with the Labor Party who indeed have supported our position on negative gearing. Let's ensure that we do not have property investors who are effectively getting subsidies while we see both the major parties wanting to take money away from the most vulnerable people in the community, slash publicly funded dental care and slash funding for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. 


Reconsider your position. Let's extend the time line for this inquiry and let's ensure that this Senate does its job. What we do not need is a rubber stamp from the Labor Party to the coalition allowing them to pass through these regressive and unsustainable measures.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2016-09-01,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:08):  I just want to say a few things here as a crossbencher. I would have hoped that you people over there would have learnt your lesson by now. Things were going to be different this time around, weren't they? Okay, you have got new crossbenchers in this Senate. You have shoved us a great big white folder. How do you think they are feeling right now? 


Give them the time to settle in. Give them the time to learn the ropes—and I want more time on this as well. Don't just go shoving this folder down my throat either. This is not the way we were going to move forward. Right now we are on what? Day 3. Show a bit of integrity and show some bloody respect, because we do not have the staff. We do not have the manning that you have. We want more time. Thank you. 



The PRESIDENT:  I will just let the Senate know exactly where we are. Senator Bushby moved a motion to adopt the Selection of Bills Committee report. Senator Dastyari has moved an amendment to that motion. Senator Fifield has moved amendments to Senator Dastyari's motion. Senator Dastyari has asked if the motion could be split into two questions. So the question now before the chair is that the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to Senator Dastyari's amendment—the first part; that is, paragraph 1—be agreed to. 


I will go through this again. The question before the chair is that paragraph 1 of the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to Senator Dastyari's amendment be agreed to. I am happy to take any points of clarification. I will take Senator Leyonhjelm first.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-09-01,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:10):  I understand Senator Fifield's amendment is simply to delete paragraph one—isn't that right? 



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, but the question is to omit paragraph 1. Senator Dastyari—and it is his right to do so—has requested that I split the question. Senator Fifield's amendment has two elements: paragraph 1, which is to be omitted according to Senator Fifield's amendment; and paragraph 2 is a date change from 13 October to 10 October this year. I will put that question next. Is everyone clear on the question now before the chair? The question now is that paragraph 1 of Senator Dastyari's amendment be omitted. 


Question negatived. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that paragraph 2 of Senator Dastyari's amendment be amended to reflect the date change from 13 October until 10 October this year. 


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Siewert, you foreshadowed you also wanted to amend Senator Dastyari's amendment. My understanding is your amendment is to add at the end of Senator Dastyari's amendment a paragraph, which has been circulated.

(c) Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 10 October 2016.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Just for complete clarity: Senator Dastyari's amendment has been amended by the result of the previous vote, so we are now adding, to the end of the amended version of Senator Dastyari's amendment, the amendment by Senator Siewert. Is everyone clear?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:12):  I move the following amendment to Senator Siewert's proposed amendment: 


Omit ''10 October 2016'' and substitute ''13 September 2016''.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to change the date in the amendment moved by Senator Siewert from 10 October 2016 to 13 September 2016 be agreed to.

 (12:20):  The question now is that the amended motion of Senator Siewert's motion to now amend Senator Dastyari's motion be agreed to. Do I need to go through it again, or is everyone clear on where we are?

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:20):  Mr President, could you please read what the actual motion is that we are voting on?



The PRESIDENT:  I will go through it again: the original question was that Senator Bushby's Selection of Bills Committee report be adopted. There was an amendment moved by Senator Dastyari, then there was an amendment to Senator Dastyari's amendment by Senator Fifield, which has been resolved, that amended Senator Dastyari's amendment. Then Senator Siewert moved a further amendment to Senator Dastyari's amendment and we have just voted, previously, on the amendment by Senator Fifield to change a date in Senator Siewert's amendment. That amendment has now been amended.


That amendment now is seeking to amend Senator Dastyari's amendment. So, in effect, Senator Siewert is seeking to add a paragraph to the end of Senator Dastyari's amendment, and that has been amended by a date change. It is very simple. It reads: 'In respect of the provisions of the Budget Saving (Omnibus) Bill 2016, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 13 September 2016.' That is now going to be added, if the resolution is carried, to Senator Dastyari's amendment to the original motion.


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  We now have a completed amendment by Senator Dastyari. The question is that that amendment, as amended, be agreed to.


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  We now have an amendment by Senator Dastyari that will now amend Senator Bushby's original motion. The question is that amendment be agreed to. 


Question agreed to. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is now that the original motion, as amended, be agreed to.


Question agreed to.

(D) life insurance policy holders who have been denied justice;


   (ii) it is clear from the breadth and scope of the allegations that the


problems in this industry go beyond any one bank or type of financial institution,


   (iii) the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens, crossbench,


Liberal and Nationals parliamentarians have supported a thorough investigation of the culture and practices within the financial services industry through a Royal Commission, which is the only forum with the coercive powers and broad jurisdiction necessary to properly perform this investigation, and


   (iv) Australia has one of the strongest banking systems in the world,


but Australians must have confidence in their banks and financial institutions, making it necessary to sweep away doubt and uncover and deal with unethical behaviour that compromises that confidence;


(b) the Senate calls on the Prime Minister to request His Excellency the

You would not come with me in June last year—the 24th, I think it was—Senator Dastyari; probably you were lacking leadership from Beijing or something and that is why you would not join me in that appeal.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government does not support a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector, because a royal commission would not benefit consumers or the Australian economy. Whilst the government has proactively sought to reform Australia's financial sector, Labor when in government sat idle and oversaw scandal after scandal. In fact, most of the notable scandals and collapses happened on Labor's watch, when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, including financial planning scandals at the Commonwealth Bank and Macquarie and the collapse of firms such as Trio Capital, Storm Financial and Great Southern. Labor was in government for six years and did not act. Our government has acted. We have delivered the Financial System Inquiry and a stronger regulator with more resources and powers, and we are working on a one-stop shop for consumer complaints.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Under the Constitution, the Australian government has responsibilities for the regulation of both banking and insurance. I want to point out to the chamber and especially to you, Senator Williams—I first, of course, recognise that you have called for a royal commission into financial misconduct for some time, and I respect that—that the banks are now vertically integrated. If we have an inquiry into the banking system, that includes the insurance markets. Most banks own financial services companies, including insurance companies. So the motion put by Labor I support, because it will encompass the areas of your concern. As far as forestry managed investment schemes go, those of us who were on the inquiry who recommended for a royal commission—that would also encompass the banking system, because the banks finance the finance companies and places like Timbercorp. They are all included. I would urge you to support this motion today.


Question agreed to.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (13:58):  Mr President, I seek your advice on a couple of events that have recently taken place in the chamber, and you may want to take this on notice. Firstly, in my time here—10 years—I do not ever recall a Deputy President taking part in a particularly partisan debate. I recognise that the office of Deputy President is not one where the rights of the Senate are curtailed, but I would seek advice as to whether it is appropriate or whether there is a historical precedent for a particularly partisan contribution from the Deputy President. Not only does it maybe breach the expectations of the Deputy President but it also seemed to lack a certain dignity. 


Speaking of a lack of dignity, I would also draw your attention to the contribution by Senator Lambie in which she basically reflected very poorly not only on me but on this side of politics, which was quite shameful. The inappropriateness of her remarks was drawn to her attention and the Acting Deputy President's attention on a number of occasions. I do not recall that Senator Lambie withdrew them, but I would ask you to review the Hansard and deem whether they were parliamentary or unparliamentary. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. I am not familiar with the incidents you are referring to. I will review the record, and I will take whatever appropriate action. But I certainly need to consider those remarks.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Cameron today relating to the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre.


In taking note of Senator Scullion's answers, I note—in words often said by Senator Scullion in answer to questions that I was asking him—there is no malice at all in the questions that I am going to be putting to him again in this period of taking note.


We heard today that the minister was deeply concerned about the issues around the culture of abuse that was seen in the Don Dale centre, but we still do not know, after the answers the minister provided today, just when he became aware of what was going on in that centre. What disturbs me more than anything in this process is that, when we sat in many hours of discussion in the Senate community affairs process, the minister would come in his then role as shadow minister for Indigenous affairs and be fully briefed on every single aspects of Indigenous services that were being taken in the Northern Territory when the Northern Territory government was the Labor government of the Northern Territory. The minister would sit for hours in our committee, asking us chapter and verse about what was going on with expenditure and programs in the Northern Territory at that time. But remember the original processes around what was happening at the centre were at that time, and now this minister says that he really did not know about it and that he was shocked by the Four Corners program.


The Minister for Indigenous Affairs was the opposition minister and more so he is a senator for the Northern Territory, and what was being exposed in the media and in commission reports in the Northern Territory was exactly what was happening at that centre. I have had a look at the media that was being put out in 2015, when the Children's Commissioner put out the report that they did on what was happening in the Territory. There was also the government report at the time, and there were open discussions about individual cases and also the exposed processes that were happening at that centre. That was clearly in debate and discussion. Individual families were coming forward, and the Children's Commissioner at the time was quite clear that there had to be action taken to change the processes and the damage that was occurring at that time.


Now we find out that the senior senator from the Northern Territory, who not only had the long-term responsibility for issues of Indigenous services but also is now the minister for that program, had not had his interest piqued by that process that was going on in the Northern Territory. It defies belief. Today in this place the minister somehow seemed to be able to blame the ABC for not giving him prior knowledge of what was going to occur in the Four Corners program. I do not understand why having a preview of a program was going to provide any more information to the minister from the Northern Territory, who had had open discussion, who had people coming to him, who had discussions with the current Northern Territory government. We know how close Minister Scullion is to the previous Northern Territory government—and we can say that, since last weekend, it is the previous Northern Territory government. We know how closely the minister worked with the ministers of that Country Liberal Party and National Party government in that area. We know how closely he worked on policy. When he came to our Senate committees, consistently talking about issues that should be raised in that area, it seems passing strange that he was not aware of the concerns raised in the community about what was happening at Don Dale.


The good thing now, of course, is that we have a commission process looking into that area. We have strong people who have raised these issues consistently, and we are very relieved that this will be exposed. We can work together on it, but no-one can convince me that this minister was not aware. No-one can convince me that his interest was not piqued, because he did not want his interest piqued. Again I say: no malice, Minister Scullion; no malice.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:11):  I agree with Senator Moore: this is a very serious issue. It is also a very complex issue. It is not a simple issue. No Australian—no-one in the government included—who watched that episode of Four Corners could be anything other than horrified and disgusted at the vision that was included. No-one could watch it and be anything other than appalled and shocked. No-one could be anything other than determined to fix it as soon as possible. That is why the coalition federal government acted as decisively as any in memory to establish very quickly a royal commission and to appoint two very eminent royal commissioners to look into this issue.


I think all senators would agree that the royal commission should be allowed to do its job effectively. I think all senators would agree that the commission should be supported to fully and thoroughly investigate this matter and to propose solutions which will be considered by both the Northern Territory government and the federal government. I think it is important that we recognise, though, that this is not just a recent failure and it is not just a failure of one side of politics or the other. There is a cultural problem in the Northern Territory corrections system; that much is clear. It is a problem which has existed for many years. It has existed under governments of both political persuasions. No-one in the Northern Territory has covered themselves with glory in administering this system.


I do not think that getting to solutions and implementing solutions for this problem are aided, however, by partisan attacks on the federal Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Let's remember that he does not administer the Northern Territory corrections system. He is not responsible for appointing or employing any of the people who were seen in the footage. He is the federal Minister for Indigenous Affairs and, as a result, he takes a great deal of interest in this matter but it is not on his watch that this occurred. It is not his responsibility that this occurred.


The coalition government is committed not just to reforming the Northern Territory criminal justice system in terms of juvenile detention but also to looking at wider, related issues. This is a complex problem and it starts at high rates of Indigenous offending and high rates of Indigenous incarceration. That needs to be addressed in a holistic, systematic way. That is something which probably is going to require extensive legal reform and the goodwill and bipartisanship of all sides of politics, particularly in the Northern Territory. We are committed to assisting in that process. This year alone we are providing $256 million through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy to help improve community safety and address the drivers of Indigenous incarceration. The Prime Minister has also put the issue of transitioning Indigenous people from incarceration to employment—in order to reduce the risk of offending and reoffending—onto the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments. 


Before I conclude, I want to also take a moment to reflect on our colleague Minister Scullion. I do not think anyone in this place would doubt his sincere commitment to the advancement of Indigenous Australians. He has spent more time, more energy and more effort focused on these issues than almost anyone in this chamber, with a very few honourable exceptions. No-one can doubt his passion and his dedication to the advancement of the causes of Indigenous Australians. I think he is very well placed, as a senator for the Northern Territory, as the Indigenous affairs minister. Long before he came into that role, he had a commitment to these issues, and, I suspect, long after he leaves this role and leaves this place, he will still have a long-term commitment to these issues. 


I invite opposition senators who think they have done more on this issue, who think they might have devoted more time on this issue, to tell the Senate about their track record, about their years of commitment and service to this issue. I look forward to hearing how they have done more than Senator Scullion to address these issues, how their commitment is more sincere, how they have spent more time in remote Indigenous communities and how they have spent more time with young Indigenous men and women and talked to them and listened to them about the issues that they face. I very much look forward to Labor senators demonstrating in a partisan way—as they seem to want to handle this issue—that their interest is superior to that of the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion.

Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I, too, rise to take note of the answers from Senator Scullion in response to the questions from Senators Wong, Conroy and Cameron. Senator Paterson is right when he talks about the royal commission being welcomed. This side of politics also welcomed the royal commission when it was announced by the Prime Minister, because it was shocking footage that we saw aired on the ABC's Four Cornersprogram. Anyone who viewed would not soon forget it. But what we heard here in the answers from Senator Scullion was actually more questions that need to be asked, and they have to be answered. Senator Scullion in his responses did not answer the questions that were put to him—and they were very serious questions, regardless of what Senator Paterson said in his contribution to try to paint this as some sort of partisan quest by the Labor Party. That is not the case. This is a very, very serious issue. It goes to what the minister knew about what was happening at Don Dale. It is a very, very serious issue. In the minister's answers, he first sought to blame the ABC for the reason why he could not view the episode. He then sought to blame his department for the reason why he was not fully briefed about the issues— 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He did not. 




Senator Brandis:
  No, he didn't. 




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Yes, he did. The departmental processes were what he talked about—about being given full briefings. What we have learnt through the media—even though we have heard Minister Scullion today make some changes to the story—is that when Mr Turnbull announced the royal commission he said:


This needs a thorough inquiry. We need to move quickly on that, get to the bottom it, and expose what occurred and expose the culture that allowed it to occur and allowed it to remain unrevealed for so long.


The first thing he really needs to do is talk to his own minister, because it is becoming quite apparent that Minister Scullion was aware of what was going on prior to the ABC Four Corners report. 


We have had, since then, a number of different reports that have alleged that Senator Scullion made these comments. These reports are completely at odds with what Senator Scullion said today. Senator Scullion, according to a media report:


… said he ""didn't know anything about"" the allegations prior to last week's episode, last night admitted asking his department for advice about the Don Dale centre in October last year after reading a media report of findings by the NT Children's Commissioner.


That is what he said. That is what has been reported: that he had asked for a brief in October last year and he did nothing about it. It appears that he did nothing about it.




Senator Brandis:
  You are not doing a very good job of not politicising this. 




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Thank you, Senator Brandis, for your help, because you should be one of the people saying to Minister Scullion, 'Why didn't you do anything about it? You knew about it. You asked for a brief. And you just ignored it.' That is exactly what we have seen from Senator Scullion. Nothing. He has just ignored it. We also heard Senator Scullion's response today when he was asked about Professor Calma's comments about Senator Scullion. Let's just hear exactly what Professor Calma, the former social justice commissioner, had to say. He basically said that Senator Scullion is not listening and he needs to consider his own position.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:22):  If this was a strategy by the Australian Labor Party to divert attention from the horrendous difficulty that Senator Dastyari is in at the moment, with his failure to answer very reasonable questions put to him, then it has failed completely. Senator Scullion has been an exemplary Minister for Indigenous Affairs. And, more than being a good minister, I know that Senator Scullion through all of his life has been a great friend of Indigenous people right across Australia but particularly in the Northern Territory. There are allegations being made about Senator Scullion's answering of questions today. I thought he answered every question exactly. He answered the questions that were asked and he gave a bit more information than he was asked for. He indicated clearly the course of events that occurred. 


The allegation is made that somehow Senator Scullion as the minister and as a Northern Territory senator should have been aware of what was happening in this particular centre. As I recall it, this centre was set up by the Northern Territory government when Labor was in charge—I might be wrong, but I think it was when Labor was in charge. They set up this centre. The opposition are accusing Senator Scullion of not knowing what was happening. I wonder aloud: when Senator Peris was a senator for the Northern Territory was she aware of this, and if she was why didn't she raise it, and if she was not aware of it then why don't you blame her the same way that you blame Senator Scullion? Senator Trish Crossin, who was a wonderful senator for the Northern Territory—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Macdonald has the right to be heard in silence. Please respect that right




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I appreciate your protection but I do not really need it. These sorts of things do not ever worry me. Former Senator Trish Crossin, who we all knew and loved in this chamber, was done over by a captain's pick by the leader of the Labor Party.




Senator Brandis:
  She's the greatest waste of space ever to enter this chamber.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am not going into that, Senator Brandis, but I take your interjection. Senator Crossin was a great friend of Indigenous people, and a great friend of all Territorians. Are you suggesting that, because she did not know, she is in some way at fault? What if she did know but did not report it? At least have some consistency in your criticism.


Senator Scullion understands the issues; he understands the portfolio. As I understand it this is an establishment run by the Northern Territory government. Am I wrong? Is that correct? Can someone help me? It is run by the Northern Territory government, so why the Labor Party are attacking a coalition federal minister escapes me a bit, except that it is just a very poor attempt to divert attention from the horrendous position that Senator Dastyari is in because of his failure to disclose money given to him for private debt by some company associated, as I understand it, with the Chinese government. The attack on Senator Scullion was the dampest squib I have ever seen. But that avoids the question of what a significant, careful and caring minister Senator Scullion has been in his portfolio, in his responsibilities for the Indigenous and other people of the Northern Territory. 


I congratulate Senator Scullion on what he has done. I congratulate him on and admire him for his answers to the questions in question time today. As I remarked to my colleague next door to me, I think he is giving too much information—he is answering the question and more. Senator Scullion was quite keen to lay out the facts, and those facts clearly show that he has acted appropriately, as any minister should and would do, and I congratulate him on that.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:27): Madam Deputy President, I acknowledge that this is the first occasion on which you have given me the call. I look forward to your success in your role. Today we have heard a very weak defence from those opposite. We have here a minister who wants the job, who wants the title, but who does not want to take the responsibility. He does not have the skills to take on the job, and that was made very clear in the question that was put forward today citing the remarks of Tom Calma. If you ever need to see an example of the coalition government's dysfunction, division and disarray, you need look no further than its handling of the abuse and the detention of Indigenous juveniles at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in the Northern Territory. The images distributed after the Four Corners investigation, of a hooded youth restrained in his chair, of a young man being rounded up by burly staff who then removed his clothing and of the gassing of inmates, were shocking. They were dangerous incidents. Children were placed in solitary confinement for up to 17 hours. The world looked on in incredulous disbelief that this could happen in Australia in 2016. But what was the Minister for Indigenous Affairs for Australia doing at the time while the rest of the country was looking on? He received a phone call, around 1 pm on the day that the program was to be broadcast, from Ms Meldrum-Hanna. She has tweeted:



I spoke to Scullion's office yesterday lunchtime. They knew about the story & STILL didn't watch. What's going on?


That is a very good question. What is going on is a minister who is not fit for the job; a minister who does not have the skills or the disposition or the capacity to do what needs to be done. Senator Scullion's reaction at the time was at once ignorant and arrogant. What sort of minister responsible for Indigenous affairs could possibly say that he did not have his interest piqued by reports of abuse? There were reports out from 2015 that he had access to. All I heard today was a man standing up and saying, 'Oh, gee, the pictures were terrible.' What do they have to do for this minister? Put pictures in the reports so that he can see what is going on in the area that he has responsibility for? Is it only the pictures that are going to move him to act?


Is it only pictures that he can actually understand? 


It is the responsibility of a minister to have the capacity to read carefully what is in those documents and to respond in the appropriate way at the appropriate time. This is, absolutely, not evident in what we have seen from this minister in his management of his portfolio. What we saw today was a man who disrespected the questions. He should have known about and been prepared for those questions today. When Senator Wong asked him when he knew, did we hear a date? Did he offer a time line? Did he give any decent defence for the ignorant way in which he answered his question? No, he did not. 


He is not fit to continue in this portfolio. This is a new government; they had an opportunity to put somebody decent in to do the job. He is the only senator representing the Northern Territory on that side of the parliament in this chamber. He has a dual responsibility as a Northern Territorian and as the first minister of this country for the first peoples—for the Indigenous peoples of this country. And he was not able to read briefings—to take briefings and to understand the content of vital reports that came to public notice as early as 2015. 


He has hundreds of staff in the department to support his understanding of his portfolio, yet he was incapable of doing that. His arrogance knows no bounds. He was told by Ms Meldrum-Hanna that the program was going to come on that evening, and yet he went ahead with the business of his ordinary day without looking at it. And then he says to the Prime Minister: 'Oh, look mate'—he says 'mate' to the Prime Minister—'I didn't know it was going on. No, I didn't know, mate. I'll have a look and I'll call you back.' It is not good enough. 


It is not good enough for the senator for the Northern Territory. It is not good enough for the man who is supposed to be standing up for the Indigenous people in this country, and they know he is not up to the job. Professor Calma said:


Any minister who is not willing to engage with the community they represent and want to listen to them and work cooperatively with them, shouldn't be a minister.


Tom Calma knows and the whole Indigenous community knows. These guys cannot defend him because they know he is not up to the job and he has done the wrong thing. When that came out on the ABC, any minister worth his salt—

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:56):  This morning in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister delivered the government's national security statement for 2016. I table a copy of the Prime Minister's statement and I wish to make some remarks in relation to it and highlight certain of the matters which the Prime Minister averted to in the national security statement.


Since this parliament last met on 5 May, the world has witnessed a seemingly constant barrage of terror attacks: 84 people were killed and 201 injured in Nice; 49 people were killed in Orlando; in a church in Normandy a priest was slain while performing mass; 47 were killed at Ankara airport; while 23 died in Dakar. The list goes on.


In the last year alone, there have been around 40 Islamist terrorist attacks against the West or Western interests. These attacks have resulted in over 700 deaths. Many of those are assessed to have been directed or inspired by Daesh. Daesh's attacks against civilians continues across the Middle East and Africa, resulting in the deaths of thousands, mainly Muslims, in those parts of the world. In July we saw the single deadliest attack conducted by Daesh in Afghanistan with around 80 killed and 230 injured by suicide bombers in Kabul. We in Australia cannot pretend that this is a problem of faraway lands; it is a scourge that threatens the entire world, and it is a scourge which we have felt here in our own homeland.


It is now two years since the national terror threat level was elevated to 'likely', a level now known as 'probable'. That increased threat was largely a consequence of the traction that Daesh was getting from a growing number of Australians. Since that time there have been three terrorist attacks carried out in Australia, and in each of those cases—at Endeavour Hills police station in Victoria, in Martin Place and at Parramatta police station—the attacker claimed allegiance to, or was inspired by, Daesh. In those two years our law enforcement and security agencies have successfully disrupted a further 10 terrorist attacks, many of them hours away from being undertaken, and nine of them featuring individuals with some form of allegiance to Daesh. 


In this period, 47 people have been charged as a result of 18 counterterrorism operations around Australia. To put that into context, that is over half of all terrorism-related charges since 2001. This government—with the bipartisan support, I am pleased to say, of the opposition—is determined to do whatever is necessary to protect Australians at home and abroad, while at the same time devising laws which impinge as little as possible upon our traditional rights, freedoms and liberties.


Our effort against Daesh is multilayered. It involves, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, support for military action in the Middle East; and that military action has seen success. I can tell the Senate that, thanks to the efforts of the Iraqi armed forces and their coalition partners—led by the United States of America and strongly supported by Australia—Daesh has now lost close to half of the territory it held in Iraq and up to 20 per cent of the territory it held in Syria. Our best estimates are that its number of fighters has been cut by about one-third. That is no small achievement, and Australia's military contribution in the air and on the ground has been a significant factor. 


Meanwhile, we know that the terrorist group's monthly income has fallen by an estimated 30 per cent since the middle of last year. In June, Daesh suffered its highest net territorial losses in over a year, including key ground near the Turkish border and the last city it controlled in Iraq's Anbar Province, Fallujah. Iraqi forces raised the Iraqi flag over Fallujah on 17 June and Iraqi military leaders announced the city's full liberation on 26 June. That progress has been critically important, but it must continue. We must go on. We have not yet had the victory which we seek.


Once the so-called caliphate is destroyed, it is necessary to undertake the equally challenging task of winning the peace; of establishing a secure and lasting peace in areas of the Middle East which have been under Daesh tyranny. We cannot take that for granted. The United States, Australia and our allies are a formidable war fighting machine, but we know from the past that we have had mixed success in re-establishing political order. That is why the Prime Minister and the government have been so resolute that the right soldiers on the right ground are critical to giving the Middle East the stability it needs and the best opportunity for peace to succeed. It is not simply the victory, but the manner of the victory, that is crucial. Daesh needs to be defeated by Iraqis and by Syrians. Our air support, our trainers and our special forces are of vital importance, but it is essential that Syrians and Iraqis take the lead, win the victory and then keep the peace.


I return to the question of our domestic initiatives. The Australian government has redoubled our efforts to build links at home with Muslim communities because we know that it is because of the links we have with and through the cooperation of those communities that we are able to obtain the intelligence we need in order to identify individuals who are at risk—to intervene and to save at-risk people from the hands of the wicked individuals who would recruit them to a path of destruction. 


As the Prime Minister has said many times, strong borders provide an important foundation for public trust in our efforts. They are a precondition of a successful multicultural society. Community trust is becoming ever more important as encryption technology enables terrorists and sympathisers to go dark with their electronic networks, and so community cooperation becomes ever more important.


We should not be so delicate as to say that Daesh and Islamist terrorism have nothing to do with Islam. There is nothing controversial about this. It is a self-evident fact that underpins much of our national security efforts at home and abroad. We will not hesitate to label Islamist extremism when we see it. At the same time, there is nothing to be gained by rashly affixing labels and pre-empting the findings of complex investigations. We will work hard to preserve the mutual respect that makes us one of the most liberal and diverse multicultural countries in the world. We must not link all Muslims with the crimes of a terrorist minority. That is precisely what the extremists want us to do. The government is committed to continuing to work closely with Australia's Muslim communities—as with all communities—to identify, isolate and defeat the Islamist extremists who prey upon them. The government has also taken measures, and will continue to take measures, to strengthen our laws to give those who protect us—the police and the national security agencies—the powers they need while always tailoring those laws in a manner to be consistent with our great liberal democratic traditions.


The government has initiated two new important measures to further strengthen our counterterrorism laws and meet the challenges of the evolving threat environment. First, we are developing a post-sentence preventative detention system to enable a continuing period of detention for high-risk terrorist offenders. It will be a court supervised process similar to the arrangements that apply in a number of jurisdictions for sex offenders and for extremely violent individuals. Some three weeks ago, I met with the state and territory attorneys-general. All have given their in-principle support to the development of this legislation, and I thank them for their constructive engagement. I will be introducing this legislation in the next sitting week.


Second, the government has accepted all of the recommendations of the review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security into the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill, which I introduced into this chamber last November. Among other things, the bill will strengthen our control order regime and address the regrettable trend of increasingly younger Australians being susceptible to the lies and propaganda of Daesh and its ideology.


Finally, as Senator Payne outlined in answer to a question in question time today, we will amend the Commonwealth Criminal Code to ensure that the law in relation to the targeting of non-state terrorist actors is made consistent with the law in relation to the targeting of individuals engaged in conventional warfare between states.


I said at the outset that this has been a bipartisan endeavour. The legislation that has been introduced by the government in the last two years has in each instance been taken to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. That committee has acted in a bipartisan manner to improve the legislation. This has been, as I said in one of the parliamentary debates, an example of the parliament doing its work at its best, to examine legislation carefully developed by government, further to fine-tune it in order to ensure that the legislation we ultimately pass through this chamber is the best possible legislation we can have, with the powers our agencies need and the laws that the courts need to have available to them, but protective and respectful, nevertheless, of our liberal democratic traditions. On all of those fronts—on the intelligence front, on the law reform front, on the military front, on the diplomatic front and on the front of community engagement—this government will continue to work to keep our community safe and to fulfil the high responsibility of any government to keep our nation secure. I thank the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:12):  I move:


That the Senate takes note of the statement.


I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for his remarks and associate the opposition with them. The opposition fully shares the government's concerns regarding the threat posed by Daesh to Australia and to Australians. The cooperative bipartisan approach that Labor took to questions of national security in the 44th Parliament will continue in the 45th.


Labor has fully supported the role played by the ADF over the past two years in helping to turn back the Daesh onslaught across Iraq and Syria. But, as many have noted, victory on the battlefield by no means signals the end of the fight. As Daesh forces have been rolled back from the cities and towns, they have increasingly shifted their tactics to continue their fight by other means. As tactics of the terrorists evolve so too must our tactics evolve to continue the fight against them. In this light, the CDF briefed the Leader of the Opposition earlier today on the need to update Australian domestic law to be consistent with international law as to the rules of engagement for our forces. As the Attorney has summarised, domestic law has a narrower definition which has not been updated to respond to such situations, particularly in relation to non-state actors, such as Daesh, which are committed to pursuing warlike terrorist activities. The CDF has highlighted that, whilst under international law forces can strike some support organisations, Australian domestic law potentially leaves members of the ADF open to prosecution as it is an offence for someone to cause the death of one or more persons if those victims are not 'taking an active part in the hostilities'. I note that the CDF has said that rules of engagement designed to minimise the risk of civilian deaths will not be changed.


Labor commends the government for bringing this matter before parliament today. We do believe it is vital that members and senators continue to be able to discuss such matters. In the interests of transparency, it is important to keep the Australian people, whom we represent, fully informed of these vital matters of national security. As has been alluded to, in the last parliament Labor supported—and, indeed, improved and amended—some four rounds of national security legislation, and members from both parties of the committee to which the Leader of the Government in the Senate refers, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, worked together to deliver more than 100 amendments to the original legislation. We would anticipate that any future legislation be also referred to the PJCIS for inquiry and report before any vote on the legislation takes place. The opposition also looks forward to being further briefed by the government on the details of the proposed arrangements.


The loss of many innocent lives has become a horribly familiar story in too many places—from Paris to Nice, to Orlando, to Istanbul and endless cities and towns across Iraq and Afghanistan. The Prime Minister earlier today, in another place, warned that:


It is quite possible that the next mass casualty attack on Australian victims will be somewhere in Southeast Asia, where Daesh propaganda has galvanised existing networks of extremists and attracted new recruits.


I know I speak for all in this place when I express my profound hope that this prediction does not prove true.


One factor in defeating this threat will be our strong bilateral relations in this region, which are our strongest asset as we review and strengthen our capabilities in countering violent extremism. Our bilateral relations with Indonesia serve as an example of this type of cooperation. Both parties of government work very closely with Indonesia on matters of security and counterterrorism. Further afield from the region, Australian foreign policy also addresses security issues in global and multilateral forums. Our term on the UN Security Council was an asset for Australia in making an even greater impact on these issues internationally. Our aid program is also an arm of this effort, not only in terms of countering violent extremism but also in terms of our defence against epidemics, climate change and financial crises, all of which pose threats to our security. In these areas, our aid program helps further and protect Australia's interests.


The recent defeats of Daesh forces in Iraq and Syria have been important steps. But as we have learnt from the terrible toll of the terrorist attacks in the name of Islamic State, these defeats alone will not defeat the threat. As the tactics of the terrorists evolve, they must be met. And, as we meet them, we will never forget what it is we are fighting to defend.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:17):  I have recently handed over the defence and veterans portfolio to Senator Ludlam, who is tied up, so I will speak on his behalf. Senator Brandis, before you flee the chamber, I would like this put on record. Perhaps you could explain to the Senate at some stage why Martin Place was a terrorist attack. I would be very interested, especially with your legal background. My understanding was that that is very much disputed. In fact, the circumstances surrounding that situation were extremely complex, including through the coronial inquest in Sydney. I would be very interested as to why you have got up here and used that as one of your motivations, because we would like to get more detail on that particular issue.


The Labor and Liberal parties have yet again sidelined the parliament and the Australian people by quietly agreeing to changes to war crimes legislation, shortcutting debate and expert analysis. The Greens' foreign affairs and defence spokesman, Senator Ludlam, said today:


These changes seriously alter the governance of ADF personnel in combat. They change the definition of a war crime. It's a highly charged, complex topic in which civilians in war zones on the other side of the world have no voice.


We'd like to hear from the ADF about why they feel these changes were needed. What actions are they trying to take that are being prevented by existing war crimes legislation?


Parliament should have a far greater role in debating the use of military force, and the implications of those deployments.


The Greens have always argued for parliamentary war-powers. Senator Ludlam went on:


These are some of the most important decisions a nation can make—


And that is what parliamentarians should be doing as one of their key roles in this place. Senator Ludlam said:


Australian forces operate under much more stringent rules of engagement than many of our allies including the US. Anything that creates a risk of that changing needs to be carefully scrutinised.


It is worth pointing out, on this issue, that Australia is one of the last Western democracies where we can send citizens into conflict zones without recourse to parliament. So it is good that we will get a chance to debate this when Senator Brandis brings this to us next week.


Before I finish up—and we will have more to say on this next week—I want to say that you are coming in here and using examples of terrorism occurring on Australian soil as justification for changes to laws, when those examples are disputed. Certainly with Martin Place, nobody has any doubt at all that the individual in question, Man Haron Monis, was mentally ill. He was a violent criminal with a history of criminality. He reportedly set fire to his wife. He was a very complex character. To label his act of violence, which was a huge tragedy for our nation, as being politically motivated—that has not been established. I have raised it in this house before. The problem with calling people terrorists is that there is no internationally accepted political definition of that word. If it implies political motivation, then the subject is, by nature, highly subjective. Let me make it very clear for the record: Monis was a violent criminal and what he did was tragic and unspeakable, but to come in here and use that as an example of an act of terrorism to give our military special powers, fighting on the other side of the world, I think undermines the case already put by Senator Brandis. So I would like him to come in here next week and clarify why he believed that was an act of terrorism.


Question agreed to.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:22):  At the request of Senator Dastyari, I move:


That the Senate notes that the Prime Minister (Mr Turnbull) has repeatedly said making changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is 'not a priority' but has refused to rule them out.


As you well know, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, in this parliament in the last sitting the particular issues around the Racial Discrimination Act were heard many times in discussion—even, I would think, in serious debate many times. In my opinion, that is a very good thing. I think that having more people who really understand the way our legislation operates and who question the way our legislation operates can only make the legislation stronger and also community education more effective. So, whilst I sincerely disagreed with many of the people who emailed me and many of the people who talked to me at community events about their views about section 18C and, not so often but sometimes, section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act, I was pleased that they felt that they could have the conversation.


Whilst having that conversation in the last parliament, we had an outpouring of concern around any attempt to make change to this legislation. The legislation has been on the books for 20 years, and I am not sure whether, in that 20-year period, anyone had really talked about it too much. But certainly, as a result of some issues being raised in the previous parliament, they did, and it became almost a cause celebre in many ways because there was seemingly an argument in our community about the right to free speech.


I do not think that there is anyone in our nation who does not believe that Australians do have the right to free speech. It is something that we sometimes take for granted. However, the issue that caused so much concern in the last parliament was whether this issue of free speech came alone or there were any responsibilities that came with having open, free speech. I believe that many people in the community agreed that, whilst we do have free speech because that is a democratic right, that right of free speech is very much countenanced by responsibilities.


The Racial Discrimination Act, over 20 years ago, did put some responsibilities around our right to free speech. Specifically it said, in section 18C, that free speech could not in any way hurt, offend or abuse. I think that continues to be the key question. For me, there is a question for all of us and particularly for those people who now again have brought out their concerns about 18C in our current situation. I just want to know, from people who question 18C, what hurt, offence or abuse they believe should happen in our community. I strongly believe that the people who framed the legislation really meant to ensure that we could balance the right to say whatever we wanted to say with another, equally important right: what we wanted to say should not be framed in a way that would cause hurt, offence or abuse to other members of our community.


What was hoped to be achieved 20 years ago in the RDA was that we would build a strong community that was based on respect. The reason that that legislation was brought forward is that we had ample evidence in our community that there was insufficient respect—that there was not a sense for everybody in our community that they felt safe, secure and respected. For people who are going to be involved in further discussion around the issues in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, it would be useful to go back and see what caused the framers of 18C to make the legislation.


For those of us who remember—and, whilst I was not in this place 20 years ago, I was certainly in the wider community, and I had an interest in issues around discrimination—we had a series of pieces of legislation and a series of community reports, Senate reports and also statements that highlighted, to our shame as a community, that there was effective discrimination based on race that was occurring in our community and had occurred historically. People would remember the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and we will be absolutely privileged to hear a first speech in this place this afternoon from a man who was deeply involved in that process. I look forward, as I am sure we all do, to hearing Senator Pat Dodson make his first speech in this parliament.


Senator Dodson, in his capacity as a commissioner many years ago, was active in raising awareness in our community about the horrors, the hurt and the damage of unfettered free speech that would attack people on the basis of their race. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody set down a baseline which said, 'This is what has occurred in our history; this is what is still occurring'—at that time—'and we must put into place many recommendations.' As you would remember, many recommendations came out of that seminal inquiry, which was publicised widely across our country, but part of those recommendations was to ensure that we would look at the way we would operate as a community. We would identify behaviours and actions which would cause offence, and we would work together as a community to respond to that.


So, as to other things: we had another inquiry that was done by the Law Reform Commission, a group that I respect deeply and whose reports I value reading whenever they come out. At that time, they released a report on multiculturalism and the law which highlighted the way people from different backgrounds were being treated by our law and how they felt as though they had some restrictions on their ability to access legal justice.


As well, we had our international commitments. Australia, as we know, has been a leader in signing up to a range of international treaties. We go back to the actual formation of the League of Nations and then the United Nations, where Australia has always been a leader. We signed up to a range of international treaty obligations, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; we have clearly identified that we, as a nation, would be part of that treaty obligation. And when you read that treaty you will see that we accept that we will work to eliminate any form of behaviour or action which would cause discrimination to people on the basis of their race. And part of that, I believe, was the introduction of the racial discrimination legislation, in which are sections 18C and 18D. In those, we balanced this ability in our nation to celebrate our freedom to speak freely with the responsibility—aware of our history; aware of the indication of where hurt and concern was caused—to moderate that right. That is still the situation now.


So again I say: what hurt, offence, abuse, elimination and discrimination do people want to use their speech to cause? And when I ask that question of the people who are saying that they need to go back and rescind this legislation, they are nonplussed. If they go to define what they want to say publicly, they are nonplussed as to saying how that would impact on another. And when we cause people to get together and work through that process, I think that we will achieve what the people who wrote the Racial Discrimination Act would have intended us to.


We, together, can identify what in speech causes offence, what in speech causes people to feel unsafe and what in speech causes people to feel unworthy. And if, by our free speech, we have that effect, I think we should be seriously thinking about how we are using free speech.


In these discussions, we often talk about the individual and the individual impact, and, coincidentally, amongst all the emails that I have at the moment, as we all do, on issues that are important to our nation, there was one from a young man in my state—and I am not going to use his name because he emailed me, and I do not think he wanted his particular name known. His opening cry in the email simply was: 'Please do not change 18C.' To begin with I was pleased that a young man knew what 18C was. But then I went on to read his email, and it was gut-wrenching. He talked about the fact that he was from another country—he and his family had come over here—and he had been subject to bullying and also abuse, linked to the way he looked, the way he spoke and the way he behaved. He said in his email that, when he talked to people about how he felt—and it took him a while to have the courage to talk to other people about how he did feel hurt, offended and excluded by what people in some ways thought could have been a bit of a joke—he was made aware that, in Australia, under the racial discrimination legislation, what was happening to him had been declared to be wrong.


He did not take any particular grievance up. He did not write a submission to the Human Rights Commission claiming that he had been vilified. But becoming aware that this legislation was in place gave him strength to be able to build his response to the people who were bullying him and causing him harm. So, in many ways, that sums up for me the argument as to why this legislation is important. It means that people who are damaged know that our nation has said that that is inappropriate.


Some of the people who have contacted me on the other side, who claim that they should have completely unfettered free speech, indicated that they felt that this piece of legislation was stopping the activities of operations in our nation. So I then went back to check with the Human Rights Commission to see how many complaints had been received by the Human Rights Commission under this particular clause. To begin with, the number was extraordinarily small—and I know that my young man in Queensland was not one of them. But the numbers of people who took their concerns to the level of putting in an actual complaint was very small. Then I went further, to find out what happened when these complaints were received by the commission, and I looked to see how much legal action there was and how much the courts were being damaged by the number of complaints that have been put forward. What I found out from talking with the commission was that, even for most of the claims that got as far as someone making a complaint—having the strength, I believe, to put in a complaint about what they felt was wrong—most of those situations were resolved by having mediation. The people involved could sit down together and work through what the complaint was and what the impact of the complaint was and what caused the action to occur. Thankfully—and, I think, most successfully—most of these actions were mediated and there was no further action but an agreement that a process had occurred and that there would be no further action taken. Some—and I have not got the numbers with me—did go through to much further action, though not many. Unfortunately, they are the ones we see in the media—the ones that get the highlight in that process.


Nonetheless, as I said about the issue with the young man in Queensland who felt vindicated and strengthened by the fact that they had some protection under legislation, I believe one of the true values of the clauses in the Racial Discrimination Act that look at free speech is that it causes people to know that there is an understanding in our community and an understanding under law that it is not appropriate and not right to use free speech to hurt or abuse or harm.


I know that we are going to hear much more about this issue over the life of this parliament. I genuinely hope for the response that we had in the last parliament, which was such a strengthening and gathering of people across the community from a wide range of multicultural groups, churches and community activists who got together to say that they did not want to have this legislation changed, that they wanted to ensure that people understood that, in Australia, our right to free speech is effectively balanced by a protection: that people should not have freedom to harm, freedom to abuse, freedom to offend. In that process I am hoping that that same community reaction will occur again.


Maybe the way to ensure that we understand the rights of free speech is to have someone like Senator Bernardi come forward with the full support of so many other people from the other side of politics to put this on the agenda again so that we will be able to continually in the parliament have a look at the way we believe free speech should be. We would be able to continually challenge our community to see how they believe free speech should happen. We would be able to challenge our community so that they, if they have not been subject to attack, discrimination or exclusively, will have the ability to put themselves in the place of someone who has. If they do take that opportunity, if they do then see how they would personally feel if they were the victim of someone speaking freely in a way that they would find offensive or harmful, would they still champion a change to 18C?


That continues tonight to be my challenge. Have a look at what the legislation says. See what the intent of the legislation was. Have a look at the environment which led to the legislation being developed and genuinely look at what is occurring in our society, in our community today. See if there have been any changes. See whether people are more prepared to abuse others on their racial basis. See whether there is any more preparedness to think that we have the right to hurt.


I truly believe that, once the community understands the legislation, they will begin to challenge anyone who thinks that we have the right to say anything about anyone at any time which could be harmful and particularly if we use their race. Remember we are talking about the racial discrimination legislation. See if it is appropriate to use someone's race in such a negative way that it could be harmful. I believe that we are able to communicate more efficiently and effectively than that.


If I have trouble with somebody else because of their race—and I am trying desperately to think how that would happen, but if it did. You should never say that nothing could happen, but if I were having a difficulty with another person that was linked to their race, I would really hope that I would be able to communicate what was affecting me, what was causing me concern without causing them personal concern, that I would be able to identify what the issues were, explain what I was doing and ensure that I would be freely able to make that comment and, in making that comment freely, I would be aware of the impact of my words. Sometimes in this place we forget that, once the words have been said, they can never be taken back.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:41):  It is indeed a great honour to be elected as a senator and to participate in our parliamentary debates; there is no doubt about that. What makes the institution of the Senate so important is that those 76 senators that find themselves here come from diverse backgrounds, work tirelessly to get here and work tirelessly to stay here so they can contribute in our national debates. Sometimes, I do not mind saying, it is tiresome to come into this chamber, to witness the relentless politicking, to be part of the relentless point-scoring and partisanship.


In preparing my remarks for this afternoon, I thought that is what I was going to hear from opposition senators, so I am pleasantly surprised by Senator Moore's contribution today, because I do not think we are all that far away from an agreed position in terms of how to move the debate forward. I acknowledge and congratulate Senator Moore's first contribution on this debate this afternoon and hope other senators will contribute in the same vein.


Senator Moore is saying a number of things. Senator Moore is agreeing that there is a debate in the community. I argue there is a debate in the community about this important issue. Senator Moore is suggesting that the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission have strong views on this. So am I, and in the next few minutes available to me let me explain to you why the Human Rights Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission agree that review and possibly reform of this law is necessary.


Senator Moore is quite right. I accept that over 20 years ago there would have been some compelling reasons in our community for this law to have been created. What I am arguing is that 20 or so years later it is time to review the suitability of that law, and I argue reform. Others might argue review and no reform, but to move this debate forward we need to step outside of the petty partisanship, step aside from the petty point-scoring and move to a position—



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Senator Kim, hear me out.




Senator McKim:
  I will.




Senator SMITH:
  and move to a position where we can have a community discussion about this important issue. That community discussion should be given to the parliament—should be given to this parliament—to do. I will come back to that point in a few moments. But let me just start by saying that when this debate started a number of years ago—and I have only been in the Senate for four years—there was little support for reform, but what has happened is that the arguments for reform have been increased, not just from Senators McKim, Smith and Moore but from esteemed people in our community. Let me start with one of them: a very eminent Western Australian who is now the Chief Justice of our High Court. Justice Robert French has said:


The lower registers of the preceding definitions [in 18C] and in particular those of 'offend' and 'insult' seem a long way removed from the mischief to which Art 4 of CERD is directed. They also seem a long way from some of the evils to which Part IIA [of the RDA] is directed as described in the Second Reading Speech.


What the now chief justice, then a justice, was saying is that reform of 18C is defensible. That is the first point. Julian Burnside AO QC, a prominent human rights lawyer not known for his articulation of political values similar to my own or similar to Senator Paterson's, has said: 


… the mere fact that you insult or offend someone probably should not, of itself, give rise to legal liability. My personal view is that 18C probably reached a bit too far so a bit of fine-tuning would probably be OK. 


What I am trying to demonstrate is that there is a wide breadth of argument in the community from esteemed people who, at a minimum, think that this should be reviewed. 


Let me turn now to the Australian Human Rights Commission, because Senator Moore did use the Australian Human Rights Commission's contribution some years ago in defence of her position. Let me share with you what the Australian Human Rights Commission have said in the last two years. They said that 'the legislation could be clarified so that it more plainly reflects the way in which it has been interpreted in practice'. And, most significantly, what did the Australian Law Reform Commission say? The Australian Law Reform Commission concluded, just last year: 


… there are arguments that s 18C lacks sufficient precision and clarity, and unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech by extending to speech that is reasonably likely to 'offend'. In some respects, the provision is broader than is required under international law—


to prohibit the advocacy of racial hatred—


broader than similar laws in other jurisdictions, and may be susceptible to constitutional challenge.


In comparing Australia's section 18C with other common-law countries, the Australian Law Reform Commission found:


The New Zealand and UK provisions seem narrower than the Australian provision …  For example, the provisions do not cover offensiveness, and require that the person provoke hostility or hatred against a group of persons defined by race or ethnicity.


The commission also stated that, in 2013, the Canadian parliament repealed a broader provision in the Canadian Human Rights Act—one reason being that the provision conflicted with the freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression safeguarded by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 


I have a strong view on this issue but I accept absolutely that there are other people in the community who have a different view. The idea that we should not take the next step forward and have a proper debate—and I do not like to use the word 'debate'. The word 'debate' in an instant suggests conflict. It does not have to be conflict driven. It can be a parliamentary discussion about the merits or otherwise of reforming section 18C, because people outside of this Senate, esteemed people, have argued that that is the right course of action. The politics in this are tempting. It is easy to whip up hysteria. It is easy to whip up concern. But we have an obligation, as considered people with rights and responsibilities as senators, not to create fear where fear does not have to be created but to give people a degree of confidence that this is a debate, a deep debate, that we can participate in. 


I am looking forward to Senator Dodson's contribution in his first speech, which we will hear shortly, as a fellow Western Australian and as someone who spends a lot of time across Western Australia's far North. But I think it is interesting to be reminded of the comments of Mr Warren Mundine reported in The Australian newspaper this week. Mr Mundine did start by opposing the Abbott government's plan to repeal section 18 in its entirety, and that is not what we are talking about. Those of us like Senator Patterson and I, who argue that reform should be possible, are talking about a very, very narrow reform. Mr Mundine has said that he believes that the law needs changing. He has said that he was supportive of removing the terms 'offend' and 'insult' from the section. I quote Mr Mundine now: 


""The way things are going at the moment we are seeing people who have been stifled in regards to their conversations, that is the concern I have,"" he told The Australian. ""I do believe it needs changes—not to wipe it completely, but to pull it back a bit."" 


Again, it just demonstrates the point that there are a variety of opinions in the community. It is beholden on us to conduct the debate carefully, to conduct the debate in adherence with our convictions and values and to accept that different people will have different points of view. 


I have an idea about how we can progress that. On many occasions this parliament has demonstrated its capacity to deal with difficult and sensitive issues. A proposition that I have shared with colleagues is that I think it is time—I do think we have the capacity—for a parliamentary inquiry to examine the broader issue of freedom of expression, of which 18C is just one part, and to invite members of the House of Representatives to join in that parliamentary inquiry, because we know that they will have different views as well. We know that the sorts of pressures that are on House of Representative members are different to those that are on senators. It would be a parliamentary inquiry that includes members of the House of Representatives and that is given to an esteemed committee of the parliament—perhaps the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, Senator McKim, of which you and I were members in the last parliament. We can step above the partisanship and the point-scoring. But is beholden on all of us to do it in a way that exercises care and caution. And it is beholden on Senator Patterson and me as opponents of reform to make sure that that consensus for reform is as broad as possible. A parliamentary inquiry puts the responsibility on Senator Patterson and me and others to broaden the consensus, to build confidence that this is a positive next step. If it is not a positive next step, we can review that—we can inquire into that. It is just not defensible anymore. 


Indeed, in Senator Moore's own contribution she recognised that there is a debate in the community. The Australian Human Rights Commission had a view; I have shared with you why that view is now different. The Australian Law Reform Commission had a view and now that view is different. It is time to take this debate to another level. Rather controversially, let me put out a challenge to my own colleagues: reform is possible, so we must exercise the greatest diligence in making sure that every action, every word we speak, has as its objective building consensus and not distracting from consensus.


Senator McKim, I think a freedom of expression parliamentary inquiry of which 18C is a part is important. We know that one of the most cherished principles in our country is the freedom of opinion and expression. We know that it stands first amongst equals and its intrinsic worth is the fact that it sits in very close proximity to other liberties that we cherish—the freedom of association, the freedom of assembly, the freedom of thought, the freedom of conscience and the freedom of religion. These are live issues in our debate in our country. I challenge anyone who thinks that they are not. But now is the time to take it to a new level, to a new place, and to encourage and empower parliament to conduct what is a very necessary community inquiry.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-09-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:54):  I thank Senator Smith for his contribution. He is invariably worth listening to closely, I have found, in my relatively short time representing the state of Tasmania here in the Senate. However, Senator Smith, I found some inherent contradictions in some of the arguments you made. Firstly, you spent quite a bit of your contribution calling strongly for a review of, variously, 18C and freedom of speech statutes in this country. However, it is beholden on me to point out that you have actually signed on to change section 18C by removing the words 'offend' and 'insult'. So you do not have a position of wanting review—you have actually signed on to the change, Senator Smith. It is worth my pointing out that in my view, and with the greatest respect, inherent contradiction in your contribution.


The problem the proponents of change have more broadly is that there are a range of other far more grievous constraints on freedom of speech that never get a mention. Our defamation laws, which have extreme constraints, in effect, on freedom of speech in this country, never ever get a mention by those representatives of the Liberal Party and the IPA in this place, because of course they are used by politicians and big corporations in order to stifle freedom of speech. So they are very convenient, and it is conveniently ignored that our defamation laws are a massive constraint on freedom of speech in this country. I refer you also to section 42 of the Border Force Act, which is a massive constraint on freedom of speech for those people who work in the immigration detention centres in our country. If people are truly going to self-style as freedom of speech warriors in this place, or in public debate—I am not suggesting that you are, Senator Smith, but I am suggesting that others in this place have done that—then I want to hear from them objections to section 42 of the Border Force Act. I want to hear from them objections to the significant constraints on the freedom of speech created by our defamation laws. But, do you know what? I am not going to hold my breath, because I do not think those comments are coming because what is driving this debate around 18C is that people want Australians to be able to offend and insult other Australians based on race—based on race; that is the key. Section 18C is in the Racial Discrimination Act. If you want to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult' from the Racial Discrimination Act, logic follows that you want Australians to be able to offend and insult based on race. What reasonable person would want to offend another Australian based on their race? I do not think there is a reasonable justification for offending and insulting fellow Australians based on their race.


I spoke about section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act earlier today, but it is worth pointing out that, like defamation laws, like section 42 of the Border Force Act, section 18D never gets a mention in this argument by proponents of change. It is forgotten by proponents of change as often as most Australians, including me, forget the second verse of Advance Australia Fair. Section 18D seriously provides massive freedom of speech protections that effectively protect anything said or done in good faith in this country. It is a significant and broad protection. 


I also want to point out in the very limited time left to me in this debate that there are many more ominous rights to the threats of ordinary Australians in section 18C. I am going to call people out here, and they are the right wing culture warriors in Australia —I am not referring to Senator Smith, but there are others in this place, including Senator Patterson and Senator Duniam, who is the new Senate for Tasmania—who will take every opportunity to crib their way through our statute books to make Australia a less safe place for people they do not agree with. I have seen this through my life. I say to Senator Paterson and his IPA—he is an agent of the IPA in his place, make no mistake about it—and to Senator Duniam and others that I will not lie down before them and let them crib their way any further than they are able to do. I will defend section 18C to my last breath in this place.


I want to point out to the chamber that threats like the growth in inequality in this place—the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Australia—is a significant challenge to the rights of Australians. Global warming and sea-level rise are significant challenges to the rights of Australians. The ever-expanding surveillance that is done in the national security—which all of those proponents of changes to section 18 C line up to support—is a significant challenge to the rights of everyday Australians. But we do not hear a peep from these people about those things. We simply hear that we need to change 18C so that people can be offensive and insulting on the basis of race in this country. Well, not on my watch!

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:50): I am pleased to participate in this debate, and I remember that some time ago I participated in a previous discussion on this issue when the coalition were proposing to change section 18C, which is all about offensive behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. At the time, I spoke about my upbringing in Scotland and the issues that cause discrimination in Scotland. That was mainly about religion at that time, and the religious discrimination was quite severe on the west coast of Scotland, where I come from. Catholics and Protestants were divided across religious lines, and I do not think much of it was about religion either


So I come with the view that there should be no place for any discrimination and that no-one should be offended, insulted or humiliated because of their race or religion. My experience was that all it does is create great disharmony in the community. My wife was brought up as a Roman Catholic and I was brought up as a Presbyterian. I know what it was like to live—for a short period with my wife's parents, who were practising Catholics—in what was basically a Catholic village outside Glasgow. It was a village where because you were Presbyterian or Protestant terrible religious discrimination went on. I do not think that is something that I want to see here. In fact, one of the reasons we emigrated to Australia was because Australia had a great deal of tolerance in religious practice.


I am not religious at all. I do not have any religion. I was brought up Presbyterian but I am an atheist. My wife was not a practising Catholic so we had the issue of our children and their religion. We took the view that if they wanted to be religious, that was something that they could take up but we did not want the pressure either from my family or my relatives or my wife's family or her relatives to try and force my children to be brought up in one religion or the other. I think the best thing I have ever done was come to Australia where that pressure was never brought on. I can be an atheist, I can be treated respectfully and that is something that you do not get in some areas in Scotland or in Northern Ireland—it is still a big problem. I think racial discrimination has to be treated very carefully, not just racial discrimination but religious discrimination or any discrimination at all.


I have been discriminated against in here. People have said that I need to learn to speak 'Australian'. I did not know there was such a language as 'Australian' but I was told, 'You have to speak Australian.' I have been told that I am incomprehensible by coalition senators. They know what I am saying, they understand me but that is the sort of discrimination that has been placed on me. When I first came to Australia, I worked at Garden Island dockyard as a fitter. I remember a newly arrived migrant like myself, a Greek guy, saying to me, 'Doug, why you no speak good English like me?' And that is a true story. I went home to Elaine that night and I said, 'I do not think we are going to make it in Australia because nobody can understand me.' But now that I have got an Aussie accent, I think everything has turned out not too bad. But seriously, if you come here and you do not have English as your native language or if you are not white Anglo-Saxon then there are challenges. There are real challenges for some Aboriginal Australians.


My background is one where you have to have a legislated opposition to this kind of cultural discrimination. You cannot rely on people doing the right thing. You cannot rely on people not being offended because the people who are discriminated against here are migrants, Aboriginal Australians and even people like myself from time to time—but being from a white Anglo-Saxon background, hey, I do not have a problem. But I cannot really imagine what it is like for many people who are discriminated against. You see it in the newspaper reports and you see it in the reports on the television news where people are attacked because of their racial background both verbally and physically on public transport. We just cannot have that.


I came to Australia because it was an egalitarian country, because it did recognise multiculturalism, because it did welcome people from all areas and from all ethnic bases around the world, even though Aboriginal Australians were suffering discrimination. We have heard from Senator Dodson that these things are slowly but surely changing. I think one of the biggest problems we could have is if we have a debate. There is no problem having a debate but a debate that results in the diminution of the protections for some of our most vulnerable people in society, I am strongly opposed to and I am opposed to any changes to the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill. 


I think, of the debate that is going on at the moment, there are some people that really believe in this. Senator Leyonhjelm, from his political perspective, believes that people should be able to be offended, insulted and humiliated. But I have to say, Senator Leyonhjelm, you did not handle it too well when the TV station rolled up and gave you a hard time. You did not handle that very well at all but that is what we all have to learn. You understand that these things happen from time to time. When Senator Williams has a go at me, I cop it on the chin.


My life in Australia has been one where I have been extremely lucky, but many others have not been as lucky. They have not been as lucky because they are not white Anglo-Saxons or they are not white Anglo-Saxon males. There is discrimination against females in this country. You have only got to look at the numbers in the coalition to know there is a problem with female participation in the coalition. So I am of the view that we should not be making any changes to the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill. We should as a parliament be looking after those that are in a weak and vulnerable position and we should be making sure that they cannot be divided against in this country. People should not be subjected to offence, insult, humiliation or intimidation and that is a position that we should hold strongly.


I know the debate is on because there is an attack on the Prime Minister. This is a challenge to Mr Turnbull's authority. It is being driven by right-wing extremists in the coalition and is being supported by people that should know better. It is a mixture of the extremists and the gullible in the coalition. We should just get beyond this and say that no-one should be insulted, offended, humiliated or intimidated in this country.

The PRESIDENT
 (18:00):  I wish to make a statement in relation to unparliamentary language. Before question time today, senators may recall that Senator Bernardi asked whether there were precedents for Deputy Presidents making what could be characterised as partisan speeches. I can assure the Senate that researchers have revealed that there are many such speeches by former Deputy Presidents, including on the address-in-reply. The election of a senator to the position of Deputy President does not require that senator to refrain from expressing a partisan point of view, where they consider it is appropriate. But, of course, they are completely impartial in the chair.


Senator Bernardi also asked me to review part of Senator Lambie's contribution on the address-in-reply debate earlier today. Senator Seselja took a point of order suggesting that Senator Lambie should be asked to withdraw reflections upon Senator Bernardi. The Acting Deputy President suggested that Senator Lambie should consider rephrasing her comments, and Senator Lambie resumed her speech. Senator Seselja took a further point of order again asking that the initial reflections be withdrawn. Senator Collins, on the same point of order, indicated her view that Senator Lambie had been in the process of rephrasing her comments, as requested by the chair. The Acting Deputy President appears to have accepted this to be the case and did not require a withdrawal. Senator Seselja did not press the point any further.


It is not entirely clear to me that Senator Lambie was, in fact, in the process of rephrasing her earlier references, but it appears to have been accepted by the chamber that this was the case. Certainly, it would have been inappropriate for the original remarks to stand, and the suggestion that Senator Lambie withdraw or rephrase the comments was appropriate.


During this point of order Senator Seselja also suggested that Senator Lambie should be asked to withdraw the use of the term 'hypocrites'. Senator Collins, again on the point of order, suggested that the use of the term in that collective way was not out of order, and this appears to have been accepted, also. I remind the Senate that unparliamentary language does not cease to be unparliamentary merely because it is directed at a group of members or senators rather than to an individual. I remind all senators that they should refer to other members of this place appropriately.


I also remind senators that requests for withdrawal of words must be made at the time. Such requests cannot be made retrospectively. This is in accordance with rulings of past Presidents over many decades, and reflects the duty of the chair to maintain order. It would simply not be feasible for senators to be able to revisit past debates and insist on the withdrawal of words after the event.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-09-01,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (18:06):  I rise to speak in consideration of the committee report of the Select Committee on Health, Hospital funding cuts: the perfect storm—the demolition of federal-state health relations 2014-2016 final report. It brings me to the issues that we experienced during the federal election in my home state of Tasmania, particularly around the Launceston General Hospital and the Royal Hobart Hospital rebuild. We know that the Liberals went to the last election promising that there would be no cuts. Then they inflicted a billion dollars of savage cuts to Tasmanian hospitals—to the Launceston General Hospital, to the Royal Hobart Hospital and to the Mersey hospital. Since these cuts, there has been crisis after crisis at the Launceston General Hospital, lengthy delays to the ongoing development of the Royal Hobart Hospital and, during a two-week period in June, nine of the 11 specialist doctors from the hospital's emergency department resigned, retired or reduced their hours. The reason for these walkouts was aired in the media with staff saying they had lost faith in their ability to care for patients. A shortage of beds has led to people not only being admitted into hospital through the emergency department but for the first time in so long—longer than I can remember—there was a gentlemen in his 70s left for days in the emergency department at the Launceston General Hospital. We know that there was a woman down at the Royal Hobart Hospital who was left lying on the floor. 


We know that the nursing staff have reported very dangerous working conditions due to the lack of resources. The community of Tasmania—and I know across the country in fact—has said enough is enough. Why has our only public hospital, the Launceston General Hospital, been forced into an untenable position whereby there have been walkouts, people walking off the job and people so stressed because they have not been able to deliver the services that they believe are essential to their local community?


What did we see during the federal election? We had the former member for Bass, Mr Nikolic, responding to the concerns of the people in his community by saying that this was a state issue—that is all he could come up with. The Tasmanian community will not stand by. They have demonstrated resoundingly at the last federal election that they will not stand by and allow governments to cut, cut and cut their health services. They will not allow a government to get away with threatening to derail and destabilise Medicare, our great public health system in this country—or the one that we have had and we aspire to have the best in the world. 


We know that even the Liberals are going off against very conservative people by trying to blame a legislative councillor in the north of the state for holding a press conference in relation to the crisis at the hospital. It is pretty serious when you have the AMA, GPs and pathologists all campaigning against you at a federal election. They are not natural supporters of the Labor Party; they are not a group of people you would expect to go out campaigning against a Liberal federal government. 


But the local member, the former local member, failed to protect the Launceston General Hospital from these cuts. He failed his community. Because he did not listen to his community, they voted him out. There is no-one else to blame for his demise but himself and his government's policies that he espoused on a daily basis. 


As I said in a speech earlier this week, we know that his mantra was: 'Jobs and growth. Jobs and growth. Jobs and growth.' I tell you across the rest of Tasmania people were saying: 'No more cuts. No more cuts to education. No more cuts to our health system, and we will never allow you to undermine Medicare.' That was the outcome. 


Quite clearly, we know that the former member failed to not only listen to but engage people within his community so he paid the highest price: they voted him out. But, earlier this week in a speech, I spoke about the three amigos, the three arrogant and out-of-touch House of Representatives members from Tasmania—now former members—the members for Bass, Lyons and Braddon. I said to them that I had brought a message from the Tasmanian community and that was: adios amigos. But I can see that, instead of taking my very sound advice, Mr Nikolic has not ridden out of town, because he has given me the great honour of a story that appeared in our local great newspaper, The Examiner, online. I quote from his Facebook page, which said: 




Disappointing to see Labor Senator Helen Polley still celebrating her involvement in nasty, false and personal politics. 



Quite clearly, Mr Nikolic, you still have not learnt from your firsthand experience of being defeated in the election, because you failed your constituency. There was nothing at all that I shared with the community that was nasty. There was certainly nothing that was false. There was certainly nothing from me that was a personal attack on him. What I did do was remind the community, which is my responsibility, of all the things he voted for when he was the member for Bass. I highlighted the fact that he failed to stand up for our health system. He failed to provide the funding that we need for education; in fact, they cut money. 


Mr Nikolic also failed older Tasmanians, because it was his government that over the last three years gutted aged care. They used it as an ATM to take $3 billion away from older Australians. I do not think that is a record that he should be proud of and I do not think he should be offended because I reminded the community of his failings as a member. I never made a personal attack on him whatsoever—none whatsoever—but I did my job as a senator for Tasmania: I went out and campaigned to ensure that they had the best representation possible. It is fantastic to finally have Labor members, once again, like Ross Hart, the new member for Bass, along with his colleagues Justine Keay and Brian Mitchell, who will be good listeners for their communities. They will stand up and fight for their communities, and they certainly will not turn their backs on the people who elected them.


I say again that this government have an opportunity. They were re-elected, but with that comes enormous responsibility. The responsibility that they have, as every federal government has always had and always should, is to look after those people who are most vulnerable in our communities. We had a speech from a new government senator from Tasmania, who I thought made some fantastic comments. He is a proud Tasmanian, as am I, and I suggest that those opposite and the leadership of the government should sit down and talk with him, because he has some good ideas, and I believe he will be a strong voice for his constituency. 


When it comes to things such as aged-care policy, we need to have a bipartisan approach because we have a responsibility as elected senators and as members of the opposition and the government, as I said, to look after those who are most vulnerable in our communities. And I am sad to say that the 44th Parliament, under the leadership of Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull, failed miserably. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:16):  I also wish to speak on this motion about the select committee report on supposed hospital funding cuts. I note in commencing that Senator Polley said she never personally attacked Mr Nikolic when he was in this parliament. It seems to me that she has waited until he was not in the parliament and could not speak for himself in this place to launch a pretty vicious personal attack on a great Australian who, both in parliament and his life previously in our defence forces, has made a magnificent contribution to Australia—a much more significant contribution, I might say with respect, than Senator Polley ever has or will.


Senator Polley's discussion on this health report draws to my attention the whole question of hospital funding. I commence my remarks by congratulating all of those who work in our hospitals, both public and private—the nursing staff, the support staff, the medical staff. They do a wonderful job for all Australians and it means, of course, that Australia has one of the best, if not the best, health systems anywhere on this planet. So congratulations go to all of those involved. 


My congratulations also go to Sussan Ley, the Minister for Health, who has done a wonderful job in the time that she has been the health minister, and has continued funding not only to hospitals but all aspects of the health budget. I particularly note the work that Ms Ley has done in bringing on to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme some very expensive drugs that have now been made available to ordinary members of society. I mention in passing just one of them: the drug related to fixing hepatitis C. So congratulations to the coalition government and the minister on the work she has been doing there, and also on the work she has been doing generally with hospitals.


Senator Polley's reference to Medicare alerts me yet again, with much sadness, to what is the most disgraceful episode that I have ever seen in my long life in any campaign. This was perpetrated by the unions, who control the Labor Party, with the Labor Party and with that outrageously fraudulent group called GetUp!, which is just a front for the Greens political party. I do not know what happened elsewhere, although I suspect this disgracefully dishonest campaign was conducted by the unions and the Labor Party and the Greens right throughout Australia, but I know it certainly happened in north Queensland. 


In the two pre-poll booths in Townsville there were long queues waiting to get a pre-poll, and southern unionists—not locals, I might say, but people imported by the Labor Party and the unions, from the south somewhere—were there bullying people in the queue with dishonest comments like, 'the Liberals will get rid of Medicare' and 'the Liberals are going to sell Medicare'. I mean, who would want to buy Medicare, for a start? It was a disgracefully dishonest campaign.


Further to that, the unions—and I suspect, the Labor Party—had printed cards that looked exactly the same as the Medicare card all of us have when we go to a doctor or a hospital. But these were fraudulent cards with a message on them that said the coalition government was going to sell Medicare, to get rid of Medicare. It was completely dishonest and fraudulent. This was followed up by those robocalls—unauthorised, I must say, but I do not think anyone would challenge me in saying they were paid for by the unions or the Labor Party—with voices coming across in the blackout period in the last couple of days before the election, saying, 'this is a message from your local Medicare office; the coalition government is going to get rid of Medicare', or words to that effect. This was a disgracefully lying campaign that is the lowest point that I ever seen in the long years that I have been involved in campaigns in Australia.


This campaign by the Labor Party and the unions actually scared a lot of people. Those unionists who were bullying people along the queue waiting for a vote at the pre-poll picked their mark. They would go to older people—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Polley on a point of order.




Senator Polley:
  I am sure that under standing orders, as the good senator would know, you should not be misleading the Senate. If you have something that you want to talk about on bullying at polling booths, then perhaps you should talk to your former member who was grabbing leaflets out of people's hands. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, resume your seat. As you well know, that is a debating point. Senator Macdonald, please continue.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  As I always say with those ridiculous points of order, the Labor Party will try that bullying on me. I can tell you, Senator Polley, it does not work on me. In fact, you had a couple of your union hacks on these polling booths and as they were standing there, lying to people and saying, 'the coalition will sell Medicare,' I went and stood next to them. As they would say that, I would say: 'Please ignore this. That is a complete lie.' The unionists on a couple of occasions then turned round and said to me, 'You're bullying me. You're in my space.' Me bully them! They were about five times my size! But I just told the voters who had been told a lie by these union thugs what the truth was. The unionists said, 'You're in my space.' I said, 'If you don't like it, move somewhere else or go back to Sydney, Brisbane or Hobart, from whence you obviously came.' This was the low point: trying to confuse and frighten vulnerable people into casting a vote on the basis of the most outrageous lie I have ever head in my long time in politics.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  For Senator Polley to continue the mistruths about funding by the coalition government for hospitals and health care right around Australia is equally as demeaning.


The GetUp! people are just a front for the Greens political party and the left wing of the Labor Party, and they even acknowledge that themselves now. We have always known GetUp! were a fraud, but they are confirming that themselves now. They were in the electorate of Dawson, which is in the southern part of Townsville, going down through my home town of Ayr and into Mackay. Five or six of them were there trying to run this campaign; they were not very good, I might say, but they were there in numbers. They had this big banner up saying, 'The coalition is going to sell the Mackay hospital'. Now they could not work out that although it was still in the electorate of Dawson, they had these signs about the Mackay hospital talking about a city 400 or 500 kilometres south of Townsville. Quite frankly, Townsville people were really not convinced on the way they voted because someone was talking about a hospital 400 or 500 kilometres away! But that was the standard of the sort of person that GetUp! were paying or had convinced to go and try and get rid of Mr Christensen in the electorate of Dawson. Mr Christensen increased his vote in spite of a most vicious campaign against him by the unions and GetUp!—they both set upon him. So perhaps the Labor Party will learn in the future that they should look at their resources more.


On that, I might add that the CFMEU and the MUA, I was told, sent up workers to hand out how-to-vote cards for the Glenn Lazarus Team. Remember Senator Lazarus, who was here for a short period of time? Undistinguished time, I might say. He had all these unionists up there handing out his how-to-vote cards. I think he got about one per cent of the vote. Again, I understand there are repercussions within the Labor Party for the MUA and the CFMEU putting resources into Mr Lazarus's campaign rather than the Labor one—although, of course, Lazarus's preferences all went directly to the Labor Party, as you would expect if you had seen the way then Senator Lazarus voted in this chamber.


So while this report is a majority report, you can understand where it is coming from. I think the minority report is by far the better indication of what happened in that committee.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-09-01,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (19:01):  I rise tonight    to speak on the subject of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. I believe that freedom of speech is, and always will be, the defining characteristic of democracy. A society where citizens are able to speak freely, both publicly and privately, without fear or favour, is a truly democratic one. In Australia we are incredibly lucky to have such a society, because, as we know, this is by no means the status quo around the world. We, on this side of the chamber, have traditionally been the custodians of the principle of freedom of speech, and it is a record of which I am incredibly proud. 


In On Liberty, JS Mill writes that the principle of freedom of speech is incredibly important, almost as important as the concept of liberty of thought. Mill believed that in a democracy there should be 'absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral or theological'. Freedom of speech is democracy. Like Mill, I consider the principle of freedom of speech to be fundamental. It is important to our nation and to our citizens but also to the world. 


I have watched with interest the recent developments in Queensland and Tasmania concerning freedom of speech. Tasmania's draft changes to the state's Anti-Discrimination Act were announced in late August. These proposed amendments would make it illegal to offend, humiliate, intimidate, insult or ridicule on the basis of—and there is quite a list—race, age, sexual orientation, lawful sexual activity, gender, gender identity, intersex, marital status, pregnancy, breastfeeding, parental status, family responsibilities and disability. There has been a great deal of debate around these proposed amendments, particularly around whether they go too far and whether they unduly stifle freedom of speech. I think this debate will continue for some time. But debate is good. Debate is a good thing. 


I spoke yesterday, in my first speech, about the wisdom of crowds. Diverse groups of people with diverse opinions bring different views, different perspectives and different values to the table. They make better decisions together. They make better, more effective and more encompassing decisions than groups who share similar views. We are all aware that there are many differing views in Australian society on 18C, and it is undeniably an important issue. Reflective of society as we are, among my colleagues there are also different views on 18C. Some believe that 18C should remain as it currently stands. Others believe that the terms 'offend' and 'insult' should be removed. Some believe that section 18D, which lists the exemptions to 18C, is a sufficient counterbalance. Others believe that the 'reasonable person' test should be applied to both 18C and 18D. These are all differing views—all valid—and I believe they should all be debated, for the best result of that debate will reflect the wisdom of crowds. 


I strongly believe that freedom of speech should be applied in debating the principle of freedom of speech. The regulation of free speech is a dangerous act. It is much easier to regulate something than to deregulate it. You cannot regulate what people think, as much as some covet the ability to do so. But I fully understand the government's position on this matter. The government recognises the diverse range of community views on 18C, and it welcomes reasonable and legitimate debate on all sides of this issue. The government has also made it clear that it has no plans to bring forward amendments to 18C. There are other things to be done. There are pressing, urgent issues that must be addressed. 


I thank the chamber for allowing me to speak freely on a matter of such importance. I am reminded of the often-misquoted words: 'I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'
