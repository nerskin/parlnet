"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-12-09,"—I want to speak briefly on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. The first bill is principally designed to enable the availability of FEE-HELP for students attending the USA based Carnegie Mellon University which will operate in my home town of Adelaide from March next year. The package of bills also seeks to improve consumer protection measures for higher education students through changes to tuition assurance arrangements and also lays bare the government’s hypocrisy on the question of compulsory fees for amenities and services.
These bills will allow Carnegie Mellon to be the first foreign owned university to offer courses to Australian and overseas students in Australia by creating a new category of Table C higher education providers in the Higher Education Support Act. Table C providers will be able to access the FEE-HELP loans scheme for Australian fee-paying higher education students; and, providing they comply with the requirements of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act, table C providers may offer courses to overseas students in Australia. They will not be able to access what are known as HECS places.
Any assessment of Carnegie Mellon reveals its outstanding international reputation. The international recognition of its bona fides as a university is based on its certification of accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, a United States higher education accrediting agency. The Australian University Quality Agency has attested to the bona fides of the middle states commission as a quality assurance agency of international standing. The qualifications Carnegie Mellon is seeking to offer have been successfully assessed against the Australian qualification framework and verified that they meet the standards of an Australian qualification.
In July the South Australian government announced that Carnegie Mellon had successfully applied to be registered as a university. This is the first time a non-self-accrediting higher education institution has been approved to operate as a university in Australia. Within our system all universities are self-accrediting. Self-accreditation is seen within Australia as an expression of confidence in a higher education institution by the government, suggesting that the government has a sufficient degree of faith and trust in the educational quality and operational robustness of an institution to permit it to approve its own courses.
Labor places great importance on the protection of the name and concept of a university. Currently this protection is embodied in the national protocols, which are a vital tool for protecting the standard and reputation of Australia universities and their students. So much of Australia’s good international academic standing depends on the reputation of our universities as being first-class centres for teaching and research. Labor does believe, however, that Carnegie Mellon’s acceptance into Australia and the legislative change this move is forcing should not allow open slather for any and all comers. The accreditation process must be thorough, comprehensive and transparent. In this case the expert panel of higher education specialists required under the protocols to examine evidence of compliance unanimously agreed that the Minister for Education, Science and Training should endorse Carnegie Mellon’s application. Public confidence in the approvals process would be strengthened by greater transparency. It is unfortunate that in this case the South Australian government feel that other legislation constrains them from making the panel’s assessment publicly available.
Labor are concerned about any diminution of the requirements to become recognised as a university. We are not attracted to arguments that access to the term ‘university’ should be relaxed, as we believe this would devalue the very essence of what is essential about our universities. In relation to either Carnegie Mellon specifically or more generally, our position is clear: that the establishment of foreign universities in Australia to offer programs for both domestic and international students must undergo a rigorous assessment process and that each application must be thoroughly assessed on its merits. If Carnegie Mellon’s application is to set any sort of precedent it is to reinforce a process of rigorous examination of the merits of each case and to ensure the applicants adhere to strict and quality standards.
The second aspect of these bills is provisions to clarify and strengthen the operation of the tuition assurance arrangements for fee-paying higher education students. The amendments stipulate that if a provider is unable to continue to offer courses to students then the affected students will have the option of transferring to another provider to complete their studies or seeking a refund of their fees for uncompleted units. Labor hopes that the provisions of this package of bills which alter the tuition assurance arrangements for higher education students will strengthen and improve consumer protection in circumstances where a student’s education provider is unable to continue to offer the units for study for which the student is enrolled. The higher education market is important to the Australian economy. It is a market where quality offerings and good reputation are critical to continued strong performance. Labor supports measures designed to uphold and protect Australia’s reputation and, importantly, to protect students.
It is the third aspect of this legislative package which is the most breathtaking. Aspects of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 are a fantastic mix of the hypocrisy, ideological obsession, contradiction and incompetence we have come to expect from this minister for education and this government. I note that the Senate is being kept back today primarily to deal with the voluntary student unionism legislation. We have not been advised as to whether that will in fact come on.
Items 5 and 6 of schedule 1 of the ESOS amendment bill are designed to allow higher education providers to continue to charge a fee to overseas students for a range of services that they are obligated to provide under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. The services that universities must provide under that act, and the national guidelines, include independent grievance handling, dispute resolution, counselling, orientation services, accommodation advice and academic progress advice. If these services sound familiar it is because they are some of the services currently provided by the much maligned university student organisations. The ESOS Act even requires providers to have a student contact officer who is responsible for the provision of counselling and other services. The act requires providers’ compliance with the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students, which requires the student contact officers to:
... Promote the successful adjustment by overseas students to life and study at an Australian institution.
... Assist students to resolve problems which could impede successful completion of their study programs.
The national code specifies that registered providers must have in place ‘appropriate support services and be able to demonstrate the advice provided to intending overseas students on these services’. This means that the government is happy to ensure that student services continue to be provided for overseas students but wants to see them wither away for local students. This is a massive act of hypocrisy by the Howard government. On the one hand, through this bill, the government is enshrining the right of universities and other education providers to charge a fee for services for overseas students, while on the other hand, through their so-called voluntary student unionism legislation, the government seeks to outlaw universities charging Australian students a fee for precisely the same purposes.
The rationale behind the ESOS bill is that the government has realised that, if its extreme and destructive antistudent services legislation were passed, this could conflict with universities’ obligations under the ESOS Act. So sections of this bill are a fix for a problem that would not exist but for the extreme and ideologically driven agenda of the Howard government; an agenda that has been so driven by ideological fervour from those opposite, that they cannot see the devastation it will bring and they cannot find a reasonable way to get it through the parliament. The government continues to refuse to countenance sensible compromises advocated by both the opposition and Senator Joyce. Frankly, it would make more sense to drop these destructive plans altogether.
The so-called VSU legislation will destroy vital campus services that support university students such as child care, counselling, legal advice and sporting organisations. Of course, we know that this attack will hit outer metropolitan and regional universities the hardest. This extreme attack has been opposed by everyone from student organisations, vice chancellors, university staff and campus chaplains, to high profile sportspeople and administrators, including prominent Olympians, high-profile performers and artists and, of course, members from political parties from all sides of this parliament. They have all expressed their concerns about the impact of the government’s attack on university services.
The opposition believes that Minister Nelson, and the government, should stop playing student politics, support Labor’s amendment and support these important student services. In light of the government’s obvious confusion—it has been made very clear to the chamber over the last 24 hours that it is in a complete state of confusion about this issue—it is unclear why elements of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill that are being debated today still need to proceed. Instead of amending the ESOS Act to be consistent with the government’s false rhetoric of student choice, this government has introduced a bill that would allow a fee to be charged to one set of students, those coming from overseas, but not to local students. Yet, such a stubborn, arrogant and extreme government cannot yet admit publicly that its so-called VSU legislation is both misguided and destructive.
What the government has failed to grasp is that student services for Australian and international students will not be possible without the infrastructure and capital accumulated by student organisations. The fact is that universities rely on these organisations and their services for all students to meet their obligations under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. It is the economies of scale realised through mass participation in student services that allow these services to be provided for overseas students. If the minister were to drop the VSU legislation, we would not need this part of the ESOS amendment bill at all. Labor strongly oppose the Howard government’s push to end proper and decent arrangements for funding student services. Labor will not oppose the bills before us today, simply because we believe that all students should be given this same opportunity to maintain and preserve all the important support services provided by student organisations.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-12-09,"—The Greens are very worried about the future of higher education in this country. We can see a disaster coming down the track and it will be one of this government’s making. There remains an urgent need to back our public universities, to fund them with appropriate indexation and to ensure that access to university remains a viable and attractive prospect for future students.
But the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 do not do that. These bills seek to change the law, a law only recently written, to allow foreign universities to set up shop in Australia to compete for overseas students, for domestic students and for some level of federal government funding. These institutions will, of course, be private fee-charging institutions. They will not be set up with a mission focused on the long-term benefits of Australian students’ education; they are coming to make money. They may, as in the case of Carnegie Mellon—the first cab off the international privatisation rank—be respected universities in their home countries, and indeed be non-profit making educational institutions, but their mission for their overseas operations is to make money. Carnegie Mellon would not be setting up in South Australia if they thought they would lose money.
The minister has said this about his brave new world:
The introduction into the sector of such a highly regarded international university will increase diversity and choice within the Australian higher education sector, make Australia more globally competitive and part of the global higher education marketplace and attract students from around the world who are seeking a high-quality education experience.
So, in case anyone missed the key words, they were: diversity, choice, competitive and marketplace. The future of the physical and intellectual infrastructure of our higher education system is to be entrusted to the marketplace, which will—via the magic of competition—deliver choice and a high-quality education experience. What he does not say of course is, ‘For those who can afford it.’ But more of that later.
This is not new. I have been talking in the Senate, since I got here in August 2002, about the way in which the government is pursuing an extreme policy of education privatisation. The first bill I spoke on in the Senate was a bill to extend government fee subsidies to private institutions. There were just three at the time and since then another 30 or so have been added to the list. We have also seen the expansion of one of our existing private universities, Notre Dame, with Commonwealth dollars, and now we are dealing with the first new university to enter the government’s international education marketplace. In those three years, we have seen an acceleration of the drift in funding for our universities from public to private sources.
Our public universities were publicly funded when the Howard government came to power. The share of public funding—that is not including HECS, which is, of course, mostly private funding from students—was just over 60 per cent. Since then HECS levels have been raised twice, restrictions on university student intakes have been lifted, domestic full fee-paying students have been introduced and core indexation has been removed. The result is that our public universities are now largely private. The proportion of funding coming from public sources to our universities is now 40 per cent. Most of the money running higher education is now private.
A lot of that increase in private funding has come from the influx of overseas students. There has been a gold rush of interest in Australian degrees from the overseas—mostly Asian—marketplace, with enrolments jumping from 53,000 in 1996 to over 210,000 last year, as a result of federal government policy. Now around 20 per cent of university revenue comes from this stream. It is not additional or top-up revenue; it is part of the basic core operating revenue for universities. If it goes, there will be massive financial problems for the sector.
There has been a revolution in the way our higher education sector is run. This government has pushed as hard as it can to float our higher education system on the high seas of the international market. Now, as Carnegie Mellon appears on the horizon, the impact of this choice will become clear to those who have ignored it up until now. This choice is ushering in a future that for the minister is full of promise. It is full of promise of increasingly limited government spending on higher education. It is a promise of overseas investment in self-interested institutions taking up the responsibility for providing Australia with the knowledge factories of the future. And it is full of the promise of a qualification industry continuing to take advantage of the gold rush in education services from Asia.
For the Greens this future is fraught with danger. It is a future that threatens to leave Australian and overseas students high and dry. Like a gambler with a sure fire system, the government has put more and more of its chips on the same numbers. The government is betting that interest from large numbers of wealthy overseas students in purchasing Australian based degrees will continue. It is gambling that a sustaining domestic fee-paying market for degrees will grow. It is gambling that overseas and domestic education investors will continue to see a return in Australia and will continue to invest. And, finally, it is gambling that it can continue to underfund the higher education sector whilst these other players fill the gap. This is recklessly extreme public policy that is really playing fast and loose with the skills and knowledge base of our future. None of these assumptions are solid, and many of them are downright shaky. It is not difficult to see that, if some of the gold rush conditions of the overseas student market change and other demographic and economic factors turn around, then the market will crash, investment will flee, leaving a system starved of public investment that will have lost intellectual and physical capital and be unable to take up the slack.
In the latest edition of the Australian Universities Review there was an article by Michael Gallagher, who is the Director of Policy and Planning at the Australian National University. He shares the Greens’s concerns about the direction of government policy on higher education, and he points to worrying demographic and economic trends that underpin the point I have been making. He says, ‘The recent raft of changes to higher education policy, if implemented, will I believe only be able to operate for between two and four years before they implode.’ What he is concerned about is that a policy that is predicated on the delivery of fee-paying students is in trouble when we recognise that the cohort of 15- to 24-year-olds who dominate demand for higher education will be in decline after 2010. Not only that but the data on the effect of economic value of getting a bachelor’s degree indicates that the worth is decreasing relative to earlier cohorts experiences, and this is happening at a time when degrees are becoming more expensive. Put simply, degrees are not worth what they used to be and they are a lot more expensive. This of course means there will be less demand. This leaves universities scrabbling to maintain their domestic student revenue, but this government continues to introduce measures which are disincentives for students to attend university—the increasing of fees and the lower service levels, as proposed in the voluntary student unionism legislation.
But it is perhaps the perilous reliance that the system now has on overseas students that is more concerning. There is no assurance that the boom times will continue regarding overseas student enrolments; indeed, quite the opposite. The latest government data tells us the enrolments are continuing to grow, but a close examination of the figures should give us pause for thought. The growth as of August this year in enrolments of overseas students was 6.5 per cent but most of that growth—42 per cent—came from India, which is a relatively new supplier of overseas students, and from China, which continues to dominate with around half the total enrolments. However, commencements or new students—that is, students enrolling for the first time—are not doing so well, with only a three per cent growth so far this year but with commencements in full retreat from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.
These trends are worrying because of the developments behind them. We know that China, Singapore and Malaysia have all increased their investment in domestic higher education places, which may explain the trend emerging from these near Asian neighbours. We can expect this to continue into the future. Growth in those economies may well look well established, but natural disasters, political instability and a coming global recession could drastically change that picture. As soon as that happens, the flow of students will dramatically decrease, particularly when domestic options are becoming more attractive economically and educationally.
These are the shifting sands on which our brave new higher education system is being built, and of which this bill is an element. Already our domestic providers are under pressure, particularly the smaller and newer universities. In South Australia, where Carnegie Mellon is poised to set up shop, there are three established universities: the University of South Australia, Flinders University and University of Adelaide. None of these institutions would claim to be awash with money, and they will now all face more competition for their students, thanks to this legislation. An ugly side effect of this increased competition is also the pressure on universities to take in increasingly poor quality students. Anecdotal evidence has been indicating this trend for some time. In May this year, the Sydney Morning Herald carried the following story about Macquarie University:
A Macquarie University professor of economics, Peter Abelson, fails 40 per cent of students in his second-year course. “We have students who have failed the course four to five times. At least one student has failed it six times,” he says. “It is an absurd situation.”
He goes on to say:
The summer school has failure rates of 60 to 70 per cent. It’s dishonest because we have ... people into courses simply to take their money.
There appears to be growing evidence that this phenomenon is being repeated around the country as institutions scrabble to maintain this funding stream. But, of course, the process leaves standards dented across the board. It therefore damages the reputation of Australian university education and so puts more downward pressure on enrolments.
This bill then comes as the latest measure to carry on with this high-risk policy. The introduction of a new university into the sector is far from obviously going to be in the long-term benefit of students, particularly in South Australia. This bill is more about attaining economic statistical goals—that is, increases in GDP or export figures—not educational goals. It is more about the government’s desire to withdraw from its funding responsibilities than any concern for the future health of the education sector. Perhaps saddest of all, it is probably a little bit to do with the minister’s fetish of having a top-100 university in Australia, and an American one at that.
The measures contained in this bill will cost a few million dollars in government subsidies to fee-paying students attending Carnegie Mellon. But it also opens the door to other institutions who will also demand access to the FEE-HELP arrangements. It is not clear what budgetary parameters are being put on this program. Will these FEE-HELP dollars be capped? Ultimately, they surely must be. When that happens, the competition for places will further impact on the viability of existing domestic comprehensive universities as they find their access to limited government-supported places is being taken up by private providers who trade on overseas reputations but do not provide the full range of services in institutions in Australia on which these reputations were built.
The Greens want to see the long-term interests of education standards in Australia take precedence. We see it as the responsibility of the Commonwealth to ensure that the higher education system can sustainably provide high-quality accessible education into the future. It is essential that this capability is preserved. But, as I hope to have shown, this is not what is being done by the policy of privatisation. The very first thing that a government which is committed to providing a sustainable high quality accessible university system in Australia would do is appropriately index the core funding that is supplied to our public universities. Appropriate indexation would reduce the need for universities to charge such high student fees as are charged now. It would provide some basic funding equity across the system and allow university administrators to sensibly plan for the future. Beyond this basic first step, the Greens are calling on increased funding to abolish fees for domestic undergraduate students. This is about equity, but it is also about ensuring that higher education remains a valuable goal for all Australians and particularly for young Australians.
The government talks about diversity. The Greens say that the public university system is already providing a diverse range of options and could do more, but, without appropriate backing and funding, this diversity will be lost. Higher education providers are being invited to pursue the same fee-paying dollar and tailor courses and institutions accordingly. Where is the diversity in Australia becoming the business studies school of the Asia-Pacific region? The Greens do not support this bill. We reject its role in the ongoing privatisation of our higher education system. We reject its continuation of the high stakes game of chance that this government is playing with our universities’ futures. We reject the approach implicit in this bill that somehow taxpayers’ money is better spent encouraging overseas providers to set up cash cow operations in Australia than investing in the public university system.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-12-09,"—It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. The essence of the first bill is to amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to make it possible for Carnegie Mellon University to establish an overseas branch in Australia, to be located in Adelaide—your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman—from January 2006. There are also, under this bill, tuition assurance requirements provided under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and some technical amendments required by the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
The first bill will insert a new category of table C providers within the Higher Education Support Act. There are currently table A providers—that is, 37 public universities and other higher education providers such as the Australian Maritime College and the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education—and three table B providers—that is, self-accrediting higher education providers, Bond University, the University of Notre Dame Australia and the Melbourne College of Divinity.
Table C providers under this legislation will be for approved overseas higher education institutions. This will provide an operational framework for all approved overseas higher education institutions to operate a branch in Australia. As well, approved overseas higher education providers will have limited access to certain Commonwealth assistance including FEE-HELP and Aushelp. This will enable, as I said, a new private, not-for-profit United States based institution, Carnegie Mellon, to operate as a university in Adelaide and access FEE-HELP and Aushelp for eligible students studying at its Australian branch. It will strengthen and clarify issues relating to eligible students attending Australian branches of an approved higher education provider as well as make other technical amendments.
Certainly, the tuition assurance provisions, which are provided under the higher education legislation measures, strengthen and clarify the tuition assurance requirements which protect students studying at non-table-A providers so that students in this category have comprehensive and robust consumer protection in the event that a provider ceases to offer a course in which a student was enrolled. Students will have the option of various other procedures and that gives them the reassurance that they are not alone if something happens to their provider. You may well ask why the Australian government is supporting the introduction of foreign universities into Australia. Unlike the Greens, the Australian government is committed to the development of a strong and high-quality higher education centre that is internationally competitive. This underpins our own nation’s economic, cultural and social development.
Higher education is increasingly delivered in a global context, with international benchmarking being a key measure of quality. Australian institutions, our own institutions, are part of that global context and they should be exposed to different forms of educational provision if they are to remain internationally relevant. The entry of foreign universities such as Carnegie Mellon will enable Australian institutions to compare their offerings and their methods of operation with other institutions that are highly regarded internationally. Our own practices and efficiencies will improve within the Australian system as a result of this process. Indeed, it is envisaged that the operation of foreign universities in Australia will facilitate the exchange of academic staff, which will benefit the quality of teaching and research within Australian based institutions. We simply cannot remain insular and parochial within this international environment.
In addition, the Australian government is committed to free trade internationally and we have recently concluded a number of free trade agreements. These agreements, while making limited commitment to public higher education, permit universities based in other countries to operate in Australia as long as they meet certain appropriate standards of quality. Just as we are establishing branches, campuses and collaborations in other countries, foreign countries are increasingly looking to expand their investment and their markets overseas. In the changes proposed to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 we will be able to provide a framework for the higher education sector in Australia to allow the further globalisation of provision and to assist Australia to compete internationally.
Carnegie Mellon is the first foreign university to establish a branch within Australia and these amendments provide the opportunity for other foreign universities to also establish themselves here provided they meet the same stringent accreditation, approval and quality and accountability requirements that are in place for our own higher education providers. For the first time Australian universities will be able to actively collaborate with foreign universities on Australian soil. We will have the introduction into Australia of highly trained and internationally respected academics. This will facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas and we will have innovative learning, teaching and research practices that will further enrich the Australian university experience not only for higher education students but also for the wider community.
Again, students will have increased choice in respect of course offerings. Subject to relevant state and territory approval, foreign universities will be able to offer Australian students world-class degrees and postgraduate qualifications not currently available to them in Australia. Carnegie Mellon University is a high-quality education and research institution. It ranks 38 out of 200 on the Times Higher Education Supplement ranking of the world’s top universities. It ranks No. 54 out of 500 on the Yau Tong University’s ranking of the world’s top universities. Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science was ranked first in the 2002 US News & World Report magazine survey of graduate programs and Carnegie Mellon H John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management ranks eighth in the USA for the quality of its courses.
We are putting in place a range of FEE-HELP loans to eligible students at the Australian branch but we will provide no funding to Carnegie Mellon University so we are not depriving Australian universities of any funding by doing this. In addition, Carnegie Mellon University will not be eligible for any research funding or other grants, including grants under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, so the limited pool of funding for higher education in Australia will not be diluted following the introduction of any foreign university. I am very pleased that the South Australian government have supported Carnegie Mellon’s entry into Australia through establishment grants. They will be providing $20 million over the next four years to support the establishment of the Carnegie Mellon University, and that includes scholarships, operational support and start-up grants.
The introduction of not only this university, but also, hopefully, other foreign universities, will increase diversity and choice within the Australian higher education sector. It will establish Australia as being seen to be open and receptive to different forms of educational provision, including through the establishment of branch campuses of foreign universities. It will make Australia more globally competitive and part of the global higher education marketplace. It will elevate the international standing and attractiveness of our country as a preferred choice education destination. It will attract students from around the world who are seeking a high-quality education experience in a safe and unique environment through either an Australian provider, of which we have many, or from an internationally recognised university. All of that is very important.
I would like to turn briefly now to Senator Wong’s comments on her attempt to link this legislation to our legislation dealing with voluntary student unionism. I would simply like to say that it is unfortunate that Senator Wong does not realise that the amendments to the ESOS Act, the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill, are about reinforcing existing arrangements and clarifying that providers are able to charge a fee to cover the cost of their obligations under the ESOS framework. The government greatly value and support the wide range of benefits international students bring to our society and we have in place a strong framework of regulatory requirements to protect the education experience of students in Australia.
The ESOS Act safeguards the interests of students coming into Australia by providing consumer protection and setting standards for education providers. That is in fact a major attraction for students to come to Australia. Higher education providers are required to make available to overseas students certain services required under the ESOS national code of practice for registration authorities and providers of education and training to overseas students, and there will be no change to this requirement. This has nothing to do with our legislation on voluntary student unionism. Like other students, overseas students will participate in the non-academic activities that they think will enhance their experience in Australia and they will be prepared to pay for them. So Senator Wong is totally wrong on this point. I think she is intentionally trying to link voluntary student unionism with this legislation, which is totally out of place in this context.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-12-09,"—I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 as well as the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. Obviously we are dealing with these bills in a cognate fashion, even though they are not necessarily linked, but I understand that they have the support of the majority of the chamber. Indeed, I go so far as to describe them as non-controversial legislation, and that begs the question—it is not a philosophical one—why are we here having potentially one of the longest debates on legislation that we have had in the last couple of days, with a speakers list that includes a number of government senators? While I respect and applaud their right to be on that list, I am just wondering if there is a particular motive for us to have a long debate over two non-controversial cognate bills that, arguably, could have been dealt with in the last few days, given the government’s hurried guillotining and gagging of debates.
Senator Troeth told the chamber that it is disingenuous for any of us to make a link between this legislation and voluntary student unionism. That is an extraordinary comment, given that one of the bills we are considering—specifically the ESOS legislation—deals with a compulsory student union fee at the same time as we are supposed to be considering legislation that deals with the so-called abolition of compulsory student fees, or universal student membership through student organisations—so-called voluntary student unionism. First of all, it is quite disingenuous not to make that link when there is a fairly obvious link before us in the bill today, and, secondly, when some of us in this place are quite conscious of the fact that we are here having long debates over non-controversial legislation, just in case there are some backroom deals on legislation, specifically the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005, the bill listed as No. 6, although there is no actual figure today. I am wondering why this is even on the red for today, given that no-one has been notified that this legislation will actually be debated. So I wonder what is going on in the backroom discussions and deals at the moment. I am under no illusions as to why the speakers list on such non-controversial legislation has suddenly bumped out.
The first of these bills—and it has been addressed in detail previously by colleagues—the legislation dealing with the establishment of Carnegie Mellon, is theoretically straightforward. The main purpose of the bill is to amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the HESA, and the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, ESOS, to enable foreign universities to operate in Australia and provide courses for domestic as well as international students. Specifically, the amendments that are contained within the legislation allow for the establishment in Australia—in fact, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, in our home state of South Australia—of a branch of the Carnegie Mellon University, which is based in Pittsburgh in the United States.
The Australian Democrats’ views on this legislation have been made public before and, indeed, we provided a short supplementary report to the Senate committee that looked into this legislation. Our views specifically on publicly funded and accessible education are well known; our concern about the privatisation of universities, whether they are foreign or domestic, is widely known as well. Having said that, we recognise also that this legislation has both state and Commonwealth support. It has bipartisan support—that is, it is supported strongly by the government in this place and, indeed, supported by the Australian Labor Party in both houses. We recognise, too, that it is expected to bring significant financial benefit to the state of South Australia, but the Democrats have made it clear from day one that we think it is imperative that adequate safeguards are built into the legislation to ensure that the reputation of our public universities is protected.
In order to do that, as I flagged in my committee report, the Australian Democrats are endorsing—and, indeed, today I will be moving an amendment—the recommendation of the National Tertiary Education Union, the NTEU, that the Senate amend the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 to ensure that table C providers are listed under the table by which they have been accredited in Australia and that the Senate amend the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill so that overseas universities accessing table C must meet the test set out in protocol 1 of the national protocols for higher education approval processes to be able to access university title in Australia. So, while we recognise and support the tuition assurance requirements contained in the legislation, we believe that our amendments will go a little further to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place.
I want to put on record some of the concerns that have been listed by the National Tertiary Education Union. They have made very clear their concerns about the idea of extending such public funds—because we are talking about public dollars, state dollars, going towards a private institution—not only in their submission to the Senate inquiry but also in public statements. They have claimed that they are concerned that the South Australian government’s decision to assess Carnegie Mellon’s application in secret could set a precedent for other state and territory governments in relation to similar applications. As has been already mooted in this place, the issue of transparency and accountability in relation to the application process is an issue.
They go on to say that the reputation of Australia’s university system rests on the maintenance of strong accreditation standards, including open and transparent community consultation. This is particularly important, they go on to note, because significant public funding is being provided to Carnegie Mellon, including the South Australian government’s decision to commit to the institution. They believe that it is important that the South Australian government now publicly release all information about the Carnegie Mellon proposal. I want to endorse that call today. I know the opposition spokesperson on behalf of the ALP said that it was unfortunate that the state government felt constrained by other legislation, but certainly we think there is a strong argument for more information to be revealed in the interests of the people in my home state as well as the people in the Commonwealth.
The National Tertiary Education Union state that Carnegie Mellon is the first application made by a foreign provider to operate as a university under the national protocols and as such—and we agree with them here very strongly—could have major implications for the Australian higher education sector. The higher education sector cannot make any meaningful assessment of the South Australian government’s decision in relation to Carnegie Mellon, however, because no information about it has been made public. They go on to say that previous applications by institutions to operate as universities in Australia have been assessed by a rigorous and transparent process, which has included the full disclosure of documents relevant to the application, and consultation with interested groups in the sector. That has not happened adequately in this case and we certainly call on the South Australian government, recognising that it is their role, to provide some of that information. Indeed, I think they have been woeful in the lack of consultation. Having said that, I do recognise the support of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the institutions in my home state for the establishment of such a branch of Carnegie Mellon.
The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, which has been touched on in this place and linked I think inevitably to the broader debate about so-called voluntary student unionism, is only really necessary if the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 is passed and the collection of a universal service fee at universities is banned. This is linked to voluntary student unionism and the very legislation that is being debated in backrooms and corridors right now; otherwise, why else would we be here debating a non-controversial bill?
As the Democrats have stated in our minority report, our additional report to the Senate committee process, this bill alone—the one before us—will not adequately protect the availability and the affordability of student services for international students or for domestic students. Fees collected under so-called VSU, even with the passage of this bill—so even with the so-called safeguards this bill is supposed to enshrine for international students—will not be enough to ensure that those vital student services are retained and kept afloat. Furthermore, many of the services that do survive will be forced to increase dramatically the cost of the services they offer which, as all senators know, are currently subsidised by the payment of a universal student fee.
Our office and obviously the Senate committee process heard from the National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia, the NLC, as well as the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations. They put on record very clearly their concerns that this fee for international students would be increased in order to support the services. Let us face it: the fee is already significantly higher for those international students than it is for domestic students. They have good reason to fear the fee will increase not only as a consequence of the VSU but because history tells us that in this country, with the deregulation of the overseas student market in education, we have used and exploited international student services and international students as cash cows.
We have recognised in this country for many, many decades the importance culturally, intellectually and socially of international students coming to our country and studying at our institutions. But it is only in the last two decades under the previous Labor government and now this coalition government that those students have been forced to pay higher and higher fees in order to not just cover the costs of their education but increasingly subsidise other costs of university life—a consequence of massive chronic and consistent underfunding for universities through their operating grants by successive governments. International students are not unused to being treated as cash cows. This bill basically underlines that.
The government recognises that it has responsibilities and obligations to provide a certain standard of services, as it should under its ESOS obligations, for international students, and that cannot be undermined. Thus the government has had to realise that it has to put this legislation through in the event of the voluntary student unionism legislation being passed in this chamber, whether today or next year, because it has to ensure those standards are maintained. But the impact this is going to have on student services, domestic and international, and the fees they pay I can only begin to imagine.
That brings us back to the point of so-called voluntary student unionism. Again, I ask the question: why do we have so many members on a speaking list for arguably non-controversial legislation? It is a question that all members on the crossbenches and indeed in the non-government parties today are wondering about. Perhaps the Manager of Government Business or someone else might want to enlighten us as to whether we will be here this afternoon, this final day of the parliamentary year, because there are discussions taking place in various offices—and we can only begin to imagine which ones they are. It does beg the question why we are here today. What are the likely effects of the voluntary student unionism legislation? It is obviously a fait accompli in that the government would not be putting forward this ESOS legislation unless it thought voluntary student unionism was going to pass this place.
Like other senators in this chamber, particularly the opposition and Greens senators, I want to make very clear how the Australian Democrats feel about the proposed passage of that legislation as it is linked to this legislation. We are strong advocates of universal services payments. We are strong advocates of the right of students and their organisations to organise democratically. We have long recognised the vital services that are provided by student unions, student associations and student guilds. We recognise that all of these services are threatened under the government’s proposals—government proposals linked to the legislation we are debating today—whether those services are subsidised catering, welfare, advocacy, representation or media.
I might add that in our home state as of 30 November last week the University of Adelaide university radio 5UV will no longer be providing student radio. They have been providing it since around 1972, arguably one of the longest-running student radio stations in the world. What has happened to it? It is no longer going to be funded because the university and the students cannot pay for it. That is the end of a wonderful tradition that has marked our state and our capital city. Many of us—and some in this place—got our start in student radio and at radio 5UV. I want to put on record how sad it is that that particular form of student media will no longer be provided—and that is directly as a consequence of the proposed student unionism legislation that this government wants to ram through the parliament.
Whether it is media, advocacy, welfare, child care or other services or sporting clubs, religious clubs or other clubs, all of these vital parts of a campus experience will be gone. When we talk about the campus experience, I want to talk about the holistic experience that is university life. It is not just a degree factory that students attend or people aspire to attend; it is a holistic experience that includes the broadening of academic, social, cultural, intellectual, sporting, religious and other horizons. Who are we—who is this parliament—to deny students that university experience, especially when many of us have had that experience, including many in the cabinet?
As for the notion that a universal fee that is paid by students on their campuses is somehow akin to a trade union fee, that is wrong. It has been shown in law to be wrong. It has been made very clear that the payment of a universal fee on campus is more akin to the payment of a council rate. It is a fee that members of your local community contribute to pay for council services and responsibilities. Let us not muddle this debate up with some kind of vendetta against the trade union movement.
As Senator Kemp made clear in his response to a question without notice from Senator Lundy this week in question time, it is clear that there is an element of vendetta in this. There is an ideological and political motive. It is about getting even with some of those student representatives and student politicians. I would have thought that a number of those people in the cabinet could work out any of those vendettas in this place if they wanted to and not take them out on current and future generations of students and aspiring students.
The government has also with this legislation sought to quash dissent. When we talk of vendettas, the government is so worried about different views and different voices. We have seen in the past nine years the way that organisations and NGOs have been shut down or had their funding closed, limited or threatened in some way. Now it is the students’ turn. There are many government senators in this place who have been prepared to stand up and say that they are not happy with the way that student organisations have directed their funds. I would be hard pressed to find anyone who is completely happy with the way that student organisations direct their funds, but when they do they should do it in a democratic fashion and they should do it in a way that marks student control of student affairs. It should not be about governments intruding, it should not be about politicians intruding and it should not be about the university administration intruding on the disbursement of those funds which are collected from and used by the students.
But I am not surprised that university autonomy has been interfered with, whether it is through this legislation or any other. Arguably, in the last year we have seen more legislation—certainly since the passage of HESA—that interferes with university autonomy than ever before. The sector knows that, the NTEU knows that, the academic and general staff know that, students know that and the Australian vice-chancellors know that. We have reached a new low—HECS hikes, up-front fees, the deregulation of the postgraduate sector, the deregulation of overseas students; and now voluntary student unionism. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2005-12-09,"—It is a great pleasure to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. Coming from an educational background, the matters touched on in the bills are matters very close to my own heart, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on them. It is important to put them in the context of the changes that have been taking place in higher education over a long period of time. It is perhaps appropriate at the very beginning of my contribution to underscore the fact that the Howard government in 2005-06 will put a record amount of money into higher education—$7.8 billion. That will be a significant contribution overall to the sector. What is important about these bills is that they move us in the direction of greater diversity in the higher education sector, which is a matter on which I have spoken in this chamber in the past and a matter in which I believe very keenly. It is a direction in which we certainly need to be moving. For my part, these bills advance that cause, and I am delighted to see that.
In her contribution to the debate, Senator Nettle made the observation that she and her party were striving for equity in undergraduate education by, as I understood her argument, increasing the opportunities for greater access to higher education for undergraduates, largely for non-fee paying students. This sounds to me rather less like equity than insanity. As with so much of the Greens’ policy on so many issues, the numbers just do not compute. We would find ourselves in a situation where other areas of public policy which demanded considerable public expenditure would be found wanting if we were to go down that path. So that contribution adds almost nothing to the debate.
It is regrettable that Senator Stott Despoja is so suspicious about the reasons for this debate taking place. It is important to recognise that issues of higher education are matters of national importance in Australia. One could even argue that they are matters of national security. Nothing is more fundamental. I recall saying in my maiden speech in this chamber that I regarded matters of higher education as being critical to the nation’s future. Nothing has occurred to change my views on those matters in the last several months. These are matters of vital international and national importance. It is right and proper that we should be spending time debating them.
It is also to be observed that this is not an uncontroversial bill. The Labor Party is proposing amendments to the bill. We ought to recognise the fact that we have a difference of opinion on aspects of this bill which make it less than straightforward. In my contribution I want to put these changes in a wider context. I think it is important to understand that in the last 15 to 20 years there has been a virtual revolution in the nature of university education. There has been a fundamental change in the way in which not just Australia but countries around the world approach matters of higher education. I would argue that this revolution has taken place in broadly three phases. The first of these, and perhaps the least successful of them from my perspective, were the great Dawkins reforms of 1988. The Dawkins reforms had one good, valuable and, one might say, virtuous consequence, which was that they opened up the Australian higher education market to a wider range of participants. Prior to 1988 it was essentially an elite system of higher education. A consequence of the Dawkins reforms was that it became a mass education system. It opened up opportunities for people who had not previously thought about going to university or who had had little opportunity to go to university for various reasons—perhaps matters of culture or socioeconomic circumstances. There are various reasons one can easily think of why people might have been disinclined to go to university. The Dawkins reforms did one good thing, which was to open up the university sector to people who would not otherwise have got there.
In almost every other respect the reforms were a disaster because they resulted in a highly homogenised university sector. Every university, after the reforms were consolidated, looked much like every other university. So we were left with, essentially, far fewer educational choices in this country. We were left with a situation where we had, by the early part of this century, 37 public universities, all of which were doing essentially the same kinds of things, providing little choice to students and little choice in educational opportunities. They were essentially trying to establish themselves as comprehensive institutions. That limited greatly the range and diversity of the overall market. The difficulty in particular was that the protocols which were imposed by various departments of education around the country defined a single model for Australian education. That put us in a situation where there was an increasing degree of single-mindedness and homogenisation and we failed to offer the opportunities to students which a market of this kind does.
One of the more disastrous consequences was that we found that more students were going to university and fewer students were going into technical and further trades. It was not until the Howard government came to office in 1996 that we began to address the problem of technical education. That has resulted in the introduction of the new colleges of technical education, which are in the process of being founded. They will address a profound problem which has existed for a long period of time and which the Labor government, in its period in office after 1988, singularly failed to address. So that is a welcome dimension in increasing diversity in the higher education sector in Australia.
The second great revolution was the opening up of the Australian education market to overseas students. This began in the mid-1980s with the opening up of the market to graduate students. It was consolidated by opening the market to undergraduate students. By the mid-1980s we were in a position where it was possible for universities to offer education to full fee paying international students. This process began rather slowly at first, but we have now reached a situation where there are over 200,000 international students in Australia. They come from an interestingly diverse range of backgrounds. In the most recent statistics, for 2004, we see that 79,000-odd students came from North-East Asia; 26,000 came from southern and central Asia; 14,000 came from the Americas, broadly defined; and about 7,400 came from sub-Saharan Africa. The total is 228,000 for 2004—an increase of 8.6 per cent on the figure for 2003.
So the market remains buoyant. It is an opportunity for students to come to Australia to get a broad education in a range of areas where Australian universities have an international reputation, where they have high levels of expertise and where their services might well be available to students in other parts of the world. This is an international market. All of the surveys that have been taken on the overseas student experience underline the value of these markets for overseas students. They are very positive experiences for most people, and in some respects one could argue that this is a very effective means of conducting Australia’s foreign policy, because most of these students remain in Australia for a long period of time, depending on the kind of course they are undertaking. Many are here for several years. They not only have experience in institutions but get a wide experience of Australian society.
It was highly regrettable that Senator Nettle, in her contribution, focused on what she saw as the downside of this process—in particular in relation to universities—and failed to outline the benefits to overseas students of participating in Australia’s higher education system. It is not just the overseas students who have the opportunity to gain benefits from this process; it is of course a great advantage for Australian students. In my experience, overseas students enrich the teaching and learning environment of institutions, they enrich classroom discussion and they expose Australian students who may not have had the opportunity to travel overseas to different values and cultures. They provide opportunities for students to interact with people from and to learn more about foreign cultures, and that seems to me to be a very important dimension of the overall overseas student experience in most of our institutions.
The ESOS Act, which is a part of the debate we are having today, is important because it actually clarifies the responsibilities and the services that universities are required to offer to overseas students. These are not trivial matters. They are matters of considerable importance, both to students and to universities. The services include matters of grievance, dispute resolution and access to information and counselling in relation to orientation and first arrival in institutions and academic progress. Speaking from experience, I know that these are matters of great sensitivity to all students, but academic progress is certainly something which is of concern to overseas students. They come with a commitment to education. They come to Australia determined to achieve their objectives of a better education, and, as I said, for the most part that is a very positive experience. The services provisions also apply to matters of further study and accommodation. So these matters are critically important to the way in which students experience education in Australia. They are not to be trivialised, as has tended to be the case, by the contributions of the other side in relation to this particular debate.
It is true that concerns have been expressed about the nature of the participation of overseas students in Australian universities. I say two things about that. First of all, we have to be on guard all the time regarding standards. Some concerns have been expressed about the extent to which overseas students have been inclined to pull down the educational standards of institutions. My own experience in universities in this country is that, for the most part, that is not the case. Students retain very rigorous standards of education and are determined to do so because they fully realise that their reputations depend on doing so.
It has also been argued that there is a danger that there will be a dependence on the income from overseas students. The point is that these programs have now been in place for going on 20 years. They have resulted in steady increases in the numbers of students participating, and students act in an international market. They are prepared to come to Australia because they get good value for their education. They prefer to come to Australia because it is a safe place for overseas education. They prefer to come to Australia, from Asia in particular, because it is close to their home. And they prefer to come to Australia because they know that they will get value for their money. So the prospect in the near term that this market is going to collapse in the dire circumstances which have been argued seems to me to be overextended.
The third revolution that has taken place in higher education in Australia is the expansion of institutions both in Australia and overseas. It is a parallel process, where some Australian universities have established campuses overseas. Several institutions in Australia have established campuses in places like Malaysia and elsewhere in Asia—I know of an experience in China. The other part of the parallel process is overseas universities establishing themselves in Australia. This is the nature of the Carnegie Mellon exercise. They will be coming to Australia to establish a high-quality educational institution. It will add great diversity to the international student market in Australia. I welcome that because it will move away from the homogenised university sector that we have had for such a long period of time. It will be subject to the national protocols, so there can be no argument that the result of this particular move will be a decline in standards. The quality will be retained. The state government strongly supports the proposal, as we heard previously in this debate. It will certainly add, I think over a long period of time, an interesting dimension to the education market in South Australia.
The expectation is that in the first year there will be around 50 students participating in Carnegie Mellon University, and this will rise to around 200 students in 2009. This is an important development in the internationalisation of Australian education. The reality is that universities not just in Australia but also around the world are acting in an increasingly international environment. It was once the case that universities in Australia, as elsewhere, were essentially in a very small marketplace. In 2005, they are not just competing with other universities in their cities, they are not just competing with other universities in their states and they are not just competing with other universities nationally; they are competing in an international marketplace. That is something that every vice-chancellor I have ever met is very conscious of. It enters very strongly into their planning processes into the future, and it guides their thoughts about the structure of their courses, the arrangements for teaching and the arrangements for use of resources. Everything about the university experience is now related to the reality that universities are in an international market.
The Carnegie Mellon institution, which will establish itself in South Australia in the early part of next year, is a manifestation of the fact that this market is increasingly diversified. It is a manifestation of the fact that Australia is recognised as an extremely valuable and important place for higher education. It is a reflection of the fact that we can offer an experience to overseas students that they cannot easily get in other parts of the world. I therefore welcome with enthusiasm the higher education bill and the ESOS bill, which will clarify in very important ways the nature of the overseas student experience in Australia. It will define more clearly important aspects of student participation in Australian education, and that is to be welcomed.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-12-09,"—I would like to make a few remarks about the establishment of international universities in Australia, which I think is a very important new development in the Australian education system. We in Western Australia have a branch of the University of Notre Dame. While it is certainly an Australian university and its governing body is very much Australian, it is nevertheless connected to Notre Dame university in Indiana and the various other members of the Notre Dame fraternity around the world. Education has become very international in recent years. While Australia has been reaching out to the region to bring students into Australia and to establish campuses in the region, I think it is an indication of the globalisation of education that we have an American university from Pittsburgh interested in establishing itself in Australia. According to a report that I have read, that university sees it as a way of accessing Asia.
As I said, Notre Dame is an example of an internationally connected university in Australia, and it is certainly an example of the benefits that internationally connected universities can bring to the Australian education system because a significant proportion of the student body at Notre Dame university comes from other countries on exchange from other Catholic universities around the world. That means that the courses they study at Notre Dame are recognised in other countries as being of an acceptable standard—they meet largely American standards—and it also means that the Australian students have the experience of mixing with students from other countries, which broadens their general outlook and brings other benefits in terms of new perspectives on the subjects they study.
Notre Dame university in Fremantle was established relatively recently. It began with an arts faculty and an education faculty, but it has expanded to provide major professional courses, including law and medicine. Its law course has been going for close to 10 years, so Western Australia now has three law schools: UWA, Murdoch and Notre Dame. Many of the international students who have come to Notre Dame have been involved in the law course. More recently—last year, in fact—Notre Dame established a medical faculty, which has a four-year postgraduate course. I recently attended the official opening of the Notre Dame medical school, having been involved with various Western Australian MPs in seeking the approval of the Prime Minister for the first private university in Perth. The Prime Minister was happy to support Notre Dame.
I went to their opening ceremony and it was very interesting to talk to the students who were studying medicine at the new NDU medical school. They included a wide diversity of people of varying ages—from their 20s to their 50s—and, interestingly, a sprinkling of international students. I spent some time speaking with a young woman who had been involved in the finance industry in New York. She had a commerce degree and had worked in the money markets of New York, and was looking for a different pathway to follow in her life in which she could contribute more to the community. And so she applied and came from New York to study medicine at Notre Dame and is now getting towards the end of her first year. As well, there were international students that had come from the pool of Catholic universities in other parts of the world—of course, the university is a postgraduate university.
That is an example of the benefit that a private international university can bring to Australia. It brings people in from other countries who get to know Australia and understand what we have to offer and then take our culture and perspectives to other countries. Notre Dame is very involved in providing assistance to East Timor in terms of nursing and teaching, and there are schools at its Broome campus. (Quorum formed) So there are benefits from having an international university in Australia—particularly, as in this case, an American university. Already, from the international students that have been in Australia this country has reaped great benefits. For example, I was told recently that at one stage the Indonesian cabinet had four graduates of Australian universities in it, which must mean as a result that there is a much greater understanding in Indonesia of Australian conditions and the Australian government’s outlook. We have been taking international students since the 1950s and we now have an enormous core of alumni throughout the region who have Australian degrees.
As I said earlier, Carnegie Mellon University have made it quite plain that part of the rationale for setting up in Australia is that they see it as a step to Asia. The provost of their campus in Pittsburgh, Professor Kamlet, has said that Carnegie Mellon wanted to establish a unique international institution in Australia with reach to Asia, China and India. He said:
We view our establishment here as important to Asia.
Professor Kamlet went on to say:
We see ourselves as a global player and we see ourselves as very strong in information management and entertainment technology.
The school that is going to be established in Adelaide will be a branch of the university’s high-calibre entertainment technology centre. In the beginning, it is expecting to have about 50 full- and part-time postgraduate students on campus in its first intake. It is fascinating, I think, that an American university is seeking to establish itself in Australia. Australian universities of course have established campuses in Malaysia—Curtin university in Perth has done that—and also in the gulf. They do that because education has now become an enormous international business. Australia is providing services to something like 270,000 international students. We are in a market where we have to compete very hard for students. Even though Carnegie Mellon University is an American university, the fact that its campus and training will be located in Australia means that students from this region will be coming to that university in Australia. Whether or not the university is American does not matter. The fact is that they will be doing courses in Australia, they will be getting to know Australia better and they will certainly bring that enhanced understanding of Australia and Australian conditions to bear in their lives and careers in their own countries.
I think Carnegie Mellon will undoubtedly be the first of many international universities which seek to establish themselves in Australia. As I said, we have seen in recent years a great globalisation of education and if Australia wants to be competitive we must play a role and permit international education institutions to establish themselves in this country. But while we may let international institutions establish themselves here, it is also important that we regulate the conditions under which the students study in Australia so we can be sure that Australia’s reputation for providing a good standard of service to international students is protected and that the quality of the education provided meets our requirements. So this bill seeks to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students Act to enable approved higher education providers to provide education and training services to international students and for registered providers to charge a fee to cover their costs of meeting the obligations of the ESOS framework.
As I have said, international education can bring a wide range of benefits to our society, including significant cultural, intellectual and economic rewards. In fact, the international market in 2004 was worth some $7.5 billion in Australia, sustaining at least 50,000 jobs in this country. The reputation of this valuable industry, including the interests of students who choose to study here, is safeguarded by the ESOS Act. This legislation establishes key national elements for the regulation of international education and seeks to ensure that international students receive the education and training for which they have paid. It also aims to strengthen public confidence in the student visa program by ensuring that only genuine students come to Australia to study under these arrangements and that they are appropriately supported in doing so. To do this the ESOS framework requires providers to meet a range of obligations. That is very important to ensure that the reputation of Australian education is maintained and that we are not providing a backdoor means for students from other countries to gain access to Australia.
We want to remain competitive in the international market. The international export industry in general is facing significant and rapid structural change. We in Australia are not immune from this. To remain competitive we need to be able to respond to emerging challenges such as competition from countries entering the market, flexible partnership arrangements, expanding offshore provision of courses and changes in the nature and demand of consumer expectations.
The entry of the Carnegie Mellon University to Australia will give prospective students a choice of qualifications, Australian or American, in a safe and unique environment. As I said, Australia will still benefit economically and culturally from having this university in this country. One of the questions which I suppose might arise in people’s minds is whether permitting this university to come to Australia and establish a campus here will adversely affect Australia’s ability to attract international students. We in the government do not think this will be the case. We believe that opening Australia to foreign owned, high-quality education providers will improve our international reputation and offer greater choice to international students.
Carnegie Mellon University is an education and research institution which is ranked 38th out of 200 by the Times Higher Education Supplement in London which ranks the top universities in the world. In other words, it is right up there in the top 40. The government believes this university will attract more postgraduate students from the Asia-Pacific region to Australia. South Australia attracts about 4.8 per cent of international students studying in Australia and aims to double that market by 2013, so this university in particular will be of benefit to South Australia. Another of the benefits from the arrangements under which this university is being set up will be that students will know how much they will need to pay for the cost of their education experience in Australia before they leave their home country. That is a vital matter to the parents of these students, so that they can be aware of what the cost obligations are and plan accordingly when arranging for the students to study in Australia.
Another question that might be asked is: what guarantees are there that Carnegie Mellon University will comply with the requirements of the ESOS Act? The ESOS Act is being amended to enable Carnegie Mellon University to operate as a registered provider and offer education and training services to international students. The Carnegie Mellon University will be subject to the same requirements as other registered providers—for example, all the ESOS consumer protection arrangements will apply, and it will need to provide all the student support and other services required under our national code. As a world recognised education and research provider, the Carnegie Mellon University is a highly regarded, prestigious university and has a reputation based on demonstrated service delivery. All of this will be audited so that the standards are maintained and the students who study in Australia will be guaranteed a very high standard of education.
There are many benefits from encouraging international universities to establish themselves in Australia. We are part of a global market. Having international students here has demonstrably increased the understanding of Australia and Australia’s culture in the countries of our region. As I have said, this university specifically has a focus on bringing in students from the Asian region, including China and India, to this country. So I think it is a very commendable project and I recommend it to the Senate for support.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-12-09,"—by leave—I just want to raise the issue of where we are going in the parliament today. We are in danger of this bill, on which we are all in furious agreement, being debated for longer than the Welfare to Work or antiterrorism bills. Given the fact that the government needed the time and insisted on guillotining those bills through, it seems very strange that today we are about to have our fourth government speaker, with maybe others lining up, to discuss a bill that everyone is going to vote for and on which we agreed we would pass last night but the government did not bring it on. I think this is getting to high farce. I accept the government may have wanted time to beat up on Barnaby or to convince Senator Fielding, but I really think we owe the staff and the other senators the courtesy of knowing what is going on. The debate on this bill has just been filibustered by the government. This is the government that has had to use the gag and the guillotine all week to save time. Although the speeches have been excellent—Senator Eggleston this is, of course, no reflection on the speeches—they have not exactly been on the topic. I asked the Manager of Government Business earlier in the day if he could let us know by 11 o’clock at the latest what is going on. He has not got back to us. It does seem to me that the Senate is being filibustered for no good reason.
The next three bills on the list are all noncontroversial ones that we also agreed to pass yesterday. We were prepared to sit late yesterday to pass them to save the expense of the parliament sitting today and the inconvenience to senators and staff. As I said, this is just being talked out for the sake of filling up time. The government ought to indicate whether the VSU legislation is coming or not. If it is not, we ought to get on with it, finish the government business and everyone should be allowed to go home. If it is, then they ought to bring it on. Quite frankly, this is, again, an abuse of the processes of the Senate. If the government is going to keep filling up the speakers list on a bill which is going to be carried, and would have been carried an hour ago if it were not for government speakers, then it is turning into a farce.
I just want to put on record our concern about the process. I would appreciate the government informing the Senate of what is occurring. The Prime Minister is on national radio saying the VSU legislation will not come on this year, but it seems the Senate has been asked to sit and government speakers have been asked to filibuster despite the fact that the Prime Minister is out there saying that the VSU legislation is not coming on. I would appreciate the government informing the Senate of its plans for the rest of the day and why it is seeking to filibuster on a minor bill. It really stands in stark contrast to the events of earlier in the week when major bills were gagged and guillotined without sufficient time, yet a bill on which we are all in furious agreement is now going to take almost as long. It is just getting to the ridiculous stage, so I would appreciate it if the Manager of Government Business could do the Senate, staff and everyone connected with the parliament the courtesy of informing us of what is going to occur today. That will allow everyone to plan their lives and get on with things and would save the embarrassment of senators, like Senator McGauran, having to grab together some notes to speak on the bill, which I am sure have been organised at short notice. Although I am sure he is very interested in higher education issues, I really think we ought to get on with it.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-12-09,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—It had better be a good speech after this!
—I had better do a good speech. I thank Senator Evans for complimenting the previous speakers on the government side. But he is not totally correct when he says that we are all in furious agreement. I am sure we all will be at the time of taking the vote but the previous speakers, such as Senator Nettle over there who seems to be spending the day in the chamber, were not in furious agreement. I was very disappointed. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in Senator Stott Despoja. We have the Carnegie Mellon University, a foreign-owned university—of course, that explains why Senator Nettle was not enthusiastic about this bill; anything foreign is not welcome to her—and I would have thought that the South Australian senator, Natasha Stott Despoja, would have been a little more enthusiastic. If you go over her speech in Hansard, she is not all that enthusiastic. I hope I do not misquote her. I invite her to come in and contradict me during the committee stages should she wish. We should all be in furious agreement about the establishment, which is part of this bill, of a new university—a foreign one at that, but a highly reputable one—in the state of South Australia. I am sorry Victoria has not got it.
Senator Conroy has just walked into the chamber. He too would be disappointed. No, he is totally disinterested. It is not surprising—it has been a long week for Senator Conroy and he is not all that interested in where the universities go. He has not put his name down to speak on this bill. We are little state proud and South Australia have something to be proud of. This bill relates to the establishment of a foreign university, a first, in South Australia—the reputable Carnegie Mellon University. That is what I will address my remarks to primarily today.
As Senator Evans intimated, this debate has covered many different subjects far and wide. It has even ventured onto the hot topic of compulsory student unionism. If time permits, I may venture into that area myself. I do not particularly want to debate that here and now; there will be a time and place to debate that particular bill. We all wait with bated breath for when that time and place will be.
What we have before us is an advance in higher education, and one of the best examples of where the government’s 2003 reforms have led us. Those reforms were very difficult to introduce into the Senate when we did not have the majority. We had to get those reforms through the Senate, against the resistance of the bottomless pit school of thought, which Senator Natasha Stott Despoja leads, which thinks that there is a bottomless pit in higher education and that governments have to fund endlessly every point of access, every degree and, for that matter, every footy oval.

Senator Stott Despoja interjecting—

—Senator Stott Despoja walks into the chamber and is already snapping at me.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order, Senator McGauran! Senator Stott Despoja, you should not be interjecting whilst walking around the chamber.
—You should have called him to order on that point.
—Senator Stott Despoja, you should also not be shouting out while you are still sitting in your seat. If you have something to say, you can take a point of order.
—Senator Stott Despoja has earnt that title. She is a long-serving senator here. She is a high-profile senator. She is not as high profile as some new senators who have charged into this chamber, but she has earnt her place as a top line, high-profile South Australian senator. That is why I am a little disappointed in relation to her not being that enthusiastic about the Carnegie Mellon University, but we can get to that point later—and she will have an opportunity to respond—and I hope I am wrong. I hope you prove me wrong, Senator Stott Despoja. I do apologise if I have not given you your correct title. One thing you will not be getting and that is an ‘honourable’ title. That only comes to government members, and that is one of the problems with the Democrats—
—Senator McGauran, one thing you will do is to address your remarks through the chair.
—Before I was interrupted by Senator Stott Despoja, I was originally talking about the difficulty that the government had in bringing in their 2003 reforms. I happen to have the full list on me. It was under the higher education act, and Backing Australia’s Future was the policy title the government gave to it. It was very difficult. It required a whole new era, although I should add that it was building on the previous Labor government’s minor, and with trepidation, reforms in HECS. It was building onto those reforms a greater flexibility and a greater responsibility on universities to raise funds. As I said, it is a very competitive market internationally. The expense of universities in infrastructure alone, as we all know, is enormous. As there is only one cake, only one budget, we will not be a part of the bottomless pit school of thought, which comes from those on the other side of the chamber.
Those reforms were introduced, but the government fully takes responsibility for an element, a portion, of the contribution to university budgets and university budget life. There is a range of ways the government makes that contribution, including direct to courses, infrastructure grants and, I should also add, regional grants. The point is that those reforms were resisted in every way. Here we have an example—and the sky did not fall in; far from it—of where we are attracting the top educators from overseas to set up in Australia. This is all part of the government’s reforms. Educators now have the flexibility and the ability to charge and set up in Australia. It is a credit to South Australia that they chose to set up there. I, of course, would have preferred it if they had chosen my own state of Victoria. We have some good universities there, too. I compliment the University of Melbourne, no less, which is in the top 100 universities. (Quorum formed)

It may surprise the interjectors, but I know quite a lot about this bill. I was simply distracted by the previous speaker, Senator Evans, when he said that we were all in furious agreement. In the final analysis we are, when it comes to the vote. But, listening to speakers such as Senator Nettle and Senator Stott Despoja, it seems there is great variance as to policy, philosophy and direction of higher education. That has been run through the Senate quite solidly and frequently. We all know where Senator Stott Despoja, let alone Senator Nettle, stands on higher education. As I said, they are from the school of the bottomless pit. But a government has to be a little more responsible than that. They will never get into government. But the major parties that do get into government have to be able to divide up the cake. That is what we have done with universities.
Ironically, universities have prospered since. One of the best examples of the advancement of Australia’s education system is the establishment of this foreign university. Just before I was rudely interrupted by the whip on the other side, I was mentioning the University of Melbourne in Victoria, which is one of the top line universities in the world. It certainly made the top 100, but I think it did better than that. Forgive me for not knowing exactly where it actually finished. We are very proud of that university. We know it is one of the world’s top universities. It is a Victorian university and, as a Victorian senator, I would like to put that on the record. I will just read out some information on the essence of this bill:
The Bill seeks to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 ... to enable: approved overseas higher education providers to provide education and training services to international students; and registered providers to charge a fee to cover their costs of meeting the obligations of the ESOS framework.
That is, the Education Services for Overseas Students framework. I will continue:
The reputation of this valuable industry, including the interests of students who choose to study here, is safeguarded by the ESOS Act.
The ESOS Act establishes key national elements for the regulation of international education, and seeks to ensure that international students receive the education and training for which they have paid ...
The protections provided by such regulation have brought world-wide recognition of our quality and innovation in education and training, and led to the development of an export sector which holds a pivotal role in Australia’s future.
Senator Stott Despoja, I hope you do not think I have it in for you just before Christmas, but I am sure I heard you say that the government or the education sector have it in for overseas students—that we are using overseas students as a cash cow and exploiting them. This is a major industry which universities hunger for. I do not know what you are going to tell your vice-chancellors at the Christmas party, but, Senator Stott Despoja, do you really understand the reliance—
—Order! Senator McGauran, I draw your attention to the fact that your remarks should be directed through the chair.
(Quorum formed)
—I know that Senator Stott Despoja did make those comments about overseas students. I should add that she was in defence of them. I am sure they would wonder why if you ever asked them. They come to this country by choice. They not only get a good education because of the high standards and bar that we set—it is an international standard—but also like to come to Australia. They happen to like to come to Australia. Recently I came back from Micronesia, and there are many scholarships given out there by Australia and the United States. The Micronesians would choose to come to Australia ahead of the United States just for the whole experience that they will get. It is not just the high education; it is the culture, security, safety and people. I do not know who Senator Stott Despoja has been speaking to when she claims that the industry is using them as a cash cow and they are being exploited. I really think they like their experience here. I do know that the universities value them highly. If the universities do not value them, they will leave. They simply will not come. It is a competitive market. Perhaps the words ‘competitive market’ are what Senator Stott Despoja does not like. She still lives in the Whitlamesque years, when it was all paid for up-front.
I would like to paraphrase for the chamber a very good paper issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is entitled, Education without borders: international trade in education. In essence, this paper sets out the importance and the dollar and social value of international students to Australia and to our higher education system. It says that in 2003 education services were worth some $6 billion to the Australian economy. That is a 13 per cent increase on 2002-03. To give credit to the previous government, that is when the market was first opened up—if I can use those words, Senator Stott Despoja—for international students. They laid the foundation stone. There was an enormous increase in their time, but it has been jumping every single year—
—If you are talking about the Colombo plan, it kind of dates back a little!
—I accept Senator Stott Despoja’s interjection. She is very knowledgeable in this area. We differ in direction, policy, philosophy and just about everything else but I know that she holds her views firmly and she has a great deal of knowledge on this issue. In fact some would say that she is a little too narrow in this particular area. I like to spread myself across all portfolios.
But there is no getting away from the fact that this is a $6 billion industry for Australia alone. Then there are the cultural effects. In the years and decades to come those that have been educated here and go back home to Malaysia or Thailand will have a friendship with Australia that will never be forgotten. There are strong international and diplomatic advantages in this. You know all that, so why are you saying that they are cash cows, that they are exploited? Whenever that foundation stone was laid, it has been increasing every single year, and you would have to agree with that. Australia is becoming a magnet for higher education.
Australia’s trade in education and its linkages with many other countries are predominantly in Asia, and I venture to say that China is our largest market. Between 1994 and 2004 the number of international students undertaking courses in higher education in Australia increased by an average of 15 per cent per year. In 1994, 35,290 international students were enrolled, and I give credit to the Labor government of that time. In 2004, this figure had grown to 151,798 students—what a leap! You would not have got that leap without the reforms. While I give credit to the previous government for their very intrepid reforms, which did begin to attract overseas students, the market is so competitive that universities need to be flexible to attract international students. Australia’s onshore enrolments constitute the largest share of international students to total enrolments in higher education of any OECD country. In 2004 higher education accounted for almost 70 per cent of a total of $3.4 billion earned in fees for international education by Australian institutions. Growth in onshore enrolments continues to be strong and will be strong into the future.
Whilst we are all in furious agreement on this bill, I will touch on one matter that was mentioned by previous speakers. I do not wish to go into it in depth—there will not be time enough for that. Previous speakers on the other side of the chamber tried to link this particular bill with student union fees. As Senator Abetz said, the link is spurious, but I suppose in this atmosphere it had to be made. There is one principle that the government is working on in relation to voluntary student unionism. At the very heart of this bill is the principle of freedom of association. You can bring in every other argument that I have heard—and heaven knows we have all heard the arguments from both sides that universities are a special case, that there needs to be a cultural understanding, that there is more to universities than just an education, and so on—but there is another side to the argument. We on this side of the chamber say: look at how they are using those student unions. No less than $200,000 was spent at the last election—against the government. I ask you: what student wants their money spent on election campaigns?
The arguments go back and forth and this chamber will debate that matter soon enough, or not debate it. But let us bring the argument back to the core. This is where senators on the other side of the chamber fall down. How you could deny this particular principle, I do not know. You come in here and pontificate about human rights, the freedom of men and women et cetera, but the heart of this bill is freedom of association. A student ought to have the right to join or not to join, and that is at the heart of it. How can you deny that?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. Senator McGauran might like to be aware that in this legislation there is an exception from that choice principle and a requirement that universities charge a compulsory fee in relation to providing services for students. So this argument is in fact counter to what the legislation says.
 (Senator Barnett)—Senator Wong, there is no point of order. He was speaking broadly to the bill.
—I urge the Senate to support this bill.
—I now call Senator Parry.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Parry was not on the speakers list. We are now seeing yet again an addition to this ridiculous filibuster the chamber is being asked to endure while this government beats up on Senator Joyce and Senator Fielding to get the deal through after they have truncated debate and guillotined debate on controversial bills.
—Order! What is your point of order?
—Senator Parry was not on the speakers list. This is clearly just a filibuster by the government. How long is this going on for?
—Senator Wong, there is no point of order. (Quorum formed)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2005-12-09,"—I was concerned about the remarks of Senator Wong regarding the validity of my wish to speak in this debate. I have a son who is currently in his second year at the University of Tasmania and I have an elder son who has graduated from the University of Tasmania. I feel very privileged to be able to speak in this debate because higher education is a part of my family’s and my extended family’s structure. I think it is a slight on this side, and certainly on me, to question the validity of my wish to speak in this debate.
I wish to join with other coalition senators and those opposite in speaking on this matter. I wish to address the two cognate bills that are being discussed, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. I want to draw the chamber’s intention to a couple of matters—in particular some Hansard extracts from the member for Bass, Mr Michael Ferguson, who gave a brilliant speech in the House of Representatives which this chamber obviously did not have the benefit of hearing. There are some matters that I wish to address in that speech which I will come to in a moment.
I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Russell Trood in this debate. Senators heard Senator Trood speak earlier. Senator Trood comes with great qualifications. He was probably too embarrassed to introduce his qualifications into the chamber. Senator Trood has not only spent 20 years in the service of higher education but also worked for the Australian National University, Griffith University and other universities overseas, which is very relevant to this debate. Senator Trood brings to this debate qualified and impeccable credentials. I particularly want to commend Senator Trood on introducing that aspect to the debate and on his modesty for not raising many of the issues that I have just raised.

Senator Payne interjecting—

—He is unique in the chamber, as Senator Payne points out. He comes to this parliament with a strong academic background which has served him extremely well in this debate and, I am sure, will serve him well in many debates to come. I am certainly proud to have commenced my term as a senator with Senator Russell Trood from the great state of Queensland.
I now wish to move to the great state of Tasmania and Mr Michael Ferguson, the member for Bass. I will just paraphrase from some of the Hansard pieces. The member for Bass was very emphatic when he spoke about this bill. He was very supportive of it, as all government members are.
—And all opposition members, Senator Parry.
—That is commendable. Senator Wong interjects, but it is nice that members opposite have agreed to support us on this bill. I cannot say the same for the Democrats completely. I think they wish to insert amendments that we will not agree with. I understand that the Greens will also. However, the main opposition has certainly supported us in this matter, but it is still necessary to place in Hansard—
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Allow Senator Parry to continue.
—Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett. I know that you will appreciate the comments of Mr Michael Ferguson from the seat of Bass. It is important to get the speech on record in this chamber because we did not have the opportunity to have it here. It is fine to have it in the House of Representatives Hansard but it is also great to have it in the Senate Hansard. Mr Ferguson indicated that he is very supportive of making it possible for the Carnegie Mellon University to establish an overseas branch here in Australia.
—Put it to a vote.
—Let’s put it to a vote now.
—I wish to address the bill.
—Order! Allow Senator Parry to continue without interjections.
—We cannot win. We are either gagging or not gagging. We just cannot win. This bill has two extra purposes which I wish to really emphasise. One relates to the tuition assurance requirements under HESA and the other makes some technical amendments that have been required by the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
—Are you still reading from the Reps Hansard?
—Are you reading your speech?
—I am refreshing my memory with notes that I have in front of me, Senator George Campbell. There is an important aspect of this particular bill. I will quote from Hansard, if I may. Mr Michael Ferguson said:
The bill inserts a new category of table C providers within HESA that are currently table A—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Whilst I appreciate the deep conviction with which Senator Parry is speaking, I wonder whether I could ask for a direction from you as to the appropriateness of reading Hansard into Hansard, which is what this chamber has been reduced to. He is reading the Hansard from the House of Representatives into the Hansard of the Senate chamber.
—Senator Wong, there is no point of order and I think you are aware of that.
—There is a relevant aspect to Tasmania in this particular extract from Hansard. It is nice for the constituents of Tasmania to hear some aspects being read into Hansard—

Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! We will have some order in the chamber and allow Senator Parry to continue.
—I will have to start that quote again because I do not believe the chamber heard it. Mr Ferguson said:
The bill inserts a new category of table C providers within HESA that are currently table A providers—37 public universities and other higher education providers such as the Australian Maritime College ...
That is in my home state of Tasmania. He goes on:
... and the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, which I—
that is Mr Ferguson—
had the pleasure of visiting quite recently ... There are also three table B providers. These are self-accrediting higher education providers such as Bond University, the University of Notre Dame Australia and the Melbourne College of Divinity. Table C providers will be approved as overseas higher education institutions. This will give an operational framework for all approved overseas higher education institutions to operate a branch in Australia if they so desire.
As has been stated before, and it is important to restate this from my perspective, the bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act to enable high-quality foreign universities, such as the university that has been quoted in this chamber today, the Carnegie Mellon University, to establish institutions within Australia.
I strongly believe that students must have a real choice of excellence in higher education and the entry of Carnegie Mellon into Australia will further enhance that choice. The crux of the debate is the choice we want to provide for overseas and domestic students. Apart from this, the Australian government will not be providing funding to Carnegie Mellon or any other foreign university. This offers Australian students at Carnegie Mellon entitlements similar to those they would enjoy if enrolled in similar courses at public or private higher education providers under the Higher Education Support Act. Eligible Australian students who seek to enrol in a fee-paying course should be treated equally regardless of whether they are studying at an Australian university, at an appropriate Australian private higher education provider or at a foreign university that has been approved under the national protocols for higher education approval processes.
Carnegie Mellon is the first foreign university seeking to establish a branch within Australia. These amendments provide for other foreign universities to also establish themselves here—so opening up the entire market and not just for one university. These amendments provide for other foreign universities to establish themselves here, as I have mentioned, provided they meet the same stringent accreditation. The accreditation standards are extremely important. The national protocols for higher education approval processes have provided for the operation of foreign universities in Australia since 2001. The national protocols have the endorsement of all states and territories as well as the Commonwealth. I know that Premier Rann is particularly pleased and very keen because South Australia will become the first home to a foreign university. It is a credit to that state for encouraging that.
I will return to the Hansard and mention some other aspects of the speech from Mr Michael Ferguson, the member for Bass. He was excited about this prospect, as we all are. Mr Ferguson said:
Labor went to the last election pledging that it would not support voluntary student unionism. The people who voted Labor at the last election did so believing that Labor would not support voluntary student unionism legislation—
—‘And guess what’!
—Very good.
—It continues:
... within the last two months the member for Jagajaga publicly announced that Labor would be supporting the principle—
—Order! We will allow Senator Parry to continue.
—I will read with you, Senator Parry.
—It is good to know that Senator Wong supports the fact that this is a very important contribution from the member for Bass in Hansard. (Quorum formed) Just prior to the quorum being called, Senator Wong waved the House of Representatives Hansard, from which I was quoting relevant excerpts from the speech of the member for Bass, Mr Michael Ferguson. For Senator Wong to have that piece of paper in the chamber during this debate proves my point that the member for Bass had a lot of relevance to the debate in the House of Representatives. To support that relevance, I wish to place on the record in this chamber that Mr Michael Ferguson, the member for Bass, is a teacher. He has had a lot to do with higher education in Tasmania and in the electorate of Bass and is recognised for his comprehension of education matters. It is very important to note that not only do I have the Hansard of his speech but Senator Wong has it as well. She offered to read it with me. I commend Senator Wong for picking up the most relevant and important pieces of the House of Representatives debate and introducing them into this chamber. I acknowledge that to make sure that Hansard records that.
This legislation will no doubt be the commencement of great things for this country. I believe that having this additional choice and the variety that it will bring to be like a merging of cultures in education facilities. If you have conferences or forums of any nature in any industry or any endeavour, including education, when you bring in a different cultural aspect you develop a wider understanding. To bring that wider breadth of understanding and that different aspect to education and learning has to be of benefit to our students. That is what this variety will bring. It is something that all members and senators should support, and support wholeheartedly without amendment. The two bills have been carefully constructed and placed together in such a way that members would wish to support them.
I want to mention some other aspects about the bills which I know have been covered but they need to be restated.
—They need to be emphasised.
—I thank Senator George Brandis for his assistance. It is important that we emphasise these matters because sometimes they go under the radar and people do not hear the structured debates concerning them.
—They are misrepresented by the Labor Party.
—As Senator Brandis also interjects, they can be misrepresented, and not just by the Labor Party but by other parties. It is important that we continually state the need for these bills and the reasons why we support these bills.
The amendments will ensure that, where students choose the option of a student contribution tuition fee, repayment of their FEE-HELP debt will be remitted. Any amounts paid up front will be recredited to their FEE-HELP balances. Also, under the tuition assurance provisions, where students choose the course assurance option, the amendments will ensure—
—Free Barnaby!
—Order!
—It is very hard to concentrate. Under the tuition assurance provisions, where students choose the course assurance option—which is a great option—the amendments will ensure that the student will not incur any additional cost for those units undertaken with a second provider that replace units not completed with the first provider. While this means that the second provider carries the cost of the student undertaking any replacement units, broad consultation with the sector indicates that this is already common practice.
Further, in relation to that provision, in the case of replacement units the changes will protect students who are forced to withdraw because of special circumstances, such as medical or family circumstances, and protect institutions which provide the replacement units without any fee. Students will be able to get a refund without any impost on the second provider and the higher education provider guidelines will set out the basis for this refund. That is a commendable and important provision. Technical amendments will make it clear that the secretary has the power to act in relation to recrediting and remitting the balances and debts of students if a provider cannot do so because, for example, it has ceased to operate. The legislation covers every possible option and every possible angle.
In light of the provisions of this legislation, an amendment to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 is also being prepared. ESOS regulates the provision of education and training to overseas students in Australia, and I wish to highlight some points about that. Currently, ESOS precludes overseas education providers from offering education and training services to students when they do not meet the residency requirements set out in section 16 of ESOS.

Senator Stott Despoja interjecting—

—You can do it—another two minutes to go.
—Senator Conroy, cease your interjections.
—Senator Stott Despoja has just indicated I should be saying ESOS instead of E-S-O-S. That is my preference and I would sooner use E-S-O-S. I think that was a pedantic interjection. I do not think there is any particular way we should pronounce acronyms, but I prefer E-S-O-S.
—You could mention some of those dead bodies you have buried.
—I would be worried if I were you, George. He is very good.
—Order! Senator Parry has the call.
—Take the interjections—go on!
—Those interjections do not deter me from my cause of promoting these two very significant bills. It might be a laughing matter on the other side, but I treat these bills very seriously. I want to talk about Carnegie Mellon University in the moments I have remaining. The Australian government is committed to the development of a strong and high-quality education sector. The important point is that it is internationally competitive. I sometimes think that people fail to see that it has to be internationally competitive, underpinning our economic, cultural and social development. I spoke about cultural development through melding other education cultures with our university framework in Australia.
Higher education is increasingly being delivered in a global context, with international benchmarking being a key measure of quality. International benchmarking is another key point. The introduction of a Carnegie Mellon University campus to Australia will enable us to focus on international benchmarking standards at home. The entry of foreign universities will enable Australian institutions to compare offerings and methods of operation with other institutions. This is a point that Senator Russell Trood raised earlier. This is the benefit of going overseas. Senator Trood has had the benefit of travelling to overseas universities. Now we will have overseas universities coming here, if this bill passes.
—If it passes? Is there some doubt?
—You cannot take anything for granted, Senator Ludwig. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-12-09,"—I would like to thank all those who spoke on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 for their interest. I particularly want to thank Senator Parry, who is a very new senator. He gave a very important speech on a topic about which he feels very strongly. That does point out the different skills and the diversity that people on our side bring to this chamber. Senator Trood has a very strong Australian and international academic background. I will blow my own trumpet, Senator Trood, and say that I have an academic background too.
—You were an academic.
—I was an academic, yes. I taught in university. Senator Parry was a policeman and also an undertaker.
—He knows where the bodies are buried!
—He knows where the bodies are buried in Labor. I look at the extensive legal experience that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has and at the background of Senator Payne.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Much as I admire the minister’s desire to praise the background of her colleagues—and I do not intend to detract from that—my point of order goes to relevance.
 (Senator Barnett)—There is no point of order.
—I am outlining the difference between the backgrounds of the people on this side and the backgrounds of the people on the other side.
—What’s that got to do with the bill?
—It has a lot to do with the bill in that Senator Trood can get up here and speak from experience, not just from having been a student at university—which is about all that people on the other side can speak about in their experience of university. I spent 20 years on Monash University Council and taught in tertiary institutions. Senator Trood has spent an enormous amount of time in universities. At least some of us on our side worked in universities and have actually been teachers in universities. There is not one on the other side who can make that claim—not one. They have nearly all been union reps. But that is beside the point. We on this side have much more credibility when talking about what goes on in universities, other than from the point of view of being an undergraduate. In fact, there is hardly a postgraduate person on the other side either. We have a breadth of experience on this side. We are not a limited gene pool, like the other side, of former union employees. We have a group of people who can make a major contribution from their perspective and their experience in the real world. That is relevant in this debate.
I want to reiterate a few points. (Quorum formed) As I was about to say when I was so rudely interrupted by yet another quorum being called, the bills before the Senate today will allow amendments to both the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 to enable high-quality foreign universities to offer courses to Australian international students.
The HELA 4 bill creates a new table C category of higher education providers to enable approved foreign universities to offer FEE-HELP loans to eligible Australian students. This demonstrates the Australian government’s commitment to ensuring that all eligible Australian students are treated equally wherever they choose to study, as long as it is with an approved provider. These amendments provide a framework for foreign universities to also establish themselves here, provided they meet the same stringent accreditation, approval, quality and accountability requirements that are in place for Australian higher education providers. Opening up the higher education sector to high-quality overseas universities will provide students with increased choice in course offerings, subject to Australian government and relevant state and territory approval. Foreign universities will be able to offer Australian students world-class degrees in postgraduate qualifications not currently available to them.
These amendments will enable the first such provider to be approved under the national protocols for higher education approval processes—the private, not-for-profit, United States based institution Carnegie Mellon University—to operate as a university in Adelaide. The Carnegie Mellon University is planning to offer education services to international and domestic students in Australia that commence from the 2006 academic year. Initially, postgraduate courses will be offered in public policy, management and IT.
The Carnegie Mellon University is a prestigious institution currently ranked No. 44 out of 200 on the Times Higher Education Supplement ranking of world universities and ranked 54 out of 500 on the Jiao Tong University’s ranking of top world universities. The Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science was ranked first in the 2002 US News and World Report magazine survey of graduate programs. This is the very sort of program and standard that we need here in Australia if we are going to operate into the future and compete in a world market. We have to ensure that we have people who are world standard in terms of technologies like IT. The Carnegie Mellon John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management ranks eighth in the USA.
This bill will, for the first time, enable Australian universities to actively collaborate with foreign universities on Australian soil. It will facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas and innovative learning, teaching and research practices, which will deepen the Australian university experience for higher education students and the wider community. I also presume that students will be able to more easily travel backwards and forwards to the Carnegie Mellon University, do some units over there and bring back the sorts of benefits that you can get when, as a young person, you have the opportunity to travel and study overseas. There are benefits within this that I do not think we will see until well into the future. They will impact on networks of senior people in IT as those students go on to be professionals, and they will improve Australia’s opportunity in what will be a very competitive world.
The provisions of this bill reflect the Australian government’s commitment to a world-class and internationally competitive university sector. This bill will further clarify and strengthen the protection offered to students through the comprehensive tuition assurance requirements under HESA to better reflect the policy intent of the tuition assurance requirements. Mechanisms are included within the bill that will provide improved comprehensive consumer protection for students studying at non table A providers. Should a higher education provider cease to offer a course in which a student is enrolled, the amendments clarify that students will not be financially disadvantaged. Students will have two options. They can either switch to another higher education provider without incurring additional costs for uncompleted units or obtain a refund for those uncompleted units.
If a student chooses to transfer to another provider, they will not have to pay twice for the unit. The second provider will bear the cost, as is the current practice. Where a student chooses the refund option, their student learning entitlement and FEE-HELP balances will be recredited and their HELP debt will be remitted. Under the amendments to tuition assurance, if a student transfers to a replacement unit with another provider and subsequently withdraws due to special circumstances, a refund of their student contribution will be obtainable while their student learning entitlement and FEE-HELP balances will be recredited and their HELP debt will be remitted. Again, the second provider will not bear any cost in such cases.
This bill will make consequential amendments required to existing higher education acts to clarify that any disallowable instruments made under those acts are now legislative amendments. These are minor technical amendments required by the legislative instrument 2003.
International education brings a wide range of benefits to our society, as I said, including significant cultural, intellectual and economic rewards. An added benefit of our competition in the international marketplace is the stimulus to quality and innovation, which is in the interests of all students. In 2004, the industry had an estimated worth of some $7.5 billion, sustaining at least 50,000 jobs. We must remember that the export industry differs from domestic education as it requires the support of migration policy and must provide relevant and accessible consumer protection. The services, education and training that providers provide must cater for the fact that students who travel to Australia cannot usually see before they purchase and, if there is reason for discontent with the services they obtain, they may not be able to remain in Australia to pursue the matter through Australian processes. As such, the reputation of this valuable industry, including the interests of students who choose to study here, is safeguarded by a specific piece of legislation: the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000—the ESOS Act—and its complementary requirements.
The ESOS legislative framework ensures all providers, including universities, meet a range of legal obligations. This includes providing support services to assist overseas students to adjust to life in Australia and study at Australian institutions—such as ensuring appropriate arrangements for independent grievance handling and dispute resolution, and access to information on counselling services, orientation, academic progress, further study and accommodation. Passing this amendment to the ESOS Act will allow a provider to include an amount in their tuition fee—but not a separate fee—to cover the national code support service requirements. This amendment does not impose any additional legislative or financial requirements on providers. Instead, it is facilitative only and reinforces the obligation to meet current national code requirements. Therefore, it continues a significant and beneficial feature of Australia’s international education export industry in a more challenging and competitive global industry.
There is yet another measure that we have introduced—one we introduced when I was parliamentary secretary for immigration. It was to reform the whole student visa process to ensure that students were legitimate when they came here and that they were not being tricked by unscrupulous providers, which would destroy our overseas student education market, in order to maintain the reputation of our outstanding educational institutions and other education services here in Australia. This is yet another example of this government ensuring that a very valuable, not only economically valuable, part of our economy—that is, overseas students studying here in Australia—has integrity and that these students have appropriate assistance and a positive experience so that they will go home and promote not only that institution but Australia as they become senior people in business and education.
I do not think I will get another opportunity today to wish my colleagues on both sides of the house a very happy Christmas and a good break. I look forward to some challenging times in 2006, when the Howard government will be introducing additional changes to make Australia more competitive and focus on the needs of individuals, like I have been able to do this year. We have extended carers payment to parents with profoundly disabled children, we have a program for some additional respite for carers with adult disabled children, and we have a measure which gives parents looking after a child with a disability in their later years some assistance to reduce the likelihood of them being affected by the means and assets test. They are the sorts of measures that we will be introducing in the new year. In the meantime, I wish all my colleagues a very happy Christmas and a very safe time over the break.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-12-09,"—I move:
That the committee agrees to the amendments made by the House of Representatives.
—Before proceeding, I will read a statement in respect of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005. The statement reads:
Two of the amendments made in the Senate to this bill have been disagreed to in the House of Representatives on the basis that they should have been requests. The amendments were moved by the government in the Senate as amendments on the basis of the well-established principle that amendments in the Senate may re-allocate appropriations without increasing the amount of expenditure.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-12-09,"—The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005 authorises the European bank to operate in Mongolia. The first thing that strikes you about this particular piece of legislation is the question of why we need a bill in relation to this matter. I understand that we do need it legally, but it would be a lot better in terms of process that we do not have bills every so often to allow the European bank to operate in a new country, in this case Mongolia. It seems to me to be a waste of the parliament’s time to be dealing with issues that really are minute in the context of parliamentary consideration. I also note that there is no financial impact with regard to this bill. If we are to come in to parliament and authorise the European bank to operate in every country that it intends to move into, I think a better way should be found for the Australian parliament to authorise such activity.
The second point I want to make is that it does not concern me that the European bank or any bank is going to help out Mongolia but it does concern me that this is the European bank and, plainly, Mongolia is not in Europe. It is about as far from Europe as you can get, except perhaps for my home state of Tasmania. We are here authorising the European bank to operate on the far side of Asia, in Mongolia. I raise this in all seriousness because I think there is a risk that the European bank, by spreading its operations into non-European countries, is evolving into a general bank of assistance to poorer countries around the world. That then begs the question: why do we need a European bank evolving into a general world bank when we already have a World Bank carrying out many activities of the European bank? I want to put those points on the record.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established in 1991 when the various communist regimes were collapsing in central and eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet countries needed support and assistance. That is fair enough. The Labor Party does not object to that original aim to support the emergence of a new economic structure in the private sector in a democratic environment in those eastern European and central European countries.
We have heard a lot about banks in the last couple of weeks in the parliament, both here and in the House of Representatives. We have heard a lot about the Reserve Bank of Australia. In what will be my final remarks for the year, I do want to re-emphasise, in the context of banks and banking policy, that we could not have had illustrated more typically what the Liberal Party and Liberal government of this country represent than what has happened in the last two weeks.
—They like putting their mates in the banks.
—I will get to that in a moment. In this Senate chamber, we have spent a fair slice of our time debating the Liberal government’s deregulation of the labour market, delivering to the top end of town and delivering to big business.
By way of contrast, but on the same theme of delivering to big business and the top end of town, there has been extensive debate in the House of Representatives about the nomination of a Mr Gerard as a member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and, apparently, unanimously by the cabinet—who were, apparently, swinging from the rafters in joy at this particular appointment by the Treasurer.
On the same theme, we have seen the Liberal government defending the appointment to the Reserve Bank of Australia of Mr Gerard, who had donated more than $1 million to Liberal Party election funds and who had been found by the tax office to have engaged in tax minimisation schemes in the Caribbean and, through his company Gerard Industries, in countries such as Bermuda and the Netherlands Antilles.
You could not have had, in this last fortnight of the parliament’s sittings, a truer reflection of what the Liberal Party stands for. In the Senate chamber, they have been cutting workers’ wages and conditions over time and deregulating the labour market. How many Australian workers have a bank account in Bermuda or the Netherlands Antilles, let alone in Mongolia? How many Australian workers who face the slow, steady reduction of their wages and conditions over the next few years—
—Tell me where Richo’s bank accounts are.
—How many of them have tax havens in Bermuda or the Netherlands Antilles, Senator Macdonald, tell me? What we have here is typical of this Liberal government—extraordinary arrogance. They are out of touch. They attack the wages and conditions of low- and middle-income earners in this country through their industrial relations changes and deregulation of the labour market and, at the same time, they defend a top-end-of-town mate who donated more than $1 million to their election fund and put him on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. With those few remarks, the Labor Party—
—There was somebody on the board of the European Bank as well, wasn’t there?
—I am glad you reminded me of that. Former senator Jim Short—a former Assistant Treasurer, actually—was, for a time, the Australian nominee on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; he was on their board for a period of time.

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—Well, he was another mate nominated to another bank, Senator Macdonald; that is the point. Former senator Short has long left this parliament; he was the Assistant Treasurer. It would be interesting to know if he was involved with the Treasurer, Mr Costello, in appointing Mr Gerard. I do not know what sort of job he did on the executive of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but that was another example of a Liberal Party mate—in this case, a former senator—appointed to a bank board. So this bill tends to—
—And a former IR minister, too!
—A former IR minister—that is right: Mr Reith! Mr Reith is now a director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have a really interesting synergy here, when we are talking about Australian nominees to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: a former Assistant Treasurer, former senator Short; and now, of course, the former industrial relations minister, Mr Reith.
—What about Blewett? What about Gareth Evans?
—But I make these points, Senator Macdonald, in the context of industrial relations, with the former minister, Mr Reith, over there, reconstructing Europe. And I make them in the context of what has occurred in this parliament—in this Senate and in the House of Representatives—over the last fortnight.
The Labor Party does support this piece of legislation, which concerns extending or allowing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to operate in Mongolia. As I say, I do not really know why we would need a particular piece of legislation taking up legislative time to allow such an operation. I hope a way can be found whereby we do not need acts of parliament to extend the bank’s operation into various countries around the world.
If this is going to happen more and more, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will effectively evolve into another World Bank. We already have a World Bank to which Australia contributes, and I think we need to be just a bit careful about setting up another World Bank. We need to ask what economic policy overlaps are involved in that—if that is the way in which this bank is going to evolve, because, clearly, Mongolia is not in Europe. If we are going to have more and more non-European countries in which the European Bank operates, then, effectively, it becomes a second World Bank. Issues such as cost efficiency and the overlapping of policy will, I think, come more and more sharply into focus. (Quorum formed)

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-12-09,"—It gives me enormous pleasure to participate in the second reading debate—
—They’re all leaving, Marise.
—You are still here, Senator Campbell. That could possibly be why. As I was saying, it gives me great pleasure to participate in this second reading debate on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005, but most particularly to assist Senator Sherry with a point he pressed on a number of occasions during his contribution. I think he asked the chamber on more than one occasion why we had to bring a bill before the chamber to achieve this outcome in relation to Mongolia. I would suggest that perhaps reading past the title of the bill might in fact have provided Senator Sherry with the answer to that. If he had made it to 1.3 in the explanatory memorandum then he would also have noticed that the act creates a regulation-making power so that any future amendments to the agreement can be made by regulation. Obviously he was not able to make it all the way through the onerous provisions of the four-page draft bill to determine that minor point. I am sure that is the application that those on the other side bring to these matters.
The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives early in November by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. I note that this is implementing an important commitment made by Australia as a member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the process of assisting Mongolia’s economic and social development. That is a commitment which we have made over a long period of time. The Treasurer, in fact, is a governor of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
I also noticed with some interest that in his remarks Senator Sherry left hanging in the air an observation about the value or role of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and whether it was stretching its resources too far with the sort of contribution that it was making, in comparison to the World Bank. I think it is important to note the differences and the very specific role of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to not confuse it, in this case, with the World Bank.
It was established in 1991. Communism was crumbling in central and Eastern Europe. One wonders where Senator Mason is, in fact, for this matter because I am sure he would make a very erudite contribution. I am also positive Senator Brandis will indeed enhance the debate later. The countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union needed some support to nurture a new private sector in a growing democratic environment.
—To throw off the shackles of communism.
—Yes, indeed, Senator Brandis—as they emerged from the shackles of communism. Today the European bank uses tools of investment to help build market economies and democracies in 27 countries, from central Europe to central Asia. It is in fact the largest single investor in the region. Beyond its own financing, it engages significant foreign direct investment. It is owned by 60 countries and two intergovernmental institutions. More importantly, notwithstanding the fact that it has public sector shareholders, its investments are mainly in private enterprises and usually made together with commercial powers. It provides project financing for banks, industries and businesses, both for new ventures and investments in existing companies.
It is clear from the European bank’s web site—which is a very interesting and useful web site that senators may wish to turn their attention to—that it has a very clear mandate which stipulates that it must only work in countries that are committed to democratic principles. Further, respect for the environment is part of the very strong corporate governance which is attached to all European Bank for Reconstruction and Development investments. It has several criteria in relation to the making of those investments. A country must move closer to a full market economy. It must take a risk that supports private investors and does not crowd them out. I made an early reference to its investment mainly in private enterprises. It must apply sound banking principles. The European bank promotes both structural and sectoral reforms. It is very committed to competition, privatisation and entrepreneurship. It is basically aiming in much of its work to enhance the development of the private sector with regard to all of these.
I think the issues of corporate governance are particularly important to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In fact, in the Office of the Chief Compliance Officer of the bank they go out of their way to promote good governance, to ensure that the very highest standards of integrity are applied to all the activities of the bank. It is clear that those standards of integrity are based on international best practice. In relation to compliance, they look at conflicts of interest, corruption, confidentiality and money laundering.
I want to make some remarks about their concentration on anti-corruption measures in particular. Their efforts in that regard are quite clearly set out on the web site in terms of what individuals, corporations or those who are aware of activity regarded as dubious are able to do to address their concerns. Most particularly they make very clear some principles about anti-corruption and fraud to which I am certain the Australian government also adheres. They note that corruption and fraud result in the erosion of public confidence in political institutions and legal systems, distort the allocation of resources, inflate spending on public procurement and undermine competition; in fact, they weaken the very institutions that the bank is mandated to strengthen: market economics, pluralism and democracy.
The European bank combats corruption and fraud as well as misconduct of bank officials, employees and consultants and any activity which might compromise the integrity of the bank and its partners. It is well known that Australia’s commitment in this area, particularly in its engagement in aid and development, is also very much targeted to addressing questions of corruption—dealing with corruption where it arises and ensuring that any contribution Australia makes in its aid program is not marred by the stain of corruption in countries where contributions are made.
This was most effectively reinforced recently in the statement of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group and Australia at the 17th APEC ministerial meeting. That joint statement was issued in Busan, in the Republic of Korea, in the middle of November. The ministers recognised and made absolutely clear at APEC, and there is a synergy in the approach of the European bank on this matter, that you cannot achieve the economic prosperity for which APEC aims and to which the European bank is so committed in democratic countries unless corruption both in domestic economies and in any international engagement in national business transactions is effectively addressed and that those individuals who are guilty of corruption are, in the words of the joint statement, ‘denied a safe haven’.
The ministers who were present at the APEC meeting in Busan identified a number of areas where corruption had a very corrosive and damaging effect on the economy and on good governance in nations where it occurs. They note in the joint statement that it undermines economic performance and weakens democratic institutions and the rule of law. They note that it has the capacity to disrupt social order, to destroy public trust and to provide an environment for the flourishing of organised crime, terrorism and other threats to human security. Challenges to human security are, in the new international environment in which we find ourselves, some of the greatest challenges that countries in this region and the region covered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development face.
The APEC ministers also identified corruption as one of the largest barriers to APEC’s road to free trade, to their efforts to increase economic development and to greater prosperity. The ministers very strongly reaffirmed in this statement from Busan:
... that they would continue to look for avenues to effectively address this important issue within APEC as well as in other fora.
So quite logically those members, like Australia, who are members of both organisations, are able to do that at both levels. The United Nations Convention against Corruption is a priority in this particular area, and the ministers encouraged those countries who had not done so to take appropriate steps towards its effective ratification and implementation and to continue to make reports to what is known as the ACT task force, which grew from the APEC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Symposium, which was hosted recently by Korea. Those steps in the implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption will also involve making annual reports to the ACT task force on the anticorruption commitments of APEC nations. The pledge that will be made by CEOs when the APEC CEO summit comes around in a very short period of time will be a very important part of that process.
I think that emphasis on anticorruption and what I would more broadly call good governance principles is an important part of the approach that the European bank and, of course, APEC take. It is also reflected in AusAID’s approach in terms of overseas aid. When we talk about effective governance we mean a country managing its resources competently in a way that is fair, open, accountable and responsive to people’s needs. That might include addressing governance at a number of levels. It might include improved economic and financial management, increased public sector effectiveness—another very important aspect of this sort of policy framework—strengthening law and justice, the development of an effective and functioning civil society and strengthened democratic systems.
It seems to me when I have the opportunity through some of the work that I do—for example, on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and particularly on the Human Rights Subcommittee of that committee—that these aspects of improved governance are absolutely fundamental to addressing the challenges of poverty and to addressing any effort to ensure that countries are able to lift themselves out of that development challenge and move forward with strong market economies and with transparent and comprehensive systems that individuals, the citizens of those nations, are able to have good faith in and able to work within in whatever capacity they choose. I bring those points, particularly in relation to anticorruption, to the attention of the Senate.
The decision on Mongolia which this bill relates to was a decision of the board of the European bank and was announced by Jean Lemierre, the president of the bank, in his press conference in April last year, when the commitment was made by the board. I would like to note his statement on that occasion. In his press conference that evening in London he said:
The Governors have all welcomed Mongolia. ... Mongolia wants to become a recipient country of the Bank, meaning that we can use the Bank’s money to operate in that country. I totally agree with this. We have already taken the first two steps. The Board has approved it, the Governors have approved it. Now, because this involves an amendment in the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the member countries of the Bank have to go through the process of ratifying this amendment. We have already received a few ratifications and there has been a very clear commitment by Governors to complete the process quickly. Hopefully, Mongolia will soon become a country of operation.
That of course is what we are doing here this afternoon. As has been noted earlier, the next step to ensuring that we do not have to do it with a piece of legislation on every occasion is the enactment of the provision to ensure that it can be done by regulation in the future. That will obviate the necessity for bringing bills such as this back before this chamber.
Senator Sherry made some observations in relation to the extension of the bank’s activities to Mongolia. I think it is important to note Australia’s engagement in that area currently. What we are trying to do in our engagement with Mongolia through our development cooperation program is to strengthen their human and institutional capacity for long-term sustainable development and, most importantly and again in synergy with the role of the European bank, to assist their transition to a modern, market based economy. The program which AusAID operates in Mongolia is aimed at assisting the skills base of key government agencies. We provide Australian development scholarships which will continue to develop specialised expertise and qualifications in a range of areas—and they go back to those principles of good governance I was enunciating earlier. They include: public sector financial management; the administration of government; and policy in both education and employment, in social welfare and in legal and judicial fields.
Our program also addresses funding for some select small-scale community and good governance activities. I want to talk briefly about a couple of those. We have a Mongolia-Australia Targeted Capacity Building and Small Activity Facility, which was launched in August 2003. Australia’s contribution over 2½ years to that is almost $6 million. The goal of that particular facility is to contribute to poverty alleviation—by strengthening the human resource capacity of Mongolian government agencies to implement their own government’s action program in priority areas of good governance reform and by supporting community development activities. We also, of course, respond to emergency assistance calls and appeals from Mongolia, particularly in order to help vulnerable families affected by the very severe climatic conditions they experience. There was a suggestion that perhaps a visit to Mongolia in the middle of winter might not be the most effective method of learning about the operations in the community there. But they do need that help very seriously, because the effects of the climate have included absolute devastation of the livelihoods of vulnerable nomadic herders in particular. We have been helping with emergency assistance in that regard.
We joined the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in 1991, so we have been members right from its establishment at the end of the Cold War, following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Why did we do that as a nation? We did that because we wanted to demonstrate our strong support for the political and economic changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and we wanted to encourage the development of democracy and strong market economies. It gives us an Australian voice, which is very important, in aspects of the political and economic reform process, through the bank’s policy dialogues with its borrowing members. It also gives Australia access to information about opportunities for both financial and commercial activities. As I observed earlier, we have been an active member of the European bank both through the Treasurer’s role as governor and through our representatives on the board of directors. We support this particular bill because giving access to investment funding will assist greatly in facilitating private sector growth and Mongolia’s future economic development.
I have mentioned some of our engagement with Mongolia, particularly in aid and development, but we have also had diplomatic relations with the nation of Mongolia since 1972. They have been recognised by high-level visits in both directions. In fact, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and colleagues from this chamber took a parliamentary delegation to Mongolia in April this year. We only have modest bilateral trade at this point—it was worth a total of $16 million in 2004. I understand it mostly comprises the temporary import of exploration equipment by Australian companies which operate in Mongolia. We would be looking at what scope there is for expansion of trade in areas like telecommunications; building; construction and design; and food processing industries. Our major investment prospects lie in the areas of mining and infrastructure.
In addition to the development assistance to which I have already referred, we have assisted Mongolia’s economic transition and supported their emerging democracy with aid in relation to the United Nations Development Program’s agricultural management development project. In the current financial year our official development assistance level is estimated at about $3.3 million. I indicated earlier that the Treasurer had supported and voted in favour of this proposal. That was endorsed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in a report it tabled on 10 May this year.
I noted earlier the regulation-making power which will ensure that bills of this sort do not have to come before the chambers. I think that is a very efficient way of dealing with it and it will reduce the administrative burden on the parliament. (Quorum formed)
",SENATE,<title>EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-12-09,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, in my capacity as their foreign affairs spokesperson, to briefly address the legislation before us—the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005. As you have heard, this bill follows a decision of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on 30 January last year to include Mongolia as a recipient country of the bank’s funds. The Mongolians were an integral part of the old Comecon system and, as such, were effectively as much a part of the former Soviet Union as any of the Central Asian states which have been the recipients of money. Although Mongolia has already received funds from the bank, this bill will make changes to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Act 1990 to allow Mongolia to formally become a recipient of the bank’s funds as a country of operations. I might acknowledge the contribution from Senator Sherry: maybe he was right about the number of times we get legislation in this place on an issue such as this. It might be worth rethinking this process. Nonetheless, before a country can become a country of operations, all countries which are member countries of the bank will have to ratify the bank’s decision and that is what we are seeking to do in this place today.

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—I missed that interjection, but I am trying to keep my contribution short because I know that all of us want to go home. It is ironic that we are spending all this time on non-controversial legislation. This bill has cross-party support. I think this is the winner bill of the session. No-one disagrees with the bill, but we are debating it! Forgive me, Mr Acting Deputy President, but it is starting to get to me. We had 2½ hours for the second reading debate on the antiterrorism legislation—arguably the most important bill of the decade, if not the century—and this morning we spent more time than that on a non-controversial—albeit interesting—piece of legislation. Carnegie Mellon’s establishment is an important part of my portfolio, as is the ESOS Act and its amendments and, equally, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005. I cannot believe, though, that we are spending this much time on it. But back to the bill before us—
—It is very interesting.
—If this is interesting, Senator Brandis, you need to get out more, because this ain’t fun. The Democrats acknowledge the important work undertaken by the bank since its establishment in 1991, and we support the bill for the positive impact that it might have on the economy of Mongolia. I thank Senator Marise Payne for her contribution, and I have no doubt that Senator Brandis was right when he said that he did not believe that the issues of Mongolia have been so effectively aired in this place in the history of this Senate. I am confident that he is right. I acknowledge Senator Payne’s contribution and therefore I do not intend to try and compete with it. Certainly, we hope that this bill may have a positive impact on the economy of Mongolia—and, indeed, that the consequential benefits of this bill may be many and varied.
On a serious note, we have one slight concern with this legislation. There is one aspect of the bill that we refer to with concern. The bill will also introduce broad regulation-making powers. The new section 6 of this legislation will enable the executive to react to future changes to the agreement by making regulations. In essence, this provision will resemble a Henry VIII clause because it enables the executive to change a piece of primary legislation by means of subordinate legislation. So, while I take on board Senator Sherry’s concerns, I think there is a process issue that we should look at.
These provisions appear problematic, as they seem to enable the executive, to an extent anyway, to undermine the supremacy of the parliament, which may result in the constitutionality of these provisions becoming an issue—potentially—for the High Court. But, those concerns aside, the Democrats support the bill, and I believe every person in this place, to a senator, supports the legislation before us. This again begs the question—put in a non-philosophical sense—of why we are here. Why are we here? Believe me, I am one for the constitutional and democratic processes of this chamber. I want us to debate bills, analyse law, debate amendments, vote on them accordingly and understand what we are doing, but why were we not doing that for the past fortnight on arguably the biggest bills of this century—Work Choices, Welfare to Work, antiterrorism and radioactive waste dumping? The government was gagging and guillotining them through.
—You are not interested in Mongolia, are you?
—I will answer that interjection. With all due respect, I do not think either my support for or interest in Mongolia—or the support of my party and me for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005—is under question here, thank you, Senator Brandis.
—Where is Mongolia?
—It ain’t near Tasmania, as we heard this morning. But I digress.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—You can tell we have lost it, Mr Acting Deputy President. I commend this bill to the Senate, albeit with that proviso. Again, I add my concerns about the process today and over the past fortnight. As I said, spending three hours this morning on Carnegie Mellon when, quite seriously, 2½ hours were spent at the second reading stage on the antiterrorism legislation—a bill that attacks some of the fundamental freedoms, human rights and civil liberties in this country—is a joke. People know that. I just hope that any meetings that are taking place with individual senators or even the Prime Minister are fast meetings—or at least meetings with some resolution—because it is a joke to keep the Senate here on a filibuster for this period of time.",SENATE,<title>EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-12-09,"—Senator Stott Despoja will no doubt be relieved to know this, following the extensive contributions in this debate. I have listened very carefully to all of them. I am very grateful for all the contributions to the debate on this very important bill—the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Amendment Bill 2005. I thank all senators for their contributions and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-12-09,"—What do we see here today? We see this government, in its arrogance, continuing to treat this chamber like its own private club. You may as well make this chamber an extension of the coalition party room, because that is how you are treating it. What we are seeing today is the government moving a guillotine on a highly controversial bill and then rorting the speakers list so that they still get to speak while senators on the opposition side are cut off. That is what we are seeing from this government.
And what have we seen today, fellow senators? We have seen the government engaging in a very new tactic for a last day of sitting: a government filibuster on its own legislation, just to allow the political manoeuvring over in the backrooms. What a confirmation that is that you treat the Senate as your own private club. Well, it is not your own private club. This is a chamber of the parliament of Australia and it deserves a modicum of respect, even for a government as drunk on power and as arrogant as this government has become in the short time it has had the Senate majority. This is being treated as nothing more than a meeting of the coalition—although, actually, it is probably a meeting of only the Liberal Party, because it looks like either the Nationals have rolled over or the government has done a deal with Senator Fielding.
Let us just look at what has happened here today. We spent just under 3½ hours debating non-controversial legislation that the opposition was supporting—3½ hours on a bill that the opposition said we would pass quickly and efficiently last night. We also spent nearly an hour—three-quarters of an hour—debating whether or not the European bank would do development work in Mongolia. I have nothing against Mongolia; I am sure it is very important work that the European bank does. But, really, one would have thought the parliament of this country could have spent a reasonable time discussing important legislation like the bill that is before us, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005, which has been guillotined. One would have thought that the Senate might have had the opportunity to debate more appropriately some of the legislation that we have been debating this week, or this VSU legislation we are on now, which the government wants to guillotine through. We will get half an hour for the committee stage, which is when we are supposed to examine the bill in detail.
We had just under four hours in committee on the Welfare to Work legislation. The industrial relations legislation was also guillotined, and we had 337 government amendments lobbed on the table, giving the opposition and minor party senators about seven seconds per amendment to consider it before we came into the chamber. So they guillotined terrorism, truncating that debate; they guillotined Welfare to Work to make sure there was insufficient debate there; they guillotined IR; and now they are guillotining VSU. Those are four highly controversial and important pieces of legislation that deserve proper scrutiny. People did not even know what they were voting on in the case of many of those amendments. We had hundreds of amendments voted on in a few minutes at the end of the guillotine.
Today they filibustered in the morning, talking about Mongolia and a bill that the opposition agreed with and agreed to facilitate, so that they had time to do their deal. That is what the Senate has been reduced to under this government: a filibuster in the morning and then, when it suits them, a guillotine and a gag in the afternoon. Somehow I do not think there was a conversion on the road to democracy. I do not think that occurred in the middle of the day. What has most likely occurred is a deal: either Senator Joyce has changed his mind or, if he is holding firm, Senator Fielding has changed his mind.
The opposition parties are here debating the bill and we do not know what the deal is. Senator Ludwig, in the previous, procedural debate, actually indicated that—that we do not know what we are dealing with—and I heard interjections from the other side: ‘Well, you’ll know soon enough.’ What arrogance! You are so drunk on power. You are so out of touch. You just sit there and sneer and say, ‘Well, you’ll know what it is soon.’ This is the parliament of Australia. If you are going to force legislation through, the least you can do is front up and tell us what the deal is. What sort of grubby political deal has been done to get this through? Have you held your people or not? Either Senator Joyce is doing the right thing and holding firm, in which case we are seeing the Liberal Party walking over the National Party again, driving the Nationals into oblivion, saying, ‘We’re not dealing with you, we’re dealing with Senator Fielding,’ or Senator Joyce is backing down.
The other alternative, as I said, is that Senator Fielding has made an agreement. I do not know what I can say about that, because I do not know if there has been an agreement or not. I hope that Senator Fielding sticks to his word. He is quoted publicly as saying that a compulsory service fee in relation to student unionism is reasonable, if it is set at the right level. In the article about Senator Fielding in the Herald-Sun on 23 July the fifth point under the heading ‘The 10 commandments’ was that VSU ‘should be retained as it exists in Victoria’.
I hope Senator Fielding is continuing to hold the same position. We were very disappointed that he indicated public opposition to the Welfare to Work changes but changed his mind. Obviously, that is his issue. I hope that on this matter he is going to stick to the position he indicated publicly. I would welcome it if he did.
Let me be clear about the bill that is before us. We strongly oppose the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. We oppose it and we defend the vital amenities, services and facilities provided on university campuses right across Australia which are under threat from this extreme legislation. Make no mistake, the bill before us will destroy vital campus services that support university students. Health services, child care, sporting infrastructure, counselling, clubs and societies, orientation activities, financial services, housing services and legal support services are all hanging in the balance. Yet we have seen no family impact statement and no assessment of what impact these laws will have on the capacity of many in our community to be supported at university.
Senators’ actions today will determine whether around 4,200 Australians will face losing their jobs. Those who stand opposed to this bill are standing in support of those services, facilities and amenities that are clearly threatened. We stand alongside those students and workers who will suffer as collateral damage because of the Howard government’s ideological vendettas and desire to settle old political scores. Mr Beazley has accurately described this legislation as the revenge of the nerds. But VSU is simply a nightmare set to befall our university campuses, and senators in this place have the power to pull the plug and stop this destructive ideological crusade dead in its tracks.
Labor have proposed a sensible compromise amendment to protect university student services while giving students the choice of whether or not they wish to belong to their student organisations. We stand here to support students, student services and student organisations. Under our amendment, a fee would be collected by universities for use on services for the benefit of students but compulsory membership of student organisations would be outlawed. Senator Joyce has circulated an amendment which is similar, in large part, to the amendment that has been moved by the Labor Party, and we encourage all those in this chamber to do whatever they can to rescue—to save—the vital services which are under threat from this extreme government and this extreme legislation.
The fact is, the education minister has been rushing, hoping and feverishly negotiating, trying to figure out just how much taxpayers’ money is enough to see the extreme views of a minority of Liberals extract payback from their student political foes. That is why we have all been held back here on a government filibuster. Surely Dr Nelson has better things to do than waste his time playing student politics. Sadly, it appears that is not the case. Sadly for university students across the country, Dr Nelson is resting his leadership hopes and shoring up votes for a future tilt at the deputy’s job, proving he is a member of the diehard ideological vanguard opposed to anything called a union. As was remarked in the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this year:
With John Howard on the warpath, the only union that’s safe is the Australian Rugby Union.
Unfortunately, if this legislation is passed, not even rugby union is safe—at least it is certain no university teams will be.
This bill prohibits compulsory membership of student organisations and also precludes universities charging mandatory fees for non-academic amenities and services. Noncompliance will put at risk a university’s entire funding. So we see a sledgehammer approach again from this government. It will use all the levers of government to hammer through its extreme and ideologically driven agenda.
There is also a brand new penalty provision which will fine universities if they do not comply with the Howard government’s ideology. It is no coincidence that each and every Australian university recognises the benefits of students’ contributions to the communities in which they study, socialise and learn. There is no doubt that student organisations help keep students at universities by offering the necessary subsidies and services that cash-strapped universities simply cannot offer. Perhaps one of the most poignant examples of that is child care. I think it is Flinders University in my home state of South Australia—and also the University of Adelaide, I believe—that offers subsidised child care on campus. That not only assists staff; it also assists single parents who want to go back to university to study in order to try and build a more secure future for themselves. These are the sorts of services that are under threat because those on the other side found it hard to win elections in student politics and have never forgotten it. They did not mind running and they did not mind holding office—when they won a position occasionally—but now they have the levers of government they want to impose their own extreme payback option on student unions.
This ideological vendetta of the Howard government ignores the valuable contribution that student organisations make to our community, both on campus and beyond. One very important way they do that is through sporting organisations. There has been a lot said about that. We have recently seen in the papers elite and high-profile sportspeople coming out against the government’s legislation. There are so many services which are potentially under threat—not only sport and child care but also advocacy services. The government completely ignores the help that individual students get from their student organisations. They are given help to appeal their grades. They get assistance if they have been treated unfairly or have been the victims of what might be described as common administrative glitches. This kind of persistent work—practical advocacy by student organisations for individual students and groups of students—happens every day in our universities. The associations go in to bat for these students, because student fees allow it and pay them to do so. This is one of the critical advocacy roles that will go if this bill becomes law, because it is hardly a service that can be run for a profit. If student organisations do not provide that service, the only other avenue left to students will be to resort to expensive legal representation, which, of course, the vast majority of students could not support.
We saw another example of the willingness of the minister to say and do anything on this issue when he told Kerry O’Brien on the 7.30 Report:
Well, the experience in Western Australia, where voluntary student unionism like this was introduced in 1994, was that these services not only survived; in many cases they actually flourished.
What an extraordinary statement. This minister will say and do anything to get this agenda enacted—right down to the downright misrepresentation that is in that quote. Student organisations were decimated under this type of legislation in Western Australia and student services were lost. The legislation damaged services at all Western Australian universities. The Murdoch University Guild was in such a bad financial position that its auditors could not sign off on its accounts and it survived on loans. The Edith Cowan University Guild went into liquidation and closed all of its services. I could go on. I recall that Senator Eggleston, I think, publicly expressed disquiet about this legislation. Clearly the minister does not even speak to some of the people who are on his own back bench and who might actually be open to the facts in this debate. Unfortunately, the experience in Western Australia is the fate that awaits every single student support service organisation—slow decay and then collapse.
This agenda is political payback. Earlier in the year an article in the Australian reported that the President of the Australian Liberal Students Federation ‘helped education minister, Brendan Nelson, draft the legislation’. What more evidence do we need that this bill is about nothing more than petty vendettas that originate in student politics? Some of us, I hope, have grown beyond our experience in student politics and moved on to issues that, hopefully, might be of more concern to the broader community, but it appears that some on the other side are still in the same old paradigms and still fighting the same old wars they could not win at university.
Whilst the vanguard of the attack has been the current crop of Liberal students and their vociferous alumni gnashing their teeth on the government’s back bench, they have been lone soldiers. Quite frankly, the coalition of opposition to this legislation has been nothing short of extraordinary. Let us take stock of who has opposed the Howard government’s extreme VSU attack: student organisations, regional communities who use on campus facilities—
—Vice-chancellors.
—vice-chancellors, university staff, campus chaplains—why don’t you interject on that, Senator McGauran?—sporting organisations, university staff, arts organisations, high-profile sportspeople and administrators, including prominent Olympians, high-profile performers and artists and, of course, members from all sides of this parliament. You cannot even convince your own backbench. There are a couple who are actually alive to what you are doing. They have all expressed their concerns about the impact of the government’s attack on university services.
Now is the time to take a stand. Let us back concerned words with firm action and take the 10 steps needed to save student services. The strength of opposition to this bill has forced the minister into humiliating delay after humiliating delay. There has been a humiliating filibuster today on non-controversial legislation, while in a frantic flurry of activity the government tried to get a deal with either Senator Joyce or Senator Fielding—or through their own party room.
When VSU was originally discussed by the minister it was going to start in 2006, but when that could not happen it was pushed back to 2007. After the ideologues on the Liberal back bench convinced the minister that you could not let good sense get in the way of extreme ideology, the education minister came up with the brilliant idea of a mid-2006 starting date. Those opposite are desperate to take vengeance on those who beat them in elections for the working groups of the subcommittees of the boards of management of their university student associations during the seventies and eighties. That is why they want to impose an administrative nightmare on our universities. Hell hath no fury like a Liberal politician scorned. It is plainly obvious that this new mid-year starting date is administratively unworkable. After amendment in the House, the punitive sections of the bill will not apply until 1 July 2006, unless you are a new student enrolling in a new course of study commencing after that date. But, presumably, if you are a student during first semester next year, it will still be possible that during second semester you will be required to pay your union fees to support the vital range of campus services. Is anyone else in the chamber confused? It is not surprising if we are. Certainly the universities are.
This government has been in disarray on this piece of legislation. We have seen that disarray play out before us on the floor of the chamber: government members filibustered in the morning and then suddenly had a conversion and voted for a guillotine and a gag on this debate in the afternoon, after getting their riding instructions. This government has tried every trick in the book to get its way. Those who get on their feet and speak in this debate, including me and those from the opposition and minor parties who will get up after me, do not even know what the deal is. Unless someone has told us in the meantime, none of us even know what the proposition is. Is there an amendment to be moved? Is there some additional funding we do not know about? We have not had anything from the government on this. Perhaps there is a funding offer where senators are being offered millions of dollars in taxpayers’ money to massage this legislation past rightful and principled opposition.
The fact is nothing has been confirmed on the public record or in this chamber on what this deal might be. All we have is media speculation—reports that, in order to secure cash grants, universities would be asked to ‘clearly demonstrate a drop in the number of students paying a compulsory fee had affected the viability of sporting recreation facilities’. What that would mean is that universities would have to wait for their facilities and services to decay before being able to access the funds. That is very logical. Let them run down, let them prove they have run down, then they can come back and ask for some money from the government. We have not been provided by this government with any proper assessment on the impact of this legislation—and certainly no assessment of its impact on families.
There is no legislative guarantee that any money that is on the table will be appropriately allocated. I hope in the discussions with the senators on the other side who have expressed concern about this that that has been made clear. Today senators are being asked to lay waste to our university campuses and their vital student services on the promise of a minister who, a little more than a decade ago, said that he had never voted Liberal in his life. There is consistency for you: he had never voted Liberal in his life! The only way to save student services and universities is to allow all universities to levy a compulsory fee for amenities and services. Labor’s amendment will save university student services. We stand opposed to this legislation, which will be terribly damaging to the services provided. We urge all senators to do the same. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-12-09,"—As the only person from the Democrats who will get onto the speakers list today, I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to make it very clear that we strongly oppose this legislation and the process that we have observed today in this place. Today is Freaky Friday in the Senate. On Freaky Friday we have talked for an hour or so on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development involving Mongolia and spent 3½ hours on a non-controversial, bipartisan supported bill involving the establishment of Carnegie Mellon and a change to the ESOS Act. That is 3½ hours of valuable, taxpayer-funded Senate time. Earlier this week, 2½ hours was good enough for antiterrorism, which is arguably the most significant piece of legislation in this parliament’s history, let alone in the last almost decade of this coalition government.
Welcome to Freaky Friday, where we do not care about democracy. Democracy, schemocracy! We do not care about informing people about what deals may or may not have been brokered in this place. We do not care if people get to speak. We do not care if people know what we are voting on. In fact, we do not even care if we get to put our amendments separately, because democracy in this place is dead. It does not matter that the standing orders still apply or that we have process, because I have seen every convention—or every convention with which I was familiar in this place, anyway—abused in this place in the last two weeks. But this takes the cake. How ironic that we are debating a bill that deals with issues of democracy, control of student affairs and the use of dollars at university campuses that are usually otherwise organised through the university and its student associations, university unions and guilds. How ironic that we are talking today about pulling the rug out from under those very support services, amenities and representative, sporting and other services provided on campuses, and we are doing it in minimal time. We have 1½ hours for debate, if you are lucky enough to get onto the speakers list in this newfound democratic place, and half an hour for the committee stage in case you want to talk about the amendments that at least two senators have moved to this bill. Half an hour for amendments—what a joke!
Senator Wong is right. What is the deal? My gosh, Freaky Friday has now turned into a television program! What is the deal? How did Senator Fielding’s meeting with the Prime Minister go this morning? I ask only because I am genuinely interested. I hope that it was fun and a nice exchange of views. I would not mind knowing, just for the record, whether a deal was struck. I do not want to pre-empt anything Senator Fielding might add in this place—or Senator Joyce, as the case may be. Just tell us! One thing I will say is that all of us have done deals in this place. All of our political parties have been party to deals with each other. But you will not find the Democrats having done a deal without negotiation, consultation and making it transparent. People may not have liked the deals we have done. I might not even have liked some of the deals we have done. But we know about them and we tell the Senate with less than five minutes to midnight.
This abuse of Senate process this week is as embarrassing as it is dictatorial. The upper house is being abused and eroded in a shameful way. This is not a house of review; this is a joke. It seems to me that there are smug and contrite faces on the other side. I am always very wary of reflecting on people personally, but I tell you what—the hubris in this place is just coming off people. It is palpable. What arrogance—we spent the morning in a farcical debate about Mongolia and Carnegie Mellon because people wanted to make a deal behind closed doors. Now we are debating the deal and we do not even know what it is. Does that suggest that maybe we are in for a shock? Maybe the numbers really are in the balance. Maybe we are going to have a considered debate and people can make up their minds on the floor. They can observe, assess and debate the amendments and then make a considered decision. Of course we won’t, because you cannot do it in 1½ hours of debate and half an hour of committee stage.
The bill is so significant. This bill has at least $600 million worth of consequences for student organisations, sporting facilities, people’s jobs and also for those students who might not even actually be on campus—that is, aspiring students. This has huge consequences—generational consequences. It has consequences for regional, remote and rural areas. It has consequences for campuses. It has consequences for the universities. It has consequences for communities. We are dealing with it in a token 1½ hours—less than the amount of time for a non-controversial, cross-party supported bill dealing with Mongolia. This is extraordinary.
Let us talk about this legislation. The likely effects of this bill have been well documented in a committee report. They are broad-ranging and devastating. We are talking about emasculating student services that have served our universities well for decades. I ask: what was it about the university experiences of members that was so bad, so chronic and so traumatising that so many of them in this place have come armed with this vendetta? They want to get their hands on university student organisations and completely destroy them. What was it? What happened?
Look at the cabinet ministers with university degrees: the Prime Minister, ministers Downer, Costello, Hill, Minchin, Abbott, Ruddock, Coonan, McGauran—the other McGauran—Vanstone, Nelson, Patterson and Andrews. What happened? I will tell you what happened. They went through university and most of them—and I will stand corrected quite happily if need be—got their university degrees on the public purse. Publicly funded and accessible education I will defend until I die. What is wrong with the people who got it, though? They are not prepared to defend it. In fact, they want to go one step further. They want to use misrepresentative phrases like ‘freedom of association’ to justify their wreaking of revenge on the student organisations. It was good enough for them, but it is not good enough for the next generation of students. It is not good enough for students today and it is not good enough for students tomorrow. What happened to them? What was so bad and tawdry about their university experiences? I hate to think.
This is part of a broader attack. We have all seen it. We have all seen the legislation come through in months and weeks and years. There have been HECS hikes, up-front fees, deregulation of the postgraduate sector and further fees and charges for overseas students. In fact, just this morning, without wishing to reflect on a vote of the Senate, we passed the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill—everyone would remember because we spent quite a bit of time on it; 3½ hours, I believe—which actually ensured that a compulsory student services fee was charged for overseas students. How ironic! We did not hear about freedom of association then—well, we did from Senator McGauran, but that is because of a mistake. He did not know what the bill was about.
So: overseas students, domestic students and university autonomy—for the first time in history a minister has the greatest power ever to interfere in the courses run by a university. ‘What about the ARC?’ I hear you ask. What happened to that board? What are we going to do to that? The minister now has discretion to not fund decisions and recommendations by the ARC. Are we allowed to know why that is the case? Of course we are not. It is not publicly transparent. It is not available. It is not accountable. It is not on record. It is not tabled. It is not even in the annual report. There is a long list of attacks on the university sector, but this one is a beauty. This is the one that not only enables the government to wreak revenge and have their ideological political direction—whatever that may be—but also single-handedly undermines the services provided by those universities.
It also takes away their voice. This is the other part of this debate: representation, advocacy, counselling and welfare—all these important areas are lost. I understand that there are many people in this place and their families that may not need assistance. They may have enough money to get them through. That is okay, but most students do not. Most communities do not. Most of the committees that are going to be hit hardest by this bill are those who happen to be poorer or, indeed, live in regional, rural or remote areas—a fact that I think is acknowledged by some on the other side.
So we are talking about stifling dissent. Are we in this place really so scared of students in their organisations feeding into the democratic process, even protesting against what we do with this place? Are we really so scared that we are going to completely destroy their opportunity to organise at all? Student affairs should be student controlled. It is the basic premise, a basic message, and one with which I agree. I am not fooled by terminology such as ‘freedom of association’ nor am I fooled by the notion that a fee that is charged in a universal fashion on a university campus is akin to trade union membership, because it is not. The court cases and the legal research prove it. This fee is more akin to council rates, the kinds of rates that we contribute to a community, as we do as members of a community. Our rates are paid to the council for the services and the amenities that they provide.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I appeal to you and others on this note: when we talk about communities, universities are just that—or at least they used to be. They are not just machines producing academic qualifications with a degree at the end. They are a holistic experience. I know that I have lost this debate but I still feel as though it has to be put on record because it means so much. It is not just an Australian tradition or an Oxbridge tradition; it is a tradition around the world. People are encouraged to expand their cultural, social, political, sporting and, yes, even religious horizons. That is what university is about. Otherwise we would all stay home and get qualifications by other means.
Mr Acting Deputy President, do not misunderstand. I do not doubt the worth of any kind of education. Lifelong learning is a passion and it is one we all feel strongly about. I have no doubt about it. I do not suggest for a moment that vocational education and training has any less worth—of course it has not. Education in itself is the key to empowerment, equality, enlightenment and democracy, so of course we all subscribe to the notion of lifelong learning, and one aspect of that is the university experience. It is different from TAFE. It is different from school. It is different from WEA. They all have their place but university as an experience is what we are talking about today, and it is the experience that we have single-handedly, or at least consistently over time in this place, destroyed.
We keep forgetting that some people cannot afford to go to university. They cannot afford to go to TAFE either where upfront, full fees apply—and before anyone interjects that I have got a problem with TAFE or the voc ed sector, please do not misunderstand that. There are people out there who were able to access universities as a consequence of the abolition of tertiary fees in the 1970s under Whitlam. That is a fact. There is research that tells us that fees and charges remain a financial disincentive and a psychological one for students entering into and participating in higher education. When you combine that with a lack of student income support—and let us face it, it is woeful and anyone who read the latest Senate inquiry into that will acknowledge the below poverty line levels of supplementary income for students particularly those from regional campuses—it is just not good enough. So when you combine fees and charges and debts the size of your parents’ or your own mortgage, it starts to add up.
When you finally get to university, what support structures ensure all students, young or old—mature age as well as those who have just left school—and particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, can participate in this university experience? What support structures are there to ensure that there is help with their child care, with their advocacy, with their welfare, and indeed with representation, with media, sporting activities, clubs of all kinds, subsidised catering, the bars and other activities? There is an extraordinary breadth of activities.
If we do not like those activities, if students on campus do not like those activities, they have input to the process of deciding the disbursement of those funds. I am not suggesting they are always perfect—of course they are not. It is like suggesting that all democratic institutions are perfect. D’oh! We are not exactly a perfect institution today on this Freaky Friday, Mr Acting Deputy President. In fact I think that our democratic structures could do with a little tightening up. Nearly every—indeed, I stand corrected—every institution, every university in this country, now has a conscientious objection clause. For those people advocating freedom of association, there is your out. Nobody wishes to ensure that you belong to a union, guild or association that you find offensive or that is somehow contrary to your conscience, and nor should you.
We are not talking about that; we are talking about the payment of a fee that is supported by the key representative groups and key organisations in the sector: the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations; the National Tertiary Education Union; the National Union of Students; the National Liaison Committee for International Students; and the AVCC, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee—not always the most radical group out there, with all due respect to some of the vice-chancellors on that committee, but they are united and they are united on this issue. When you have the vice-chancellors, the key administrators of universities in Australia today, saying, ‘This is bad law,’ then we should be listening and taking note.
It is not only those organisations; it is individuals, high-profile and prominent Australians, ordinary Australians and people who have been involved in the arts, sport and a whole range of activities. They have all said how they feel about this bill. They have made it clear in full-page advertisements. How ironic. I have a copy of the second full-page advertisement this week that an organisation have felt compelled to take out because they just do not believe their government is listening in any other way.
I recall reading on Tuesday, once again, the John North/Law Council full-page advertisement. They were so desperate for a response to their originally private letter to the Prime Minister of this country, where they outlined their fundamental problems with human rights and civil liberties breaches in arguably the biggest piece of law we have dealt with in this place in a century. Look at the names of the people: Cate Blanchett, Barrie Kosky, Nadine Garner, Nell Scholfield, Joe Kennedy, and the list goes on.
—Never heard of them.
—They are all political enemies too, are they? Whoops. If you do not agree with the artists, the journalists, the writers and the sports heroes, it is just extraordinary. The government cannot deny the strength of ill-feeling towards this legislation, because most people in the community know what it is about. They know why this is being moved. They understand that this is vengeance and vendetta dressed up as some kind of support for freedom of association. How misleading. In recent days we heard about deals, discussions, negotiations and bribes, because that is what they are—$80 million here, $100 million there; ‘Whoops, I will raise you $120 million if you sell out students for today, sell out university experience and forget the aspiring graduates of tomorrow.’ Do we honestly think that $120 million is going to compensate for the job losses, lost services and lost amenities?
We have heard a lot about those things but, as has been made clear today, we do not know what the deal is. That is the deal: a blank sheet. We have nothing. I sincerely hope there is no deal, but I have to admit—I listened to our Prime Minister on television last night and again, I believe, on radio this morning—that the Prime Minister led us to believe that he was not going to pursue this legislation unless he felt he had some prospect of success. So I can only believe that he feels he has some prospect of success and that is why we spent this morning filibustering and debating bills that were non-controversial and unnecessary for that time frame of debate.
I will not necessarily get a chance to speak in the committee stage, given that we have only half an hour, so I say now that the amendments are an attempt to ameliorate the worst aspects of the bill. The ALP’s are better than Senator Joyce’s—for those of us who have read them, and I am sure that everyone is au fait with the amendments here—but they do not go far enough and I think that is acknowledged by the movers. At this point, I think we are all desperate to do something to ameliorate the impact of this legislation, such as it is. We are desperate to do something that recognises that maybe we are not in the best position to make these decisions. How dare our government talk about using taxpayer funded dollars to compensate universities for the money that students would otherwise be paying. What about user pays? (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-12-09,"—The Senate is debating the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. The Nationals have long supported the abolition of student union fees, believing that no-one should be forced to join a union or that their money should go to people or events that they do not support. The Nationals’ policy is to support the abolition of compulsory student union fees while also looking after the educational and other needs of students, particularly in regional areas.
This legislation gives effect to the abolition of the fees, while The Nationals have argued strongly for and secured a funding package of some $80 million that will contribute to non-educational university amenities and services. We went to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, and put our case in the strongest possible terms. The funding package would not be there today if it were not for the National Party. I believe it answers our policy resolution on VSU as much as is possible at this time. I am aware that there is a proposed amendment from my colleague Senator Joyce, which will be moved in the committee stage but which is not supported by the government.
It is necessary to canvass the issues raised in the second reading stage in order to outline why I support the bill before us. It is tempting to cross the floor to applause from vested interests. In my younger days I may even have given in to the temptation. It is hard to resist the bright lights and popular talk shows of the media. It is hard to resist the magnet of a high profile. Every person in the Senate today has that same opportunity. Fourteen years in opposition teaches you that the only way you will win and hold onto government is to have a tight and sustainable coalition. And if you are not in government, you have nothing to offer your constituents. However, if I were to vote against the government at any stage of this bill, as a party leader in the Senate there is no doubt that I would put the coalition under tremendous pressure.
The Nationals come to Canberra with a distinct policy focus and we argue for that in the party rooms and forums available to us. We benefit from access to ministers and have voices in the cabinet room. There are two alternative approaches from then on: either you abide by the coalition party room decision and go out and sell the joint decision or you take it upon yourself to publicly disagree. There are pros and cons with each strategy, as most senators understand. You can sell yourself for going against the government or you can go with the team approach that secures government and holds you there.
It was The Nationals’ voice in the coalition that got the package for university funding. There would not have been any such funding had The Nationals not gone in and fought hard for it. Not only that; as with all legislation we will monitor the situation of non-educational services at universities closely. If the package is not enough or is not working out properly, The Nationals will be the first to negotiate with the minister for a better deal. This is what is on the table today and we have to go forwards, not backwards. We have to be a coalition to have government and to have ministers that we can go to.
It is no secret The Nationals have had concerns about facilities at regional universities. I do not think we could have expressed those concerns more vigorously than we have at every opportunity in the forums available to us. We have pushed the cause of these students as far as we are able. There comes a point in a coalition relationship where both sides have moved to accommodate each other and can go no further. Then it is up to the coalition as a whole to step together, not to draw apart in conflict. That is why this coalition government has been so successful. There has to be give and take. Individually we attract a wider pool of voters than we could if we were amalgamated. We then bring them together under a coalition. We bring government to all those people.
Unfortunately, the same situation does not always exist at state level, which is why we have so many state Labor governments. It would be dangerous to try the state version of coalition in Canberra because that would put huge pressure on the federal coalition. There is a view from some in Queensland to support an amendment to this bill, even though none was put forward by our colleagues in the lower house. It is possible that any such amendment could be the straw that would put considerable pressure on the coalition camel’s back if I were to give my support to it as a Senate leader. I will not put a successful coalition government in jeopardy because the implications of that would be far worse for The Nationals’ constituents than the applause that may come from supporting an amendment not sanctioned by The Nationals party room or the joint party room.
The condemnation that would fall on The Nationals if we were to undermine this government would pull down our electoral prospects to a position from which we would never recover. To my critics waiting in the wings, I say that I do not have the luxury of a populist stand on this.

Senator Lundy interjecting—

 (Senator Brandis)—Order! Senator Lundy, Senator Boswell will be heard in silence.
—I have negotiated sincerely and with great effort to bring about a compromise that satisfies both coalition partners. My record across many industries and issues shows that I will always go into bat if there is a hole or an oversight in government policy or a need for government action. The bill should be supported. There are always ways to deal with any shortcomings if and when they arise. It is far better to be in government to be able to address issues as they arise than to be locked in opposition with no way to deliver for your constituents.
My stance on this bill is all about supporting the coalition as the best structure to deliver good government for Australia. It is about making sure that students who are external or part time do not pay for services they never use, so straightaway they are better off by hundreds of dollars. It is all about saving money for many of The Nationals’ constituents who struggle to send their kids to uni. The football fields will still be there tomorrow and there will still be students playing on them, but they will be about $600 better off. Sure, everyone has a wish list when they come down here and enter the party rooms. I believe that I have achieved a great deal for The Nationals’ constituents because of the coalition.
I am enormously proud of this government. Over the last decade we have turned the nation from a shipwreck into an aircraft carrier. We have not just weathered the storms of international economic crisis; we have prospered as a nation. We have created employment and wealth and given our children a future. Those achievements are directly due to the fact that we have held this coalition together.
At the last federal election I was fully involved in The Nationals’ Queensland Senate campaign and worked tremendously hard to win that seat for The Nationals and Senator Joyce. That has meant much to the coalition. Together with Senator Joyce, the National-Liberal coalition has some wonderful achievements to look back on this year with the passage of major legislation.
It must be recognised that it is not easy for National senators to get elected. We have to distinguish ourselves from other candidates, yet not jeopardise the coalition. There is a fine balance required. I relish my job because I can deliver for many industry groups, from sugar and fishing, tobacco growers, wheat growers, graziers, miners, ethanol producers, banana growers, pork producers and ginger and pineapple growers to super-yachts and small business. I can go directly to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and ministers for action. I can deliver road funding, mobile phones and the internet to remote Australia. I travel from Normanton and Boulia in the most far-flung regions of my great state of Queensland and help them with tourism and development projects and infrastructure. I can be a voice for social conservative voters and influence the political agenda on issues such as abortion, RU486, stem cell research, euthanasia, pornography and so on.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on relevance. Senator Boswell has completely gone off the track. He is not addressing the bill that is about to sell out students around Australia and I ask you to draw his attention to the bill.
—There is no point of order. Senator Boswell’s remarks are relevant to the debate on the second reading of the bill.
—It is tempting to cross the floor on occasions and rev up my short-term personal vote. In these days of cynicism against politicians and political institutions, it would be popular too. But the day we allow populism to triumph in our parliaments is the day the ship of state sinks. There are those who wait for me to support the government on the existing bill so that they can pull me down. But I would rather go out fighting for good coalition government than leave on my knees to populism.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-12-09,"—This issue has been a vexed one for me and for Family First. I have looked at the issue on its merits and I genuinely believe the argument can run both ways—to retain compulsory student union fees or abolish them. I have been asked constantly for my views about the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005—for many days and weeks—and have given an honest answer, telling my parliamentary colleagues, the media and my constituents that I have not made up my mind on the bill. I have had a great deal of trouble deciding on this legislation because there are strong advocates for both sides mounting good cases.
Family First has met with a range of groups, including the Australian Campus Union Managers Association at RMIT in Melbourne, as well as Sydney University Sport. I have listened to arguments by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Prime Minister. I have also spoken with the opposition leader and met with the shadow minister for education. I have had numerous delegations in my office, ranging from the National Union of Students to Christian student groups to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee.
While this bill is about an issue that is close to the hearts of many coalition members, that is not something that bothers me. I am not fussed by the noise surrounding this issue nor interested in the politics. The matters I have been pondering include what is education and what is the purpose of education, what services should be provided at tertiary institutions and who should pay for them, what obligations do tertiary institutions have and whether people at tertiary institutions receive preferential treatment in terms of access to subsidised services that others in the community do not have. I am also conscious of the need to promote higher education and access to higher education, particularly for people from the outer suburbs and regional areas.
Family First believes this bill raises two central issues. The first is compulsory student unionism—whether students should have to be members of unions or associations. The second issue is whether students should be required to pay a compulsory fee for services and whether those services are an essential part of a university experience. There are a range of conditions under which students pay amenities and services fees. Part-time students and those at regional campuses or studying off campus usually pay less than full-time students at metropolitan campuses. Most universities do not require membership of a student union or provide an exemption for students who do not want to join a student union. However, all students are required to pay the compulsory charge.
Family First is opposed to compulsory unionism and believes students should have the freedom to choose whether they belong to a union or any club or association. In relation to paying compulsory fees, the question we need to ask is whether, if we abolish compulsory fees, we will cut out many of the services that exist on universities. How many of these services would continue without a compulsory fee and how many are really essential? Do any of these services mean the difference between a student being able to attend a university or not? I am persuaded by the argument that many services would not continue in the same form if this bill was passed. But it is argued that services that students really want, and need, will continue.
Current and former university students have told me of their frustration at having to pay a compulsory fee for services they have never used. Others have spoken passionately about the need to subsidise services such as legal advice, housing assistance, counselling and child care and how important these are to students, particularly those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as some mature age students, such as single parents returning to study. In Victoria, student fees range from about $130 to $440 per year, which is a lot of money to many students and many families. I remember when I was an engineering student. Being one of 16 children, I am fully aware of how compulsory amenity fees can stretch people and I can understand how students would prefer to spend the money elsewhere. Are we imposing hardship on some students right now?
These are the sorts of issues I have been considering, as well as trying to ponder the possible consequences if this bill is passed—particularly what the unintended consequences might be. I have found it difficult to focus on the issues given the overloaded legislation schedule we have had in the Senate this past fortnight. I ended up locking my office door last night, because a number of colleagues—all well meaning—kept dropping in to offer advice and it was difficult to focus on the details. While it has been hard to find time for quiet contemplation, I have been able to weigh up these issues, clarify these views and finally arrive at a decision. I have also put all the politics and noise aside. As I said at the outset, I have focused on the merits of the bill before us—nothing else. And, when Family First votes, let me stress that Family First will be voting on this bill and nothing else.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-12-09,"—There we go. There is the deal. At four o’clock on a Friday Senator Sell-Out comes in here to tell us that he has sold out students across this country.
 (Senator Brandis)—Order, Senator Nettle! Senators will address other senators by their names, not by offensive nicknames. Senator Nettle, withdraw that, please.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Withdraw what?
—There is no point of order. I have called Senator Nettle to order.
—I am asking what phrase you’re asking to be withdrawn.
—I am sorry, Senator Conroy; there is no point of order. I am calling Senator Nettle to order. Senator Nettle, Senator Fielding will be addressed by his name. Senator Nettle, you have the call. You will address Senator Fielding and all other senators by their names.
—Yes. Senator Fielding has sold out Australian students at universities across this country—not just students who are studying now but generations of students who will come through Australian universities and who will not be able to access the services that senators in this chamber accessed while they were at university. Students will not be able to access services like child care, for example. They will not be able to enjoy the fulfilment of campus life or have the opportunity to have full knowledge and experience of university. Senator Fielding has sold out students who choose to involve themselves in a whole range of different clubs on campus. That includes students who choose to involve themselves in Christian clubs on campus, and we all know that there are many of those. Senator Fielding has sold out those students and their Christian clubs here in the Senate at four o’clock on a Friday. He made the deal with the Prime Minister this morning and then he came in here at four o’clock and said: ‘I’m going to sell out all those students. I don’t care about those students.’
What about the mature age student who wrote to me who studies at the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle? She is studying mathematics and fine arts. She is a single mother with four children alive and one child deceased. Her youngest child is disabled. She wrote to me about the great benefit that the compulsory student amenity fee has provided for her. She said:
If this fee is made voluntary few students would pay it. This would mean a great deal less support ... for students like me.
She talked about how she wishes to start a degree in teaching next year and about how it requires a compulsory practical component. She wrote to me about her student association, which provides the on- and off-campus insurance that will allow her to do the practical component of her course. The practical component of her course is being put in jeopardy by Senator Fielding here this afternoon. This mature age student with four children, one of whom is disabled, who relies on the services at her campus, will not be able to access the child-care services that she currently accesses at her university. I have received a raft of these letters. I have visited 23 campuses around this country, talking with students about the impact of voluntary student unionism. I have also met with the managers of student unions, who are right now making decisions about which services they will have to cut, thanks to Senator Fielding.
Government senators interjecting—
—How many child-care centres will be cut out of Australian universities, thanks to Senator Fielding? How many services will be stripped from students, which will mean that they will not be able to continue with their study, thanks to Senator Fielding?
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Government senators will come to order. Senator Nettle should be listened to silence.
—It is worth reminding the chamber, especially members of the opposition who are here and who I know are extremely disappointed with the outcome we have today, that Senator Fielding is in this chamber because of the Australian Labor Party. Senator Conroy has been over here trying to find out what is going on with Senator Fielding. Senator Conroy, it was your party in Victoria that gave preferences to Senator Fielding, which allowed him to come in here today, at four o’clock on a Friday afternoon, and sell out Australian university students now and into the future. It is worth acknowledging that that is why Senator Fielding is here today and that is why he is able to sell out the university students of today and the future.
What does Senator Fielding say to the students who write to me? Another student from the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle wrote to me to say that he saves every year for enough money to be able to go with his touch footy team to play at the University Games. He wrote to me about how much money he saves up every year to go on those trips, to be able to spend money in the regional centres where his touch footy games are played for the university. This is being ripped away from him, thanks to this government and Senator Fielding. I applaud the two young women students from Macquarie University who were at a hockey game recently which the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Minister Nelson, attended. I applaud those two young girls, who are members of the Macquarie University hockey team. They held up a sign which said: ‘My hockey team will not be playing next year because of this man.’
—Pay the fee, get the service.
—That sign was pointed at Minister Nelson.
—Pay the fee, get the service. What’s wrong with you?
—Order, Senator Ronaldson!
—Perhaps they should hold up another sign which says that their hockey team will not be able to play in future hockey games with a whole range of other universities not just because of Minister Nelson but also because of Senator Fielding, who got in here on the preferences of the Australian Labor Party.
—Whose pre-ferences did you get in on?
—There are university students whom we all met with—perhaps not many that Senator Fielding has met with—
Government senators interjecting—
—Senator Fielding talked today about the number of students who had been in his office. I am not sure how many of those students Senator Fielding actually met, but there are students now and there will be students into the future who will have none of the opportunities and choices that Senator Abetz and Senator Mason got to enjoy at university. They will not have those same services. I am very interested to hear what Senator Fielding has to say about the compulsory payment of taxation in our community.
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! There are too many interjections and there is too much audible conversation. Would everybody please do Senator Nettle the courtesy of listening to her in silence.
Senator Fielding came in here today and said, ‘I don’t think that students should have to pay for these services.’ I wonder what Senator Fielding thinks about people in our community who have to pay for the roads that they drive on and the child-care centres that their local councils run out of their council rates. I wonder what Senator Fielding has to say about the football fields that are provided and maintained out of funding that is given to local councils. I wonder what Senator Fielding has to say about all these sorts of services that can only be provided to the high quality that they are provided to if everyone chips in. This goes to the very question of whether people should be contributing to services for everyone to use.
This is why the Australian Greens support not just universal student services on campuses that are run and controlled by students but also universal public services in our community—public services like health and education. The government are only to able to provide those services because everyone chips in. Maybe some people do not use the child-care centre, perhaps not right now. Perhaps in a few years they will; perhaps their parents used it. But the services are only there because everyone has chipped in. Those services will not be there in the future at Australian universities, thanks to this government and Senator Fielding coming in here and selling out university students in Australia and university students into the future.
We have heard examples of what has happened at universities in Western Australia. They have simply not been able to provide the same level of services. When you say to somebody, ‘Do you want to pay taxes?’ funnily enough, most people will say no. So when you say to students, ‘Do you want to pay for these things?’ funnily enough, they do not all say yes. That is why we have compulsory taxation in this country, and that is why we should have a system where everyone in that community contributes like they do in the broader community—contributes to ensure that those services are there.
Let me give another example. A postgraduate student who studies at Flinders University in Adelaide has written to me. This student goes through the services that are provided at that postgraduate organisation and compares the costs that students pay currently for those services with the costs of similar services that are available in the local community. For example, at the child-care centre that exists at Flinders University, students are charged $60 per semester for one child and $5 for each additional child. Let me say that again for all those mothers who are thinking about how much they pay for their child care: if you are a postgraduate student at Flinders University you pay $60 per semester for one child and $5 for each additional child. By comparison, the closest child-care facility to Flinders University charges $235 per week for one child only.
This is the choice that this government wants to give mature age university students with children who need to access child-care services. Would you like the choice of paying $235 per week to have your child in the local child-care centre, or would you like the choice of paying $60 per semester for your child to go to those services? That choice will not be there if this legislation goes ahead, because that university will not be able to provide the same kinds of subsidies to enable university students to send their children to that child-care centre for just $60 per semester. The choice will not be there.
This legislation is not about choice. This legislation is about taking away student choice; it is about taking away student voices. Here we are in here, right at the end of the year, 9 December, at a quarter past four and all the students are doing their exams, have gone away on holidays or are out there feverishly working to earn enough money to pay their way through university next year. They are not able to be here making sure that their voices and concerns are heard in the debate. So it is left to us to read out these letters and examples that we have received or heard from the students we have visited around the country, because it is the students who are being sold out today. It is the students who are having their throats and voices ripped out, ensuring that they do not get to have a say about what happens on their campus.
Senator Abetz over there got to have a say about what happened on his campus when he was at university, and Senator Mason over there got to have a say about what happened on his campus when he was at university, but this government and Senator Fielding want to make sure that students in the future do not get to have a say about what happens with the money that they contribute to ensure services are there for all students on their campus. The government and Senator Fielding want to make sure about that, and they will do it in this way and a whole raft of other ways—taking students off university councils or whatever it may be. They will find every avenue available to them to ensure that future students do not get the opportunities that members of this government have had—taking away that voice from students; taking away the opportunity for students to come together and put together a whole range of activities, whether it is newspapers, newsletters, student activities or setting up clubs.
This government is taking away those opportunities for students. We have heard from people in the community who have enjoyed the same experiences that senators here have enjoyed talk about how much being involved in those activities benefited them. This chamber and the House of Representatives are absolutely full of people who have experiences from being involved in a representative democracy on their student campus, learning about whatever it might be: debating—I am sure in the case of Senator Mason—being involved in activities, making decisions and being representatives. They learnt those skills and learnt those ropes as students, and they want to deny future students the opportunity to be involved in those activities. They want to take away from students the choice of being involved in those activities as part of their extracurricular activities. That is how many people have made their way into this chamber and into the House of Representatives—by being involved in those activities and learning about democracy and representation. This government and Senator Fielding want to take all those life experiences away from future Australian university students.
We have heard from many people who have enjoyed these experiences regarding what will be taken away. Let me share with the Senate a letter I received from an associate professor at the University of Melbourne who wrote to me about the theatre board at the University of Melbourne. She said:
The Theatre Board’s role at the University is to encourage the widest possible participation in theatrical activity from students across the University, not only aspiring performers directors and writers, but lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects and economists—even budding politicians—whose confidence, teamwork and public presentation are immeasurably enhanced by their extracurricular experiences in theatre.
Student theatre has an extraordinary history at the University of Melbourne and has been instrumental in shaping Melbourne’s and Australia’s cultural life. The Melbourne Theatre Company grew out of the Union Theatre. Student theatre also had a significant role in the development of many other theatre companies and movements, including La Mama, the Australian Performing Group, Whistling in the Theatre, Chamber Made Opera, law and Architecture reviews, the D Generation and the broader comedy scene in Melbourne and Australia.
Innumerable people who have been influential in shaping Australia’s cultural history developed their skills in student theatre at Melbourne, including performers ... Barry Humphries ... Norman Kaye, Zoe Caldwell ... Joan Harris, Max Gillies, Cate Blanchett ... Steve Vizard and Rod Quantock, directors John Summer ... and George Fairfax; and writers, Ray Lawlor, Jack Hibberd ... Benefactors Richard Pratt and the late Sir Rupert Hamer developed their love of the arts through student theatre as did many public intellectuals, including Germaine Greer.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I apologise to Senator Nettle for the interruption, but I wonder if coalition senators could do us the courtesy of having their meetings outside the chamber.
—There is no point of order. I have already called senators’ attention to the level of audible conversation. I did not think it was particularly distracting at that point, but perhaps Senator Wong’s advice might be taken.
—It is very rude.
—I was just speaking about all of the people who got to enjoy the experiences that this government and Senator Fielding this afternoon are moving to deny Australian university students. Things like the Monty Python team came out of student theatre. These are the sorts of things that this government and Senator Fielding are denying future students the opportunity to be involved in.
Recently, I visited a gallery called the Watt Space Gallery. It is in Newcastle and is funded by the student union there. Over the last six years nearly 4,000 students have exhibited their artwork at that gallery. They have had nearly 200,000 people visit the gallery and nearly $300,000 of student artwork has been sold. It has been around since 1989 and has developed a national and regional reputation as a premier student art gallery. Students learn the skills of running and curating exhibitions and promoting shows, and many of them go on to be successful artists or run galleries in regional Australia or around the world.
Without the funding and infrastructure provided by the University of Newcastle union, the future of Watt Space in Newcastle is bleak. Other senators have asked me how I know. I know because I talked with the university administration and the people who run these services about what is already planned to be taken away from them. So 4,000 students at Newcastle university will not get the same opportunity to exhibit their artwork in that place. I know that because 75 per cent of the funding of these organisations is provided by a student fee, where everyone chips in; everyone pays their bit. It is not just the fine arts students who are able to exhibit their work at student theatres. The day I visited, a first-year accounting student was putting up on the walls her first-ever exhibition, which was of traditional Chinese calligraphy. All students have the opportunity to be involved in those sorts of activities. That is what students there now and future students are being denied by these moves of this government.

Senator Humphries interjecting—

—We saw what happened when VSU—voluntary student unionism—was brought in at other universities. The services crumbled. They do not all disappear overnight; we all acknowledge that. But, because we have had conversations with people, we all know that right now university union administrators are making decisions about which services they will have to cut for next year. That is how we know, Senator Humphries—and others who have been interjecting. We talk with the managers of these unions, we sit down with them, they show us their budgets and they discuss with us how they will have to take away job opportunities for people in their regional centres.
I went to Southern Cross University in Lismore and heard about the 170 people who work in that regional town—a regional town that really needs employment opportunities—who will not be able to continue to do that work. That whole community is going to suffer. The bus company that drives the international students to their places and the whole town of Lismore will suffer as a result of the moves being taken right here by this government and Senator Fielding. You should never deny not just students but also regional towns those opportunities. It is not about paying off regional towns, like in the funding package Senator Boswell was talking about. What about the regional students who travel to Sydney university or Melbourne university? Do they get any money from the funding package Senator Boswell was talking about? No, I suspect they do not, because this government is not concerned about students. Government members have had their turn, they have had their experience, and they want to deny other students that opportunity. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2005-12-09,"—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. According to standing order 186, when all else is in doubt you should call the senator who rises first. This is the third time I have risen to speak in this debate—
 (Senator Brandis)—I saw Senator Joyce rise first.
—That is because you were looking in that direction.
—There is no point of order.
—There have been many good arguments posed, and I will endeavour—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a further point of order. Perhaps you could advise me when I will be able to seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading, seeing that I am obviously going to be deprived of the opportunity for the third time this week to give such a speech.
—Senator Lundy, that is not a point of order either. The debate has not long to go.
—Can you give me that—
—No. It is not a point of order. Sit down.
—As I said, there have been many good arguments posed here today, and I will endeavour not to replicate them. I do not support—
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: I ask you when honourable senators who want to incorporate speeches will be able to. Can you make sure that that opportunity is available?
—That is a matter for arrangement between the managers—not for me.
—At your behest.
—I do not support compulsory student unionism. We have the chance today to end that process, and it is quite obvious that it will end today. I have moved an amendment to allow the ending of compulsory student unionism but to facilitate continued facilities at universities. The inception of it is in a resolution that comes from my state conference. I will read it out to completely clarify my position, because I was sent here by Queensland to represent Queensland and to follow or be guided by it. It reads:
That this State Conference of The Nationals Queensland:
• Declares its full and unequivocal support for the concept of voluntary student unionism;
• Notes the concerns of the Federal government with regard to wastage of funds by university student unions;
• Requests the Federal government ensures that an alternate funding mechanism with comparable—
that means the same—
levels of funding to existing fees is provided to maintain—
that means forever—
the level of services and the provision of facilities on university campuses.
That backing—coming down in my first term to represent my party at the federal level—is what is driving me. I would like to thank Mike Horan and Stuart Copeland for raising this issue at the start and for sitting down with me to cover the issues of the University of Southern Queensland. I would like to thank Lawrence Springborg and the Queensland Nationals for their support.
As a starting point, I see a number of pieces to the philosophy. I see a university as any other business, and so at this moment I have a problem. Universities should be able if they so choose to not charge a fee. If we get rid of compulsory student unionism and put the matter under the auspices of the universities, they should be able to choose to charge a fee or not to charge a fee. If they pick up students, who are like clients, and start making a way into the market because of that reduction of fees then they will continue on with that. But we should leave them the option if they so choose to charge a fee at the university level, audited and covered by the university—a bill that goes to the university. It seems peculiar, from a conservative party point of view, to be telling a business what it can and cannot charge for.
Universities are not just purely academic institutions. They never were and they never will be. I hope they are never turned into just purely academic institutions. They are to embolden the whole spirit of a person and to broaden their social dynamic. And to broaden a person’s social dynamic they must have things around them that entail and encourage that—that bring that out of them. That is why we have playgrounds for the kindergarten, we have playgrounds for the primary schools and we have fields for the high schools. And so it should be the case at universities that we create the mechanisms for people to go out and mix.
If you are going to have those mechanisms for them to have a greater social engagement then you have to have them in place. To say a user-pays facility will work does not tend to countenance the argument that some of these facilities take 10 or 13 years to pay off—maybe 150 years of funding is needed to build them up to a certain level. We are about to take Australia to a form of funding for these facilities that is only replicated in one other country in the world—that is, the Republic of China. The package speaks of $80 million to cover $170 million worth of fees. There would be a residual of about $25 million. So we have $145 million a year or $20 million a year taken over four years. That is about a $120 million shortfall. That is not a comparable level of funding. This means that there is going to be a large black hole at the end of that period. It is going to fall to a political process as to who gets the funding.
Yes, I am driven by the fact that I went to the University of New England. It holds on by its nails to being a relevant university. I am passionate about it because I believe in the collegiate spirit that it has. I believe that this change is going to take them down so that they start losing relevance. I believe that when they close down 14 hectares of sporting fields, as they say they going to, they will become a second-rate choice university to go to. I believe it will build up the status quo for the sandstone universities and that the little universities, such as the University of Southern Queensland, the University of New England, James Cook University, the University of Central Queensland and Charles Sturt University, will be detrimentally affected. We will be saying to people who go to one university, ‘This is the experience you will have here,’ and to the people who go to another university we will be saying, ‘This is the type of experience you will have there.’
Earle Page, a Prime Minister of this nation and a leader of my party, was formative in trying to construct education in regional areas to give them a comparable experience, to give equality around this nation. I am passionate about this because I think that we are being bloody-minded. We could go forward and come up with a reasonable solution that would achieve parity and equality. I believe that after this bill passes all of a sudden the funding mechanisms of these regional universities will say once more to people in regional areas, ‘You belong to a second class.’ And they should not.
Families, 5,000 of them, are going to be affected by this legislation. Where is the impact statement on them? You should not create a problem and then endeavour to say, ‘We are going to fix it.’ You should not create the problem—you should find the solution rather than create it. That is what we should be doing here today. There is no reason that this has to go through in the next half-hour. There is no reason to put these things at risk. There is no reason to put the University of New England at risk in the next half-hour. We could come up with a solution. We are a clever government. We build submarines and all these other things, and I am sure we could come up with a reasonable solution.
The Senate is not controlled and nor should it be. This is a clear example for the soothsayers, especially on the other side, who say the Senate is controlled; it is not controlled. This is a house of review where people have their own minds and their own mechanisms for making decisions, and it will continue to protect the dignity of the parliament of our nation. I am disappointed that some people believe that there is a sense of attracting attention. I would happily not have been the subject of having a resolution from my party, which I am supporting. It is not the resolution of one senator; it is the resolution of my party, supported by three states and federally.
I certainly do not seek applause and I never have. But I certainly have gone into bat for my party against the odds and against all takers, and I have tried to do the very best that I can for them. I find it a slight insult to suggest that I have done 10 years of work for my party as some sort of gratification mechanism. That is a complete insult. I have done it because I believe in the people I represent. This Senate has passed a lot of legislation and will continue to do so. I will be an effective part of the transition of bills, but I will always retain my dignity in representing the constitution of this nation. And I will never let this place fall into a position where we cannot review and where, the moment we intend to review, the moment we intend to exercise our dignity as senators of this nation, we are derided.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

On three occasions the Coalition has introduced legislation to end the practice of universities charging fees for compulsory membership of student unions, guilds and associations. It was defeated in 1999. It was defeated in 2001.
The changed composition of the Senate offers some prospect that this—the third attempt—will be successful. I hope it is.
At the heart of this bill is a commitment to uphold the right to self-determination, to uphold the right to freedom of association.
To guarantee that no student can be compelled to join any organisation against their will. To ensure that no student can be compelled to pay a fee for services they may not want.
This bill is necessary because, to date, campus organisations, universities and state parliaments have denied these rights to students or at best viewed freedom of association as a technicality to be satisfied rather than a principle to be embraced.
There has been much discussion in this parliament over recent weeks about the necessity to circumscribe certain civil liberties. These discussions have taken place in the context of the anti-terror legislation.
As a parliament, we have reluctantly placed limitations on freedom of association in specific circumstances.
We have done so as a parliament to do all we can to protect life. Compulsory student unionism is a restriction on freedom of association.
The only rationale is to make life easier for the administrators of campus services. To save them the bother of having to be responsive to students and justify their services. Public safety is a reason to restrict freedom of association. The convenience of union administrators is not.
This bill is in no way anti-student, anti-union, or anti-campus life.
To the contrary, this bill respects students. This bill trusts students. This bill empowers students. This bill recognises that university students are clever adults able to exercise their own judgement in their own interests.
The view has been put that the inability to compel fees, to compel membership will destroy student life. As though student life can only exist as a result of a compulsory fee. As though fun will only happen if it is compulsory.
Those opposite must have a very pessimistic view of today’s youth. I don’t know if youth have changed since my days at uni.
I’ve said it before Mr Acting Deputy President, but if you put a couple of thousand 18 to 23 year old frisky, curious, energetic students together, you’re going to have a vigorous campus life. You can compel a fee, but you can not compel engagement in campus life. It is an inquiring mind and a curious disposition that determines the quality of campus life and engagement.
Kim Beazley referred to this legislation yesterday as “revenge of the nerds”. This is a particularly undergraduate use of language by the Opposition Leader.
But since Mr Beazley has introduced this category, I should point out that the only people on campus who fall into it are those who lack the capacity through reason, advocacy or good service to convince people to voluntarily join them in an activity or organisation.
The only people in Mr Beazley’s category are those who can not persuade people to join their organisation, who have to make it mandatory.
If we can trust students to choose their university, to choose their degree and to choose their courses. We can trust them to decide whether to not to join a student union or association.
The onus should be on student organisations to convince potential members of the benefits of the services they provide.
I am optimistic student organisations will be able to. But more than that, the onus should be on the service providers to justify their services. They should be doing it anyway. When there is the power to compel, there is no imperative to respond to student wishes.
If students value the services provided by student unions as much as student unions claim, then they have nothing to fear. Students will pay and join.
Students will rise to the challenge of running organisations on a voluntary basis.
Organisations throughout the community operate on the basis of mutual support for agreed objectives.
Students should have the same rights on campus as they do off campus—that of choosing the interests and recreations they wish to pursue.
On this side of the chamber we have faith in the ability of students to determine their own needs.
Not all do.
I cite Professor Peter Coaldrake, Vice-Chancellor of Queensland University of Technology who said at a Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee hearing into this legislation:
 “I am not sure that students at any particular point, particularly early on in their studies, are likely to make—I hesitate to use the term—‘rational’ choices in that respect.”
This is the cry of central planners everywhere.
Students know better than universities how their own funds should be spent.
Those who argue the counter case contend that student fees are analogous to tax. The example of local government rates is cited.
I don’t accept that universities are some sort of fourth tier of government.
It is the role of state and federal governments to provide a social safety net—not universities. This safety net is provided for all in the community—the old and the young, for workers and students alike.
The tax analogy ignores the differing capacity to pay. Not only are the same union fees paid regardless of the value to the student, the fees are paid regardless of the income or other circumstances of the student.
The compulsory fee is akin to a poll tax.
Members of the community can choose to pay for non-government services. Students should have that right.
The moral argument about the right of students to choose has been won. Labor conceded this when they dropped their ‘in principle’ opposition to VSU.
I say ‘in principle’ opposition because their substantive opposition remains. The ALP are offering only a technical out.
The ALP policy is officially you don’t have to join a student union. There’s a catch under their plan—you still have to pay a compulsory fee for a range of services.
This is similar to what is known as the Victorian model. The legislation introduced in Victoria by the Kennett Government and since amended by the Bracks Government.
This model is colloquially known as VSU-lite.
It is true that Victorian students don’t have to join the student union. You can opt out. But if you opt out, there is no fee differential. Whether you belong to the union or not, you have to pay the same fee.
Under the Victorian legislation there is also a legislative bar on compulsorily acquired fees being used for political purposes.
One problem. It doesn’t work.
It doesn’t work because no accounting or auditing system can deal with the fact that money is fungible.
I draw the Senate’s attention to an article by Jason Frenkel in the Herald-Sun on 23 November 2005, headed ‘Student cash given to Iraqi union’.
The article alleges the Monash Student Association provided $1000 to Foraok Isma’al, a member of the Southern Oil Workers Union in Iraq. According to the article, the union supports the anti-coalition insurgency in Iraq.
According to the article, Monash Student Association chairman Nick Richardson admitted the Iraqi organisation could be engaged in violence aimed at coalition forces, but defended the donation, which he described as going to a “progressive organisation”.
I have written to the Attorney-General for advice on whether the Monash Student Association or its office bearers have potentially breached Australian law, by providing funds to an organisation which encourages the targeting of coalition forces, including members of the Australian Defence Force.
Even if compulsorily acquired student money could be quarantined from political activity, I for one could still not accept such a model.
In a free market, in a free society, people should not be compelled to buy products they don’t want.
A limited services fee in Victoria still results in an absurd situation.
I read from a letter addressed to university student Jessica Thompson from the first of August this year, from the Fees Unit, Monash University. The letter states, in relation to an outstanding compulsory amenities fee, that:
“If payment is not received by the 4 August 2005 your enrolment will be encumbered. This means that while your enrolment this semester is still valid, the following restrictions will be placed on you:
Loss of access to library borrowing and other services
Loss of access to Monash University’s computer systems, including internet and email
Loss of access to enrolment records, examination results, and academic transcripts
Unable to graduate until the debt is cleared”
This is just a slightly more sophisticated case of ‘no ticket, no start’.
This bill honours the Coalition parties’ commitment at the last election and gives effect to the clear will of the Coalition parties.
The majority report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the legislation recommended this bill be passed without amendment.
I would like to commend the members of the Government Education, Science and Training backbench committee, which I have the privilege of chairing, for their work on the form on this bill.
I also thank the committee, particularly its secretary Michael Ferguson, for their lateral thinking in proposing a transitional fund for sport and recreation on campus.
This is an example where the processes of the governing parties come up with a concept to address a community concern. I particularly acknowledge Senator Trood, a distinguished academic, for his quiet efforts on this plan and personal insights into the university sector.
I’d particularly like to thank Minister Nelson for the time he devoted to what is a small bill, but which contains a great and enduring liberal democratic principle.
I also thank Minister Nelson’s Senior Adviser Zoe McKenzie for her assistance.
I commend Senator Judith Troeth for her magnificent chairmanship of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation.
I place on the record my thanks to the president of the Australian Liberal Students Federation Mr Julian Barendse and the Federation’s VSU Officer Rohan D’Souza for their advocacy on behalf of the rights of students.
I want to leave the final words in my speech to a student—Michael Josem, president of the Monash Student Union, who stated to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee’s hearing in Melbourne that:
“the abolition of high, compulsory up front and unfair amenities fees will force changes. It will force us to work harder to serve students. We’ll have to work smarter to deliver services that students choose to fund. No longer will we be able to continue, reliant on a compulsory fee. We’ll have to deliver services that students actually want. That’s challenging for many people. The status quo is comfortable. The mediocre is easy. The future, of change, progress and excellence, is unknown. We’ll have to be excellent—not merely adequate. Unsurprisingly, many people don ‘t like that.”

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am delighted that today the Australian Senate has the opportunity to correct a long-standing wrong, and remove a blight on the freedom of young Australians.
Compulsory Student Unionism sits uneasily with core Liberal Party philosophy—freedom of choice and freedom of association.
Within reasonable limits, this Government does not seek to mandate human behaviour. It believes that individuals are the best judges of how to conduct their lives, in particular how they spend their money.
This Bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 so that from mid-2006, no student will be compelled to join a student organisation, union or guild. In addition, no student will be compelled to pay a fee to an institution for non-academic amenities, facilities or services unless he choose to pay a fee to make use of those services.
Currently, as a condition of their enrolment, Australian higher education students are required to pay a general services fee of between $100 and $590 per year. The average fee is almost $300 per year.
There are a number of arguments put about by the opponents of voluntary student unionism that demand addressing:
1. The National Union of Students claims that the ability to opt out of a student union already exists. This is misleading because even if a student chooses to not belong to a student union, that student is still required to pay the general services fee which is then typically donated to charity.
2. The NUS asserts that voluntary student unionism would lead to only a small number of students paying the general services fee, causing a dramatic reduction in campus services. However, these services, particularly the clubs and societies, are already often only accessed by a small minority of students. I do not dispute that these services contribute to the ‘university experience’ and ‘campus life’ but why should the majority of students subsidise the lifestyle of the few?
Voluntary student unionism may well result in better services being provided to students. It is a law of economics that subsidies encourage organisations to become inefficient, complacent and unresponsive to consumer demands. With a guaranteed source of income through compulsory fees, student unions have little incentive to respond to consumer dissatisfaction with their services and provide value for money or improve amenities.
If, with the abolition of compulsory fees, there were a decline in the incidence of certain services, surely this would be a reflection of the preferences of the student population. Businesses and organisations which are part of the general community live or die on the basis of how much patronage they can attract. Why should their campus equivalents be any different?
Supporters of compulsory student unionism have raised the spectre of ‘free-riders’, people who would use campus services despite not paying the fee. This problem would quite easily be prevented by requiring users of campus services to hold union membership cards.
One of the most common arguments used by the NUS against voluntary student unionism is that it is an attempt by the Federal Government to silence students from protesting against its higher education policies. This is wrong. It is an attempt by the Government to provide freedom of choice and association to students, the same freedom exercised by every other Australian. Almost a quarter of a century ago, while a student at the Australian National University, I wrote the following in the ANU Reporter:
“Could the Student Association survive voluntary unionism? The answer is another question: if it cannot make itself sufficiently attractive to potential members, ought it to survive? If, as the Left would have us believe, students love their representative body, what is there to fear?”
The Left’s credentials as champions of social justice would be bolstered if they supported Voluntary Student Unionism. As internationalists, the Left is horrified when Australia defies international opinion and conventions.
Yet compulsory student unionism defies Article 20 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that ‘everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association’. Australia is also a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labor Organisation convention concerning freedom of associations. These conventions specifically denounce the practice of compelling individuals to become members of associations.
The term ‘equity’ is used ad nausea by the Left. Yet Compulsory Student Unionism flies in the face of this principle. A student from a low income background, working part-time and studying, and without the time to indulge in ‘campus life’, is required by to pay the same fee as a student from an affluent background supported by his or her parents. In a sense, compulsory student unionism is a form of regressive taxation.
No-one has yet explained to me why university campuses are virtually the only places in our society where membership of a prescribed set of organisations is mandatory before a person can enjoy something which the Left often describes as a right. It is time that this anomaly was ended. Compulsory student unionism is an obnoxious anachronism, and has actively contributed to a poorer quality of services than students deserve.
For both those reasons I support this legislation and commend its passage through the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Listening to some of the speakers against VSU, one might be forgiven for thinking they were discussing a different Bill.
For the benefit of colleagues opposite, let me assist by making clear three things this Bill does not do. It does not prohibit students attending universities. It does not prevent them from banding together, pooling their funds, and establishing a sports club, drama society or women’s collective. And it does not prevent the provision of services on campus, whether they be refectories, medical centres or tennis courts.
The Bill before us does one thing, and one thing only. It prevents the coercive taxation of university students to fund organisations, services and ideas which they do not use, do not want, and in many cases find offensive.
The status quo which the Opposition and others support is telling as to their motivation. In recent years, we have seen High Court challenges which have enforced the prohibition against State Governments imposing taxes, particularly in the form of excise. And we haven’t heard any suggestion from Senators opposite that we should legislate to reverse that.
At the same time, through the offices of this Government, we have consistently passed and enforced legislation which prevents compulsory subscription to labour unions, to outlaw the historical scourge of “no ticket—no work”. A reform which has been wholeheartedly embraced by the Australian community, to the point where self-employed people now outnumber union members in this country.
Then, on the issue of university funding, we are told by colleagues opposite that education is a right, and that any restriction on that right, such as requiring students to retrospectively fund part of their education once in the workforce, is anathema.
And yet, through some twisted logic, we are told that there is one inviolable financial restriction which must be a condition of education—that no student may enrol, learn or graduate at an Australian university, unless they pay an annual fee to their respective unions, guilds or similar associations.
I would ask Senators opposite to consider this hypocrisy, next time they lecture us on free education. You insist that the right to study may be unilaterally withheld—not for refusing to pay for a valuable education—but for refusing to join an extracurricular political body. You will happily enforce a regime which bans university attendance for anyone taking a stand on political principle. And you will happily neglect to mention that your primary interest in the status quo is the retention of training grounds for the next generation of your party.
I am proud today, that the Howard Government is willing to confront, and take the political flak for confronting this last bastion of coercive collectivism.
VSU is a cause which is close to the hearts of many of the people in my Party, from our time in ALSF, and it provided the issue which I and so many of my colleagues first learnt how unjust the Labor Party’s idea of justice really is.
We continue to oppose it not just because it is an arrangement against which many of us fought in our campus days, and not just because the principle of compulsory unionism is rightly reviled.
We fight it because we are the true believers. We are the true believers in the rhetoric used by the Australian left to cloak and disguise its contempt for democracy and meritocracy.
We believe that the only path to justice, freedom and the good society lies through the field of ideas, in which the universities are such a critical participant.
And it disgusts us, that this forum: the one place where every Australian can earn a place, to learn and discuss at the highest level the values, structure and governance of our society and nation, is polluted by a politically opportunistic gateway, that says “no ticket—no education.”
We have heard genuine nonsense during this debate. We have heard that the Schonell Theatre at the University of Queensland would be shut under VSU. No doubt Hollywood, Bollywood and the Australian film industry are shaking in their shoes. Cinema is a commercial activity, people, not a public good, and we don’t collect to subsidise movie tickets for any other group. And if it needs a membership to keep movies cheap, then no doubt the movie-going student public will rise up to that challenge.
And we’ve heard the risible suggestion that the Sydney University Rugby Club, that poverty-stricken breeding ground for judges, doctors and Wallabies, will no longer be able to compete with the Eastwoods, the Parramattas and the other clubs in the Sydney competition who have to rely on the largesse of much less privileged communities.
We have been told that country universities are a special case. I can only agree with that. It is a fact that regional universities have less local competition from suppliers of food and entertainment—they are a special case, and will find the task of obtaining student support for collective goods much more compelling than their city cousins In Inner City Campuses where Commercial competition in both prices and offering of services is so very much greater. Regional campuses have a captive market, city campuses do not.
My view as a legislator is that one should always pursue the highest principle. But I also recognise that there may be an incremental process, and this may only be our first step in freeing up the Universities. As long as the final outcome doesn’t say that you can’t attend an Australian university unless you pay tax to a political body, then I’d say we’ve taken a significant step forward.
And I would say that if we are required as part of this step to permit some non-political exemptions, to fund what some of my colleagues judge to be essential services, then we can tolerate that on one condition: that unlike the farce of partial VSU in Victoria, funds are spent only on the services for which they are explicitly raised, and are never subject to discretionary diversion by some unrepresentative group of student political hacks.
And I will say this clearly here today: Woe betide anyone who seeks to use any exemptions or amendments to this Bill to subvert the principle of voluntary unionism. While we might recognise the pragmatic need for an incremental approach to this issue, none of my colleagues—and I am confident that includes those who are seeking amendments—will hesitate to revisit this legislation if it is not observed in letter and spirit.
Finally, I would take this opportunity, in my last speech of the year, to make an observation on the past six months.
During that period, we have passed the Telstra sale legislation, overhauled workplace reforms, introduced the visionary welfare-to-work program and …
And we’ve managed such an ambitious program, because we can work as a Coalition. Despite attempts by those opposite and their self-styled “community” advocates, to fragment us, and despite Senator Conroy’s bluster about how an exercise of democratic power conferred with the Australian people is an abuse of his right to waste everyone’s time, we have achieved a great deal together.
And this VSU Bill will be one of our crowning achievements, because it represents four decades of campus and Party action, and lies at the beginning, and the heart of our cause.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

What we are debating here today is not a matter of good public policy or about furthering or bettering the nation.
We are debating legislation that is regressive and dogmatic.
It’s legislation that aims to crush student services, organisations, unionism and activism on University campuses throughout Australia.
It’s a clear and direct assault upon a group within the community perceived to be opposed to the policies of the Howard Government. It’s as simple as that.
This is an issue that the Howard Government and a number of ministers within it more particularly are obsessed with.
It’s an issue that pops up from time to time, is never supported by the community or those concerned, yet it’s one that the Howard Government simply cannot do away with.
And so it’s back before the Senate again.
What this bill seeks to do is to make the compulsory non-academic fees that all students at Australian universities pay toward the services provided at the university, voluntary.
The Minister and the wider Government distort the debate by arguing that it’s about offering students choice in the organisations they are associated with or are members of when they attend university, but that’s not what this debate is really about.
Most university students already have choice about whether or not they wish to join their student union, association, guild or council. Most students may opt-in or opt-out of the student associations at their university, whatever the case is at each, upon enrolment or at any time. I don’t have a problem with this and if enshrining this principle was all that this bill was about then there’d be no problem. But that’s not what this debate is about.
What this debate is really about is fulfilling the long-held ambition and so-far unsuccessful quest of the former student politicians within the Howard Cabinet to crush the organisations they were once involved and active in.
It’s about the starving of funds and eventual bleeding dry of organisations still understood by the likes of Ministers Costello, Abbott and Nelson to be full of Left wing Marxists and other communist and socialist types hell-bent on bringing about a revolution in Australia.
It proves just how out of touch this Government is. Australian Universities and the student organisations inside of them have changed a lot since the days Peter Costello wandered the grounds of Monash.
On the other hand, some things haven’t changed at Australian universities and that’s their community-mindedness and service provision.
Universities are more than just degree-factories. They are a place where students are part of a community, where a wide-range of diverse opportunities and experiences are made available, a place where people can gain more than an academic education, where one can gain an important life experience.
Compulsory non-academic fees, otherwise known as general service fees or amenities fees are like a flat tax or local council rate payable by all students enrolled at each university.
The amount differs from University to University, depending on the services provided.
The income generated is used by the student organisations on the university campus to provide services for student, and in many cases, community use.
For instance, at La Trobe University’s Bundoora campus in my home state of Victoria, the $357.00 General Service Fee, paid by all full-time students is divvied up between four student organisations, each providing a wide range of services and a Children’s child care Centre.
The La Trobe University Union provides publications and information including the student diary, a daily campus newsletter and a periodical publication. It provides cultural, arts and entertainment services such as: bands, a student bar, a ceramics studio, comedy, films, a Rainbow Room, an International Students’ Association, leisure courses, a weekly market, a radio station, a recording studio, student theatre, an amphitheatres and a women’s room.
It also operates commercial facilities and services including: a bakery; food and beverage outlets; room, hall or bar hire for functions, weddings, birthdays, and conferences; a large Union Hall used by the University for graduation ceremonies and other community organisations; and a Wholefoods Café.
The Union also provides: academic gowns for graduation ceremonies; BBQs; bike and book lockers; a bottle shop; a computer room; a dark room; faxing facilities; games; newspapers; housing services; lost property; movie tickets; the Orientation program; a Parents and Children’s Child Care Centre (separate from the Children’s Centre I mentioned before); passport photos; a Part-time, Evening and Mature Age Student Organisation and lounge; phone cards; photocopying; a piano; pool tables; a second hand book store; a school holiday care program; screen printing; showers; student employment services; a tool library; and a Union Services Centre for general information.
The La Trobe University Sports and Recreation Centre provides access to a 25 metre indoor heated pool; basketball and netball courts; a weight and fitness gym; an aerobics studio; 6 squash courts; 5 tennis courts; playing fields; a synthetic hockey pitch; a shared ski lodge at Mt Buller and around 25 affiliated clubs.
The La Trobe University Students’ Representative Council provides representative and advocacy services including support with appeals against assessments and academic misconduct, support with show cause hearings and special consideration applications, disciplinary matters, bullying, harassment and discrimination. Other services include a legal service, tax and financial advice and assistance, Rabelais student newspaper, a 2nd hand furniture and book store and over 50 clubs and societies. The SRC’s numerous activist departments include an indigenous and a disability department, which represent the needs of these marginalised groups at the University and in higher education more broadly.
SRC members and officers routinely represent the needs of students on University Committees such as library committees, security on campus committees and on academic boards.
And finally, the La Trobe Postgraduate Association (LUPA) provides a wide range of advice, advocacy and representative services, including running skills seminars, publishing a regular newsletter and representing students in their disputes with the university system. LUPA provides access to postgraduate lounge facilities and also runs an Orientation program for postgraduate students.
All of these services and organisations are under threat from this legislation.
The Minister argues that if services are required or wanted enough by students, then the market will demand and happily fund them. What a naïve outlook?
Everyone knows that’s not the way society works. The market of itself does not naturally work to ensure that the vulnerable are provided for.
That’s why governments and taxation exist. They exist to ensure that all necessary services are provided for everyone and that the vulnerable are protected.
If made voluntary, how many students do you think will spend the money to support their student organisations and services, particularly those they may not realise exist only until they are needed?
My guess is not many—probably about the same number as would pay tax or local government rates if they were made voluntary.
You see, not everyone at university will need to access academic support if and when they have to “show cause” in order to remain enrolled in their course. But some do and will in the future. The wage and resources alone needed for an organisation to provide an academic support officer could not be adequately covered by the fees charged of individuals accessing such a service, and thus it simply wouldn’t be provided.
The reason many of the services are currently provided on university campuses is due to the steady-stream of student income provided for them each year, which has progressively been able to fund a wider range of services that individually, students would not or could not pay for.
The Minister says that it’s unfair that a single mother attending university should be paying to subsidise the sky-diving club, but that is hardly an argument to abolish the entire rates-like system.
I don’t support the use of my tax dollars being used to fight a war in Iraq, to give the Prime Minister a 30 per cent tax rebate on his private health insurance or funding the use of immigration detention centres, but I still have to pay for them. I don’t have a choice how and where my tax dollars are spent, other than through the same democratic processes that exist for students and the student organisations spending student money.
The Minister says that this legislation is not about attacking student unions because nothing will prevent them from continuing to exist or providing on-campus services. But it’s committing them to death by a thousand cuts. They will be starved of funds because few students will pay a voluntary levy—and they will eventually fold along with all of their services.
And there is little doubt that the effect of this bill is likely to be felt more severely by students and communities in rural and regional areas.
Many student organisations operating from universities in some rural and regional areas of Australia are the only service providers of their kind for students and other members of the local community.
For instance, the University of New England Students’ Association, in partnership with the Armidale Ex-Services Club, constructed and operates the only local cinema available for use by students and the local community.
The UNE Students’ Association is also the sole administrator of the student employment database, finding jobs for students in the local community and it also operates the local radio station 2UNE, one of the oldest regional community radio stations in Australia.
Likewise, the University of Southern Queensland’s Guild provides students and the wider Toowoomba and Darling Downs communities with their only easy-to-access Olympic-standard sports and training facilities.
This type of student union community involvement and integration is mirrored around the country, particularly in rural and regional areas.
In terms of employment, the bill advocates the loss of around 6,000 jobs in the non-academic university sector, including many hundreds in rural and regional areas.
And these mass job losses will affect a wide range of skilled and unskilled workers in a wide range of industries.
It’s a draconian outcome to satisfy a sad old ideological vendetta.
And what’s worse, it will inevitably affect the academic outcomes of Australia’s universities and many students studying at them.
As student organisations are starved of funds, services will be wound back. Student advocacy, academic support and welfare services will be obviously affected, leaving many students who would otherwise access these important services stranded. Many will drop out of university. Others will simply fail or fail to gain the education they are capable of and are paying for.
Many, who with the help and support of these services would normally succeed, will fail to reach their full potential. Such a situation will drag down the overall average academic outcome of Australia’s universities, thus making Australian higher education less attractive and effective.
Moreover, with the starving of funds used by student organisations to provide services on campuses currently, many universities themselves will end up funding a range in the hope of keeping academic averages up, an on-campus culture and community existent and thus an attractiveness about the institution in order to keep paying streaming going through.
These funds can only come from one place and that’s from the operating budgets of the universities, each already starved of funds.
Universities will be forced to dip into their capital works, infrastructure or staff and education budgets in order to provide the services that students would otherwise pay for and provide.
It’s obvious, but the more universities have to spend on providing services that student organisations once provided, the less there is to spend on the main business of universities and that’s on academia, on research and development, and on the building or maintenance of facilities.
It’s a lose-lose situation for universities. Do they maintain a sense of community and culture about them and provide services to support and further the educational experience for students, which will benefit all concerned but sacrifice funds? Or do they refuse to do this and risk the attractiveness of the institution and at the same time risk its academic outcome by failing to provide adequate support services for its students?
As I mentioned before, universities are more than degree-factories. However by culling the culture at our universities, these are exactly the type of institutions this legislation aims to create.
It’s a bill which will have severe detrimental effects on the higher education sector in this country and on its export success. It’s a bill which will see Australian universities and higher education in Australia devalued and become less appealing and attractive to overseas students.
As it is today, many international students attending Australian universities face a very rough deal. They pay thousands and thousands of dollars in up-front fees, sit in overcrowded lectures and tutorials, are unable to access the support they need from their overworked tutors, may be dealing with language or specific academic challenges and do so in a foreign country and culture away from family and friends.
In many cases, the support of services such as the International Students’ Association at La Trobe, Bundoora, are the only ones of their kind offering access to the networks and services many international students require to succeed.
To pass this bill will be to make higher education in Australia a less attractive package to lucrative overseas student markets. It’s economically irresponsible.
Not only will this legislation damage Australia’s reputation as a high quality higher education provider, it is, according to experts bound to damage the nation’s sporting success in the future as well.
Many student organisations fund sporting programs, facilities and clubs, an arrangement heralded by many as one of the core factors leading to Australians having had so much sporting success in the recent past.
According to a report in the Australian newspaper on 24 March 2005, last year, more than 1300 athletes received more than $2.6 million in sports scholarships from Australian universities.
A national survey of universities revealed $58 million was invested directly each year into sports facilities and services, (of which) $40 million was derived from student fees.
The Australian Olympic Committee has voiced its concern that university sports programs could lose $100 million when this legislation is passed.
Many successful sportspeople have been supported by university sporting clubs including many famous rugby Wallaby greats such as Nick Farr-Jones and Michael Hawker. Double Olympic gold medallist and Oarsome Foursome rower, Nick Green rowed for the University of Melbourne Boat Club when he was a student. In fact, the former Head of Sport at the University of Technology, Sydney, boasts that its rowing club has produced 30 Olympic rowers.
Replicating any of this in the future will be almost impossible due to the Howard Government’s belligerence.
The absurdity of the situation is exacerbated further when you consider that this legislation comes about at a time when we are trying to encourage more people, particularly younger ones to participate in sport to help combat obesity.
As Geoff Lawson, a former Australian Test cricketer is quoted as saying in 17 March’s Sydney Morning Herald, “it smacks of absolute bloody mindedness”.
And he’s dead right.
But Mr Lawson isn’t the only person to condemn this legislation. In fact, the condemnation has been coming in thick and fast and from far and wide.
Kevan Gosper, member of the International Olympic Committee has said he is very concerned as Patron of university sport in Australia that this move could have the unfortunate outcome of denting very badly the expectations of university sport at a very critical time.
The Australian Vice Chancellor’s Committee is also disappointed by the legislation, and I quote from the Committee’s media release of 16 March:
“This legislation, if passed, will have the potential to reduce university students’ convenient and affordable access to various support services and amenities,” AVCC President, Professor Di Yerbury said.
“The AVCC rejects the Government’s underlying premise that students are forced to be members of student organisations they do not wish to join voluntarily. They are not.
“The AVCC’s policy acknowledges that students already have the option not to be members of student organisations but also states the importance of students’ participation in the organisation of their universities,” Professor Yerbury said.
“It’s a bit like council rates—not everybody uses all the services, but rates in a community are compulsory.
“The Government is going against its own policy statement in Backing Australia’s Future in that we should have a diverse higher education system, not ‘one-size-fits-all’,” she added.’
Michael Osborne, Vice Chancellor of La Trobe University has said, and I quote from a report in the Age newspaper of 18 March this year:
‘The Federal Government’s controversial laws scrapping compulsory student union fees would ensure universities would become “wastelands” lacking the facilities of decent institutions worldwide. The legislation would impoverish universities deterring international students as they “see Australian institutions becoming academic slums.”
If the Minister and the Government were serious about their argument that this has nothing to do with an assault on student unions or their services and instead has everything to do with ensuring that Australian students do not have any up-front fee-like impediments as they enrol for University, then the Minister would seriously consider altering the system for the collection and dispensation of compulsory non-academic fees to ensure that no such impediment existed yet didn’t kill the services or the student organisations providing the services in the process.
The Government in its wisdom, surely, could come up with an alternative arrangement whereby students could add the charge of the compulsory non-academic fee to their higher education contribution scheme debts to be repaid once in the workforce, or some such similar scheme.
There is only one reason why the Government has refused to do the necessary leg-work in this regard and that is simply because it has not wanted to.
This legislation has been designed from day one to kill student organisations, whatever the cost.
Through its sheer rightwing zealotry, the Howard Government risks the quality of the entire higher education system and its attractiveness in to the future both to local and international students.
This is an appalling piece of legislation and I wholeheartedly reject it.
I encourage the Senate to pass Labor’s amendment to save university services or to reject this bill outright.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Mr President, I rise to speak to the second reading of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Up‑
front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005.
This is a matter that I have spoken on several times before in the life of this Government. I have done so on all of these occasions because the issue of membership of university student organisations is one that has obsessed this Government.
Time and time again, it has felt driven to attempt to destroy student organisations in our universities and the services that they provide.
Time and time again, this Government has sought to subject the university students of Australia to its ideological fixation on this issue.
And, time and time again, the Senate has exercised its proper role and rejected this extreme legislation.
We have yet to see whether the ideologues can pull it off on this occasion—whether those people at the extreme end of the spectrum, like Dr Nelson, can take each and every one of the Liberal and National Party colleagues here in the Senate with them. They are worried that they can’t—and they worry with good reason.

Government Senators’ misgivings

Because there are Government Senators and Members who don’t like this bill. There are members of the Government who know what it will mean to Australian universities and Australian students.
They understand the devastation it will wreak on the polity and community of campus life.
They know what it will mean to a young bloke I know from Ballarat, who has moved down to the city to go to university. He wants to keep up his sporting interests and join a university hockey club.
But, if this legislation becomes law, from next year that hockey club probably won’t exist. The University’s sports grounds won’t be maintained.
Government Senators know this is true. They know it’s even more likely to be true in the case of regional campuses—that play such a vital role in local communities and economies.
They know that, by voting for this bill, they will be depriving young and older Australian students of services, facilities and opportunities for recreation and social interaction that are fundamental to university life.
We are talking here about somewhere on campus to buy a sandwich or a cup of coffee.
We are talking about a child care centre so that student parents actually get the chance to go to classes and get themselves qualified with a degree.
We are talking about personal and academic counselling and support—vital to so many students if they are to get through their courses successfully.
These are the kinds of things that Dr Nelson wants to abolish with his extreme legislation.
Where’s the sense in that?
There are many Government Senators and members who are uneasy about this prospect, because it represents a senseless, mindless attack on students’ rights to the services that are essential to a decent university education.

ESOS provisions

The Government itself—even its most rabid ideologues—know that this attack is counterproductive. They know it’s destructive.
How do we know this?
We know because this very same Government has introduced legislation—legislation that’s currently before the Senate—that makes it mandatory for universities to provide just these same services and facilities to the international students who come to this country to study.
The Government is well aware that, if our universities do NOT provide these services and facilities, international students—the cash cows on which Australian universities now depend for their continued financial viability—these students will go elsewhere.
They will go to the United States or New Zealand or the UK because our universities could not compete.
So, on the one hand, the Government has acknowledged that these services are vital for international students, but on the other hand, Australian students apparently can do without them.
What a hypocritical attitude!
How unfair is it to guarantee student services and facilities for cash cow international students, but to deny the very same services to local students?
It is only a mad ideology that leads anyone down this path.

Membership of student organisations

And it’s an ideology that completely ignores the facts.
Dr Nelson and his colleagues profess to be driven in this mad endeavour by the principle of freedom of association.
That’s an important principle.
But, as far as I’m aware, it’s a principle that’s already enshrined in the statutes establishing every public university in the land.
Universities have opt-out or conscientious objection provisions, that allow students to decline to join the campus student union. They do not have to join.
They don’t have to join now.
If the Government is worried about freedom of association, there is freedom of association right now on our university campuses.
No, it’s not really that. This Government is so blinded by its own ideological obsession against campus student organisations that it can’t see reason.
It plans not just to ensure that students aren’t forced to join a political or representative organisation, but to ensure that students don’t get the basic services they need on campus.

A senseless position

In his hubris, Dr Nelson has ludicrously painted himself into a corner.
In order to justify his position, he has been forced to advance a series of ridiculous arguments.
We heard about the price of sausage rolls.
We were told about the poor young guy who didn’t see why he should subsidise the child care costs of the single mum.
And we heard about the single mum who couldn’t afford to pay anything towards the university rock-climbing club.
Then we heard about the student who didn’t actually use the counselling service—why should she subsidise someone who did use it?
Dr Nelson knows these arguments are silly. Of course he does.
Because, if they’re not silly—if they’re entirely reasonable—then of course, to be consistent, we have to apply them to the taxes that the same Government makes us all pay.
As anyone who read last Friday’s Australian is aware, I live in a reasonable-sized house in the suburbs of Melbourne. It’s my own house.
But there are many other Australians who are not nearly as fortunate as I am. They don’t own their own homes—they have to rent.
And rents in our capital cities are steep. Those on low incomes receive rent assistance from the Commonwealth.
We taxpayers collectively spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in Commonwealth Rent Assistance.
Following Dr Nelson’s logic, though, he and I and all the taxpayers who own their own homes shouldn’t be forced to subsidise the rents of less affluent Australians. It isn’t fair, according to his reasoning.
What claptrap!
If my luck changed and I found myself unemployed and homeless, then this Commonwealth program of assistance would be available to me—or to Dr Nelson, for that matter.
I am quite happy to pay my taxes just so that programs like this one are available to people who need them.
And a student, when he or she enrols at university, might not foresee that, a few months down the track, some major personal or family problems will come up. Then that student needs support services such as counselling to get them through their studies successfully.
Not all students use all campus services, just as, as a taxpayer, I don’t benefit from all possible Commonwealth assistance programs.
But those facts don’t imply that I shouldn’t have to pay tax, nor that students shouldn’t be expected to contribute to the cost of the services available on campus and the facilities they might want to use.
Labor’s amendment to this bill would require students to contribute to the cost of campus services, without making them join a student organisation. As I have noted, this is a right they already enjoy.

Dr Nelson’s “student vote”

Now we have seen Dr Nelson come out and make the ludicrous suggestion that all students should be forced to vote on whether or not they want to pay their student union dues to fund campus services and facilities.
Technically speaking, he could oblige universities to undertake such a ballot.
He could do that by threatening to cut off their Commonwealth funding if they don’t co-operate. Under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, he has open‑ended powers to force universities to do just about anything to ensure that their funding flows to them.
Technically speaking again, Dr Nelson could specify that, as a condition of funding, all university Vice-Chancellors had to sing Tiptoe through the Tulips in the presence of DEST officers.

Micro-managing universities: IR

This Government’s power to micro-manage universities is phenomenal. We have recently seen to what extent it will go in terms of Industrial Relations. It has decimated university staff conditions and torn away the rights of unions on campus.
Now it is withholding universities’ conditional payments for January and February 2006, until it has had time to peruse the fine print of all the workplace agreements made with unions, to find out if they comply with the detailed new conditions it has forced onto them.
It is placing universities’ cash flow at risk at a vital time of year, simply because the Government itself is snowed under with all the mountains of paperwork it has created.
By the time the next Federal Election comes around, it’s difficult to predict just how intrusive all of these arrangements and conditions will have become.
Meanwhile, the proportion of university revenue, exclusive of HECS, that actually emanates from the Commonwealth has plummeted under this Government—from 57% in 1996 to less than 40% in 2004.
Universities are required to jump through ever more hoops for ever-diminishing amounts of money.
This Government is hell-bent on turning our universities into degree mills that do no more than its bidding.

Conclusion

If this legislation passes through the Senate, this Government will have its heart’s desire—it will have smashed student organisations.
It will snatch away students’ rights to collective representation on campus governing bodies.
It will remove their right to advocacy and advice concerning academic matters such as academic progress rules and appeals.
It will abolish the very services that support and help students who need assistance with personal and life problems.
It will also abolish the educational support services—English language, writing skills, how to make the best of lectures—that help students through their courses.
It will close student medical and dental services.
It will make it impossible for many student parents, all around the country, to attend class—because of the closure of child care on campus.
And it will make university life lonelier, more isolating and socially poorer for all students.
In the case of regional universities, this Government will strike at the very heart of regional economies and community life.
What an achievement.
I can only hope that enough Senators on the Government side of the Chamber see reason and cross the floor on this bill. The students of Australia, and Australian universities, depend on their good sense.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Labor opposes the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up front Fees) Bill in its current form, and proposes sensible amendments which, of course, the Government rejects.
Labor opposes the Government’s bill because it is going to be very bad legislation for the university students the Government says it is so concerned about.
But as we have seen, time and again, when it comes to implementing its extreme ideological agenda, the Government couldn’t care less about who gets hurt along the way.
And so we have seen the Government vote to sell off Telstra despite 70% of Australians not wanting it sold and now 12,000 Telstra workers are potentially going to lose their jobs.
We’ve watched the Government vote for the wholesale destruction of Australia’s 100 year old industrial relations system and now more than 3.5 million Australians won’t be able to seek redress if they are sacked for no reason.
And we’ve also watched Government Senators vote for the so called welfare to work legislation that will dump Australians who are disabled or single parents onto the dole.
And now the next instalment—destroying Australia’s student unions.
It’s the final plank in a raft of extreme legislation that will see realised the long held dreams of the Prime Minister and his worn out, out of touch, government that has had nine long years to do something good for Australia but has spent all of that time wrecking everything that is good and fair in Australia.
Another piece of extreme legislation is about to be rammed though this Senate, just like it was crunched through the other House earlier in the week.
AND FOR WHAT?
Because some of those in the Coalition have harboured vengeance for 10, 20 or 30 years just waiting for the chance to punish student unions because some members of the Coalition weren’t able to win control of the student unions when they were students.
Because this Government has a pathological hatred for anything that has as its basis collectivism and fairness—the principle of people working together, contributing equally so that everyone benefits and those who need it are looked after.
Because this Government cannot bear the criticism it gets from the student organisations that—quite rightly—focus on the real problems in our higher education system, the lack of funding to Universities, and the huge HECS debts that Australia’s young people are accumulating—the $11 billion dollar HECS debt being carried by our students and graduates., the HECS debt that has doubled in nine long years of this Government.
And this Government is shoving this legislation through just because it can. With arrogant disregard for the wishes of the majority of Australians who are NOT clamouring for this legislation, this Government is just charging ahead doing what ever it likes, just because it can, because it has control of the Senate and it is once again going to abuse that situation.
BAD FOR STUDENTS, BAD FOR STUDENT UNIONS
Australians are not out there demanding the destruction of student unions. The students themselves are not clamouring for this. If they were, the protest would have been manifest well before this in campus referendums or student protests or by universities supporting VSU. But there is no groundswell, students are sensible people who, unlike the Government members, can see the rationale and the value of contributing a relatively small amount for student services that will support them in many different ways throughout their university career.
If you look at the submissions to the Senate Enquiry into this Bill the individuals and organisations that contributed submissions overwhelmingly said they did not support this legislation.
Just this week the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee—hardly a radical organisation—wrote to all Senators rejecting the mooted proposal to secure support for the Bill with an $80 million bribe and imploring us to not support the Government’s legislation and instead leave it to the institutions themselves to determine what services will be provided on their campuses, and how those services will be managed and funded.
Labor does not support this legislation—even though the student organisations have been highly critical of the Labor Party and its policies.
Critical, because the point of student unions is to support students and advance their interests—an objective which will invariably put the student organisations in conflict with the government of the day from time to time.
It is not just arrogant to ride roughshod over the student organisations, it is dangerous—highly dangerous. What we are seeing here is a dangerous slide into restricting the ability of a significant interest group to organise legitimate opposition to the government of the day. Which groups will this government target next with its slide into repressive, punitive legislation that restricts the freedom to criticise government? Maybe some of those church based welfare groups that receive funding from the Government should start to get worried.
Of course, the representative function of student organisations is but one of a raft of activities they undertake on behalf of students.
The services and amenities that student unions provide for students are well documented in the submissions to the Senate enquiry. Those services and facilities include sporting clubs, health centres, welfare services, childcare centres, IT resource centres, catering facilities, meeting rooms, entertainment programs, chapels and prayer rooms, student representation to university boards and committees, and accommodation and employment services.
Sometimes I think those on the other side live their lives divorced from reality.
It seems the only historical or contemporary knowledge they have of student organisations is a few examples of financial mismanagement which are repeated ad nauseum. Mind you, its OK for their mates who donate $1.1 million to the Liberal Party to engage in extraordinary lengths to avoid paying tax, its OK to bail out the Prime Minister’s brother when he goes broke, its OK for them to waste $55million of taxpayers money on a failed attempt to get public support for its draconian workplace laws—but they don’t talk about that much. And of course we keep hearing about those AUS days, back in the 1970s and 1980s. Thirty years ago. To bring us into this century, perhaps the Government should just “Get over it”.
It is typical that the Government ignores the many, many excellent services and amenities that student unions provide .
Amenities and services that can ONLY be provided if there is a universal fee collected from all students—a modest fee which, when everyone pays it, provides enough money to ensure all students benefit.
Amenities and services that will NOT be provided at all, or will have to be provided on a user pays basis, or that Universities will have somehow to fund out of their own revenues.
EXAMPLES
Unlike many of the Government Senators who apparently have little knowledge of what student unions do—or wilfully ignore what those organisations do because it suits their pathetic arguments to do so—I have a good understanding of the benefits of student unions because I used to work for one.
When I worked for a student union it was in an administrative capacity and I must admit when I took up the job with the Adelaide University Union, I really had very little idea about what a student union did or how it operated. That was the case even though I had been a mature age student at that University a few years before. I did not have much occasion then to use many of the services provided by the student organisations on campus, but I never begrudged paying the student union fees if it meant other people would benefit.
Adelaide University Union has a long and distinguished history—and was first established in 1895—more than 100 years ago. It commenced charging universal membership fees in 1927 and has charged them ever since. Interestingly, a survey of students at the University conducted by independent market research company, found that 84% of students at Adelaide University supported a compulsory student services fee to fund services and amenities, as opposed to a user pays system (from AUU submission to Senate Enquiry, p5) .
The affiliate organisation where I worked, the Students Association, began as the student representative council in 1946. It has always been a strong advocate for student interests and critical of governments—all governments—that introduce policies or legislation perceived to be inimical to the best interests of students.
In the five and a bit years I worked for the student union at Adelaide University, I worked under six different student association presidents and six different elected student boards and councils—boards and councils whose members had been supported in their election campaigns by the whole gamut of political parties and views—Liberal, Labor and Independent.
Despite my occasional disagreements with some of those elected student representatives about political, industrial or administrative matters, I found in my five years that overwhelmingly they were absolutely dedicated to providing the best possible service to the students they represented, and—despite the fact they were mostly young and inexperienced in such matters—they managed large budgets with financial rigour and responsibility that would put to shame many of the employers I dealt with in my later life as a union official.
It is galling to have to sit here and listen to Government members continually deride and disparage the efforts of elected student representatives who voluntarily, and usually for no or very little monetary reward, worked very hard and very effectively to make life at university better for their peers.
EXAMPLES
There are numerous examples one could use to illustrate what it is that is in jeopardy because of the Government’s hysterical, pathological hatred of student organisations.
There are so many good and valuable services provided by student unions and partly or wholly funded by universal student fees that it is hard to know where to start and stop, however I will give a few examples.
WELFARE SERVICES
We should be particularly concerned about the threat the Government’s legislation is to welfare services on campus. For example, at the University of Adelaide student union—and I am sure at most student organisations—the Education and Welfare Officers help students in a variety of ways including individual counselling about both academic and personal matters. Students in financial difficulty can be assisted with emergency student loans and budgetary advice. Such assistance can be the difference between completing a course and dropping out. A loan of a few hundred dollars to pay an unexpected bill can make all the difference to a student trying to juggle university workloads, paid work and family life.
As the AUU said in its submission to the Senate Enquiry into this legislation ‘Whilst these counselling and support services are not academic in nature, they clearly affect a student’s ability to perform academically. Without this type of support and assistance, the stress placed upon students in need will increase and a consequent increase in the number of students dropping out of study would seem inevitable.
Now it is true that most students at Adelaide University—which currently has some 18,000 students—will, hopefully, never need to go near an Education and Welfare Officer. If you asked a student who was enrolling for the first time if they could foresee the need to visit a Welfare Officer at the student union I am sure they would say, they could not envisage having to do that. But the fact is some of those students will need those services at some point in time, and if they had to pay for them on a fee for service basis, they would not be able to afford to pay for those services that now are provided on an equal basis to all students because all students pay the student services fee.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS ASSOCIATION
My working life at the Adelaide University Union coincided with the beginnings of a greater influx of overseas students to Australian universities. These students, whom the government actively encourages to come to Australia, have particular needs. It is not an easy thing to up stumps and come to Australia—to another country and another culture—to study.
Under the umbrella of the Adelaide University Union, overseas students at Adelaide University formed the Overseas Students Association to advocate for them and to assist them with the many complexities of being a student from another country living and studying in Australia. Again, referring to the AUU submission to the Senate enquiry, I note that the OSA has been successful in securing changes to university policies despite resistance from the University. Changes such as allowing early graduation so that overseas students can have their degrees conferred before returning home, and the introduction of supplementary examinations held in the students’ home country were the direct result of lobbying by the OSA on behalf of its members.
If there was no OSA, funded by ALL students on campus through the universal levy, there would not have been those changes which, apparently, the University now agrees were good changes and have assisted the University attract more overseas students.
As well as its advocacy and representation roles, the Overseas Students Association organises social events for both overseas and non-overseas students. I know the Government likes to rant on about beer and barbecues provided by student unions. I wonder if Opposition Senators begrudge the provision of social events to overseas students who are away from the support of their families and friends back home.
They must, because that is exactly the kind of campus service that the Government’s legislation will deny students because who or what is going to fund the Overseas Students Association if the student union does not? No doubt one of those “niche entrepreneurs” that the Government Senators refer to in their section of the Report of the Senate Committee into this legislation will step into the breach.
No doubt “niche entrepreneurs” are falling over themselves to pick up student welfare services and student advocacy and lobbying services like those provided by the Overseas Students’ Association.
What a farcical position on the part of the Government—that some private, for profit entrepreneur will pick up services like the Overseas Students’ Association.
OTHER SERVICES
I could go on about other services—how student organisation’s Women’s Departments on the University campuses in South Australia over many years lobbied for provision of campus child care services, and for improved security on campuses and how they provide invaluable, independent support for women who are sexually harassed by academic staff.
How Environment Officers on campuses work with universities to raise awareness of environmental issues and reduce energy use and encourage recycling of waste on campuses.
None of those things are going to be funded by entrepreneurs or by universities. Those things will just not happen anymore, these valuable things that contribute to the welfare of students on campus and to the whole University community will just disappear.
STUDENT EMPLOYMENT
As well as providing services for students, student organisations are also employers of many students. In its submission to the Senate Enquiry, the Australian Campus Union Managers Association estimates that under the Government’s legislation up to one third of student organisation employees—some 4200 people—are at risk of losing their jobs and many of those people are students.
Go to any campus and you will see students working in the student services provided. What is the Government going to say to those students who lose their jobs? Look we saved you $300 in student union fees sorry about the $3000 a year you are going to lose because you won’t have a job any more.
However we know that the government doesn’t care about people, it is completely out of touch with what happens at universities—it is still living in the past, still harbouring old grudges
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the government hides its hatred of student organisations under the guise of “freedom”. This is nothing about freedom, it is an abuse of the word freedom to say that institutions cannot choose how they organise student services on campus, to restrict the way institutions provide those services and to punish them if they provide services in a way the government does not approve of.
It is not acceptable for the Government to confess to its real motivations for this legislation so they have to fish around and find an acceptable word to disguise their real intent and “freedom” is purloined.
Students are already free to choose whether or not to attend a university that requires a student to contribute to a student union. There are already opt out provisions for students that do not wish to join.
Student unions themselves—democratically elected student organisations—can determine whether or not to compulsorily or voluntarily charge for membership.
And the amendments proposed by the Labor Party to this legislation further ensure that any student organisation fees collected will be used for student services.
The Government is shameful in the way it claims to be so concerned about “freedom” when this legislation is all about forcing universities to bend to the Government’s ideological imperatives.
The ideological imperatives of an out of control, incompetent, extreme government that once again is going to use its control of the Senate to wreck Australian institutions that are based on the tradition of fairness and a fair go for everyone.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on this bill, which we all know is designed to undermine student activism in our universities and through this to undermine the autonomy of universities—but it will do much more than that—it will destroy the social and cultural fabric of Australian higher education institutions.
It is a bill driven by the ideology of this government that wants to eliminate “union’ in any shape or form from the political landscape.
This bill needs to be amended to protect the important services that are provided through student union and amenity fees, at university and TAFE campuses across the country.
Without those fees, services and activities that student associations provide will be pared back to the bare minimum. What will happen to the welfare services, subsidised health and child care, academic appeals and advocacy that student services now provide on campus?
Who will pick up the slack, who will provide the alternatives? Well, the government is now trying to cajole Senator Joyce with a Christmas present—another bucket of money to dole out, in the hope he will capitulate.
And will he be suckered again by this government? Let’s just wait and see!
Through this bill, this government is guaranteeing to see the collapse of student organisations across Australia—student organisations which provide vital services and advocacy roles for students.
Labor will strongly oppose this attack on students.
As a recent student of a university, I am very aware of the range of services provide to undergraduate and postgraduate students alike.
Surely students are being pressured enough by this government. Higher HECS fees mean debts, part-time jobs, crowded classes and now $100,000 degrees.
Labor opposed a similar attempt by the federal government to introduce voluntary student unionism at a federal level in 1999.
Then, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, represented the Howard government’s first attempt at its ideological assault on student organisations.
That bill, as with the bill before us, attracted widespread community opposition.
It was opposed by a number of vice-chancellors, including the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. State parliaments passed motions against the former bill’s introduction. Even in South Australia, where Liberal government was in power, the South Australian parliament passed a motion against the bill;
It stated:
That this house is committed to ensuring that South Australian university programs and students are not disadvantaged and is therefore opposed to voluntary student unionism.
That’s pretty clear isn’t it?
So, perhaps Government Senators aren’t aware of the range of services provided by student organisations:
Let me tell you—the University of Canberra, for example, where I was recently as student, support services such as subsidised health and child care, academic appeals, student loans, welfare support and assistance in the transition to university life.
These services could not exist without a compulsory services and amenities fee.
I have three children enrolled in university, so I know that attending university for the first time is very challenging. University can be a lonely time. Young students move from their high school class of perhaps 30 to a lecture of perhaps 150-300.
It’s not that easy for a country kid, or any student, to find their own way in a large institution like the University of Canberra or the ANU, or Charles Sturt, or UNE—this is a big pond for little fish.
Orientation Week—O-Week—gives new students a chance to make some tentative friendships, and find their way around the campus and the services that are there to support them. They do this by becoming involved in the activities offered by the student organisations.
And it is these services that help them settle into university life.
So, what do we have in this bill—well, orientation programs will be curtailed, because the activities organised by student organisations won’t be able to happen.
And what will be the outcome of that?
Disoriented students, students making poor subject choices, students getting caught up in accommodation options that don’t work for them—real effects on students and their abilities to successfully participate in the higher education system.
An important issue that I see is unresolved by the government’s arguments is the removal of transition programs offered by student organisations, which will seriously impact on international students.
For many overseas students, it is the transition programs that student organisations provide during the orientation period that allow them to make some sense of cultural issue S in Australia, that help them in their language needs, and are essential to their success in higher education in Australia.
The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report—Hacking Australia’s future—examined this issue at length.
Mr Trevor White, a representative of the Australasian Campus Union Managers Association, argued that services provided by student organisations were ‘part of the total educational experience in coming to Australia’.
Mr White was very clear about the contribution of services and amenity fees. He said:
It is an outrageous comment by the government to say that these services are not important.
International students use a wide range of services from student organisations as part of their transition to university life in Australia.
As well as the vital program that occurs for international students during orientation week, many student organisations have an international students department. which provides an important support base and friendship network for overseas students on campus.
At the University of Canberra, there is a strong focus on international student enrolments.
UC enjoys a culturally rich population, with students from over 80 countries forming part of the University’s multicultural community.
International Student Services offers a variety of activities and services for international students, including facilities, organising affordable day trips, political advocacy, international newspapers and cheap faxing.
As well, overseas students are able to access the range of services provided by student organisations, including clubs and societies.
The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee concluded in their inquiry that there was a clear danger that foreign students would be deterred from enrolling in Australian universities if these services were not available.
And higher education is on of our most significant export earners.
Another group to be affected by the abolition of VSU are mature age students and women.
Believe me for mature age students, going back to university can be a challenging time. Mature age students find going back to study and upgrading their qualifications a tough experience, often juggling home life with studying on a limited income.
In many student organisations across Australia, there are mature age student departments.
At Monash University at Clayton for example, the Mature Age and Part-Time Students Association provides a strong support base for students aged 23 and above.
They provide a quiet and comfortable lounge with free computer access, coffee—and tea-making facilities, reading rooms and regular social events.
They also play a strong advocacy role for mature age and part-time students within the university. This department would almost certainly not exist without a compulsory services and amenities fee.
Women are participating more in Australia’s higher education institutions than ever before, yet women still face discrimination and harassment on campus. They need to feel safe.
Flexible learning options mean night time lectures and tutorials, night time library and computer lab sessions—and women need to feel safe on campus at those times.
The level of success that they experience from participating in higher education can be dependent on how safe they feel on campus.
It might sound a very simple thing to many Senators, but student organisations have played a vital role in lobbying university administrations to ensure that campuses are well lit.
And that there are security guards on campus. I have availed myself of this service many times—Security guards will walk students to and from class and to car parks to ensure their safety.
Here in Canberra, the student organisations even provide shuttle buses for students to get to their accommodation at night.
The university environment can intimidate women as students in other ways too-have you ever been to a tutorial with 300 other students and tried to ask a question?
Adult Learning styles are very different, and the fact is that male students often dominate classroom discussions and debates. It’s even tougher for women enrolled in non-traditional professions such as engineering who often feel totally excluded in these predominantly male courses.
So, in these kinds of circumstances, the women’s department, which is part of the student organisation, plays an important role in providing support for women on campus.
Women’s departments are often one of the strongest departments of a student association. They can be advocacy bodies raising campus awareness about issues such as sexual harassment and assault and gender equity on campus.
Women’s departments also provide a range of activities, including self-defence classes and practical workshops, spaces for breastfeeding, learning facilities, mentoring, quiet reflection, study and companionship.
Without a compulsory services and amenities fee, what will women’s departments be able to offer? In some associations, they would be forced to close down.
Women will be the losers on campus.
And, if you come from a regional community, and have studied on a regional campus, as I have, then you know how important student organisations are to the lives of students who attend regional universities.
Student organisations at regional universities are the lifeblood on campus, providing activities and support for students almost 24 hours a day.
Regional universities make significant contributions to the communities in which they are based.
Student organisations are creative in provide services that allow students to engage in the larger communities—it’s different at a rural campus. Students live in the town, rather than in residences—so transport to and from the campus is an important service.
Transport services enable students to have an active student life and a fruitful university experience.
Without such services, students would be less likely to select regional universities as their higher education provider of choice. This has significant implications not only for the university but also for the local economy of the town itself.
For regional towns, student associations often own a variety of facilities used by the local people; A great example is the University of New England in Armidale. The student union owns the town’s cinema. Other student associations have wonderful choirs and bands.
These kinds of facilities add to the vibrancy and life of regional centres. The functions that are provided by student organisations are vital parts of a student’s experience in higher education.
Even the Minister for Education, Science and Training acknowledged that:
... student organisations enrich university life and provide a whole range of services, from the very commercial right
through to support and counselling—services which are all ... valued by students.
So, why then is the minister now is trying to destroy the very institutions he praised? He know that this bill, without amendment, will mean the cessation of many of the services he regarded as ‘valued by students’.
It will lead also to a massive loss of jobs. We’ve already seen that in Western Australia.
The Court government introduced voluntary student unionism in Western Australia, in 1994. The immediate effect was that student organisations were forced to the brink of collapse.
University administrations recognised the irreplaceable value and role of student associations and were regularly forced to financially prop up student organisations to ensure their continued existence.
Under VSU, student organisations in Western Australia were forced to lay off services staff, as they did not have the funds to maintain their employment.
If the legislation is passed without amendment, the Australasian Campus Unions Managers Association, the peak body for services providing organisations on campus, estimates that at least 4,200 jobs will be lost, including hundreds in regional areas. How can this government claim to support regional Australia when attempting to legislate hundreds of regional jobs out of existence?
The minister has argued that many of the services operated by student organisations could be operated by commercial enterprises and that this would be a more efficient and cheaper way to go.
And as much as Universities are now trying to offer flexible delivery, summer programs, extended classes, and professional development course, its not enough to ensure that services can be viable, because the main student body is only on campus for six months of the year.
That’s a tough call for commercial businesses trying to remain viable and inevitably they have to raise their prices to compensate for the six months they are not there.
At the moment, many student organisations subsidise food outlets; This certainly won’t be possible without a compulsory services and amenities fee.
But this is about much more food and drink outlets.
How does the government expect the student welfare services, and student advocacy services to be funded under this bill?
In Western Australia, as a result of the VSU legislation introduced by the Court government, students who worked unpaid for the guilds found themselves using all their energy in recruiting students as members to their guild rather than representing their members. The students had no choice but to do this, because without the financial resources provided through memberships the student associations would almost definitely cease to operate.
Labor is proposing an amendment to this bill, a sensible compromise—to outlaw compulsory student union membership and to allow universities to charge a compulsory services and amenities fee.
Labor’s amendment provides a practical and sensible way to protect vital campus services. Labor has moved beyond the Liberals’ tired old debate about compulsory student unionism, where Liberal members are still fighting the campus battles they lost in the 1970s.
In fact, the amendment is aimed at saving the government from itself
If the government chooses not to support the amendment Labor will strongly oppose this bill.
Without a compulsory services and amenities fee, vital student services such as welfare provision, subsidised health and child care, academic appeals and advocacy will be significantly diminished; in some cases, they will cease to exist.
So, we wait to see what Senator Joyce is up to—‘Backdown Barnaby’—who, once again, has been talking about being prepared to stand up and fight the good fight on this legislation I guess we will have to wait and see whether he does.
I feel very strongly about this legislation—perhaps because my university experience is still very fresh in my mind.
Students today face a vastly different set of circumstances. Students are paying increasingly greater sums of money for their degrees. People are working longer and longer hours on the side to support themselves and more than ever people need the support of their student organisations.
And the argument that part time students don’t want to fund these services doesn’t wash—it is the culture of university life that is provided through a range of student services that exposes young people, young and old minds alike to the intellectual stimulation and activities that round them as human beings.
It has suddenly occurred to me why the government might not want to support such seditious activity!
We all know that the government’s attack is aimed at silencing opposition, silencing voices of dissent. And where do we find the radical youth of this generation? In the universities, of course.
Why wouldn’t we want them there?
The government’s attack is particularly aimed at the representative arm of student organisations, though the consequences will be felt far more widely.
The student bodies of every university in this country has democratic elections, where students decide who represents them and who spends those fees. And Senators opposite know this to be true, because most universities actually have Liberal students who run for representative office on a pro-VSU line.
University governance bodies require representation by student organisations, and there are circumstances when students themselves need representation. Who will fill that role at student appeals committees when students charged with offences against the university need, and in some cases are required to have representation?
Where will the students voice be on equal opportunity boards, on the university council and on both chancellor and vice-chancellor selection committees?
So, these are the implications of this Bill. It’s not jut about sporting facilities and the student union bar—as some in the government would have us believe.
The Australian Vice Chancellors Committee has proposed a compromise proposal to the minister that would allow universities to maintain student services and amenities on campus.
The AVCC is strongly opposed to the idea of proposing a fund of some $80 million to universities over three years as compensation for the removal from universities of the ability to continue to charge a services and amenities fee.
As John Mullarvey CEO of the AVCC has pointed out:
This sum of money is less than half what universities currently collect in any one year. It will not come close to ensuring universities are able to maintain the current level of services and amenities and does not take into account the relative requirements of each university campus”
Mr Mullarvey points out that such a proposal will create another level of federal bureaucracy and intervention into the affairs of autonomous universities.
And I’m reminded of the Ministers’ heavy handed approach to the Higher Education Funding Bill, and the TAFE funding Bill—the minister is gaining a reputation for his heavy handed approach.
Well, in this instance, his quick fix, grants-based solution is no solution at all—and I hope that Senator Joyce is not swayed by the silver tongued bodgie.
This Bill is about reining in student activism, but driven out of ideology. It’s not about small p political activism—anyone who has been involved in Labor or Liberals on campus would appreciate how seriously those students take themselves—but its not about any of that.
It’s about reining in the universities and their autonomous councils—bringing them to heel on tertiary funding issues. It is part of a much bigger agenda by this Minister.
Let me remind Senators: the effects of this Bill will be felt far wider than the representative arms of student organisations.
Labor is proposing sensible amendments which aim to protect many of the services which student organisations deliver on our campuses.
The range is extensive—employment services, academic rights, women’s rooms, music, sport, safe spaces, taxation assistance, welfare services.
Our universities have always been regarded as places of learning—and they need to remain that way as vibrant, diverse campuses encouraging debate and participation.
The AVCC provides an alternative—now lets see what the Government is prepared to concede.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005.
Education Minister Brendan Nelson is living in the seventies.
Just like the Sky Hooks song but he has caught a dreadful disease. But Dr Nelson’s disease that has nothing to do with sex, drugs and rock and roll.
Dr Nelson’s disease is that he has become the stereo-typical middle aged man whose radical student days are long gone and whose politics have shifted from Labor to those of the extreme right. Acting Deputy President, it’s hard to believe this is the same man who shared my politics as a member of the Labor Party.
But there you go.
The Education Minister’s Report Card might read:
“Brendan seems confused about the tasks we have set him. He appears to have withdrawn from the rest of the class and tends to bully those least able to defend themselves. Brendan needs to reflect more on the consequences of his actions.”
Students from regional Australia will remember what living in the 70s was like.
The only people who could afford to go to university were the children of doctors and lawyers.
This bill is another step by Education Minister Brendan Nelson towards turning Australia’s universities back to the 60s and 70s.
Acting Deputy President, this bill will have two significant impacts.
From January next year, any higher education provider—primarily universities—who is receiving Commonwealth support under the Higher Education Support Act will be prevented from making membership of student organisations a condition of enrolment. Sounds more than heavy handed to me. It sounds extreme.
But what’s new with this extreme Howard Government? It really is just more of the same!
It also sounds absurd when students already have the option of opting out of membership of student organisations.
The truth is in the numbers. Most students already have a choice and they choose to stay in student unions.
Minister Nelson’s bright idea to call a referendum among students reeked of desperation politics. He might as well survey Australians about whether they want to pay the Commonwealth taxes that provide childcare.
Bass MHR Michael Ferguson shone the light of his ignorance into this debate when he articulated that child care services for students weren’t a necessity and shouldn’t be a union function.
Given this government’s out-of-touch record with childcare in regional Australia I suppose we shouldn’t have been surprised by his comments.
Acting Deputy President, this bill also prevents higher education providers from making a condition of enrolment any fee ‘for the provision to students of an amenity, facility or service that is not of an academic nature’. You can bet that higher education providers, TAFE and Universities will have to abide by this ridiculous condition to received Commonwealth funding.
It will become a condition of receiving a grant.
The bill contains a provision which allows the minister to reduce Commonwealth funding for higher education institutions by $100 per federally funded student place if the conditions are breached.
Heavy handed? Minister Nelson, how soon you forget your student roots and how disgracefully you abuse your privileged position in this parliament. Finally, if the minister chose to invoke section 19-65, more than $5 billion in Commonwealth funding to universities could be lost.
It’s hard to believe this is a minister who enjoyed the privilege of a free university education.
This is extreme in its heavy-handedness. This Bill is arrogant in its bullying.
But this government has become an expert at bullying.
By bullying legislation through and abusing its power in this chamber.
By bullying the most disadvantaged in our society by ramming through its Welfare to Work Bill.
By bullying Australian workers and employees into its WorkChoices Bill.
History will record this government as bullying and extreme in its reforms agenda.
Look at the groups of society it has targeted in the past two months. Students, the disabled and unemployed have all been painted in powerless corners.
For what agenda?
I believe this miserable Howard Government is trying to impoverish and consequently silence great chunks of Australian society and create a little America.
Last week we saw survival of the fittest, American style agendas rammed through our Parliament with WorkChoices and now Welfare to Work.
Now the Federal Government wants the Americanisation of our universities. Labor wants an Australia built on Australian values not run by Terminator-style politicians who have no care to protect society’s minorities.
Australia deserves an Education Minister who isn’t stuck in the seventies and who doesn’t model himself on Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Labor wants a university system that contributes to a confident, independent nation that stands on its own two feet.
Labor wants a clever country where the university system is allowed to support students appropriately to ensure they make the most of their study opportunity.
This bill will destroy vital campus services that support university students. Health services, child care, sport and legal support services are all hanging in the balance. The child-care centre at my local university, the University of Tasmania, provides an exceptional service to students who are parents. Many of the students who come from Northern Tasmania arrive at university from low socio-economic background and go back to study, upskill and better themselves through education.
The child-care centre provides not only subsidised child-care places but also many very flexible arrangements that parents would be very hard-pressed to find at other child-care centres in the area. Without this valuable service—and it will go if this legislation gets through the parliament—many parents who are students simply will not be able to afford child care and will not be able to afford to stay at university. Families will be forced to either have to pay through the nose for child care or no longer continue their university studies.
Is that Minister Nelson’s agenda? To reduce the number of students attending university in regional Australia? Judging from his statements last week about degree quality from regional universities I am starting to think his agenda is to take Australia back to the early 1970s when only the children of doctors and lawyers could afford to attend university. Is Minister Nelson living in the 70s?
There is no doubt that student organisations help keep students at university by offering the necessary subsidies and services that cash-strapped universities just cannot offer. Already targeted by this out-of-touch Howard Government through its miserable and arrogant Welfare to Work Bill, single parents may suffer the most from this bill. They have very few choices but to rely on campus child care to allow them to improve their skills and they would not be able to study without their subsidised support.
The sole parent is probably only able to complete their teacher training thanks to the student organisation’s child-care subsidy. What Labor wants to see is the entire student services on our university campuses continue.
We don’t want to hear Education Minister Brendan Nelson trivialise the issue again and again lowering the debate to the cost of sausage rolls.
Labor wants to allow all students to decide whether or not they want to join a student organisation but each and every student would be responsible for making a contribution to these services on their university campuses.
We do think that there should be a contribution that everybody makes.
But what we want to see is that all of the services on our university campuses continue.
The only way to continue is to reward all students who make a contribution to those services.
We are yet to hear an idea from Education Minister Nelson that doesn’t come as a heavy-handed threat to universities connecting their funding to their ability to stop students joining student unions.
VSU is also about the fights that many of the Liberal Members of Parliament had when they were on university campuses, where they lost student elections to more savvy Labor student organisers.
Now what they are trying to do is use their power in the Australian Parliament to get rid of all of these services that they were able to enjoy when they were at university.
But this government arrogantly ignores the valuable contribution that student organisations make in so many ways. One of the very important ways is university sporting organisations. They make campus life vibrant and create opportunities for the promotion of health and fitness in the general community, not just for university students. They have trained generations of Olympians and elite sportspeople.
Many prominent Australians were so alarmed at the introduction of this bill that they took out an advertisement in major papers around the country condemning the government’s move to destroy university sport. Sport for university students also provides a valuable outlet for stress and is great for students’ mental health. When sporting greats like Shane Gould, John Coates, Kevin Gosper, Stuart MacGill, Geoff Lawson, Phil Kearns, Liz Ellis and Ric Charlesworth speak out against these changes to campus life does this arrogant Howard Government listen?
No. Because as they have shown, they don’t have to listen to anyone, anymore. Which way will Senator Joyce jump this time? Come on Senator Joyce. Join these great Australians and show some courage and act against this appalling legislation. Come on Senator Joyce. Protect the great contribution to university life of their sporting organisations. Actions speak louder than words, Senator Joyce. Actions speak louder than words.
It is not only sport and it is not only child care; there are so many other services provided by student organisations. Come on, Senator Joyce. Help disadvantaged Australians get a university education with access to safe and reliable child care. Another one is the advocacy services. The government completely ignores the help that individual students get from their student organisations.
Come on, Senator Joyce, help the university students who would otherwise not have any access to legal advocate. The persistent work, practical advocacy by student organisations for individual students and groups of students, happens every day in our universities. Student advocates will go if this bill becomes law. There’s no money in being a student advocate. It is the students’ union fees that support the service. Who will desperate students turn to for legal advice?
This bill smells more like making students and universities powerless. The universities will be pressured with funding threats to apply the bill while the students will be left without much of the vital support they deserve to successfully complete their studies. After four long years Minister Nelson gets an ‘F’ for:
reducing the number of Australian students in our universities while massively increasing the cost of university education
presiding over the most significant drop in Australians in training in a decade in 2004
continuing to back a flawed Federal schools funding system which gave big funding increases to the schools which needed it the least
reducing research and development to 0.6% of GDP—the lowest level in two decades
introducing massive 25% HECS fee hikes, and 60 degrees costing over $100, 000
vetoing ten Australian Research Council grants without giving any reason increasing the size of the education bureaucracy from 1,481 in 2001 to 2,014 in 2005
increasing his Ministerial powers and bureaucratic red tape, reject university and TAFE courses and
bungling the implementation of the Parent School Partnership Initiative by tying up Indigenous communities in red tape.
The Education Minister is probably financially secure after he was given his $200,000 medical degree gratis after his education was made free by the Whitlam Labor Government. However, I am left to wonder whether Minister Nelson is also a business graduate? After all, he oversees at least a $13 billion debt owed by other, not-so-fortunate students.
Minister Nelson needs to take a long hard look in the mirror and see beyond his own face to the absolute hypocrisy of this arrogant government’s policies.
Under Labor’s amendment a fee would be collected by universities for use on services for the benefit of students but would outlaw compulsory membership of student organisations.
The amendment:
Outlaws compulsory student union membership.
Allows universities to charge a compulsory services and amenities fee.
Specifies a range of amenities, facilities, activities and services on which monies collected may be spent—including child care, sports facilities, advocacy, counselling, orientation information, cultural activities.
Introduces tough new accountability and reporting requirement for universities to make sure any money collected through a compulsory student amenities fee is used in accordance with the law.
Requires universities to levy fees on a pro-rata basis for part time, external and distance education students.
Labor’s compromise amendment is a sensible, practical way to protect vital campus services.
Labor has moved beyond the Liberals’ tired old debate about compulsory student unionism, where they are still fighting the campus battles they lost in the 1970s.
Still living in the 70’s Minister Nelson? The Minister should give something back to this nation and protect vital campus services under threat from this extreme, ideological, so-called VSU legislation. Acting Deputy President, Labor’s list of protected services, amenities and activities of direct benefit to students:
food and beverages, meeting rooms, sports and physical recreation, child care, counselling, legal advice, health care, housing, employment, visual arts, performing arts and audio-visual media, debating, libraries and reading rooms, academic support, personal accident insurance for students, orientation information, support for overseas students, student representation and advocacy, student clubs and societies, social activities, cultural activities, welfare, commercial activities, capital funds and infrastructure, investments and reserves, student publications, or student financial assistance; and
administrative matters related to any of these; and
other facilities, services consistent with, or reasonably incidental, to any of these items.
Come on Minister Nelson! Convince Australia’s students that you are not living in the seventies.
 (Senator Brandis)—It now being after 4.30 pm, pursuant to the procedural resolution of the Senate I now put the question that the bill be read a second time.
Question put.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-12-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

As I discussed in my previous second reading speech in response to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004, the protection of privacy in Australia lags far behind that of the rest of the developed world.
Since I last spoke on this piece of legislation no further measures have been introduced to protect the private information of Australians nor have any developments occurred at common law.
Rather, there have been increased attempts at erode privacy—including the decision by the government to seek to extend the 2004 version of this bill.
It should be noted that in 2004, following its Inquiry into the Provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee referred to the operation of the sunset clause as an “important check in the process” of ensuring clarity in the application of the TI Act.
Yet the Government attempts to further extend this legislation as a patchwork measure on what has been deemed an inadequate legislative framework for access to telecommunications in general.
The Democrats at that time supported this need for clarity and were hopeful of a positive outcome on this issue following the review commissioned by the Commonwealth Attorney General and undertaken by Mr Anthony Blunn, the so-called Blunn review.
I take this opportunity to again lament the absence of an expressly established right to privacy in Australia. The absence of a bill of rights in Australia holds us in stark contrast to every other common law country.
Our privacy law is an awkward accumulation of different Acts, regulating different areas of our lives.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes that individuals have a right to be free from arbitrary interference with their privacy, family, home or correspondence and a right to the protection of the law from such interference.
Of course the Declaration does not have the status of a legal instrument but these rights have been subsequently enshrined in the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. This provides the international legal basis for privacy law in Australia.
The development of new forms of communication, such as email, SMS, voicemail and internet chat programs has posed a constant challenge to the existing legislative framework surrounding the protection of privacy of telecommunications.
To cope, the legislation has been updated in a consistently ad hoc fashion and as a consequence of numerous amendments it has become quite complicated. According to the recent review it requires replacement by new legislation.
This Bill, which has been proposed in various forms since 2002, all sharing the same intention of removing protection for private stored communications, has been constantly opposed by organisations advocating the privacy rights of Australian’s.
In response to the 2002 amendment an objection was the Federal Privacy Commissioner, who remarked;
“There seems to be little justification for reducing the privacy protection of a communication as intimate as a voice mail message or SMS, in comparison with a ‘live communication’ simply because the transmission of the former is temporarily delayed”.
This comment remains valid and the Democrats repeat the view contained in the dissenting report attached the Senate Legal and Constitutional Report that there is in fact no justification for exempting such communications.
When the Telecommunications (Interception) (Stored Communications) Bill 2004 was introduced into the Senate in June 2004 the Government lifted the thin veil of pretension and the amendments blatantly excluded stored communications from the ambit of the act, whether read or not, for a period of 12 months.
These amendments mean that instead of an interception warrant, as provided for by the TIA, a general search warrant is sufficient to allow law enforcement agencies to access private emails, voicemails and SMS messages.
This outraged privacy organisations and in it’s submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee Inquiry Electronic Frontiers Australia referred to the Bill as an “utter disgrace” as it “is the type of legislation one might expect to see in a police state, not in a democracy”.
I referred earlier to the Democrats hopes in relation to the Blunn Review. In 2004, as a response the requests of many government and non-government bodies, the Commonwealth Attorney General commissioned Anthony Blunn, SC to conduct a review of the regulation of access to communications.
This review was demanded by privacy oriented groups and strongly supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee following their inquiry into the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2004.
Included in the complaints in relation to this review was the fact that non-government bodies with an interest in the preservation of individual privacy were given an extremely inadequate consultation period.
This stands in contrast to the time provided to government agencies contributing to the review. The Australian Privacy Foundation, in their submission, commented: “Without labouring the points made in our letter of 19 April, we re-iterate our concern about the limited consultation period and lack of transparency of information relevant to the review. Despite the terms of reference being dated July 2004, the review was only announced, and invitations made to interested parties, in March 2005. We contrast the limited opportunity for public input with the more than 9 months that have been given available to government agencies.”
This report purports to have, as its primary consideration, that “the protection of privacy”, but it can be seen from its recommendations that it is merely paying lip service to the notion.
On the most contentious issue debated in the preceding three attempts to change the legislation, the report makes a point of justifying the distinction between “real-time” and “stored communications” and gives reasons why stored communications does not need to be covered by the act.
This justification centres around the ‘spontaneous’ nature of “real-time” communication and the inherent necessity of protecting it on that basis.
The paramount consideration, according to Blunn, is that these communications “do not provide the opportunity for ‘second thoughts’ prior to transmission offered by other forms”.
Using this distinction as a basis for justifying the application of an interception warrant for one form of communication and not another does not make sense. When a person leaves a voice message they do so spontaneously. The storage of the message for a period of time in an unopened inbox does not make it any less spontaneous.
Blunn further exhibits confusion on the issue when he states that no distinction needs to be made between chat room conversations and those conducted through a medium allowing verbal exchange.
This being so, the question must be asked—is a quickly drafted and sent email necessarily any less spontaneous that a verbal exchange or an internet chat room exchange?
Unless the person who is sending the communication is monitored to see how much time and thought they have put into it, the simple answer is no.
The Blunn Review is correct in its recommendation that new legislation needs to be drafted to cater for the evolution of modern technological developments in telecommunications.
I certainly think aspects of the report are valuable, it has no value in terms of the recommendations it makes regarding stored communications.
Finally, it must be noted that the intention stated by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee was that this review should be public.
The recommendations of the report were made public, but none of the submissions were. Upon telephone inquiry to the Attorney-General’s Department, it appears that they could not release them because none of the parties making submissions were asked for authorisation to release the information they provided upon submission.
I acknowledge that it may be appropriate in relation to submissions by government agencies as ASIO to withhold some information for valid reasons, but it seems dubious that the input from privacy organisations at least was not authorised to allow for publication.
This “oversight” clouds the transparency of the whole process, particularly after consideration of the unfavourable views of the two independent privacy bodies (that released their reports on their website for public viewing).
There is a distinct theme running through the history of this legislation. It is one of manipulative conduct by the government.
Leaving aside the recommendations of the ‘Blunn Review’, the actions of the Attorney-General’s department in allowing far more time to government agencies to contribute to the review than that provided to those preparing external submissions, and the far from transparent nature of the submissions leave a distinctly odorous impression.
In order to improve the legislative framework surrounding the regulation of access to telecommunications in Australian Federal law a second independent inquiry should be undertaken to examine the current scheme and determine the measures needed to protect private communications including stored communications.
In relation to the legislative treatment of stored communications we could use the example of the United Kingdom where the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 provides acceptable protection for stored communications.
Despite the terrorist attacks we’ve seen in London they haven’t introduced such draconian measures affecting stored communications to parliament. Unlike our legislation the UK legislation provides much greater protection.
The fundamental difference is that communications are deemed to be still in transmission when stored on a system for the intended recipient to access and interception that does not fall under one of the limited lawful interception exceptions requires the issue of a special warrant.’
But how effective are these interception warrants anyway? I have previously risen to speak on the worrying statistics in the 2003 annual report on the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and noted that there has been a dramatic imbalance between the increased number of interceptions and the contrastingly number of interceptions that yield information and are used in the prosecution of offences.
It seems this trend remains. The 2004 Report on the Act showed that whilst 3028 warrants were issued there were only 2035 arrests and 1824 convictions based on these warrants.
The number of arrests and convictions since 2003 has increased slightly proportionate to the number of warrants issued but there is still a significant imbalance.
Julie De Rooy also referred to the figures from the 2002 and 2003 Reports by the Attorney-General’s Department in her article in the Law Institute Journal
She noted that the United States Courts—despite the US’s far larger population—only granted approximately half the number of phone tap warrants in the same period as Australian courts granted interception warrants. This is disturbing information.
The Democrats will not support this Bill. The position we are in now remains the same as that of a year ago.
The Blunn Review has not proven to be as transparent and independent as we hoped and we suggest a further review of the telecommunications interception regime to allow for adequate consideration of the concerns expressed by privacy advocacy groups.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT (STORED COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
