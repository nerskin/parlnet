(c) the series of battles were incredibly fierce and costly, claiming the lives of 26 Anzacs, with up to 100 wounded and an estimated 300 North Vietnamese combatants killed during the almost one month of fighting;


(2) acknowledges all of the units and elements that comprised the 1st Australian Task Force (Forward) that deployed to Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral;


(3) notes that:


(a) the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal recently wrote to the Minister for Defence Personnel recommending: 'That the 1st Australian Task Force (Forward) be awarded the ""Unit Citation for Gallantry"" for extraordinary gallantry in action at the Battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral, between 12 May and 6 June 1968.';

4 MS MCGOWAN
:

To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) the Commonwealth's Financial Assistance Grants are a key source of revenue for local governments, especially for regional and rural councils;


(b) the impact of the indexation freeze in the 2014-15 budget meant that local councils missed out on $925 million in funding to provide better infrastructure and better services for our local communities—in Victoria this equated to $200 million in cuts to funding for local roads and community services;


(c) the impact of the indexation freeze was magnified in rural and regional areas where local governments have small ratepayer bases and ageing infrastructure and these councils cannot afford a repeat of the indexation freeze;


(d) cost shifting onto local governments places them under increasing pressure to deliver services and maintain assets previously provided by other tiers of government and for rural and regional councils the impact is magnified due to their limited ability to increase revenue;


(e) the two main sources of funding for councils are rates and grants and as grant income declines, councils have had to fill the revenue gap by increasing rates or reducing services;


(f) the ability of rural and regional councils to increase revenue via rates is limited due to a high proportion of 'non-rateable' land and a smaller population, and revenue raising via user charges for facilities, parking fees and development applications adopted by metropolitan councils is not an option for regional councils; and


(g) rural and regional councils often have higher costs per capita than metropolitan councils, with:


(i) older, more disadvantaged or more vulnerable populations, who require more services from councils;


(ii) larger asset bases relative to the population;


(iii) an environmental stewardship role, including responsibility for weed and pest animal management and flood mitigation infrastructure;


(iv) more dispersed populations, which increase the amount of travel needed to deliver services or which require duplicate facilities to be provided in multiple locations to meet local needs; and


(v) reduced competition among service providers and suppliers, which can increase costs for councils when purchasing goods and services; and


(2) calls on the Government to:


(a) commit to the sustainability of rural and regional councils by guaranteeing the Financial Assistance Grants will not be subject to another indexation freeze;


(b) work with the states and territories and local governments to review the funding methodology of Financial Assistance Grants so that distribution of funds supports the sustainability of rural and regional councils; and


(c) support the development of regional strategic plans with the states and territories and local governments to guide investment and avoid cost shifting and duplication.

The government is committed to reducing the social harm caused by alcohol, drug abuse and gambling in areas with high levels of welfare dependency.


The cashless debit card operates like an ordinary debit card but aims to reduce the effects of alcohol, drug and gambling abuse by both limiting the availability of cash and limiting the items that can be purchased.


The card is already operating in three sites;


Ceduna, South Australia;


East Kimberley, Western Australia; and


The Goldfields, Western Australia;


In Ceduna and East Kimberley the card has been in operation for over two years. In the Goldfields, the card is still being rolled out.


The independent evaluation into the effectiveness of the card has shown 'considerable positive impact' in communities, including:


48% of drug-takers using fewer drugs.


41% of drinkers drinking less


48% of gamblers gambling less


This is in addition to the anecdotal evidence provided in each site that has seen a direct impact on the communities.


The bill will allow the cashless debit card to be rolled out to a fourth site, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area in Queensland, from later this year. The cashless debit card will operate in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay until 30 June 2020. This will allow time to rollout the program in this area, and allow it to operate for a minimum of 12 months.


The bill updates the current limitations on the number of participants from 10,000 to 15,000, recognising the increase that would come from implementing the cashless debit card to this area. Like the current trial sites, the bill introduces provisions that allow merchants to block restricted goods at the point of sale.


For the purposes of the bill, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area has been defined as the federal electoral division of Hinkler, in line with the electoral boundaries as at 31 May 2018.


The bill seeks to have the criteria for trial participants in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay site outlined in the legislation. Those persons living in this area aged under 36 years of age, and receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance (jobseeker), parenting payment (single) or parenting payment (partnered) would be transitioned onto the cashless debit card.


It will not be rolled out to any individual on the age pension.


This would impact around 6,700 people, and represents a more targeted approach to the one taken in Ceduna in South Australia and the East Kimberley and Goldfields in Western Australia. If passed, it will be the largest of all the card trial sites.


Expansion of the cashless debit card under these criteria will allow the effectiveness of the program to be further tested and understood in the context of a larger urban population. It is also an opportunity to test the technology in a more diverse community. This area has a significantly different demographic than other sites currently operating.


The bill also specifies that for the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site welfare recipients that are not included as trial participants may not volunteer for the cashless debit card.


This will allow the government to test the impacts of the cashless debit card trial exclusively for the selected group, as has been asked for by the community.


The criteria for trial participants also sets out some exceptions where a person would not be transitioned onto the card, drawing on policy parameters used in existing sites.


This includes a provision for the secretary to exempt a person where inclusion in the trial would pose a serious risk to the person's mental, physical or emotional wellbeing.


These exemptions and discretionary powers will be used to ensure vulnerable people are not adversely affected by the trial.


The selection of the cohort in this area has occurred as a result of significant consultation with the community. This is designed to help address key social problems that local people have identified during meetings, in particular high youth unemployment, intergenerational welfare dependence and local children whose needs are not being met.


According to regional youth unemployment data from March 2018, these communities have a youth unemployment rate of 28.7 per cent, an increase of four per cent since last year. This compares to the state average of 13.4 per cent.


Bundaberg and Hervey Bay has a high level of long-term and intergenerational welfare dependency. Children born to parents who are welfare dependent are more likely to become welfare dependent themselves.


Ninety per cent of the people in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay under 30 and on Newstart or youth allowance had a parent or guardian who received income support at some point in the last 15 years.


Of that cohort, around 13 per cent had a parent or guardian who received income support at least once each year for the past 15 years.


Findings by the Australian Research Council indicate that risk factors such as attitudes to work and welfare, attitudes towards alcohol and drug consumption and family influences contribute to intergenerational welfare dependency.


The council also found evidence that young people from welfare dependent families are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol or consume illegal drugs, highlighting the relationship that welfare dependence has on a young person's outcomes in life.


On average across Australia, 46 per cent of people attending government-funded financial counselling for their problem gambling were also receiving a taxpayer-funded benefit. In the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, it is 73 per cent.


Additionally, people attending financial counselling for their problem gambling in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area are more likely to have been on their current benefit for longer than 5 years, compared to other people in Australia attending problem gambling counselling.


The cashless debit card could help to stabilise the lives of young people in the area by limiting spending on alcohol, drugs and gambling, thus improving their chances of finding employment or successfully completing education or training.


By targeting a younger cohort, we can influence positive behaviour change before welfare dependency becomes entrenched in a person's lifestyle.


We have seen that a 'spillover' benefit of the card is that it can increase motivation to find work. As part of the final evaluation report of the cashless debit card trial, we received feedback from some card participants in September 2017 that almost a quarter of people on the card are spending several hours a week looking for work. This is an increase from 11 per cent in February 2017.


As I have previously stated, the Department of Social Services has undertaken significant consultations with key stakeholders and community members. Specifically, between May and December 2017, over 188 meetings, including three community information sessions, were held across the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area.


A Community Reference Group was established in late 2017 to work through local policy and implementation issues to ensure the cashless debit card is implemented effectively in their community.


Additionally, a local shopfront will be established with staff who could link people with existing services.


Through the Community Reference Group, the department will monitor service demand to ensure the cashless debit card is complemented by appropriate supports for people as they adjust to this change.


Complementing the card will be a further investment in community services of $1 million. There are already a significant number of services in place, including 70 federally funded services across the area, which includes drug and alcohol services, financial capability services, employment and families' and children's programs.


The bill will allow the program to respond to unforeseeable circumstances, such as wide-scale power outages and natural disasters, allowing trial participants in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay to access their full payment as cash.


This measure will ensure participants and their families remain supported in the event of wide-scale emergencies.


The Bill will also allow the option of establishing a community panel in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area to allow participants in the area to apply to have access to a higher portion of unrestricted funds.


Consultations with community leaders in the area have indicated that a panel will be useful to make the trial flexible to the needs of their community.


The government has also announced a second evaluation of the cashless debit card across all three current trial sites, to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the program.


The second evaluation will use research methodologies developed independently by the University of Queensland, and draw on the baseline measurements of social conditions in the Goldfields, developed by the University of Adelaide. Findings from the second evaluation will be published in late 2019.


Should this bill pass, the government will also evaluate the card's operation in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg.


To support the cashless debit card trial, this bill will strengthen the provisions that enable merchants to block the sale of restricted goods to trial participants at the point of sale.


Merchants in trial sites will more readily be able to service participants of the program, through the option to implement product level blocking solutions, automatically blocking transactions where a participant is attempting to purchase restricted goods with the card.


In doing so, the bill also clarifies the restriction on 'cash-like' products, such as gift cards, vouchers, money orders, or digital currency, where these could be used to purchase alcohol and gambling products.


These products are included as restricted goods, as has always been the intention of the program. Clarifying this provision to include 'cash-like' products will support product-level blocking amendments, and help prevent participants from circumventing the program and spending their welfare payments on alcohol, gambling and drugs.


The cashless debit card is a world first in how it operates. The evaluation has been conducted and it has been shown to work. Consultation in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area demonstrates it needs a way to break the cycle of welfare dependency, and help people manage their income and stabilise their lives.


I ask the parliament to back this trial for Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, to provide the community a trial that they have asked for.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (10:02):  Labor does not oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. However, the circumstances which gave rise to it coming before the parliament do require further scrutiny.


I would say by way of commencement that there is something very ominous about the fact that a bill which is about communications legislation, which is about providing a fund to assist regional and small publishers, which has the title Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund and which is brought into this House by the government cannot attract a single member from the government to speak in favour of it. Not one single government member, apart from the minister who introduced this bill in the House, has thought that this bill was important enough for them to come into the parliament and speak in favour of it. Perhaps what I'll go through, which explains some of the circumstances which brought this bill before the House, explains why there is not one government MP, and particularly not one government MP from a regional electorate, who's willing to speak in favour of the establishment of a Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund.


The context is everything. In October last year, the government was determined to remove the two out-of-three rule, which prohibited a person owning all three licences—television, radio and newspaper—in a single radio broadcasting area or in a single market. Labor opposed this proposition. The government had been pushing it for many years. The industry, particularly the television industry, had been advocating very strenuously in favour of it. Labor opposed it on public interest grounds. Quite simply, we were concerned that giving three green lights to media companies to merge would lead to fewer voices, less diversity and certainly fewer jobs in the television broadcasting industry, in the print publishing industry and in radio broadcasting. In fact, if, as many tried to argue, these mergers were going to create more jobs, it would be the first time in the history of the industry that two companies merging into one actually created more jobs. We know that this has never occurred.


The government was determined to do it, but they did not have the numbers. They didn't have the numbers to get the legislation through the Senate. So what we saw over the course of several months were more deals being done than at a blackjack table at Star Casino on a Saturday night. There was One Nation, that was willing to dust off its culture wars against the ABC—and there are always many members in the coalition parties who are willing to jump in on this one—and the result of that was the competitive neutrality review, which is nothing more than an attempt to continue the culture wars against the ABC. Why, I do not know, because if you cripple the ABC, you'll cripple the capacity of regional storytelling in this country. There is not a publisher or broadcaster in the country that has a greater commitment to rural and regional reporting than the ABC. But that is the wisdom of One Nation, and many of those opposite.


Of course, there were plans to give special tax exemptions. They were floated and sunk almost as quickly as they were raised. But then there was the Nick Xenophon Team, once a member of the other place, spectacularly imploding after the recent South Australian elections. They managed to strike a deal with the government which enabled the last bulwark against the merger of these large television entities with radio and print entities being removed. The deal that they did concluded in a fund being established, which is now the subject of this legislation, with some $50 million worth of funds to be set aside—and I'll go to the details of this in a moment—together with $8 million being set aside to create 200 short-term cadetships and another $2.4 million over three years to facilitate the establishment of 60 regional journalism scholarships.


Now, of course, Labor supports small publishers; of course, Labor supports more regional journalists; and, of course, Labor supports initiatives which will see more cadets entering the industry. But we are not convinced about the measures that are a part of what many are calling—and I happen to agree—a dirty deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to enable the largest media deregulation initiative to pass through this parliament in decades to occur. We do not think they were worth the price.


There's another important point about the context of the bills before the House, and that goes to what can only be described as the collapse of the traditional business model that has supported what we now refer to as 'traditional' media and the traditional media outlets in this country—and, in fact, right around the world. The first onset of the collapse of this business model occurred with the print media. Print media has operated in this country for close to 200 years under a pretty unsophisticated business model. You bolt a series of news stories onto the back of a big book of advertising and you sell that to your consumers. You would remember the times, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon: on a Saturday there would be three thuds on your front lawn, which were the Saturday edition of The Sydney Morning Herald being delivered. Two of those thuds were classified advertising. It now arrives with more of a pat than a thud, in one roll. The reason for that is the collapse of the classified advertising business as it once was. That has come through online classifieds. Quite frankly, most of the print media either didn't see this happening or were not nimble enough in their response to it.


Of course, TV was second. What we are seeing is a drift of eyeballs from big screens to small screens. Quite simply, people's viewing habits are changing. It is now more the case that, if you are under the age of 20, it's more likely that you are going to be doing your media consumption on an iPhone, an iPad or an Android device than on the big box in the corner of your lounge room. And with eyeballs goes the advertising. Of course, this didn't happen alone. You saw a recycling or a pinching of content by other online players, whether that be Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and others, but this has put enormous pressure on the traditional revenues of the traditional TV businesses in this country. 


Radio, I have to say, which many were predicting was going to collapse, has seen itself being much more resilient. Perhaps that's because it's always on. You're able to listen to the radio while doing several other things, and it has been more local and more nimble, which has enabled it to persevere and succeed when many of its traditional rivals were collapsing. 


Of course, we have seen jobs being lost and journalists' jobs being lost in great numbers. Over the last five years alone, over 3,000 full-time, paid journalist jobs have been lost from the industry. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates that nearly one-quarter of all working journalists have lost their jobs, as we've seen these changes—technological, economic and business model changes—work their way through the industry. 


So, these three things—the determination of the government to agree to remove the protections against further media mergers within the TV, radio and print media market; the fact that they didn't have the numbers, and they had to do a dirty deal with the Nick Xenophon Team and the crossbenchers; and the fact that we are seeing what many describe as a collapse in the traditional business models which have supported media in this country—are the context which brings this bill before the House. 


The bill itself, as I've described in outline form, will establish a regional and small business innovation fund. It's part of a package, which also includes the establishment of a one-off funding arrangement for the establishment of cadets, and a one-off funding arrangement which will support scholarships. The fund will enable three tranches of grants, of $16.7 million each, over the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 and 2020-21. The grants will be administered at arms-length from government. However, government has set the rules about who is and who isn't eligible for this, and the other aspects of the deal that was done. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, will be the independent statutory body which administers the distribution of the grants. They'll be contestable. Presumably the instruments which will be necessary to advertise the commencement of this fund will be made public soon after the passage of these bills through both houses.


We support the legislation. We are sceptical about its origins, and we are also sceptical about its capacity to make a demonstrable difference to the crisis which media is facing around the country. You would have thought, at a time where media outlets around the country, many of whom, particularly in the print media, are closing down or consolidating or reducing staff within newsrooms, that the government would take a view about the one media outlet that it, in and of itself, funds; that it would be doing more to support that media outlet to ensure that that media outlet, particularly in rural and regional Australia, was able to continue to tell stories about rural and regional Australia, and to ensure that those people are represented in the national narrative. 


But, sadly, in the budget that was introduced not three weeks ago we see the very opposite of that. We see the government taking up the cudgels in the cultural war against the ABC, with $84 million worth of cuts to the ABC's triennial funding. This is nothing more than the government attacking the institution because it disagrees with some of the stories that the ABC runs. Well, I disagree with many of the stories that the ABC runs as well. I don't like it when I'm interviewed by the ABC and they give me a hard time and they put the blowtorch on the soles of my feet and take me to places that I may not necessarily like. But I understand that that's their job. I understand it is the job of a fiercely independent national broadcaster, with first-class journalists, to put the people who come to this place to the test, and people who are in government or aspire to form government to the test, to ensure that the fourth estate actually does its job—that it does its job of keeping the government and the elected representatives to account. For a government to punish a national broadcaster because it disagrees with its editorial content is nothing more than antidemocratic. 


On budget night the cheers were audible throughout the chamber when the Treasurer announced his $84 million worth of budget cuts to the ABC. But I guarantee you this: if there are job cuts from the ABC in those very same members' electorates, they will be the first to complain. You don't have to take my word for it. There's a by-election going on in Braddon in Tasmania as we speak. And what was the first commitment that the Liberal candidate in that by-election, one Brett Whiteley—not the oil painter—gave to his putative voters? It was, 'My government's $84 million worth of budget cuts will not fall on the ABC's studio in Burnie.' There is a brave tiger; there is somebody out there championing the government's budget. Yes, 'Let those budget cuts fall on every other electorate in the country, but not on mine.' (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-30,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (10:17):  I thank the member for Whitlam for his great contribution and for the great work that he does in this area. Like the member for Whitlam, I rise to put Labor's position with regard to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017 on the record today in light of the many deals that were done—in fact, so many dirty deals, I think the preceding speaker, the member for Whitlam, mentioned—by this coalition government. Just this week, we saw Senator Hanson's secret deal to secure her support to give $80 billion to big business, multinationals and the big banks. I think we've got the fourth iteration of that deal at the moment. They do say that sausages are like sausage making: it's horrible when you actually see the process. But when we examine the input of the 'supreme president for life', Senator Hanson, the details are truly 'offal'. 


However, this particular deal, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, exists only because of a shoddy, last-minute backroom deal between the Turnbull LNP government and the Nick Xenophon political party, who now refer to themselves as Centre Alliance—an optimistic moniker at best. I don't think they're yet to earn either of those titles. So this fund is the result of a heavily compromised trade-off. The fund didn't come about because the Turnbull LNP government is genuinely committed to promoting public interest journalism—far from it. It came about to grease the path for the government's repeal of the two-out-of-three media control rule. 


Labor will not oppose this bill, but we maintain that it does precious little to fill the void left by the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. This rule acted as a public interest safeguard by stopping any one voice in the media landscape from becoming too dominant. It promoted diversity and competition between different voices. A 'bulwalk against authoritarianism' is how I've always seen this media rule operating. The two-our-of-three rule ensured that no individual or company controlled more than two out of three regulated media platforms—commercial television, commercial radio or associated newspapers—in the same licence area. In essence, it was to preserve a diversity of opinion on our airwaves, and it stimulated alternative viewpoints. 


Over the six months that have passed since the Turnbull government abolished the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, cross-media merges have begun as a result. How many have actually come through? Zero. The milestone makes a mockery of communication minister Senator Fifield's alarmist urgings that parliament must act on media reforms to protect Australian jobs and to give industry a fighting chance and of his dire predictions of the failure of Australian media organisations. Senator Fifield even went so far as to suggest that Labor's opposition to the repeal was crippling the industry and limiting the options for organisations like Channel Ten. How wrong he was. Just on a sidenote, I commend Channel Ten for their stance on axing the TV show Roseanne in light of her offensive comments. They were out of the blocks quickly. Well done, Channel Ten. 


Back to this legislation: development since that time clearly demonstrates just how captured by the top end of the sector the Turnbull government was, and how out of touch it clearly remains. The CBS acquisition of Channel Ten occurred thanks to the two-out-of-three rule. So, as it was actually working as designed and benefitting the sector, the geniuses in the coalition decided that they'd best get rid of the rule. So, well done! It is so dangerous without it. The repeal of this rule is a threat to informed democratic debate, as it allows a single person or organisation to control how local news is reported. This potentially gives one person a lot of power in a market where big media players are already wielding a great deal of power. 


The Australian media landscape is one of the most concentrated in the world, with an extremely small number of firms producing content that reaches the vast majority of Australians. According to market research from IBISWorld from June 2016, the industry's four largest players were estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of industry revenue since 2015-16. These players included News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Seven West Media and APN News & Media. Obviously, we all know the role of our national broadcaster, the long-trusted, ever-professional ABC. In the budget, the ABC is suffering yet another cut of $84 million. That's on top of the $254 million cut in that horror 2014 budget, after the then Liberal Leader of the Opposition had said before the election that there will be no cuts to the ABC. As anyone who understands the ABC would know, there was no fat to be cut in 2014. But, after those two big cuts of $84 million and $254 million, we're not slicing off any fat; we're now slicing off muscle and making our national broadcaster less affective. 


Anyway, back to this fund: this one-off fund will dispense $50 million of taxpayer funds over three years before it runs out. What then? The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, or MEAA, has expressed concern that these short-term programs, without adequate follow-up, may serve only to temporarily boost the numbers and scope of journalism and journalists. MEAA argues that the benefits of the program will be exhausted shortly after the 2020-21 financial year, unless consideration is given to sustaining these programs during their rollout. 


Labor believes it is imperative that taxpayer support for journalism be ideology-free. However, there is considerable scope for government to influence the way the funding is distributed. The government already appears to be influencing the recipients of this funding through the inclusion of the foreign parent company veto. The foreign parent company veto was likely included with the aim of preventing The GuardianAustraliafrom receiving funding from this grant, given they have selectively waived the veto for other media groups. TheGuardian is a little progressive, but any progressive outfit that provides high-quality journalism on the digital platforms should be cultivated, surely. 


ACMA will also have considerable leeway to decide the purposes for which funding will be allocated. The legislation does not require that an advisory committee be set up to advise ACMA. This is all subject to the minister's discretion. The whims and whimsies of the minister are supreme, as there are no checks and balances on his decision. How is the foreign parent company veto being used? A range of publishers like The Guardian, BuzzFeed and The New Daily have been excluded from the fund due to having a foreign parent company. Publishers affiliated with a superannuation fund are also excluded from accessing the fund. So, while The Guardian Australia has a foreign parent company, its local business, supporting Australian journalism and publishing jobs, depends on maintaining a viable Australian revenue model. The Guardian Australia has created 80 jobs for Australians over the last few years. The Guardian argues that is every dollar of revenue it earns in Australia is invested in Australian journalism, given they have no shareholders or proprietors to pay. If the package were really intended to boost Australian journalism, why was The Guardian excluded? The Guardian argues that this legislation disadvantages a fast-growing source of Australian news and jobs for Australian journalists, when the whole purpose of the fund is to encourage both these things—a pretty fair point, if you ask me.


How does the Turnbull government justify giving $30 million to Fox Sports but cutting Australian content creators like The Guardian Australia out of the fund? Let's just think: both are Australian companies with a foreign based parent company. It sounds a bit fishy to me; in fact it stinks. They say that a fish rots from the head first. Fox Sports, owned by News Corporation, another company with a foreign parent, was granted $30 million in the 2017 federal budget with the vague purpose of covering women's sports and niche sports. This grant was dodgy. It was provided without conditions or any transparent process. I love sport. I love netball. I love all the sorts of sports they're talking about, but last time I checked we had a public broadcaster or two funded to perform exactly this role. Don't get me wrong: broadcasting and supporting women's sport is a good use of money. Young girls can't be what they can't see—perhaps an important message for all the people on that side of the House that talk about quotas! If that were the endeavour, surely our trusted public broadcasters ABC or SBS would have been better placed to host that content. $30 million given to them to bring in those niche sports and transmit them would have gone a long way with people that know how to do it.


Like The Guardian and other outlets, publicly owned media are ineligible for funding under this measure despite the government funding cuts they have been subjected to in recent years. As I said, the budget handed down by Treasurer Morrison and Prime Minister Turnbull cuts $84 million from the ABC on top of the $254 million the LNP have already cut since the 2013 election. The sneaky way the government cut funding from the ABC, hidden in the fine print of the budget papers, was to freeze the indexation of ABC's operational funding, amounting to a cut of $83.7 million. When the ABC's core content costs are rising faster than inflation, that is an cut in absolute terms. You can't argue otherwise. They articulated that it's to ensure the ABC continues to find back-office efficiencies. I think One Nation is pursuing the fact that they might drink coffee sometimes on budget mornings out in front of Parliament House, but I'm sure there's not $83.7 million worth of coffee being consumed at the ABC. The government should know that they can't squeeze blood from a stone.


The ABC itself says it's out of fat to cut, and that it's cutting into muscle. I fear the ABC will suffer most where? In the bush. The old Nationals are signing off on cutting bush broadcasting services. Estimates last week heard that the ABC have shed 1,012 jobs since 2014, cut under the watch of Prime Minister Turnbull and Prime Minister Abbott. They know full well that this cut they are inflicting on the ABC means cuts to jobs, content and services at the ABC, particularly in the bush. The Liberals and Nationals complain that the ABC isn't doing enough news coverage, yet these hypocritical politicians have left a $43 million hole in funding for ABC news and current affairs. The ABC said the impact of the cuts cannot be absorbed by efficiency measures alone, because the ABC has already achieved significant productivity gains in response to past budget cuts.


The Liberal Party claims their budget is about investing to create more jobs every day and to support essential services, yet these cuts to the ABC will inevitably lead to job losses and a reduction in the quality or breadth of service, especially damaging for those in the bush, the rural and remote parts of Australia that are too sparsely populated to sustain commercial media. Redundancies at the ABC are on the horizon as a result of the government's cuts to the ABC in the recent budget, and the reduction in ABC services that Australians value will be the consequence of the budget delivered by the Treasurer a few weeks ago. We'll have less news and fewer jobs as a result of these attacks on the ABC.


Labor will fight these fresh cuts, just as we did last year. In government, Labor gave additional funding to set up the ABC children's channel, ABC News 24 and ABC online. Now, how's that for promoting local public interest journalism? Publicly funded broadcasters like the ABC and SBS provide an important source of public interest journalism, which is critical for a robust democracy. It is why the top floor of this building, on the Senate side, is devoted to the fourth estate. I don't think any other parliament in the world has the fourth estate inside the building, sitting alongside the lawmakers, because they serve such a crucial role. They are critical. However, government funding cuts mean the capacity of publicly funded broadcasters to produce high-quality investigative content has been smashed. The Indigenous Remote Communications Association objects to the exclusion of Indigenous licenced community broadcasters from eligibility for funding from the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. The IRCA argued that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander audiences utilised broadcasting services more than print or online services for their news. Why? It's because many of them are in rural and remote areas.


How is it fair that large companies like News Corp can the $10.4 million set aside for scholarships and cadetships? Why are taxpayers' funds being used for cadetship and scholarship programs at large commercial media organisations? I'm a strong believer in training and skills development, but I have to ask: what's the point of cadetship and scholarship programs in a declining market for journalism jobs? Does the industry need to train more journalists when there are not enough jobs for existing journalists? These are just a couple of questions when we look at the repeal of two-out-of-three rule and what the impacts are. Job prospects for Australian journalists are growing fewer by the day. At least 2,500 journalism jobs have disappeared in Australia over the past six years, according to MEAA. Wouldn't funds be better spent creating long-term employment opportunities in journalism? Instead, the government has slashed $84 million in funding to the ABC.


Another question is: do regional media companies have the reliable and affordable broadband they need to enable them to grow their businesses and create more jobs in the digital age? What also would be of great help in rural and regional areas would be lobbying for decent broadband. Unfortunately, the deal with Centre Alliance was not the only dirty deal done by this government to secure support for its broadcasting bill last year. Even worse than their deal with Centre Alliance was their deal with One Nation to change the ABC's charter. It is a deal clearly that is aimed at undermining the integrity of the ABC. As one of the One Nation senators has admitted publicly, this deal is absolutely a platform for fringe groups such as anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and even more dangerous right-wing groups.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation) (10:32):  I thank colleagues who have contributed to the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. The bill will implement an important component of the government's media reform package. The government is committed to assisting small and regional publishers through a time when the media landscape is in a state of flux. Traditional revenue models have been fractured, and media organisations must adapt to move with their audiences. For smaller and regional publications, this is even more challenging. In this disrupted environment, access to locally relevant, factual journalism remains vital to develop and maintain strong communities. The government's Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund recognises this need. The $50 million will provide grants over three years to eligible media organisations for projects that enable new business models and practices. By doing so the government will assist these publishers to put themselves on a sustainable commercial footing.


I note that industry is supportive of this bill and that submissions received during the inquiry recognised the merit of developing measures to support Australian civic journalism as well as the particular need to support civic journalism in regional areas. The bill will establish the legislative framework to establish the operation of the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. The government looks forward to proceeding with a call for applications so that ACMA can begin assessing applications and distributing these much-needed funds to regional and small publishers. I therefore commend the bill to the chamber.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (10:02):  Labor does not oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. However, the circumstances which gave rise to it coming before the parliament do require further scrutiny.


I would say by way of commencement that there is something very ominous about the fact that a bill which is about communications legislation, which is about providing a fund to assist regional and small publishers, which has the title Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund and which is brought into this House by the government cannot attract a single member from the government to speak in favour of it. Not one single government member, apart from the minister who introduced this bill in the House, has thought that this bill was important enough for them to come into the parliament and speak in favour of it. Perhaps what I'll go through, which explains some of the circumstances which brought this bill before the House, explains why there is not one government MP, and particularly not one government MP from a regional electorate, who's willing to speak in favour of the establishment of a Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund.


The context is everything. In October last year, the government was determined to remove the two out-of-three rule, which prohibited a person owning all three licences—television, radio and newspaper—in a single radio broadcasting area or in a single market. Labor opposed this proposition. The government had been pushing it for many years. The industry, particularly the television industry, had been advocating very strenuously in favour of it. Labor opposed it on public interest grounds. Quite simply, we were concerned that giving three green lights to media companies to merge would lead to fewer voices, less diversity and certainly fewer jobs in the television broadcasting industry, in the print publishing industry and in radio broadcasting. In fact, if, as many tried to argue, these mergers were going to create more jobs, it would be the first time in the history of the industry that two companies merging into one actually created more jobs. We know that this has never occurred.


The government was determined to do it, but they did not have the numbers. They didn't have the numbers to get the legislation through the Senate. So what we saw over the course of several months were more deals being done than at a blackjack table at Star Casino on a Saturday night. There was One Nation, that was willing to dust off its culture wars against the ABC—and there are always many members in the coalition parties who are willing to jump in on this one—and the result of that was the competitive neutrality review, which is nothing more than an attempt to continue the culture wars against the ABC. Why, I do not know, because if you cripple the ABC, you'll cripple the capacity of regional storytelling in this country. There is not a publisher or broadcaster in the country that has a greater commitment to rural and regional reporting than the ABC. But that is the wisdom of One Nation, and many of those opposite.


Of course, there were plans to give special tax exemptions. They were floated and sunk almost as quickly as they were raised. But then there was the Nick Xenophon Team, once a member of the other place, spectacularly imploding after the recent South Australian elections. They managed to strike a deal with the government which enabled the last bulwark against the merger of these large television entities with radio and print entities being removed. The deal that they did concluded in a fund being established, which is now the subject of this legislation, with some $50 million worth of funds to be set aside—and I'll go to the details of this in a moment—together with $8 million being set aside to create 200 short-term cadetships and another $2.4 million over three years to facilitate the establishment of 60 regional journalism scholarships.


Now, of course, Labor supports small publishers; of course, Labor supports more regional journalists; and, of course, Labor supports initiatives which will see more cadets entering the industry. But we are not convinced about the measures that are a part of what many are calling—and I happen to agree—a dirty deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to enable the largest media deregulation initiative to pass through this parliament in decades to occur. We do not think they were worth the price.


There's another important point about the context of the bills before the House, and that goes to what can only be described as the collapse of the traditional business model that has supported what we now refer to as 'traditional' media and the traditional media outlets in this country—and, in fact, right around the world. The first onset of the collapse of this business model occurred with the print media. Print media has operated in this country for close to 200 years under a pretty unsophisticated business model. You bolt a series of news stories onto the back of a big book of advertising and you sell that to your consumers. You would remember the times, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon: on a Saturday there would be three thuds on your front lawn, which were the Saturday edition of The Sydney Morning Herald being delivered. Two of those thuds were classified advertising. It now arrives with more of a pat than a thud, in one roll. The reason for that is the collapse of the classified advertising business as it once was. That has come through online classifieds. Quite frankly, most of the print media either didn't see this happening or were not nimble enough in their response to it.


Of course, TV was second. What we are seeing is a drift of eyeballs from big screens to small screens. Quite simply, people's viewing habits are changing. It is now more the case that, if you are under the age of 20, it's more likely that you are going to be doing your media consumption on an iPhone, an iPad or an Android device than on the big box in the corner of your lounge room. And with eyeballs goes the advertising. Of course, this didn't happen alone. You saw a recycling or a pinching of content by other online players, whether that be Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and others, but this has put enormous pressure on the traditional revenues of the traditional TV businesses in this country. 


Radio, I have to say, which many were predicting was going to collapse, has seen itself being much more resilient. Perhaps that's because it's always on. You're able to listen to the radio while doing several other things, and it has been more local and more nimble, which has enabled it to persevere and succeed when many of its traditional rivals were collapsing. 


Of course, we have seen jobs being lost and journalists' jobs being lost in great numbers. Over the last five years alone, over 3,000 full-time, paid journalist jobs have been lost from the industry. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates that nearly one-quarter of all working journalists have lost their jobs, as we've seen these changes—technological, economic and business model changes—work their way through the industry. 


So, these three things—the determination of the government to agree to remove the protections against further media mergers within the TV, radio and print media market; the fact that they didn't have the numbers, and they had to do a dirty deal with the Nick Xenophon Team and the crossbenchers; and the fact that we are seeing what many describe as a collapse in the traditional business models which have supported media in this country—are the context which brings this bill before the House. 


The bill itself, as I've described in outline form, will establish a regional and small business innovation fund. It's part of a package, which also includes the establishment of a one-off funding arrangement for the establishment of cadets, and a one-off funding arrangement which will support scholarships. The fund will enable three tranches of grants, of $16.7 million each, over the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 and 2020-21. The grants will be administered at arms-length from government. However, government has set the rules about who is and who isn't eligible for this, and the other aspects of the deal that was done. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, will be the independent statutory body which administers the distribution of the grants. They'll be contestable. Presumably the instruments which will be necessary to advertise the commencement of this fund will be made public soon after the passage of these bills through both houses.


We support the legislation. We are sceptical about its origins, and we are also sceptical about its capacity to make a demonstrable difference to the crisis which media is facing around the country. You would have thought, at a time where media outlets around the country, many of whom, particularly in the print media, are closing down or consolidating or reducing staff within newsrooms, that the government would take a view about the one media outlet that it, in and of itself, funds; that it would be doing more to support that media outlet to ensure that that media outlet, particularly in rural and regional Australia, was able to continue to tell stories about rural and regional Australia, and to ensure that those people are represented in the national narrative. 


But, sadly, in the budget that was introduced not three weeks ago we see the very opposite of that. We see the government taking up the cudgels in the cultural war against the ABC, with $84 million worth of cuts to the ABC's triennial funding. This is nothing more than the government attacking the institution because it disagrees with some of the stories that the ABC runs. Well, I disagree with many of the stories that the ABC runs as well. I don't like it when I'm interviewed by the ABC and they give me a hard time and they put the blowtorch on the soles of my feet and take me to places that I may not necessarily like. But I understand that that's their job. I understand it is the job of a fiercely independent national broadcaster, with first-class journalists, to put the people who come to this place to the test, and people who are in government or aspire to form government to the test, to ensure that the fourth estate actually does its job—that it does its job of keeping the government and the elected representatives to account. For a government to punish a national broadcaster because it disagrees with its editorial content is nothing more than antidemocratic. 


On budget night the cheers were audible throughout the chamber when the Treasurer announced his $84 million worth of budget cuts to the ABC. But I guarantee you this: if there are job cuts from the ABC in those very same members' electorates, they will be the first to complain. You don't have to take my word for it. There's a by-election going on in Braddon in Tasmania as we speak. And what was the first commitment that the Liberal candidate in that by-election, one Brett Whiteley—not the oil painter—gave to his putative voters? It was, 'My government's $84 million worth of budget cuts will not fall on the ABC's studio in Burnie.' There is a brave tiger; there is somebody out there championing the government's budget. Yes, 'Let those budget cuts fall on every other electorate in the country, but not on mine.' (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-30,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (10:17):  I thank the member for Whitlam for his great contribution and for the great work that he does in this area. Like the member for Whitlam, I rise to put Labor's position with regard to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017 on the record today in light of the many deals that were done—in fact, so many dirty deals, I think the preceding speaker, the member for Whitlam, mentioned—by this coalition government. Just this week, we saw Senator Hanson's secret deal to secure her support to give $80 billion to big business, multinationals and the big banks. I think we've got the fourth iteration of that deal at the moment. They do say that sausages are like sausage making: it's horrible when you actually see the process. But when we examine the input of the 'supreme president for life', Senator Hanson, the details are truly 'offal'. 


However, this particular deal, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, exists only because of a shoddy, last-minute backroom deal between the Turnbull LNP government and the Nick Xenophon political party, who now refer to themselves as Centre Alliance—an optimistic moniker at best. I don't think they're yet to earn either of those titles. So this fund is the result of a heavily compromised trade-off. The fund didn't come about because the Turnbull LNP government is genuinely committed to promoting public interest journalism—far from it. It came about to grease the path for the government's repeal of the two-out-of-three media control rule. 


Labor will not oppose this bill, but we maintain that it does precious little to fill the void left by the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. This rule acted as a public interest safeguard by stopping any one voice in the media landscape from becoming too dominant. It promoted diversity and competition between different voices. A 'bulwalk against authoritarianism' is how I've always seen this media rule operating. The two-our-of-three rule ensured that no individual or company controlled more than two out of three regulated media platforms—commercial television, commercial radio or associated newspapers—in the same licence area. In essence, it was to preserve a diversity of opinion on our airwaves, and it stimulated alternative viewpoints. 


Over the six months that have passed since the Turnbull government abolished the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, cross-media merges have begun as a result. How many have actually come through? Zero. The milestone makes a mockery of communication minister Senator Fifield's alarmist urgings that parliament must act on media reforms to protect Australian jobs and to give industry a fighting chance and of his dire predictions of the failure of Australian media organisations. Senator Fifield even went so far as to suggest that Labor's opposition to the repeal was crippling the industry and limiting the options for organisations like Channel Ten. How wrong he was. Just on a sidenote, I commend Channel Ten for their stance on axing the TV show Roseanne in light of her offensive comments. They were out of the blocks quickly. Well done, Channel Ten. 


Back to this legislation: development since that time clearly demonstrates just how captured by the top end of the sector the Turnbull government was, and how out of touch it clearly remains. The CBS acquisition of Channel Ten occurred thanks to the two-out-of-three rule. So, as it was actually working as designed and benefitting the sector, the geniuses in the coalition decided that they'd best get rid of the rule. So, well done! It is so dangerous without it. The repeal of this rule is a threat to informed democratic debate, as it allows a single person or organisation to control how local news is reported. This potentially gives one person a lot of power in a market where big media players are already wielding a great deal of power. 


The Australian media landscape is one of the most concentrated in the world, with an extremely small number of firms producing content that reaches the vast majority of Australians. According to market research from IBISWorld from June 2016, the industry's four largest players were estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of industry revenue since 2015-16. These players included News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Seven West Media and APN News & Media. Obviously, we all know the role of our national broadcaster, the long-trusted, ever-professional ABC. In the budget, the ABC is suffering yet another cut of $84 million. That's on top of the $254 million cut in that horror 2014 budget, after the then Liberal Leader of the Opposition had said before the election that there will be no cuts to the ABC. As anyone who understands the ABC would know, there was no fat to be cut in 2014. But, after those two big cuts of $84 million and $254 million, we're not slicing off any fat; we're now slicing off muscle and making our national broadcaster less affective. 


Anyway, back to this fund: this one-off fund will dispense $50 million of taxpayer funds over three years before it runs out. What then? The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, or MEAA, has expressed concern that these short-term programs, without adequate follow-up, may serve only to temporarily boost the numbers and scope of journalism and journalists. MEAA argues that the benefits of the program will be exhausted shortly after the 2020-21 financial year, unless consideration is given to sustaining these programs during their rollout. 


Labor believes it is imperative that taxpayer support for journalism be ideology-free. However, there is considerable scope for government to influence the way the funding is distributed. The government already appears to be influencing the recipients of this funding through the inclusion of the foreign parent company veto. The foreign parent company veto was likely included with the aim of preventing The GuardianAustraliafrom receiving funding from this grant, given they have selectively waived the veto for other media groups. TheGuardian is a little progressive, but any progressive outfit that provides high-quality journalism on the digital platforms should be cultivated, surely. 


ACMA will also have considerable leeway to decide the purposes for which funding will be allocated. The legislation does not require that an advisory committee be set up to advise ACMA. This is all subject to the minister's discretion. The whims and whimsies of the minister are supreme, as there are no checks and balances on his decision. How is the foreign parent company veto being used? A range of publishers like The Guardian, BuzzFeed and The New Daily have been excluded from the fund due to having a foreign parent company. Publishers affiliated with a superannuation fund are also excluded from accessing the fund. So, while The Guardian Australia has a foreign parent company, its local business, supporting Australian journalism and publishing jobs, depends on maintaining a viable Australian revenue model. The Guardian Australia has created 80 jobs for Australians over the last few years. The Guardian argues that is every dollar of revenue it earns in Australia is invested in Australian journalism, given they have no shareholders or proprietors to pay. If the package were really intended to boost Australian journalism, why was The Guardian excluded? The Guardian argues that this legislation disadvantages a fast-growing source of Australian news and jobs for Australian journalists, when the whole purpose of the fund is to encourage both these things—a pretty fair point, if you ask me.


How does the Turnbull government justify giving $30 million to Fox Sports but cutting Australian content creators like The Guardian Australia out of the fund? Let's just think: both are Australian companies with a foreign based parent company. It sounds a bit fishy to me; in fact it stinks. They say that a fish rots from the head first. Fox Sports, owned by News Corporation, another company with a foreign parent, was granted $30 million in the 2017 federal budget with the vague purpose of covering women's sports and niche sports. This grant was dodgy. It was provided without conditions or any transparent process. I love sport. I love netball. I love all the sorts of sports they're talking about, but last time I checked we had a public broadcaster or two funded to perform exactly this role. Don't get me wrong: broadcasting and supporting women's sport is a good use of money. Young girls can't be what they can't see—perhaps an important message for all the people on that side of the House that talk about quotas! If that were the endeavour, surely our trusted public broadcasters ABC or SBS would have been better placed to host that content. $30 million given to them to bring in those niche sports and transmit them would have gone a long way with people that know how to do it.


Like The Guardian and other outlets, publicly owned media are ineligible for funding under this measure despite the government funding cuts they have been subjected to in recent years. As I said, the budget handed down by Treasurer Morrison and Prime Minister Turnbull cuts $84 million from the ABC on top of the $254 million the LNP have already cut since the 2013 election. The sneaky way the government cut funding from the ABC, hidden in the fine print of the budget papers, was to freeze the indexation of ABC's operational funding, amounting to a cut of $83.7 million. When the ABC's core content costs are rising faster than inflation, that is an cut in absolute terms. You can't argue otherwise. They articulated that it's to ensure the ABC continues to find back-office efficiencies. I think One Nation is pursuing the fact that they might drink coffee sometimes on budget mornings out in front of Parliament House, but I'm sure there's not $83.7 million worth of coffee being consumed at the ABC. The government should know that they can't squeeze blood from a stone.


The ABC itself says it's out of fat to cut, and that it's cutting into muscle. I fear the ABC will suffer most where? In the bush. The old Nationals are signing off on cutting bush broadcasting services. Estimates last week heard that the ABC have shed 1,012 jobs since 2014, cut under the watch of Prime Minister Turnbull and Prime Minister Abbott. They know full well that this cut they are inflicting on the ABC means cuts to jobs, content and services at the ABC, particularly in the bush. The Liberals and Nationals complain that the ABC isn't doing enough news coverage, yet these hypocritical politicians have left a $43 million hole in funding for ABC news and current affairs. The ABC said the impact of the cuts cannot be absorbed by efficiency measures alone, because the ABC has already achieved significant productivity gains in response to past budget cuts.


The Liberal Party claims their budget is about investing to create more jobs every day and to support essential services, yet these cuts to the ABC will inevitably lead to job losses and a reduction in the quality or breadth of service, especially damaging for those in the bush, the rural and remote parts of Australia that are too sparsely populated to sustain commercial media. Redundancies at the ABC are on the horizon as a result of the government's cuts to the ABC in the recent budget, and the reduction in ABC services that Australians value will be the consequence of the budget delivered by the Treasurer a few weeks ago. We'll have less news and fewer jobs as a result of these attacks on the ABC.


Labor will fight these fresh cuts, just as we did last year. In government, Labor gave additional funding to set up the ABC children's channel, ABC News 24 and ABC online. Now, how's that for promoting local public interest journalism? Publicly funded broadcasters like the ABC and SBS provide an important source of public interest journalism, which is critical for a robust democracy. It is why the top floor of this building, on the Senate side, is devoted to the fourth estate. I don't think any other parliament in the world has the fourth estate inside the building, sitting alongside the lawmakers, because they serve such a crucial role. They are critical. However, government funding cuts mean the capacity of publicly funded broadcasters to produce high-quality investigative content has been smashed. The Indigenous Remote Communications Association objects to the exclusion of Indigenous licenced community broadcasters from eligibility for funding from the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. The IRCA argued that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander audiences utilised broadcasting services more than print or online services for their news. Why? It's because many of them are in rural and remote areas.


How is it fair that large companies like News Corp can the $10.4 million set aside for scholarships and cadetships? Why are taxpayers' funds being used for cadetship and scholarship programs at large commercial media organisations? I'm a strong believer in training and skills development, but I have to ask: what's the point of cadetship and scholarship programs in a declining market for journalism jobs? Does the industry need to train more journalists when there are not enough jobs for existing journalists? These are just a couple of questions when we look at the repeal of two-out-of-three rule and what the impacts are. Job prospects for Australian journalists are growing fewer by the day. At least 2,500 journalism jobs have disappeared in Australia over the past six years, according to MEAA. Wouldn't funds be better spent creating long-term employment opportunities in journalism? Instead, the government has slashed $84 million in funding to the ABC.


Another question is: do regional media companies have the reliable and affordable broadband they need to enable them to grow their businesses and create more jobs in the digital age? What also would be of great help in rural and regional areas would be lobbying for decent broadband. Unfortunately, the deal with Centre Alliance was not the only dirty deal done by this government to secure support for its broadcasting bill last year. Even worse than their deal with Centre Alliance was their deal with One Nation to change the ABC's charter. It is a deal clearly that is aimed at undermining the integrity of the ABC.

This is Leticia's voice. These are her words:


I am 9 years old and I love cats and big cats. I drew the pictures myself.


One of nature's great predators, tigers, are feared and admired in equal measure. But a long history of persecution has brought them to the brink of extinction. Many continue to be shot or trapped every year out of fear or greed.


The unusual cousin of the big cats is named for the gorgeous markings on its coat. It is among the most arboreal cats in the world and its agility when moving around in the woodlands and forests of southern Asia is second to none.


We must try and protect them so they don't get killed.


Thank you, Leticia.


Thank you, Leticia, for saying so clearly what so many young people feel: we must protect them so they don't get killed. Whether it's tigers, the clouded leopard or our own miniature possums or gliders, all endangered because of land clearing and climate change, her words ring absolutely true. We must try and protect them so they don't get killed—from nine-year-old Leticia.

So a reasonable person, observing the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to prove the payment was authorised and the determination of the union to stop the payment being investigated, could only assume—

 (Denison) (14:16):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, Tasmanians are anxious right now about the GST and whether or not the formula will be changed to our disadvantage. This is a separate matter from your Braddon by-election promise that Tasmania will not see its dollar amount of GST reduced. When will the government respond to the final report of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the GST and, in particular, make clear the government's intention regarding the formula? Most importantly, Prime Minister, will you now commit to not change the GST formula to Tasmania's disadvantage?

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:17):  I acknowledge the gentleman from Tasmania has asked the question in the presence of one of his distinguished Tasmanian predecessors in the House of Representatives. The government has been given the Productivity Commission's final report on horizontal fiscal equalisation, which examined our system for determining how GST revenue is distributed among states and territories. This will be released within weeks, not months, but we have to go through and read it carefully. The government has committed to release the report in June. As the Treasurer has committed, both cabinet and the state and territory treasurers will have the opportunity to be briefed on the report before it's published. There will still be an exhaustive process that follows the Productivity Commission report's release. We'll consider its recommendations and work with the states and territories to come up with a package of reforms. It's important we take the time to fully examine any proposed changes to our system of horizontal fiscal equalisation and understand state and territory views and perspectives. It's also important that any new arrangements be seen as fair everywhere. They have to pass the pub test in Burnie, as they do in Bunbury, Ballarat or Bendigo, right around the country. I say to the honourable member: whatever changes are made to the GST to make it fairer or more transparent, payments to Tasmania will not be reduced a cent. Tasmania will not lose a cent. We will ensure that.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (14:28):  That's a good question about jobs. We should be hearing questions about jobs and innovation rather than the muckraking and tearing down that we're hearing from those opposite. I'm glad to get a question from our side about jobs, innovation and infrastructure. I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. He is a tireless fighter for his local community, for Victoria and for the infrastructure and the jobs that our nation needs.


This government is delivering. A million jobs have been created throughout Australia, including in Victoria and Tasmania, thanks to this government's strong economic plan—a plan which has taken the pressure off small and medium businesses through tax cuts and the instant asset write-off, which was extended for another 12 months in the Treasurer's excellent budget; a plan which will see Australians keeping more of their hard-earned money in their pockets through our personal income tax cuts; and a plan that is delivering the vital infrastructure needed to boost the economy, connect local communities and create local jobs. It's all about productivity. 


The member's electorate is benefiting from a $500 million investment in the Monash Freeway, connecting his region with Melbourne and other parts of regional Victoria. The constituents of La Trobe will be amongst those in the region to benefit from our commitment to the Melbourne Airport rail link—$5 billion—which will deliver the much-needed, long-called-for rail link between Tullamarine and the CBD.


The member asked me more broadly about infrastructure connecting local communities, and I'm delighted to inform him of the government's infrastructure investment in Tasmania. Warwick Smith, the former member for Bass, will also be delighted to hear this. In the north-west, and in the west of Tasmania, in the seat of Braddon, this government has delivered with Gawler River, Stony Point Creek and Zeehan Rivulet bridge replacements. There is $3½ million for eight community infrastructure projects under the Regional Jobs and Investment program, a wonderful initiative, including: the Wild Mersey Mountain Bike Trails project, the Burnie Waterfront Eastern Promenade, and a project unlocking export opportunities for seed potato production in the Apple Isle. There is $11.1 million for a number of projects under the Community Development Grants Program, including the Devonport Gymnastics Club project and a new community facility on King Island, building community capacity and creating local jobs. 


I'm asked about the risks. There are those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition stands opposed to jobs creation, he stands opposed to higher wages for Tasmanians and he stands opposed to business growth. I can't understand why he's so anti business and so anti start-ups, particularly in Tasmania. The Leader of the Opposition is a clear and present danger to the continued growth, prosperity, job creation and hard earned wages of all Tasmanians.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2018-05-30,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (15:18):  This is a very important matter, because, of course, wherever you look with respect to this government, it fails to give account to the Australian people. Whether it be providing $80 billion to the big end of town or whether it's, indeed, failing to account for a number of areas of public policy, we see ministers in this government failing to be transparent and failing to account for their actions.


Of course, that's been underlined most dramatically today when we've seen again Minister Cash failing to come clean about her level of involvement—the extent and nature of her involvement—in relation to the unlawful leak to the media about the police raids on AWU offices seven months ago. For the last seven months, we've seen obfuscation and cover-up by this government. In fact, in October last year the minister, Senator Cash, in answers to questions in the Senate on five separate occasions, misled the parliament when she said that her office was not involved in unlawfully providing information to media about police raids. The fact is that since that time we have not seen any effort by the minister to account for herself, and today in a press conference she's made very clear that she will ensure she'll spend taxpayer's dollars avoiding the courts as well. This is a minister who refuses to account to the parliament and doesn't want to account to the courts. She wants to avoid accountability and does not want to tell the truth when it comes to this very serious matter, and the fact is we can't allow this to continue.


This is actually consistent with the conduct of this minister for many, many months. Firstly, we saw the minister appoint a commissioner to the ABCC who had, indeed, deliberately provided unlawful advice and placed that on the website. We saw the same minister appoint 11 consecutive employer based commissioners to the Fair Work Commission, which added to the three appointments by Senator Abetz when he was minister. That's 14 consecutive commissioners now that come from one side of the bargaining table. We've seen, of course, the efforts by the minister to avoid accountability in relation to these matters. But this matter here is of most importance, because for seven months we have had a failure to account for her conduct and the conduct of her office.


We do know, of course, that the staffer who made admissions to the minister about leaking that information has left the office of the minister. We also know that there are now four staff members of that office that have left, yet we have not actually been provided with any information as to why they have departed the minister's office. Today, of course, we've seen the court subpoena not only the minister but, indeed, the head of the Registered Organisations Commission, the former employee of the minister's office and a former employee of the Registered Organisations Commission. These matters should be answered. If the minister thinks it's okay to spend taxpayers' money to seek to set aside the subpoena so she won't account to the court, the question has to be asked: what does she have to hide? What does she have to hide to avoid these court proceedings, and why is it that, when she's been asked questions in Senate estimates and in the Senate, she has sought to claim a defence of public interest immunity to avoid answering any questions of the Senate?


The highest obligation of a minister of the Crown is to account for and be responsible for their conduct. The fact is that, under the Westminster system, ministers are responsible for the conduct of their office. So already it's clear, given the conduct of the office of Minister Cash, that she should have already resigned. She should have resigned seven months ago. Since then she has failed to answer any questions in relation to further conduct by that office, and the conduct of herself, and for that reason she should be censured by the parliament and she should resign or, indeed, if she fails to resign, the Prime Minister should sack her.


The Prime Minister in the last seven months has defended the minister when she has refused to answer any questions in relation to this matter. This is a sordid saga. This is a seven-month scandal that will not go away. There will be court proceedings that will, of course, be heard in several months. Meanwhile, we have a minister who refuses to do her job. We have a minister who refuses to attend Senate estimates late yesterday and, indeed, all of today. She's in the building, she's in the parliament and she's there to do her day job, but she doesn't turn up to do that. The fact is you cannot continue to have a minister who represents the junior minister at the table in the Senate not turn up to act on his behalf. She's scheduled to turn up. She's actually in attendance in the parliament but refuses point blank to turn up to the Senate budget estimates and answer questions. Well, frankly, this is an untenable position for Minister Cash and this is an untenable position for the Prime Minister too. He cannot keep defending the indefensible in relation to this matter. There is no defence to suggest that the minister is not answerable to the parliament. The fact is she continues, of course, to argue otherwise.


It's not just in relation to Minister Cash that we see this lack of accountability; it also applies to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has failed the Australian people. The Prime Minister seeks to introduce his central tax plan to provide $80 billion of taxpayers' money to the big end of town. Frankly, this is very unfair on working people. This is very, very unfair on the millions of working people who require some support. It's unfair that we would seek to provide $80 billion of taxpayers' money to the big end of town and, at the same time, deprive workers of a decent wage increase. We've seen wages stagnating in this country. On 1 July this year there's a second round of penalty rate cuts for retail and hospitality workers. There's a bill that could be introduced into this parliament today by the minister at the table that would have the effect of stopping the penalty rates decision in its tracks and stopping further cuts, and yet, of course, we see the minister at the table, the Prime Minister and Minister Cash refuse to accept the argument that those workers should not have their wages cut in real terms.


This disregard for working people is quite remarkable from a Prime Minister who likes to argue that he cares about the Australian workforce. Frankly, if you look at the record of the Australian Prime Minister, he has no regard for the Australian workforce. He has no regard for hardworking people—middle-class and working-class Australians—who are struggling to make ends meet. All they wish to have is a decent pay raise. Of course we are not surprised that the Prime Minister doesn't have any empathy for these workers because, frankly, he doesn't understand. He does not understand the concerns, the needs and the aspirations of these workers. The Prime Minister likes to pretend he has regard for them, but he feels comfortable in the boardroom and he feels uncomfortable in workplaces. This is a Prime Minister who has invented a log cabin story. This is a Prime Minister who pretends he has a log cabin story, except, of course, the logs were made of bars of gold. The fact is this Prime Minister has never financially struggled in his life, and he has never had any regard for working people in his country. He never regards them when he introduces his policies.


The most remarkable thing is that we know that trickle-down economics don't work, but it works for the very few, including the Prime Minister. The richest man in the parliament, the biggest shareholder in the parliament, will be the biggest beneficiary of the trickle-down economics that are being introduced by this parliament. The budget is, of course, the values and the priorities of the Prime Minister writ large. He is a person who has no interest in working people. He is a former merchant banker who spends more time talking to bankers than he does talking to workers. It's this lack of accountability and this lack of regard for working people that we see every day in this place from this Prime Minister. That's the reality, whether it's Minister Cash, who refuses to appear in the parliament and is spending taxpayers' money refusing to go to court, or a Prime Minister who has no interest and lives in his social citadel at Point Piper instead of looking after decent working people in this country and giving those workers a pay rise.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation) (15:28):  There's 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back. It's just more of the same. Where is one policy that those opposite have that will create one job? Where is it? It's non-existent. It was a wholehearted 10 minutes defending the indefensible, as per usual—their union puppet masters—and bagging and creating class envy, which is the only trick of this one-trick pony opposition.


I would like to make a couple of points with respect to the shadow minister's comments regarding, firstly, appointments on the Fair Work Commission. I noted with interest last week that apparently, according to him, we've stacked the joint. I would draw to his attention that currently, among those sitting on the Fair Work Commission, it is 51 per cent put there by Labor versus 49 per cent from us. We are, of course, the 49 per cent.


I will also say that, as the Prime Minister said in question time, there's a very simple way for the ROC, the Registered Organisations Commission: the action would never have been taken if the union had provided the documentation on the authorisation for the $100,000 of—and here's the key—union members' money. It's not the union delegates' money, it's not union bosses' money, it's not the Labor Party's money and it's definitely not the Leader of the Opposition's money; it is union members' money. Why is it that those opposite fight so hard against transparency—and here's the other misnomer—of not just unions but any registered organisation, yet, at the same time, at the back end of the banking royal commission—you watch them—they'll be calling for company directors to be hanged, drawn and quartered? That behaviour, if found to be true, should absolutely be penalised, and I note that the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has already made indications that there'll be a considerable stiffening of penalties on the corporate side of the fence, as there should be. But there should be responsibility on anyone that looks after anyone else's money. There should be transparency for anyone that looks after anyone—




Mr Champion:
  By banks?




Mr LAUNDY:
  Banks, shareholders or members, no matter who they are—for the member for Wakefield's attention—they should be accountable to their members. But there is not one iota—it would be easy to throw this out by saying, 'Here's the paperwork; here's where the Leader of the Opposition, when in charge of the AWU, had authorisation to give GetUp! 100 grand.' They can't produce it, so they want to play games—smokescreens by their union bosses. They are in here prosecuting slander and class warfare, which is exactly all they are: one-trick ponies.


In terms of accountability, those opposite have not one policy for one job. We are responsible on this side for the policy settings that have enabled over one million jobs the economy has created and have enabled businesses to take on bank debt, back themselves and employ people over the past 4½ years. I spoke today in question time of the need for the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ABCC. Why? Because we have green shoots galore in construction.



Ms Butler interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Griffith is warned.




Mr LAUNDY:
  In the last year of the Labor government, in 2012-13, 15,500 small and family businesses in construction closed, with a net decrease of 14,000 jobs. In the past 4½ years in construction, with the rule of law restored, there has been a net increase of 35,600 businesses, amounting to an increase in employment in the sector of 200,000 people, driven predominantly by small and family businesses taking on bank debt, backing themselves and employing people. Across the board, there have been 150,000 additional small businesses opened over the past 4½ years. Compare that to the last 12 months of the Rudd-Gillard government, when there was a net decrease in businesses in this country of 61,000, irrespective of the business's size. But in the past 12 months, just in small and family businesses—businesses with turnover of $10 million or less—65,000 have opened. In other words, in the last 12 months under the Turnbull coalition government, more small and family businesses have opened than the net decrease in businesses, irrespective of size, under the previous Rudd-Gillard government. As they say, if you want more of the same, re-elect them. You'll see it again. They will roll over and pay back their secret deals with their secret union mates.


I spoke about reducing red tape yesterday in question time. It has been reduced by $6 billion for businesses in the last 4½ years, and there has been an $800 million reduction in red tape in the last financial year. There is the instant asset write-off of $20,000. Free trade agreements have been used in my electorate, especially by young Australian entrepreneurs of Chinese descent, leveraging their family networks to distribute back in mainland China. There is the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. There are new forms of financing including crowdfunding. In the start-up sector, there are tax concessions to angel investors and early-stage venture capital investors. What has happened? We've seen an increase of over 100 per cent in venture capital funds—not our work. It was AVCO, independent of government, availing us of that in the last few months. What we would see under those opposite would threaten all of that. 


I do, again, want to make reference to something that my opponent said in his 10-minute diatribe. He mentioned penalty rates. Again, do you want to see hypocrisy? In 2010, the Fair Work Commission made a decision to reduce penalty rates in some awards. In 2010, the Labor Party were in control. There was not one word from any member opposite. Why? Because the Fair Work Commission was completely of their design. It was staffed with their people. It came up with the decision. There was not one word. That changed, however, in 2014, when they went into opposition. Again, in 2014, the Fair Work Commission reduced penalty rates for some awards. I quote directly the member for Gorton when he was asked about these penalty rate cuts: 


We've always said that employment conditions should be considered properly and should be considered by the Fair Work Commission.


As he should do; they set it up. I agree with it. I'm arguing for the integrity of the Fair Work Commission. 


The irony of where I find myself as the minister for industrial relations is that I am actually arguing for the integrity of the system—the Fair Work Act and the Fair Work Commission—that the Labor Party set up. What else did we get under the last Labor government? We got jobless queues growing by 206,000 in their six-year tenure. What have we had? We have had one million new jobs created in the economy over the past 4½ years. In the last 12 months, 417,000—80 per cent cent—of those jobs were full-time. It's a record. We are into our 18th month of positive employment growth—yet another record. We're into our 27th year of continued economic growth, while those opposite want to continually try to obfuscate their union mates, whom, at the end of the day, they are here to represent. I don't mind that, because my family come from a union background. 


There are good union members in this country. There are good union delegates in this country. There are good unions in this country. The ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission are there to hold to account those who fail that test. They are there to make sure that the rule of law on construction sites is adhered to. They are there to make sure that members' money is used appropriately. Is that fair? Yes, it is fair. It's absolutely fair. It's what every union member in this country should expect and, more importantly, be entitled to. If those opposite aren't going to insist on that happening, we are going to keep hearing cases of where it doesn't happen. Instead of coming in here and bagging the officials that hold rogue union delegates to account, they should come in here and condemn their abhorrent criminal behaviour. Do you hear 'boo'? No, you don't. You see secret deals being done by the Leader of the Opposition with a guy like John Setka, who has a rap sheet as long as your arm. As I said today in question time, no Australian would be proud of one iota of the 59 offences and nor would he be someone that they would want to associate with. However, that's not the case for the Leader of the Opposition. He is not only associating with him; he's relying on his votes so that he can maintain his slippery hold on leadership. If this country elects him, we are all up the creek without a paddle.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:38):  This matter of public importance is about accountability. We know that the greatest honour, other than being a member of this House or the other place, is to be a minister. It is a great honour. It's a great responsibility, because you hold great power—the power of the state and its agencies. We also know that parliament is the sentry to this extraordinary power. This is the heart of the Westminster system. The parliament reigns supreme. It is not just a tradition. It is not just a debating point. It exists in the Statement of Ministerial Standards. If you go to page 9 of this statement—and I recommend those opposite have a look at it—it says in clause 4.4: 


Ministers are required to provide an honest and comprehensive account of their exercise of public office, and of the activities of the agencies within their portfolios, in response to any reasonable and bona fide enquiry by a member of the Parliament or a Parliamentary Committee.


Now, we know that what's actually happening in this building today is that we've got a minister who will do anything but turn up to the parliament and account for her actions and the actions of her office and her agencies.


You think about the consequences of this. I know some members opposite think about the consequences of this. This is more than just the life of one government. It's about the standards that ministers are held to in this parliament. It is an important standard. Instead, we have a minister presiding over this mess, setting out to get the Leader of the Opposition, setting out to get the unions and setting out to embroil the government in this witch-hunt. In the process, the minister is creating this omnishambles, which is now consuming the actions of this government. We know what an omnishambles is. For those opposite, I will give you the definition: it is a situation that has been comprehensively mismanaged, characterised by a string of blunders or miscalculations. What better way to describe a minister who misleads the Senate and misleads the estimates five times, and then has to come back into the Senate and say, 'Oh, actually, a member of my own staff tipped off the media as to a police raid on a union office.' Now, she's in hiding behind whiteboards. She is in witness protection!


We know that this is a deliberate strategy of the government because in The Sydney Morning Herald article on 19 December 2017, entitled 'The winners and losers of Malcolm Turnbull's reshuffle', it says:


Michaelia Cash: despite a recent stumble when a member of her staff tipped off media about a police raid, she goes from Employment Minister to the new portfolio of Minister for Jobs and Innovation.


The Prime Minister set out, as a deliberate design, to reshuffle his government to avoid ministerial accountability and to avoid this parliament looking at this minister's conduct. This is an outrage. It is an absolute disgrace. I can't believe that we have ministers coming into this place and talking about jobs, talking about this and that, and not accounting for this minister, who is like Marcel Marceau behind the whiteboard. It is a joke. You are making this government, these ministerial standards and this Prime Minister a complete joke. I bet you were all hiding under your desks and you did not watch the press conference, but it was a cracker. The Sky News ticker said:


Senator Cash: I had nothing to do with the whiteboard. You think you were surprised …


The poor minister! It is everyone else's fault! It is the big mean unions, it is the nasty old Labor Party, it is the Department of Parliamentary Services! How cowardly do you have to be to blame the attendants in this building? It's the journalists! It's everyone else!


It is time for her to rock up to estimates and account for her actions. It is the bare minimum that a minister needs to do. If she can't do it, then the way open for her is just to resign. That's the Westminster tradition. That's what you should do. That's how you protect the government. Those opposite absolutely know that. They know that it's only a matter of time before this minister had to resign. Get it over with, because otherwise we'll deal with it parliamentary week after parliamentary week. It will cost this government more and more until election day, and then they'll be accountable to the Australian people.

He is a passionate contributor, and he did get one thing right: this is about cash. We should talk about this mob over here, where they source their cash and what they do with it. Let's be very, very frank: there is no-one on that side of the room anymore who actually represents the working people in the country. Working people get up every single day, put on their hard hats, put on their high-vis, put on their safety boots and go to work.




Mr Champion:
  What about me, mate? I worked for a living. I worked on a farm. I picked fruit.




Mr PITT:
  Okay, we have one, the member for Wakefield has put himself forward. We have one. It's a great contribution. Those workers are out there every single day, doing the 20-on, eight-off shift and doing the 14-day swing shift. They are the ones who are working in the resources industry and working in power generation. They are working hard in very difficult conditions. And what happens every single fortnight? They get their payslip, and at the bottom of that is a contribution to the union for their membership.




Mr Champion:
  They have to join the union for that contribution to come out!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Wakefield is warned!




Mr PITT:
  I acknowledge the work of the unions over many, many years. They have done things that are valuable. They are, in fact, a necessary evil.


But let's look at where that money goes, because it goes into the union and we know that it now goes from the AWU to GetUp!—$100,000. And what does GetUp! do with that money? What do they do with it? They go out and run an anti-coal campaign. They go and run a campaign against the resources industry, to take the jobs away from the people making the contribution to the AWU, to the CFMEU, to what was the ETU, to Labor and to GetUp! to get rid of their jobs! What sort of circle is that? To make these contributions all the way round the circle, from hardworking people to unions, to Labor, to GetUp! to get rid of their industry? I mean, that is just outrageous!


How can they sit over there and say that they represent working people but want to close their industry? The resources industry is incredibly important to Australia: it is a very strong contributor to our GDP, it provides tens of thousands of jobs and we know that there are lobby groups out there like GetUp! that want them to be gone.


This $100,000, what was it? Was it Christmas? Was it Santa Claus? Did Santa decide that he should push $100,000 from the AWU across to GetUp!—really? Was it their birthday? Well, no, someone made a decision. And that decision was made by the Leader of the Opposition, the former head of the AWU, one Bill Shorten. Now, he should be accountable for those decisions, because that money is trying to get to rid of the jobs of the people who are making the contribution.


What do you say to the comrades? Well, comrades, we really want you to continue to contribute. We want you to continue to give us money so we can fight our good fight. But we also want you to be out of a job. We want your industry to be closed down. We do not want you to have a job at all. So we'll continue to go to GetUp! and continue to let them campaign. We'll let them campaign to shut your industry so that you no longer have a position and you can't pay your union fees and dues. I'm not sure what you think happens next, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, but I would imagine there'd be no more contributions. I would imagine that there would be no more money to be paid.


But this debate is also about trust. Who do we trust? Do we trust the Leader of the Opposition? This is a man who goes to Melbourne and tells the people of Melbourne that he doesn't support the resources industry. In fact, he doesn't want to see the Galilee Basin opened. He thinks that's terrible because he's trying to win the Batman by-election. But when he goes to Biloela or Moranbah he has a completely different perception, and that is that he supports resources. So we can't trust the Leader of the Opposition on resources; we simply cannot.


Or what about energy? The contribution from the Labor Party is that they want a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target. This will drive up prices, there is no doubt about that at all. In fact, as an electrical engineer, I struggle to understand the concept where you would make your generation system—half of your capacity—a variable supply, one which doesn't work in the dark and won't work if it's calm. What do we do? Do we turn off half the nation when it doesn't operate?


These are the challenges that we need to look at. You cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition—you cannot trust him when it comes to resources, you cannot trust him when it comes to energy and you can't trust him on borders. We've heard this debate and we saw the contribution from Mr Dutton, the shareholding minister. What happens when there's a debate on? Well, they shut it down. We've certainly heard from Mr Dutton how that happens. You get your mates from the CFMEU to come down. And where do they get their funding from? From those poor, hardworking people who are out there doing their gig and looking for support from their unions and organisers, who take that money and want to get rid of their jobs. They want them gone. They want to open borders and they want to increase the cost of electricity. This is just an absolutely outrageous list of things that the Leader of the Opposition wants to do, and he cannot be trusted.


The last word should go to Mr Setka. Mr Setka was very, very clear in his quote when he was asked, 'Do you trust Bill Shorten?' Well, the short answer, in one second, was, 'No, I do not.'

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (15:48):  Today's MPI really is about accountability, and today's question time was about bringing to account the behaviour and the actions of the minister. So far today, not one government member has defended the minister. No-one has got up and said, 'She's done a good job.' No-one has said, 'Well, she's achieved all these great things.' No-one is backing in the minister. That's because those on the other side simply do not believe in what the minister has done. If they had, they would be referencing it. The previous minister at the table, Minister Laundy, gave a spirited defence of everything other than Minister Cash. You have to put this into context: this is the same minister who, last Friday, didn't lodge his own nomination form to sit in this parliament. The New South Wales Liberal Party has had to extend and reopen nominations. It's bad enough for the member for Gilmore sitting here, who is now confirmed to be under challenge from a Mr Schultz in her own electorate; we're now seeing ministers fail to complete the most basic of paperwork to sit in this parliament.


Nothing is clearer when it comes to accountability than with respect to the Minister for Jobs and Innovation and her desperate attempt to escape any scrutiny over her involvement, and that of her office, in the leak to the media of the Registered Organisations Commission raid on the AWU offices. I will spend some time going through the history of this, which demonstrates very clearly the lack of accountability from the minister in the parliament. For seven months the minister has dodged, weaved and hidden behind whiteboards. I did laugh today when she was asked about the whiteboard incident in one of her rare media performances, and she said with a straight face:


Do you think you were surprised? You should have seen the look on my face.


We couldn't, because she was wheeling the whiteboard to hide from people.


We know the facts. In late October last year the minister misled the Senate five times by falsely denying that her office was the source of the leak, but lo and behold, after some time and reflection, a few hours later she walked in and said that her office was the source of the leak to the media and that her staff had informed unlawfully. The AFP quite rightly then launched a criminal investigation into the leak, and despite fessing up and owning that her office was the source of the leak, the minister won't disclose if she has been questioned or interviewed by the AFP—a pretty simple yes or no.


I don't say this lightly, but I believe this reeks of a cover-up. The minister is running away from any accountability. Now we're reaching a tipping point where the Prime Minister needs to reflect if Minister Cash is still the best person for the job. At this stage it appears she clearly does not want to be in that job. Budget estimates happen once a year, an important function in holding a government to account. It is Minister Cash's job as a minister of the Crown to turn up and answer questions. It is incumbent upon ministers to be there and answer questions truthfully, yet she is not there today and abandoned it yesterday. Instead, despite a unanimous request by the Senate committee for her to return to estimates later this afternoon to face the music, the minister has failed to offer any excuse as to why she believes she is above the standard set for representatives of the people.


It is not good enough. Members opposite should get up and criticise her for not doing her job and not being held accountable. We are accountable in this place. Forget all the rhetoric and nonsense that the government is saying. The minister is on trial today. She is the one responsible. She is the one avoiding scrutiny. Perhaps the minister was not in the building this morning. She may in good conscience have had more important parliamentary work to attend to. But I'm advised that the minister was in the building during Senate estimates today, sitting down instead with the member for Gilmore making Facebook videos. The topic of discussion? Providing flexibility for older Australians when it comes to working. I know the member for Gilmore is under pressure because she is being challenged, despite the Prime Minister offering her support— (Time expired)

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (15:54):  It is indeed a pleasure to stand and speak in response to the speakers that have gone beforehand on this matter of public interest—that is:


The failure of the Government to be accountable to the Australian people.


This MPI is not a witch-hunt for Senator Cash; it is about accountability. The government speakers have articulately spoken about issues of accountability. I want to take the point from the member of Oxley, who said no-one here had stood to offer any type of spirited defence of Senator Cash, the Minister for Jobs and Innovation. I will absolutely do that. I owe a great deal of thanks to Senator Cash. Within my electorate, I have no less than 11,000 road transport operators. Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, you would remember not too long ago how the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, if it had come into effect, would have forced no less than 50,000 sole transport operators off the road. I have no idea what the reasons were or what the motivation was of those on the other side to take away the livelihood of those people. I have 11,000 road transport operators in my electorate alone. I live just outside a metropolitan area, which is Brisbane. The precincts they reside in are normally one-, two-, five- or 10-acre blocks, and so they have access to larger sheds and larger yards for their trucks. They tend to congregate there because the operators will be: sand and gravel as that's where the quarries are located, and they'll take product into the CBDs; road transport operators shifting livestock from reginal precincts to selling yards within my electorate, shifting cattle, horses and others; single operators picking up horticulture from the paddocks and taking them into markets. If they've got a couple of trucks, they'll be running to Sydney and Melbourne.


So 11,000 road transport operators in my electorate were going to be out of a job, they were going to be homeless. Their only single source of revenue is their truck. Those on the other side, through the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, put legislation before this House, under the guise of road safety—that the roads were going to be safer if we took 50,000 operators off the road. It was Senator Michaelia Cash, from the other place, who stood and fought the unions, who fought the legislation that came through—as we did in this House. We opposed it here. As a result, I stand here and say that she is doing an outstanding job in representing those 11,000 road transport operators in my electorate. She deserves to continue in that position; she has been outstanding in that position.


When it comes to accountability, at the next election the Australian public will have a very clear decision to make: accountable government or, in contrast, the Australian Labor Party. We have put on more than one million jobs since coming to office. One million jobs where we have taken people from the unemployment queues, from welfare and put them into work. Seventy-five per cent of those sit with the small business sector, a sector which we have supercharged by the instant asset write-off, our tax policy and our fiscal settings. We're getting it right. On the other side, think about when Labor were last in government. In the past year, we've put more than 420,000 jobs on. In contrast, when Labor were in government, have a guess how many jobs were created in their final 12-month period of office? Three hundred thousand? No. Two hundred thousand? No. Did they get to 100,000 jobs? Pathetically, no, they did not. They created 89,000 jobs, and, as the Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation said earlier, no less than 15½ thousand small businesses went broke. There's your contrast; there's accountability to the Australian public. When a sensible coalition government is in place, the economy grows and fiscal prudency is seen to. When you're talking about accountability, when Labor are in office fewer jobs are created, government grows and taxes get higher. The Australian people have a very easy choice. (Time expired)

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2018-05-30,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (15:59):  Here we are again and, again, we are talking about the disgraceful behaviour of Minister Cash and how she continues to avoid scrutiny. She is the person who stands in her ivory tower and shouts down at the rest of us, 'You must be held accountable.' She is the person who doesn't waste a moment or a second to defame, to ridicule, to call out, to yell, or to use the most obscene language about a union organiser or a member of the opposition. Today again she has proven that she is not up to the job. She has failed again to front up to budget estimates.


Let's step through the time line in relation to this particular issue. There were a number of times when the senator failed to do her job in a transparent way, but let's focus on this one. This is in relation to the Registered Organisations Commission's raid on the AWU offices. She misled the parliament five times. She falsely denied that her office was the source of the leak. Then she informed the Senate that it was her staffer's fault—it wasn't her; she didn't know about it. It was her staffer's fault. The Prime Minister said: 'I didn't know about it. I wasn't quite sure'—not that we all really quite believed the Prime Minister when he said that.


The AFP have now launched their own criminal investigation into the leak. There is still a cloud over Senator Cash. As we've learnt today, the minister under investigation was subpoenaed not once or twice but three times to explain what she did or did not know. This is a government that touts over and over again, 'Let's follow the rule of law'—until it comes to one of their own and then there is nothing but a cover-up. The minister has refused to explain the conduct of her office and the abuse of ministerial power.


Let's remember what this raid was about. Remember back to when that happened. The AWU were very clear. They were sent a letter by ROC that said, 'Do you have documentation to talk about this?' The union sent back a letter saying, 'Can you please provide us with more information.' At no stage did they refuse to hand over the information. The Prime Minister today was wrong. He stood at the dispatch box and said that that union put every roadblock in the way. That is not true. The union asked for a little bit of extra information. Instead of that, they said that they were willing to cooperate with the ROC. Instead of that, the very next day the AFP raided and demanded the documentation. The Prime Minister likes to rewrite history to protect this minister. That's what this Prime Minister does. Just what does she have on this Prime Minister that he is continuing the protection racket against her? 


Then we all remember the TV images. The media turned up before the police. The minister tried to deny that she had anything to do with it. She misled the Senate on five occasions, only to be outed by the press gallery. Then she came in to admit that she had got it wrong. She has hidden behind her staff. She has hidden behind parliamentary privilege over and over again. Today again she has refused and failed to turn up to budget estimates, saying that it is no longer her responsibility. It is hard to believe that, for the first time since Federation, we do not have a minister responsible for the Fair Work Act or industrial relations in cabinet. We are saying that it is the junior minister who sits the furthest away. The assistant minister gets sent in to be the sacrificial lamb. Industrial relations is one of the core responsibilities of this government and of this place. It doesn't matter whether you're a worker or an employer; you need a robust system and a minister who is independent, transparent and accountable. But again the minister has failed this test. This isn't the first time; she has form.


Former ABCC boss Nigel Hadgkiss resigned over the fact that he breached the Fair Work Act. The minister knew about it and she still appointed him. The person responsible for ensuring that everybody in the construction sector abided by the law admitted to breaking the law and then the minister admitted to knowing that he broke the law. Just what level of scrutiny is this government really applying? Why won't they come clean and tell the Australian people that is just about pursuing their opponents?


Then you go to the way in which this government has misused police resources to pursue their political opponents. The minister must resign or the Prime Minister must sack her for this deliberate misuse of power and failure to the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-05-30,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (16:04):  This MPI today—the failure of the government to be accountable to the Australian people—has been a clear attack on the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Michaelia Cash, from start to finish. I'm a country bloke and I come from a world where a handshake still means something, where a man's or a woman's word is good enough. And I have a good respectful relationship with the union leaders who live and work in my electorate, especially, I might say, in the town of Whyalla, where they, along with the rest of the community, have helped rescue the Whyalla steelworks. And I stand ready to keep fighting with them for the right outcome. They are unions who are doing what they are supposed to do—looking after their members. 


It seems a world away from the central and national leadership of some of the union movement, where it seems to be perfectly fair game to take members' money and use it for purposes a long way removed from the members' interests. It is a world where the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, is urging lawlessness from the union. Even with dozens of their members facing court proceedings, they advocate for more lawlessness. A place where secret deals which benefit union officials and their mates, and penalise their members, is sadly all too common a place, as was detailed by the Heydon royal commission. And it's a long way from home—it's a long way from where I come from—but it impacts on the whole nation, because it raises the question of who would be running the nation if Labor were to win the next election. 


Instead of getting to the bottom of the deal the Leader of the Opposition did with GetUp!, the Labor Party wants to pursue the side show, as to whether someone in the minister's office leaked to the press and who authorised or triggered the raid on the AWU offices. The issues of substance though are the union's or official's behaviour that triggered the investigation in the first place and what part the Leader of the Opposition, in his former role as leader of the AWU, had in that deal. The Registered Organisations Commission is trying to discover whether the Leader of the Opposition donated a hundred thousand dollars of union members' money to GetUp! without the authority of his executive. Instead, Labor wants to know who pointed the finger—who put the Federal Police on the path, trying to find out what happened to members' funds and whether they had been misappropriated—not whether the crime had been committed. It's a very old but good piece of advice, and I suggest that Labor takes it: don't shoot the messenger. Don't get bogged down on who blew the whistle. Do the right thing and find out if union members have been ripped off. 


We should just reflect on this. The union, we are told, took the money from the coal workers to support GetUp!, which is implacably opposed to their industry. Why would they do that? Perhaps they didn't. Perhaps it was the Leader of the Opposition's sole decision. Perhaps he didn't have the authority of his executive. So why not produce the evidence, if the evidence is there? Why not produce the minute, the note, whatever it was? Surely the union wouldn't give a hundred thousand dollars to an organisation opposed to coalmining when the dues have come from their coalmining members without at least discussing the decision. 


In fact, Australians are increasingly concerned about where the Leader of the Opposition's loyalties lie. While he continues to receive millions of dollars from the CFMEU, the most lawless union in the land, Bob Hawke, Peter Beattie and Kevin Rudd have all urged him to sever ties. Hawke says he should do as Hawke himself did, with the outlawing of the Builders Labourers Federation, deregistering them from the ALP, but the Leader of the Opposition remains tied to the purse strings of the CFMEU. The Leader of the Opposition's past is littered with secret deals. The Chiquita Mushrooms, Cleanevent, Cirque du Soleil and Melbourne and Olympic Parks Trust deals have all benefitted the union. And the union bankrolls the ALP, but it has penalised the workers. It's a desperate act trying to defend the Leader of the Opposition in this time. Maybe it's a little bit like Weekend at Bernie's. The Labor Party is desperately trying to keep this figure alive until the next election, hoping beyond hope that they can keep him in protection until that time. Meanwhile, the opposition leader, through his proposals for the tax system, is going on his repeated escapade of confiscating cash from people who have earned it in a fair and proper way—mechanics, policemen, nurses and teachers—and taking franking credits away from retirees. It is disgraceful. That is where accountability lies.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (16:09):  Today's matter of public importance is indeed incredibly important, but before I talk on that I just want to pick up on the member for Grey's assertion that the Labor Party is somehow whipping up the sideshow on this. I might point out to the member for Grey that the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin himself, said that a media tip-off would 'potentially put officers in danger and compromise operations'. This is far from a sideshow. In fact, this is the core business of the AFP, and it should be the core business of your minister. This government has ultimately failed to be accountable to the Australian people, and this minister, the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, has ultimately failed in her ministerial responsibility.


Even a cursory glance at the definition of ministerial responsibility will tell you that a minister is ultimately responsible for the actions of their department, even without the knowledge of an infraction by subordinates. The minister approved the hiring and ongoing employment of those civil servants. The cabinet minister ultimately bears responsibility for the actions of their staff. I say to you: if Minister Cash didn't know what was going on in her office then she's incompetent, and if she did know then she's handling the truth very recklessly. I would say to you, as a newly minted opposition backbencher, that, if my staff tipped off the media about anything, I would know, and, if I didn't know, there would be problems. So how can she possibly stand in this place and say, 'I didn't know; I don't know; my staff didn't do anything,' seven times, and then come back to that same committee and recant and say, 'Oh, a staff member did it without my knowledge'? I say 'bunkum' to that, absolutely. She misled the Senate five times, falsely denying that her office was the source of the leak. It is truly disgraceful.


Someone mentioned whiteboard walking. Game of Thrones might have White Walkers, but I say that this government has the ultimate destructive force: Senator Michaelia Cash, who is the whiteboard walker—absolutely. She believes that she is above her ministerial responsibility. She believes she's above the parliament. She believes she's above the law, rebuffing a subpoena by the Federal Court and, incidentally, having the Commonwealth lawyers being paid to rebuff that. And now she thinks she's fit to serve. Well, she might well fit behind a whiteboard, but she is not fit to be in this place, and this Prime Minister should not be supporting her.


She asked the Registered Organisations Commission to consider investigations of donations from the AWU to GetUp!. Then she is quoted as saying: 'I have issued instructions for the subpoena to be set aside. I do not intend to play the court process out publicly.' So, on one hand, at some level it's okay to call in the cameras on an AFP raid, but there's nothing to see here publicly, folks, when the minister who is responsible is being called to account.




Ms Madeleine King:
  And she's a lawyer.




Ms SWANSON:
  Yes, she is a lawyer. I take the interjection from my learned colleague the member for Brand. The minister is a lawyer. You would think she would know the law better. We often talk about the court of public opinion in this place. I would say to you that in no court in this country, whether it be the court of public opinion or the court of law, would this stand up, and it won't stand up. It really won't stand up.


If her staff somehow decided to tip off the media without her knowledge, I want to know: what did the Prime Minister know as well when he had that meeting with her and her staff? The other question that I think really needs to be asked is: who did make the phone call to the Registered Organisations Commission? I think that's a really interesting question to ask, because that person apparently, when they made that call, said that they were fearful that documents may be destroyed or tampered with. So I think that's the other big question: who made the call to the Registered Organisations Commission? Who made the call—or was there more than one who made the call? (Time expired)

Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (16:14):  Earlier today, Labor implied that we, on this side, are not here to support Senator Cash. Let me outline some of the ways that inspire me to see the work and effectiveness of Senator Cash: firstly, with the road transport remuneration tribunal, saving so many truck businesses in my electorate and so many families from losing their income; secondly, while visiting Gilmore to help the PaTH program awareness level, talking with and inspiring some of my mentors and jobseekers to make a difference in their life; thirdly, talking in detail about the difficulties faced by the job service providers, and how we can make it better; then facing off to the unions, who have, in my region, bumped my local contractors off local construction jobs. I find Senator Cash to be one of the most effective ministers I have worked with.


We see the Labor Party, in a blazing rage, calling the government to account over issues of supposed public interest and parliamentary process—in this place it's rare for me to point out the obvious, but really?—turning the debate into a commentary of vitriolic criticism. During the 43rd Parliament—which, as everyone knows, was one of tight numbers, an almost-hung parliament—there was a member of the Labor Party who occupied his seat for almost 18 months, guilty of wrongdoing, as later determined by the courts, but doggedly remaining as an elected MP. Shame, Labor, shame! Those on the opposition benches are very forgetful. That MP, while serving as member for Dobell, was investigated by the Fair Work Commission for nearly four years over allegations that he used his Health Services Union credit card for improper purposes. Where was the accountability back then? He shouldn't have remained in the parliament at all, looking at his biography. It appears that he was born in New Zealand, and we all know what happens to members in this House under such circumstances. But did the Labor Party make itself accountable to parliament? No, it did not.


That brings me to another situation where Labor has failed to be accountable to the Australian people. Last year, there was a definitive court ruling for members of parliament—incidentally, all coalition members—and their citizenship. Yet Labor allowed three of their party to remain in parliament, assuring Australians that Labor had a rolled-gold vetting process and everyone on their side was clear. Following the further court investigation of a Labor senator, we're now faced with three by-elections that could and should have taken place last year.


Labor rants that the Turnbull government has failed our country. Is it a failure to have a strong economy that creates over a million jobs? Is it a failure to have regional investment that would develop over a thousand jobs in Gilmore alone—millions of jobs nationally; thousands of jobs locally?


Australia is one of the best countries in the world in which to live, work and raise a family. We all know that. However, we face global uncertainty and cannot take our prosperity and security for granted.


At this point, I'd like to remind Labor that they say they look after the low-income workers, but, in reality, that couldn't be further from the truth. Who negotiated the enterprise agreements for low-paid workers at Woolies, Subway, Kmart, Target and a range of other major international companies—as to which, by the way, Labor didn't want to support changing the taxation laws? Why, the unions, of course! And many of these people have hourly rates that are less than the changes proposed by the Fair Work Commission in the next rounds of changes. Labor are not looking after the low-paid workers. But do we ever have that information put forward for the workers? No. Labor say they are protecting the workers. Well, they're not. It's an absolute lack of accountability to the Australian people, especially these union workers.


We on the government benches are determined to make life opportunities and prospects better for every Australian. We know that we are accountable at all times and look after all of our people at all times.


As to the whole issue of putting this investigation on the table and saying it's a problem: what are they hiding? That money was taken from union members. It was hard-earned union members' money. And, let me tell you, it's not a couple of bucks a week; it is a significant amount of money. It should be in their pockets. And if not, it should be used for their purposes if they get into strife. I have hundreds of union members coming to my office and saying, 'I've rung the union; they won't help me.' So what the hell are they paying their dues for? Seriously, it is, yes, numbers—conflated statistics presented by Labor. Australia won't be conned anymore by the inflated lies that are being presented right now by the Labor Party. And they should absolutely know better.

 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:20):  It is with such pride that I stand here today to provide certainty to the two million Australians who live up and down the Murray-Darling Basin. Today is a historic moment for this nation. As the member for Watson so eloquently put it this morning, since Federation we've never had an agreement on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but this parliament today sets forth on a new direction for the people of Australia, and for those two million Australians. And as he quite eloquently also put it: this isn't perfect; it was never going to please everybody, but it was the best plan to give the best outcomes to the environment and to our farmers—for the social and economic benefit of this nation. 


While I wasn't in this parliament when the plan came to be in 2012, I'm proud to say that I'm here to implement it as the new water minister. And I do it with some pride, because I know the personal stories of the hardship that this has caused to communities and individuals, and it's driven me to make sure that I have been determined to get outcomes rather than play politics. It's beholden on me to talk about some of those brave people whose livelihoods and lives we've impacted over the last five or six years. One in particular, who always will stick with me, is a young agronomist in Dirrinbandi, who, in tears, told me that because of the uncertainty he was unable to employ a second agronomist. So he was doing 17 hours a day of work, to the point of exhaustion. He rolled his ute, nearly killing himself and leaving a young family behind. I have seen fear in the eyes of a young man who wants to get ahead and wants to be in a nation that gets a fair go. That's driven me to make sure we've got outcomes. I've seen hardened men brought to tears over this—hardened farmers that have seen far, far greater adversity in their lives, but this has broken them to their absolute core. 


And there are the business owners. A business owner that I met had been 40 years in the one business. Now, basically because of the uncertainty, his business is worthless—not worth a cent. He had no superannuation. He had a mental health plan. They were trying to keep him alive, let alone keep him in his business. These are the lives that we've impacted. These are the livelihoods of people that we are today going to fix. This bill will set us on a journey of bipartisanship to rectify that. I thank those opposite for coming on this journey. 


The Water Amendment Bill 2018 will allow us to re-introduce the Northern Basin Review back into parliament. We were fortunate enough to have the sustainable diversion limit disallowance defeated the other day, with the assistance of the opposition. I sincerely thank them for that. This now sets us on a journey to complete the plan on time, in full. Can I say that the member for Watson, who has been forthright and honest in all negotiations with me during this journey, has ensured that we not only have in place a plan that was created in 2012; we've built on it. We've built on it to ensure that there is now compensation to the extent of economic reconstruction for some of those communities that have been hurt severely by the buybacks of water that stripped the livelihoods of businesses—like the gentleman who I just talked about who owns a business and is on a mental health plan. It's about trying to reconstruct their economy, with a $20 million injection into changing their industries away from irrigation and into other agricultural pursuits. 


But it's also about compliance. It's about making sure there is integrity in this plan, whether it be from Queensland to South Australia. If you are doing the right thing, you have nothing to fear. If you are doing the wrong thing, you are going to get caught. We'll be instituting a Northern Basin Commissioner to ensure that compliance by the states is upheld. That's a practical and sensible solution. That's something that gives integrity to this plan, which all Australians should be proud of, because we know that it will be sustainable. 


But what I'm most proud about is the fact that we've made, for the first time, an investment for Indigenous Australians. As I sat in St George and listened to an elder whom I respect above all, Ronnie Waters, he told me that basically he had been forgotten in this whole plan and that he was not empowered to do something about it. I'm proud to say, and as the member for Watson said so eloquently this morning, this is probably a world first. We've ensured that we are now empowering Indigenous Australians to purchase cultural water for economic purposes. They have a place in this. They have a traditional ownership of this. They have a cultural feel for that water. When you sit there under a tree with Ronnie Waters and listen to him talk about water being in that river, passing on his culture to the younger generations of St George, not only Indigenous but white Australians, it bridges the gap more than anything else in regional and rural Australia. I'm proud to say that we've made that commitment. It was important to me. I'm pleased to say that the member for Watson came on that journey with me. 


This plan was always about goodwill and trust, but over its journey we haven't had that. We've had vitriol and name-calling. I was never going to get into that. This was far too important. Those people's lives and livelihoods which I have been talking about were always inside me. It worried me that, unless we got this right, unless we set out on this journey now, it would fall apart and we would never have another opportunity to get it right again. I was determined for those people who had touched me during this journey to make sure that I got it right for them. I'm pleased to say that the member for Watson has done that every step of the way. The member for Watson was honest. He was forthright. He acted with utmost integrity in all our negotiations. We didn't all get what we wanted, but he made sure that we were honest with one another, that we held our hands out to each other and that we would walk out of this place having delivered something that was historic for this nation. This nation should be proud that we have a parliament that works, a parliament that will ultimately deliver a plan for the Murray-Darling that has never been done before. 


I'm proud to say that the member for Watson is the architect of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—something which he should be profoundly proud of. I'm proud to say that I have been here to deliver it. I'm proud to say that I put my hand out, he's taken it, and this parliament will now deliver the certainty to the two million Australians who have been impacted, who have been fatigued, by this issue for so long. Today we give them certainty. So, to those opposite, I say: thank you for the honesty and integrity that you have shown. I say to this nation: you should look at this parliament and see that it does work. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:20):  It is with such pride that I stand here today to provide certainty to the two million Australians who live up and down the Murray-Darling Basin. Today is a historic moment for this nation. As the member for Watson so eloquently put it this morning, since Federation we've never had an agreement on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but this parliament today sets forth on a new direction for the people of Australia, and for those two million Australians. And as he quite eloquently also put it: this isn't perfect; it was never going to please everybody, but it was the best plan to give the best outcomes to the environment and to our farmers—for the social and economic benefit of this nation. 


While I wasn't in this parliament when the plan came to be in 2012, I'm proud to say that I'm here to implement it as the new water minister.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-05-30,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (19:30):  For South Australia, the Turnbull government's 2018-19 budget was a huge disappointment. It is becoming an annual occurrence under coalition governments. First under the Abbott government, and now under the Turnbull government, it seems coalition governments have little interest in South Australia, where they currently hold only four out of the 11 seats and have limited prospects of increasing their representation.


For the Turnbull government, South Australia is clearly irrelevant. South Australians, however, held out some hope that with the new state government and the economic setback of the Holden closure, for which the coalition government has considerable responsibility, that the 2018-19 federal budget might have been a little more generous. But it was not to be. Instead, it was a budget filled with empty promises that maybe delivered in years to come—that is, if the government continues to be re-elected.


Contrary to the government's talk of major infrastructure funding for South Australia, the real dollars provided to South Australia for road and rail works are in the distant future, and they are clearly spelt out in the budget documents. A joint press statement was released by the RAA, the South Australian Freight Council, Civil Contractors Federation South Australia, and the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy in response to the 2018-19 budget. This statement makes it clear, and I quote the words of Evan Knapp, the executive officer of the South Australian Freight Council:




This year
'
s Federal budget is all smoke and mirrors and


delivers none of the promise of the pre-budget announcements
 …



The press release accurately points out how little of the funding for the north-south corridor, the Joy Baluch Bridge or the Salisbury to Gawler rail electrification work was actually in the budget. None of these works can take place without the full funding.


Just as disappointing, South Australia only gets $3.7 million, or one per cent, of the $530 million over the forward estimates allocated to the Roads of Strategic Importance program. The Turnbull government's infrastructure announcement is akin to its invisible shipbuilding jobs, which the member for Sturt boasted about having delivered in the lead-up to the 2016 federal election. The truth, which South Australians are not blind to, is that another 223 jobs will be lost at the Australian Submarine Corporation by 30 June, bringing to around 1,000 the number of shipbuilding jobs that have been lost at the ASC over the past three years.


South Australia's unemployment rate is now 5.9 per cent. It's above the national rate. For young people, finding a job in South Australia is becoming increasingly difficult. Infrastructure and shipbuilding projects could immediately create jobs, particularly for skilled ex-Holden workers or young people looking for an apprenticeship. That is particularly important at a time when apprentice numbers in South Australia and, indeed, across the country are falling, having dropped in South Australia from 17,100 in 2016 to 15,700 in 2017. Yet in one of its first acts of stupidity the South Australian Marshall Liberal government is cutting $5 million from TAFE. This comes on top of more than $3 billion of cuts to TAFE by the Abbott-Turnbull governments, and after the widespread skills training rorts by many private providers.


State Liberal and federal coalition governments should stop undermining TAFE by cutting its funding and should support young people who want to take up a trade or a skill here in Australia. It's good to have the nation skilled up for the future, and we should stop relying on importing overseas skilled workers, which has been the trademark of this government ever since coming to office. If there are jobs out there, those jobs should go to Australians who are looking for work. As we know, right now there are about three-quarters of a million people looking for work and more than another million people who would like more hours. For young people the statistics are much worse, with one in three young people either out of work or looking for more hours. We could be doing something for them by simply honouring the budget commitments and allocating the money for projects that would create immediate work. Labor would do that. It would skill up the country by, firstly, scrapping upfront fees for about 100,000 TAFE students and, secondly, committing $100 million to the Building TAFE for the Future Fund. That's what investment in the future is. (Time expired)

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (10:00):  On 18 April, I was very pleased to host my annual Sports President evening held at the newly revitalised and redeveloped Avalon Airport Oval, or Chirnside Park as we know it. It's an opportunity to share sporting success in our region and for presidents to network, get to know one another and discuss future opportunities for our sporting associations, clubs and teams. We heard from the Werribee Basketball Association, which has been named Basketball Victoria's Association of the Year. President Paul Jones gave us a terrific five-minute insight into the way our basketball association has grown young people's participation in the game. It was a fabulous evening. We got to see the new development, of course. I have to stop and reflect on the first home game that was held by the Werribee Football Club at the redeveloped ground. After a year on the road, it was great to be back at Chirnside Park. The community atmosphere was absolutely phenomenal. I hope the visiting coaches and teams are enjoying the new facilities as much as our senior coach, John Lamont, and the Werribee Football Club players are enjoying the new facilities. I also hope that the media are enjoying the new facilities at Chirnside Park.


The evening for the local sporting champions is also an opportunity to celebrate the grant recipients for the year. These young people have excelled at their chosen sport, competing at national and international championships. This year, we celebrated Kaman Malou, Samuel Clifford, Samuel Reale, Catherine Mashalidis, Catherine Huell, Noah Borg, Divid Palu, Compton Fautimau, Rory Pretty, Tai Pretty, Joshua Gomes, Nicholas Masini, Noah Cooney, Cartier Vasta, Jake Wallis, Aaron Lewer, Guillaume Chianpen, Cooper Hillyer, Ebony Dodemaide, Amy Kurkowski, Xaviour Taufa, Tevita Mapa, Lemau Maiava-Tapusoa, Brendan Wilson, Charli Blackborrow, Katu Little, Jotham Kuku, Sebastian Weickhardt, Daniel Roberts, Jai Copland, Joshua Byrne, Emmet Healey, Haloti Fonua, Sophia Potter and Emmason McCurley. They all represented not just our community but the state or their country in a range of sports.


In our community, we build community every day. It's the volunteers in our community, the people who organise sport and community activities, who help us grow our great multicultural and cohesive society. We're a growth corridor. The work is hard, the work is long and the work is absolutely important. I thank all of the people involved in community sport in the seat of Lalor for their hard work.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:31):  Thank you for using my Korean name, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan. It was a fine night at the Korean embassy last night.


Last Thursday, The Guardian reported that Assistant Secretary Narelle Clegg of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources broke down during a Senate estimates hearing while describing the conditions on live sheep export ships that led to the death of 2,400 sheep on one of those voyages. Many have seen the footage of the live sheep export ships that leave Fremantle on their way to the Middle East, and there is outrage in the Australian community. I don't think I have to explain that to any member of this parliament. All of us have received hundreds, indeed thousands, of genuine emails from local people who are outraged at this brutality. According to Meat & Livestock Australia, close to two million sheep are put on these ships from Australian ports every year. The live sheep export industry, according to the MLA, is worth $249 million. By comparison, in 2016, according to the MLA, the total export of red meat was $12.1 billion. This puts the export of live sheep at around two per cent of the bigger red-meat export market. 


As I said, last week we saw the impact of the cruelty on a senior department official months after the footage was seen. Last year, Labor's agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, put out a plan about what Labor would be doing. He spoke very eloquently and passionately at a public forum that we held. It's not often that we have the agriculture spokesman speak in an inner city electorate, but he was very good at it. We were putting the deep ethical concerns I've had about animal welfare for a long time.


Unfortunately, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources seem to have backed the industry over public concern and have vowed to continue the live export of sheep, despite the meat and livestock association's being unable to offer any guarantee that the type of cruelty witnessed will not occur again. By contrast, Labor has made a commitment to phase out the live export of sheep. Both the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, and the agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, have committed to immediately ceasing the live export of sheep during the coming Middle Eastern summer and phasing it out over five years. Joel Fitzgibbon discussed on radio FIVEaa how the Turnbull government is not only refusing to act but actually injuring efforts to investigate industry failings, after the Western Australian regulator was forced to make an FOI request to obtain information from the Commonwealth regulator. In comparing Minister Littleproud's words and actions, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, said that Mr Littleproud says he is 'going to hunt down the bad guys and put them in jail' et cetera. That's Mr Littleproud's rhetoric. But now, when the Western Australian government is attempting to pursue rogue operators, the Commonwealth is not interested in lending it any assistance. There is a clear difference: Labor plans to act and the Turnbull government's plan thus far is to evade responsibilities as far as this disgraceful cruelty on live sheep export ships is concerned.


All politics are local. People expect action from MPs even if they are not in areas of federal responsibility. They expect us to support state governments like the Victorian government, who were acting on issues of housing affordability with vacant properties. According to the 2016 census, 13.7 per cent of homes in Melbourne Ports are unoccupied, which is much higher than the national average of 11.2. It's clear that Labor's state plan to work on a vacant property tax would help free up supply. It's clear we have an affordability issue hitting younger people all around the country. I know I have extensively Facebooked and written people, and I've had a direct mail campaign and gotten very positive feedback to it.


I want to draw attention to the difference between this government's plans and the opposition's plans on negative gearing. Many people have attacked the Leader of the Opposition in a very unfair way over the years, but no-one can say he lacks policy courage. It was widely considered that negative gearing was an untouchable policy area, but now it's time for a more level field for first home buyers. It's clear that the Turnbull government doesn't understand the depth of the problem or the potential role of our federal tax system in levelling the playing field. Treasurer Morrison decided to criticise the states instead. At the Urban Development Institute of Australia in Sydney in 2016 he boiled the housing affordability crisis down to a supply issue, and he's since has said very little. This is despite the analysis from the Australian National University last year that we have an undersupply of 164,000 dwellings. Australia's banking regulator, APRA, are applying restrictions to investor financing in a bid to level the playing field, obviously due to government inaction on the issue.


Labor has a reasonable and, indeed, sensible approach to this matter. We want to reform our federal tax system, not in a bid to reduce investment in the housing market but in a bid to make the current level of investment work better, and to help increase supply by allowing negative gearing on new homes only. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that 93 per cent of new investment loans go to people purchasing existing housing stocks. This means that the vast bulk of investment in the housing market does not increase supply or boost jobs; all it does is increase demand and the price of existing homes, allowing investors to use tax subsidies to outbid owner-occupiers and first home buyers for existing properties, locking young people out of the housing market. There is a serious policy difference between the two parties on this issue, which affects a fundamental issue of equity in our society, particularly as far as it affects younger people.


Let me turn to the area of education. Labor obviously supports funding of the government school sector and would see that the Gonski projections and plans would be carried out so that the government school sector would continue to flourish in a way that I would say exceeds the current government. I want to particularly focus on data that I have from the Parliamentary Budget Office and the National Catholic Education Commission. Remember, under a Labor government, Catholic schools would receive an extra $250 million in funding compared to under this government.


The Catholic schools claim they have been unfairly targeted by the Gonski 2.0 school funding policy. Funding for over 600 Catholic systemic schools—over one-third of the Catholic system—has been cut under the Turnbull government, largely as a result of the removal of systemic funding arrangements. The Catholic Education Commission in Victoria claims these cuts will amount to an average of nearly $600,000 per school or just under $2,000 per student. Catholic schools across the country are forced to increase their fees as a result. I saw that some in regional New South Wales were forced to do that. The local Catholic schools are complaining very bitterly about it. The Australian reported in October 2017:


The National Catholic Education Commission has warned that fee rises are being considered for 766,000 students under changes also questioned by Lutheran Education and the Victorian Ecumenical System of Schools.


The principal of Emmaus College in East Melbourne said that his Catholic school stood to lose $982,000, or $773 per student in next year's funding and would have to decide whether to increase school fees or cut programs.


The working poor, some of whom attend the Catholic school system, are the people who are particularly going to be under severe financial strain as a result of this. Catholic Education Victoria states its aim:


Catholic education aspires to provide a low-fee, modest, faith-based, inclusive schooling option for all families who seek one.


Cuts in federal funding put the low-fee model at risk. Labor is committed to ensuring, just as with the government school system, the sustainability of the Catholic education model without the need to push up fees.


Gonski 2.0 limited the Catholic education system's autonomy to distribute funds according to its own assessment of local school needs, and I can tell you they are very different according to each school. I know some of my local parish schools such as St Aloysius, St Joe's and St Columbus are very worried about these changes and the effect of fees on their parents. They take people from large families. They take the families of recent refugees and they make no bones about being inclusive in taking everyone even though they are a fee-paying system. They often have people in apparently wealthy postcodes like Elwood or Caulfield who are lower down the socioeconomic ladder. So it's very difficult imposing hard and fast models on parochial schools which are inclusive and take everyone and not necessarily the wealthiest people from that suburb.


There have been reports claiming that the government is considering giving the Catholic sector an additional $1 billion to make up for the inequities in the socioeconomic status system that I just described and which was introduced by Minister Birmingham. However, this admission of a failed funding model has not been backed up by anything in the 2018-19 budge, and as of yet the government has failed to release its own review of its funding methodology and its effect on these poorer parish schools. According to The Weekend Australian in May 2018, the Catholic Church believes it needs $3 billion for its schools over the next decade to make up for these inequities.


I want to end on something a bit mischievous. Recently the ABC has been complaining about funding cuts. I was very aggrieved at the cancellation of Lateline, the once highly valued program which would often set out the agenda for the following day's news. In my view, the cut backs to PM to half an hour, the cut of Lateline and some changes to Melbourne morning radio and not the kind of changes that serious listeners to the ABC want. The ABC announced in February that Lateline's audience was steadily declining. In 2017 it had an average audience of about 185,000, whereas the ABC news channel had a figure of was 239,000 in 2014-15. The program's demise came after frequent changing of presenters and changing formats. When it was in its prime it had such presenters such as Kerry O'Brien and Maxine McKew, each of whom held the role for six or more years. Between 2007 and 2017 the show went through four hosts, and this is likely to have put off viewers. With few exceptions—perhaps 7.30—the public is left with pay TV as a main option for political discussion. This is failing on the part of the national broadcaster, whose role is to provide balanced and unbiased journalistic debate on serious issues of current affairs.


In February the ABC stated in its annual public hearing:


The program's resources have been better utilised by being reinvested into the ABC Investigations team, the Specialist Reporting Team, and new programs Matter of Fact, National Wrap and a 10.30pm news bulletin.


I've seen Matter of Fact with Stan Grant. That's a valuable addition. That's actually making up for some of the absence of Lateline. But I must say that I don't understand why so many ABC current affairs programs had to be liquidated in order to provide money for the so-called ABC investigations unit, headed by the empire-building John Lyons and his offsider, with whom he has decided political views, Sophie McNeill, whom he brought back from the Middle East. I don't understand why we're all suffering from a lack of current affairs in order that one faction of the ABC should be funded more. The public benefit was in an hour-long PM program and a Lateline program.


I'm glad the new chairman of the ABC and its new executive director, Michelle Guthrie, are being more sensitive in issuing apologies. There was an apology issued to the ECAJ for a disgracefully bigoted broadcast that was broadcast on Radio National. I commend the ABC for doing that. But I can't understand their priorities as far as current affairs are concerned. A public face, with more PMand more Lateline, is the way I would go, with fewer invisible investigations units.

These budget appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the 2018-19 financial year. In introducing the bills, the government has already highlighted some of the more significant items provided for in these bills. The total of the appropriations sought through these three appropriation bills is just under $108.5 billion. 


I would also like to thank all members who contributed to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2017-18 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2017-18. These supplementary additional estimates appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this financial year. In introducing the bills, the government has already highlighted some of the more significant items provided for in these bills. Most importantly, the bills will provide approximately $6.5 billion to the Department of the Environment and Energy, including approximately $6 billion to facilitate the Australian government's purchase of the New South Wales and Victorian governments' shares in Snowy Hydro Limited, and just under $435 million to continue to deliver the Reef 2050 Long Term Sustainability Plan. The total of the appropriations sought through these two appropriation bills is just under $8 billion.


Once again, I thank all members for their contributions and commend these bills to the House.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:31):  Thank you for using my Korean name, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan. It was a fine night at the Korean embassy last night.


Last Thursday, The Guardian reported that Assistant Secretary Narelle Clegg of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources broke down during a Senate estimates hearing while describing the conditions on live sheep export ships that led to the death of 2,400 sheep on one of those voyages. Many have seen the footage of the live sheep export ships that leave Fremantle on their way to the Middle East, and there is outrage in the Australian community. I don't think I have to explain that to any member of this parliament. All of us have received hundreds, indeed thousands, of genuine emails from local people who are outraged at this brutality. According to Meat & Livestock Australia, close to two million sheep are put on these ships from Australian ports every year. The live sheep export industry, according to the MLA, is worth $249 million. By comparison, in 2016, according to the MLA, the total export of red meat was $12.1 billion. This puts the export of live sheep at around two per cent of the bigger red-meat export market. 


As I said, last week we saw the impact of the cruelty on a senior department official months after the footage was seen. Last year, Labor's agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, put out a plan about what Labor would be doing. He spoke very eloquently and passionately at a public forum that we held. It's not often that we have the agriculture spokesman speak in an inner city electorate, but he was very good at it. We were putting the deep ethical concerns I've had about animal welfare for a long time.


Unfortunately, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources seem to have backed the industry over public concern and have vowed to continue the live export of sheep, despite the meat and livestock association's being unable to offer any guarantee that the type of cruelty witnessed will not occur again. By contrast, Labor has made a commitment to phase out the live export of sheep. Both the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, and the agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, have committed to immediately ceasing the live export of sheep during the coming Middle Eastern summer and phasing it out over five years. Joel Fitzgibbon discussed on radio FIVEaa how the Turnbull government is not only refusing to act but actually injuring efforts to investigate industry failings, after the Western Australian regulator was forced to make an FOI request to obtain information from the Commonwealth regulator. In comparing Minister Littleproud's words and actions, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, said that Mr Littleproud says he is 'going to hunt down the bad guys and put them in jail' et cetera. That's Mr Littleproud's rhetoric. But now, when the Western Australian government is attempting to pursue rogue operators, the Commonwealth is not interested in lending it any assistance. There is a clear difference: Labor plans to act and the Turnbull government's plan thus far is to evade responsibilities as far as this disgraceful cruelty on live sheep export ships is concerned.


All politics are local. People expect action from MPs even if they are not in areas of federal responsibility. They expect us to support state governments like the Victorian government, who were acting on issues of housing affordability with vacant properties. According to the 2016 census, 13.7 per cent of homes in Melbourne Ports are unoccupied, which is much higher than the national average of 11.2. It's clear that Labor's state plan to work on a vacant property tax would help free up supply. It's clear we have an affordability issue hitting younger people all around the country. I know I have extensively Facebooked and written people, and I've had a direct mail campaign and gotten very positive feedback to it.


I want to draw attention to the difference between this government's plans and the opposition's plans on negative gearing. Many people have attacked the Leader of the Opposition in a very unfair way over the years, but no-one can say he lacks policy courage. It was widely considered that negative gearing was an untouchable policy area, but now it's time for a more level field for first home buyers. It's clear that the Turnbull government doesn't understand the depth of the problem or the potential role of our federal tax system in levelling the playing field. Treasurer Morrison decided to criticise the states instead. At the Urban Development Institute of Australia in Sydney in 2016 he boiled the housing affordability crisis down to a supply issue, and he's since has said very little. This is despite the analysis from the Australian National University last year that we have an undersupply of 164,000 dwellings. Australia's banking regulator, APRA, are applying restrictions to investor financing in a bid to level the playing field, obviously due to government inaction on the issue.


Labor has a reasonable and, indeed, sensible approach to this matter. We want to reform our federal tax system, not in a bid to reduce investment in the housing market but in a bid to make the current level of investment work better, and to help increase supply by allowing negative gearing on new homes only. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that 93 per cent of new investment loans go to people purchasing existing housing stocks. This means that the vast bulk of investment in the housing market does not increase supply or boost jobs; all it does is increase demand and the price of existing homes, allowing investors to use tax subsidies to outbid owner-occupiers and first home buyers for existing properties, locking young people out of the housing market. There is a serious policy difference between the two parties on this issue, which affects a fundamental issue of equity in our society, particularly as far as it affects younger people.


Let me turn to the area of education. Labor obviously supports funding of the government school sector and would see that the Gonski projections and plans would be carried out so that the government school sector would continue to flourish in a way that I would say exceeds the current government. I want to particularly focus on data that I have from the Parliamentary Budget Office and the National Catholic Education Commission. Remember, under a Labor government, Catholic schools would receive an extra $250 million in funding compared to under this government.


The Catholic schools claim they have been unfairly targeted by the Gonski 2.0 school funding policy. Funding for over 600 Catholic systemic schools—over one-third of the Catholic system—has been cut under the Turnbull government, largely as a result of the removal of systemic funding arrangements. The Catholic Education Commission in Victoria claims these cuts will amount to an average of nearly $600,000 per school or just under $2,000 per student. Catholic schools across the country are forced to increase their fees as a result. I saw that some in regional New South Wales were forced to do that. The local Catholic schools are complaining very bitterly about it. The Australian reported in October 2017:


The National Catholic Education Commission has warned that fee rises are being considered for 766,000 students under changes also questioned by Lutheran Education and the Victorian Ecumenical System of Schools.


The principal of Emmaus College in East Melbourne said that his Catholic school stood to lose $982,000, or $773 per student in next year's funding and would have to decide whether to increase school fees or cut programs.


The working poor, some of whom attend the Catholic school system, are the people who are particularly going to be under severe financial strain as a result of this. Catholic Education Victoria states its aim:


Catholic education aspires to provide a low-fee, modest, faith-based, inclusive schooling option for all families who seek one.


Cuts in federal funding put the low-fee model at risk. Labor is committed to ensuring, just as with the government school system, the sustainability of the Catholic education model without the need to push up fees.


Gonski 2.0 limited the Catholic education system's autonomy to distribute funds according to its own assessment of local school needs, and I can tell you they are very different according to each school. I know some of my local parish schools such as St Aloysius, St Joe's and St Columbus are very worried about these changes and the effect of fees on their parents. They take people from large families. They take the families of recent refugees and they make no bones about being inclusive in taking everyone even though they are a fee-paying system. They often have people in apparently wealthy postcodes like Elwood or Caulfield who are lower down the socioeconomic ladder. So it's very difficult imposing hard and fast models on parochial schools which are inclusive and take everyone and not necessarily the wealthiest people from that suburb.


There have been reports claiming that the government is considering giving the Catholic sector an additional $1 billion to make up for the inequities in the socioeconomic status system that I just described and which was introduced by Minister Birmingham. However, this admission of a failed funding model has not been backed up by anything in the 2018-19 budge, and as of yet the government has failed to release its own review of its funding methodology and its effect on these poorer parish schools. According to The Weekend Australian in May 2018, the Catholic Church believes it needs $3 billion for its schools over the next decade to make up for these inequities.


I want to end on something a bit mischievous. Recently the ABC has been complaining about funding cuts. I was very aggrieved at the cancellation of Lateline, the once highly valued program which would often set out the agenda for the following day's news. In my view, the cut backs to PM to half an hour, the cut of Lateline and some changes to Melbourne morning radio and not the kind of changes that serious listeners to the ABC want. The ABC announced in February that Lateline's audience was steadily declining. In 2017 it had an average audience of about 185,000, whereas the ABC news channel had a figure of was 239,000 in 2014-15. The program's demise came after frequent changing of presenters and changing formats. When it was in its prime it had such presenters such as Kerry O'Brien and Maxine McKew, each of whom held the role for six or more years. Between 2007 and 2017 the show went through four hosts, and this is likely to have put off viewers. With few exceptions—perhaps 7.30—the public is left with pay TV as a main option for political discussion. This is failing on the part of the national broadcaster, whose role is to provide balanced and unbiased journalistic debate on serious issues of current affairs.


In February the ABC stated in its annual public hearing:


The program's resources have been better utilised by being reinvested into the ABC Investigations team, the Specialist Reporting Team, and new programs Matter of Fact, National Wrap and a 10.30pm news bulletin.


I've seen Matter of Fact with Stan Grant. That's a valuable addition. That's actually making up for some of the absence of Lateline. But I must say that I don't understand why so many ABC current affairs programs had to be liquidated in order to provide money for the so-called ABC investigations unit, headed by the empire-building John Lyons and his offsider, with whom he has decided political views, Sophie McNeill, whom he brought back from the Middle East. I don't understand why we're all suffering from a lack of current affairs in order that one faction of the ABC should be funded more. The public benefit was in an hour-long PM program and a Lateline program.


I'm glad the new chairman of the ABC and its new executive director, Michelle Guthrie, are being more sensitive in issuing apologies. There was an apology issued to the ECAJ for a disgracefully bigoted broadcast that was broadcast on Radio National. I commend the ABC for doing that. But I can't understand their priorities as far as current affairs are concerned. A public face, with more PMand more Lateline, is the way I would go, with fewer invisible investigations units.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2018-05-30,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (10:48):  Last Saturday I had the honour and the privilege to attend, with the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister John Howard and his wife, Janette, the funeral for Sir John Carrick KCMG, AC. Sir John survived his wife, Angela, by about four months. He lived to the age of 99. He was one of the finest of his generation. I have not seen a finer generation of Australians. It was a generation that served in the Second World War, a generation that did so much to build the country, and Sir John was a giant amongst those who did all of these things. Sir John's service reminded us all of the impression that one individual can make, and I speak of it as an impression because it is something that lasts. He made an impression on all of those he came in contact with: a lasting one, a firm one, an affirming one, a positive one and an encouraging one.


I knew Sir John because I served as the party director in New South Wales for many years and it was my habit then to go and sit in his apartment in Burwood and spend time with Sir John, seek his counsel and his advice. We would sit and talk about many things over hours and I was always so incredibly impressed about not only his command of detail and knowledge but also the graceful wisdom that he was able to impart. There was always a generosity of spirit. There was always a kindness behind every sentiment that he expressed. He was a truly remarkable person, and I was very honoured to have known him in the way that I did. So many others knew him far better but I do consider myself privileged to have had the opportunity to have known him in the way I did. So he did leave an impression. He was not just one of, I would say, the founding fathers of the Liberal Party, having served first as a research assistant and then as the general secretary of the party of New South Wales for 22 years—a record that I am quite sure no-one would seek to emulate because, in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, there is no more significant figure, other than, of course, John Howard.


As a founding father of the party, he brought the principles, pragmatism and intellectual values and capacity he had to this task, which provided our party with the right framework, the right basis and the right platform to become what it is today. We owe so much to not just Sir John but Bob Cotton and of course Robert Menzies and that whole generation of Liberals at that time, who set about creating the party that has become the most successful political organisation in Australia's history.


But Sir John's life before he entered politics was quite different. He served as a young man in Sparrow Force in Indonesia where he was captured, and he then went on to Changi, the Thai-Burma railway and Hellfire Pass. As an officer there, he had special responsibilities to lead his men in the darkest of hours. As the Prime Minister reminded us in the House, they had a practice that no-one died alone and, while they were far from home, their fellow prisoners of war would hold each other as they passed on. Indeed, as Sir John passed on, he was held by his daughters, as the Prime Minister reminded us. This went on for some time. They slept through the night on the floor or in the room—I am assuming—and they stayed there and were with him until the very end. He passed on in the same way that his comrades when he served as a POW also passed on—in the arms of the people that loved him.


But it was in what he said at the end of their time, which was recalled at the funeral on the weekend, that I found so much of the character of Sir John Carrick, and it was this: as they were going to be going home, he told the POWs to put all of this behind them—all of its horror, all of its awfulness, all of its deprivations, all of its pain. He said, 'You are young men. Go back and live your lives in a positive way.' The capacity to say that after having experienced what none of us today can imagine speaks to a quality of a person that runs very, very deep and that we were very blessed to have amongst us. 


Sir John went on to be married to Angela for 67 years. To hear his grandchildren speak at the funeral was just tremendous. Noah, Joel and Ben Campbell, and Matthew Woods and Genevieve Woods paid tribute to their 'Pa' with the hair flopping over the front of his face in the pool and his hands clapping together like an alligator as he chased them around the pool. They didn't speak of the war hero or the political titan of the Liberal Party. They spoke of Pa and the love and the joy that he brought to their lives as a family and as a member of this place. It was a great reminder that you can serve here and you can have a wonderful family, provided you continue to commit to it and see it as the most important thing.


Sir John is just an incredibly great reminder, and this is why I talk of the impression that he potentially put on all of us but particularly those who met him. He was able to achieve a balance in life. Yes, he was away for long stretches and periods of time from his family, but to hear them speak of him and the investment that he made in them—and the songs from the 'song machine' he would often to sing to his grandchildren in the evening when he was looking after them later in life—showed he was able to walk between the great corridors of power, the battlefields of wartime and the simpleness of home and do it all so effortlessly—an extraordinary thing. 


But the sad part of all of this is not that Sir John has passed on—we celebrated a man of great faith that afternoon and he is with his lord now. It was the reminder of the 40,000 Australians who didn't come home from the Second World War and the loss to Australia of all the John Carricks who never came home and were never able to make the contribution that Sir John and so many of his generation did. That was the tragedy when I reflected on Sir John's passing. It reminded us of those who didn't come home and what they would have otherwise been able to contribute to our country and, indeed, the 60,000-odd in the First World War and those who have fallen in conflicts since. That is the great loss of war—not just the loss of life but also the loss of contribution that was able to be made.


So, with Sir John—his contribution—it's hard to find a peer. We can only hope to try and serve to the same standard with the same integrity that he served as a father, as a husband, as a member of the Senate, as a leader in politics, as a lieutenant in command, and serving with fellow prisoners of war. We can only hope that we can approach his standard. We also can reflect on the loss of so many others who could have served in the same way, but, sadly, did not come home. His time as a senator, his time as a Leader of the Government in the Senate, his time as a minister in resources and education—he was particularly passionate about education. He would often tell me those stories. We would be sitting in his apartment, talking about how to negotiate coalition agreements or things like this—which he had great wisdom about.



A government member:  And success.




Mr MORRISON:
  And success, true. Then he would change topic and he would be talking about the OPEC oil crisis and the people that he met in the Middle East and how he dealt with those issues. He would often return to his most favourite topic—early childhood education and the duty we owe to those in their early years. His passion for issues of intellectual curiosity, as much as anything else, stayed with him right until the end. 


As we left the church on Saturday at the end, 99 bells were struck from the church. For several minutes there, as we listened to them, we had the opportunity to reflect on one of the greatest Australians I've ever known. I hope to meet many more like him, and I hope all of us can seek to aspire to his standard. Thank you, Sir John. You've left an incredible impression.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-05-30,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:00):  I rise to join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Treasurer and other members in paying tribute to a great Australian indeed, Sir John Leslie Carrick. John Carrick was a father, a husband, a veteran, a senator and a champion of the causes to which he devoted his life. He passed away on 18 May aged 99 years, just shortly after his beloved wife, Lady Angela, who died in February of this year. They had three daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona. I spoke to Jane last week. Jane is married to a former member, Bob Woods. I got to know Sir John through my relationship with my mentor and father figure Tom Uren, who of course served with Sir John.


He grew up the fourth of six children in Sydney, in Woollahra. He moved to Randwick and eventually Bondi. He studied at Sydney Technical High School. He delivered gas bills for AGL while studying economics at the University of Sydney. He lived in a time, though, that was turbulent, and he enlisted in the AIF in December 1940.


He was posted to the 18th Anti-Tank Battery, and his unit was deployed to West Timor as part of Sparrow Force in December 1941, with orders to deny the island to the enemy. There, two months later, he was captured, along with some extraordinary Australians—Tom Uren and 'Bluey' Rutherford. These were giants of Australian history. Lieutenant Carrick was captured, together with other survivors, and was shipped to Java in July 1942. They then moved to Singapore's Changi camp and worked on the railway—as they put it, quite that simply—at the infamous Hellfire Pass.


One of the great opportunities I've had in my life was to visit Hellfire Pass for the opening in 1987. Many of the veterans, of course, since then have passed away. Sir 'Weary' Dunlop was there, along with Sir John Carrick, Tom Uren and other veterans. I saw the extraordinary emotion of these men who went through hell. When you see Hellfire Pass—and I encourage Australians to visit there—you literally see the rock that they cut through, often with no real tools being offered, suffering from malaria and suffering from starvation. The mistreatment that occurred to the prisoners of war would have, I think, understandably broken any human being.


What was remarkable about these men was that they were so stoic about their experience. They had a sense of solidarity and looked after each other at that time. Coming together more than 40 years after the war had ended, they had—my understanding is that it was—the largest gathering of these men that happened in that period in one place. These were tough guys but they cried, they talked, they drank and they celebrated life and survival. They were determined to take that experience and cherish life and make the most of it for themselves, their families and their country.


On that visit, Sir John Carrick wanted to go down the River Kwai. We went down on a longboat. I sat next to him for about four hours there and back—and the Treasurer has just spoken about the long chats. He had a chat with me. I was a very young man. I was in my early 20s. We had a chat about our different philosophies. He was absolutely committed to the Liberal Party. He was a giant of the Liberal Party. The three giants of the Liberal Party have been Bob Menzies, Sir John Carrick and John Howard. They are the big three in history. There he was, with a young democratic socialist. It was my first overseas trip; I had never been anywhere. I was overwhelmed by this experience. Tom Uren, in order to develop my life skills I guess, had taken me on this trip. Sir John was very generous in talking about the times that he had had. But Tom Uren only ever spoke to me about his war experiences during that trip; it was the only time in his life. And I would have spoken to Tom at least once a fortnight, for decades. Sir John talked about, in a personal way, his experiences. He told me some things that perhaps he had not told other people. And I certainly kept that confidence. I regarded it as a great honour. He shared his experiences in order to educate me. He talked about his involvement in the Liberal Party, about his philosophy and about his commitment to early childhood education. He was a great thinker. He was an intellectual. I was speaking with Jane last week, and she was aware that we had corresponded over the years. John was always very generous in his comments. The last time I saw him was at Tom Uren's funeral service at Sydney Town Hall. Despite his ill health, he was determined to be there.


One remarkable thing about all of these people—and one would hope that we would have their character to respond in a similar way—was that they bore the Japanese people no ill will at all. Indeed, Sir John Carrick refused to give testimony to any war crimes tribunal because he regarded that as being about the past and that it was the structures and systems of fascism that had created the problem, not the people; it was the political structures. People had different ways of responding to that. Tom Uren was a collectivist. For his whole life, he believed in the importance of the collective—from that experience of the way the Australian prisoners of war share everything. In his first speech, and subsequently, he spoke about the fit looking after the sick and those who had the most giving it to those who needed it. The officers did not have the same hierarchy as occurred under the British system, which was across the other side of the river. Indeed, in terms of survival rates, the Australians did much better.


For Sir John Carrick, it was the importance of the individual and liberty. He had a very coherent position, and, in spite of the fact that on the surface it was very different to Tom's, there was a great deal of consistency, essentially, about both of them; a consistency that was all about the Australian national interest. Sir John Carrick said it was systems, not people, that caused the sorts of atrocities that happened during that. He said:


… although I had seen many atrocities, I saw the evil compulsion of the system on the individual.


He also said:


It's not people who create the savagery, but the systems of government … Human nature depends upon the political and social environment in which it finds itself.


I thought that the obituary by Troy Bramston in The Australian was very good. He interviewed Sir John Carrick last year. In that interview, Sir John said: 'Good God, I've seen the most horrible things. I saw human beings in terror.' There, he was talking about the Japanese, that the whole structure of that system was one of terror. Today, when terror has a different form—in particular, the rise of Islamic terrorism, a form of fascism that seeks to impose its views on others in the most horrific way; that discards humanity and human rights—that challenge remains for us in a different way.


Sir John came back to Australia, enrolled in a law course at the University of Sydney and took a job as a research officer in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. Two years later, he became the general secretary of the New South Wales division, a position he held until 1971. It is remarkable that someone who began as general secretary in the 1940s was still the general secretary in the 1970s. I find that quite extraordinary. Six years in a party office was six years too many for myself, as far as I'm concerned. He went on to become the Minister for Housing and Construction, Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Federal Affairs. He was appointed the Leader of the Senate in August 1978, and he retired from the Senate in June 1987.


It was interesting; there were a number of veterans who had at that time a solidarity across the chamber. Think about the turmoil of that time—the election of the Whitlam government, the dismissal in 1975, the period of the Fraser government and then the election of the Hawke government. There were a whole lot of people during that era that served in this place who, compared with our life experiences, we are so much more fortunate than. We literally stand on their shoulders as the result of their sacrifice, and we should always remember that.


In 2008, Sir John was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for:


… distinguished service in the area of educational reform in Australia, particularly through the advancement of early childhood education and to the development and support of new initiatives in the tertiary sector …


He continued to be an active servant of the community post politics, serving on boards and advisory committees, serving, no doubt, as a mentor to people like the Treasurer and many others in the Liberal Party, and being prepared to give advice to people such as myself whilst being totally loyal to his party. There's no question that there was no more passionate supporter of the Liberal Party than Sir John Carrick. He also understood, and it's something we as parliamentarians should always understand as well, that above all we in this place have one interest to serve, and that is the national interest. Sir John Carrick is someone whose entire life was about serving the national interest.


I pay tribute to him today, and I express my sincere condolences to his family, to his friends and to his comrades who he served with. There are very few of these veterans left now, but we are very humbled, I think, in their presence, because what they did for the country should never ever be forgotten. May he rest in peace.

Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (11:15):  I rise to support the condolence motion that was moved in the chamber by the Prime Minister and that has been so eloquently supported by the Leader of the Opposition and those who have spoken since. I do so to honour a remarkable Australian and one of the finest servants of the Liberal Party and our ideals, Sir John Carrick. I want to start by thanking the Prime Minister for what I thought was an incredible speech that he gave in the House of Representatives in honour of Sir John's life. I suspect in part that reflects the fact that the Prime Minister's own father-in-law, Tom Hughes, was one of the beneficiaries of Sir John's support and patronage in his own political career.


It's fair to say and reflect on the fact—and no hyperbole—that Sir John is without peer in terms of shaping the success of the Liberal Party in New South Wales and also, I'd argue, nationally. He was our general secretary from 1948 until 1971. He actually began his career with the Liberal Party two years earlier, in 1946, when he accepted what was a temporary job following his return from the horrors of World War II. It was, however, to become a lifetime career, both as a member of the staff of our secretariat and then as a senator in the other place. It was a role that he took, as I mentioned, not long after he'd come back from South-East Asia, where he had served Australia in Sparrow Force but was subsequently to become a prisoner of war in some of those horrific circumstances that have been so well documented. Many Australians reacted differently to that experience, but Sir John was, like many of his peers, one who came back to Australia with an absolute determination to create a more peaceful and more successful world, a world in which the horrors that he had experienced himself would not be ones that future generations would have to endure.


Many of those returned servicemen like himself were to go on to serve in state and federal politics. It's fair to say that the ranks of the Liberal Party in parliament at the time bore many of those returned servicemen, as did of course the Labor Party as well—Tom Uren typifies the service of many returned servicemen to that side of politics. I think it's in fact a fair observation to say that the early Liberal Party of Menzies was founded on the influence of two groups: firstly, those many returned servicemen who were determined to commit their lives to public service and also those women's organisations that Menzies recruited so successfully to join the new party, and which really became its backbone.


Sir John was a formidable general secretary of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He served in that role for some incredible 23 years. In fact, it was often joked—I have no idea whether it was true—when he was encouraged to move to the Senate it was because the Liberal Party couldn't afford the superannuation he'd racked up at that time. I joined the Liberal Party at the time that Sir John was finishing his public career in the Senate, in the late 1980s, but even as a teenage Young Liberal, the legacy of Sir John Carrick was recognised and lauded across the party. My own understanding of Sir John Carrick's role was aided by the fact that one of my first jobs was working for the late John Booth, the then state member for Wakehurst. John, alongside people like Terry Metherell, had been a member of Sir John Carrick's staff while he was a senator for New South Wales.


Sir John had, at that time and throughout his career, a reputation as one of the Liberal Party's greatest political operators. He was courtly, but he was also tough, and I want to note that The Bulletin described him not only as 'the grey eminence of Ash Street', Ash Street being our then headquarters, but also as the 'smiler with a knife'. Like no other estate director, as we now call it, he shaped the affairs of the division, and his hand was in many preselections. In fact, there was a term used to describe his time as general secretary, and that was 'head office factionalism'. He had little truck for the emergence of other factions in the Liberal Party. In fact, most notably, in the late 1960s he put an end to the ambitions of the now notorious Lyenko Urbanchich in Warringah because he was determined to make sure that if there were to be a faction it would be one controlled by head office and one that squarely served the interests of the party.


It's fair to say that, during those years he was general secretary, whilst we had a very competitive preselection system, there was very rarely a candidate who won a preselection who wasn't the candidate preferred or endorsed by Sir John Carrick. That, in part, reflects the fact that Sir John saw himself in the role of general secretary as responsible for the recruitment of candidates. He traversed the state of New South Wales, making sure that the party had the capacity to put forward to parliament candidates of the highest calibre. Many of them were to be fellow returned servicemen, and some of the greats of the Liberal Party in both state and federal politics at the time were people that he recruited from those ranks. He was determined and believed passionately that the success of the Liberal Party depended on the quality of the candidates he put forward. As general secretary, he regarded that as one of the primary obligations he had.


It's hard to fathom the challenge he faced when he first joined the party in the late 1940s. He was there in its infancy. His first role was within months of Menzies founding the party. As general secretary, two years later, at the age of just 30, he had the responsibility of building an entire party organisation effectively from scratch and finding candidates to run immediately for federal and state office. In part, his strength as a general secretary and the influence and success he had was because of the network of field officers he created across the party. Those field officers became his agents, both in electoral politics but also, it's fair to say, in the internal politics of the Liberal Party. When I joined the party, sadly those field officers were in decline, and whilst there were a handful back then, they weren't to last for much longer.


It's also fair to say his time in the Liberal Party was highly personally rewarding. The great love of his life, Lady Angela, was a person he met at those Ash Street headquarters in his early years at the party. She was the party librarian and equally committed to the cause. I'm not sure that that type of relationship would be one that would be permitted today, but it was certainly a very fruitful one for Sir John.


Sir John was far more than simply a machine man for the party. His parliamentary career which followed his retirement as general secretary in the early 1970s is testament to that fact. Throughout both his career in the party organisation and in the Senate, he demonstrated such a deep commitment to the values of our party. My predecessor, Joe Hockey, quoted Sir John in his own maiden speech, and I want to repeat that quote. Joe said:


A true Liberal was described by Sir John Carrick in 1967 as someone who was always concerned about the welfare of the individual, for the creation of opportunities, for the preservation of human dignity and the development of human personality.


It was those values that guided his parliamentary career and perhaps shaped his great passion in public life, which of course was for improving education in Australia. Sir John described the role of education in these terms: 'the real role of education is to stimulate people in mind and spirit for what is a limitless adventure'. That passion for education is reflected in his committee service in the Senate and in his role as the federal education minister during the Fraser government. Importantly, it was a passion that he carried beyond his retirement from the Senate. Most notably, when the Greiner government was elected in 1988, the then education minister, Terry Metherell, and Premier Greiner commissioned Sir John to chair a committee which bore his name, in the form of the Carrick report, which reinvented and reshaped school education in New South Wales. It's a legacy that prevails today.


I also wanted to mention, because it's a passion close to my own heart, the fact that, when was unfashionable to do so, Sir John was one of the earliest advocates to end the death penalty in Australia. In fact, the second speech he gave in the Senate, the very day after he had given his maiden speech, was to support a private member's bill introduced by Lionel Murphy to abolish the death penalty in federal jurisdictions. He at the time was just one of three Liberal senators who exercised a conscience vote to support that bill, which passed the Senate at the time but failed in the House of Representatives; however, it was importantly enacted just a couple of years later.


I only had the privilege of meeting Sir John on a couple of occasions during my own involvement in the Liberal Party. I want to reflect on one of those occasions which, I think, typifies the type of person that Sir John was. In 2005, I had the great pleasure of assisting Joe Hockey in organising North Sydney commemorations for the anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day, what we originally called Victory over Japan. It was a significant commemoration for our veterans. Joe invited Sir John to be the keynote speaker. I vividly remember two things: firstly, his remarks about the values that have been spoken about by other speakers—his commitment to reconciliation, the deep faith he had in human nature, which led him to spend much of his adult life post the Second World War trying to ensure that the horrors of that war did not affect our relationship, not only as individuals but as a nation, with the Japanese people.


Secondly, the thing that struck me about his contribution that day was his extraordinary humility that was reflected in all that he said. It was also reflected in the way he happily spent an hour after the service mingling with schoolchildren who didn't know who Sir John Carrick was. It was the first time in their lives they had met a knight and they were intrigued by that fact and by the impressive medallion he wore as a knight. He happily talked to them and shared his own experiences with those school students for a very long time. It's that humility that we'll most remember Sir John for and it was reflected in his decision to make sure that this family turned down a state funeral—as the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech—because he believed that his life was no more worthy than any of the other veterans who he had served alongside. His humility was reflected when the Liberal Party, over the years, on many occasions discussed whether our own head office should be named in his honour. It was a request or a suggestion that he always turned down because he considered himself a servant of the Liberal Party and no better than any other person who served in that role.


I speak today to honour someone who was a child of the Depression, a soldier for Australia, a survivor of those awful prisoner of war camps that he experienced in South-East Asia, a warrior for the Liberal Party and its values, but, most importantly, someone who was committed to further generations, be they the generations to follow him and his own family, or more broadly across Australia, as his commitment to education was so effectively to demonstrate. We have lost a great Australian, and I extend my sincerest condolences to his family.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (11:28):  I rise today to acknowledge the passing of Sir John Carrick AC, KCMG, an eminent Australian politician, public servant, veteran and leader. Sadly, this comes just weeks after I rose in the chamber to acknowledge the passing of his wife, Lady Angela Carrick AO. Sir John and Lady Angela Carrick were residents of Bradfield for many years, in Bent Street, Lindfield. Sir John was a member of the Killara branch of the Liberal Party for decades. Sir John Carrick was a Liberal senator for New South Wales for many years. He served variously as the Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy, and Leader of the Government in the Senate. He is one of the most distinguished figures in Australian politics over the last 80 years, who was instrumental in working with Sir Robert Menzies to transform the Liberal Party from a fledgling political movement in New South Wales in the 1940s, to the major party it is today. He served for 23 years as the general secretary of the New South Wales Liberal Party and advised countless leaders, including John Howard, Sir Robert Menzies and Malcolm Fraser.


It is worth reflecting on Sir John's remarkable history of service. He served with distinction in the Australian Army in World War II. Enlisting as a lieutenant in the Sydney University Regiment in 1939, he deployed to West Timor in December 1941 with the Australia Army's Sparrow Force. They fought bravely against overwhelming odds before being taken prisoner, and Sir John was a prisoner of war of the Japanese at Changi Prison and spent time on the infamous Thai-Burma railway and at Hellfire Pass. Whilst interred as a prisoner of war, Sir John acquired a considerable command of the Japanese language, which assisted in the communication with his captors.


Sir John earned the respect of his fellow prisoners of war through the way that he supported them, and he described his period in captivity subsequently as a 'great and enduring learning experience'. That speaks volumes of his nature as a human being to be so generous and reflective in his observations on what was undoubtedly a traumatising and appalling experience.


After returning to Australia, Sir John worked as a research officer for the New South Wales Liberal Party from 1946. Two years later, having greatly impressed senior figures in the party, he was appointed General Secretary of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party, and for the next 23 years he built what is arguably the most effective political organisation in the history of politics in New South Wales. He established the template for political engagement and community advocacy within the Liberal Party, and it's worth reflecting on the scale of mass community engagement with political parties at that time. His work was instrumental in the scale of engagement which the Liberal Party was able to have throughout the community. He worked tirelessly, travelling all across the state and throughout communities across New South Wales, encouraging participation and campaigning on the foundational values of the Liberal Party. For people who have been involved in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party for many years such as the member for North Sydney, who spoke previously, and such as I and, of course, many other members and senators in this place, it is instructive to observe how much the institutions and the practices and the values of the modern Liberal Party very much reflect the work that Sir John did in those early days as the party was growing and building momentum.


Elected as a senator for New South Wales in 1971, Sir John served in the parliament with the same efficiency, professionalism and commitment to the community that he demonstrated as General Secretary of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party for 23 years. Of course, he rose to high ministerial office, serving as Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy and Leader of the Government in the Senate. Although he held a number of portfolios, perhaps it is his time as education minister which speaks most to his passions and the contribution that he sought to make to our nation. It was certainly a policy area for which he had great enthusiasm.


One of Sir John Carrick's characteristics is that he did not seek personal fame or reputation. He served the community and the Liberal Party selflessly and he worked to advance the views that he felt resonated throughout the Australian community at a time when, as a nation, we were very much engaged in a process of nation building, recovering from the traumatic experience of World War II and throwing open the national arms to people from around the world as our population grew, as our confidence grew and as the scale of our nation grew. Sir John was absolutely critical to that process.


He was, in every way, deserving of the title, which is often accorded to his generation, in our country and others—the greatest generation—those who sacrificed so much in World War II and went on to build their nations. His is a life story of experience in extraordinary hardship and privation, including some quite challenging times as a child and teenager during the Depression. He devoted himself to the task of shaping our nation and, particularly, shaping our political life. 


As a young man, he fought for Australia's freedom and for our values as a soldier. As a party official and parliamentarian, he spent decades fighting for freedom and fighting for Australian values, and he did so with enormous effectiveness. There is no person who better encapsulates the values for which the Liberal Party stands. He stood for aspiration, he stood for community involvement, and he stood for fairness and equality of opportunity. He believed deeply in the inherent value of individual freedom and the centrality of free enterprise to a successful and fair society. 


It is, therefore, with great sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Sir John Carrick AC, KCMG and the loss of one of Australia's most distinguished leaders and faithful servants. On behalf of the people of Bradfield, I particularly express our collective sadness at the deaths of Sir John and of Lady Angela Carrick within such a short space of time. They are survived by their daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona, and their extended family, and I express my condolences to the extended family.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (11:37):  I rise to honour and pay tribute to the late Senator Sir John Carrick—as the Prime Minister says, a lion of the New South Wales Liberal Party, an exemplar of dignity and character, a wonderful mentor and, indeed, friend. 


When I first joined the New South Wales Liberal Party in 1968, Senator Carrick was then the general secretary of the party. I was pleased to be able to attend his memorial service last Saturday, along with some now not-as-young Young Liberals, Philip and Heather Ruddock, Robyn Kerr, Bruce McCarthy and many others. Former Senator Nick Minchin was also in Sydney but unable to attend the service, so I offered to include his words today: 'It was a great privilege to know John Carrick and be inspired by him to follow in his footsteps as a Liberal state director, senator and government leader in the Senate. John was a true Liberal hero, a humble man and great man who was an inspiration to so many of us.' 


As you would expect, it was a moving service with wonderful eulogies and memories from family and friends—from former Prime Minister John Howard and Sir John Carrick's biographer, Graeme Starr, to his grandchildren, all of course Pa's favourite, and all with loving and special childhood memories. I should note that the service was held at one of Sydney's historic churches, St Paul's Burwood, which is just two years shy of being 150 years old and notably still has real bells and bellringers and at the end of the service the bells were rung 99 times, once for each year of Sir John's life. 


Senator Carrick, as I knew him, was one of a number World War II veterans on both sides of the House and the Senate who came to politics after the war with a deep and abiding commitment to public service in the very best sense of those words. Then Senator Robert Cotton convinced him to stand for the Senate and I feel honoured and privileged to have worked for him. Indeed, when I joined his staff in 1975 the Senate included Robert Cotton, John Carrick, Ivor Greenwood and Reg Withers, a most formidable team. He was a generous, considerate and inclusive boss. Always proper and always on top of his brief, he was a good friend whose political advice was worth its weight in gold, as was his advice generally. Even after I left his staff and moved to Queensland he was always available whenever I needed advice. He could always find time to talk, even to a junior staffer just starting in politics.


Like my father, a prisoner of war, his character was forged through war, Changi and the Burma railway. He described his captivity as 'a great and enduring learning experience', which through 'the strong amalgam of mateship' disclosed reserves of spirituality and moral strength in his fellow prisoners. I remember how concerned he was when veterans with whom he had served, who like him has survived and come home and rebuilt their lives, had later need to apply for a TPI pension. He always stressed the importance of staying fit, physically and mentally. Every day that I worked for him, he went for either a walk or a swim and every morning he would give the staff a small puzzle or riddle to ensure that we exercised our minds.


I paid tribute to Sir John Carrick in my maiden speech in this place as a special leader, a great mentor and a man of immeasurable compassion. I noted that, when considering new legislation, he always cautioned us to be mindful of our responsibility to assist those in need, and, as we all know, he was passionate about the importance of education. In establishing the Carrick Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, Dr Brendan Nelson, as the then minister for education, said of him:


Sir John Carrick has made an enormous contribution to our country.


…   …   …


He did many things, but one of them was the establishment of the National Tertiary Education Commission, to play for the first time, a serious role in co-ordinating the higher education sector throughout Australia and at arm's length from Government ... of all of the people that I have met in my adult life there are few that I consider more noble and decent, nor intelligent nor committed to the cause of education ...


The name of the Carrick Institute was immediately accepted throughout the university sector and beyond. Even in political circles there was no express disapproval and the Carrick Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education was an immediate success. I can still recall the day, many years earlier, when we were unable to leave our offices in Chifley Square as a result of a large student protest outside. As staff and security officers rushed around in a panic trying to find ways to get the minister out of the building, we turned and found Senator Carrick calmly cutting out paper dolls for the then very young Melanie Howard.


At the memorial service on Saturday, we were all given a white rose and a copy of a poem that Senator Carrick had handwritten with a notation: 'I've no idea of its origin or author. I doubt that I've ever seen it in print. It is out of my childhood.' Indeed, it exemplifies how Senator Carrick approached his life. Well, Senator Carrick, I will now read it into Hansard so that it is in print with your name for perpetuity. It's known as The Bridge Builder and reads:


An old man going a lone highway,


Came, at the evening cold and gray,


To a chasm vast and deep and wide.


Through which was flowing a sullen tide


The old man crossed in the twilight dim,


The sullen stream had no fear for him;


But he turned when safe on the other side


And built a bridge to span the tide.


 ""Old man,"" said a fellow pilgrim near,


""You are wasting your strength with building here;


Your journey will end with the ending day,


You never again will pass this way;


You've crossed the chasm, deep and wide,


Why build this bridge at evening tide?""


The builder lifted his old gray head;


""Good friend, in the path I have come,"" he said,


""There followeth after me to-day


A youth whose feet must pass this way.


…   …   …


He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;


Good friend, I am building this bridge for him!""


Sir John Carrick's generation of senators and members set standards that are applicable today because they stand the test of time. Knowing Senator Carrick also included knowing his wonderful family: his wife, Lady Angela Carrick, who sadly passed away just a few months ago, and his daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona. My thoughts are with them and their children and grandchildren. Just as your mother made such an enormous contribution generally and to the Girl Guides movement in particular, your father was a giant of a man whose contribution to our nation should never be underestimated.


I'd like to finish with Sir John Carrick's own profound words. He said:


Man has always shown himself more willing to seek to understand his material environment than to understand himself or his neighbours. Indeed, in recent decades, we have given great prominence to the physicists, the chemists, the engineers, and their kindred scientists, while failing to appreciate that mankind's currently intractable problems are those essentially for the philosopher, the educator, the psychologist and the political scientist.


Senator Carrick, I'm honoured to have known you and your family. May you rest in peace.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (11:45):  I rise to pay tribute to the late the Hon. Sir John Carrick AC, KCMG. I never met Sir John Carrick and I did not know him personally. Nonetheless, I know him by his reputation for his contribution to our great party, the Liberal Party, the movement and the cause of liberalism in Australia and also his service to our great nation. Sir John Carrick was elected to the Senate in 1970 and served until his retirement in 1987. He had a long and illustrious political career, including rising to the level of Minister for Housing and Construction, Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Minister for Education and the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Federal Affairs, National Development and Energy.


The interest I have in Sir John Carrick is not just about his roles and professional capacity but the values and philosophy that sit at the heart of his liberalism. Liberalism is the greatest political philosophy the world has ever known. It has endured over every type of 'ism' and extremism that has ever reared its head in competition. Over time, through the process of understanding of the human condition and our aspiration, it has endured against incredible difficulties at times. Sir John Carrick represented the best of that tradition. He understood that the foundations of liberalism were to aspire to a society where people are free to choose their life and their circumstances, free to be able to change their circumstances if they found them undesirable, and free to live their lives as they want, understanding not just the primacy of the rights of the individual but, importantly, the foundational building block of our country, which is the family, towards community and, ultimately, nationhood.


Critically, Sir John Carrick understood that the foundation of liberalism was also anchored in a sense of justice—not just respect towards the individual but our collective bond and sharing responsibility to each other. He recognised on so many occasions the importance of a sense of national unity, particularly around rejecting a lot of sectarian elements that existed within Australian society at the time. There was no better demonstration of that than his advocacy for public funding for faith based schools, particularly the Catholic system. He recognised that, no matter who you are, if you want to live an enlivened life of freedom and choice, you have to have choice about where you go to school and, equally, where you seek to have your children go to school.


In his first speech, Sir John Carrick made remarks along these lines: 'I do not stand for any section of the community. The people I represent are not represented by the size of their pay packets, by colour or shirt collar, or by the nature of their religious devotion. Divisiveness is the evil of politics, and I hope to do something to reduce it.' Throughout his political career, Sir John Carrick did just that—by focusing on that sense of unity and purpose, national identity and freedom of choice. He was a man of his times. When I read his history and some of his contributions, I did raise my eyebrows. In particular, there was his advocacy for the virtues of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. But, as I said, he was a man of his times.


Critically, though, he was a man who understood that the heart of any successful political career and the heart of the pursuit of what the Liberal Party should stand for was anchored in values and philosophy. He wrote extensively about this, particularly for the public, in various contributions. It struck me in David Clune's review of a more recent book titled Carrick: Principles, Politics and Policy. Clune wrote of Carrick that his:


… definition of Liberal philosophy placed much emphasis on 'the potential of the individual'. It rejected both laissez-faire and collectivism as threats to 'the development of individual dignity'.


He understood that the Liberal Party must be a party for every Australian.


More than anything else, when you read through his history and his contribution to public life, Carrick represented the foundations of great Liberal philosophy and then sought to put it into practice. He understood that the foundation of liberalism is a cultural and institutional conservatism. In fact, I found an article from 1973 where he was arguing that, in the choice of a new national anthem, God Save the Queen should at least be part of the selection choices. He understood the power of symbols and of the institutions that we have inherited and the importance of their roles continuing on into the future.


But, critically, he also understood the power of economic and social liberalism to chart a course for the future of the country. He understood that the future of this country was not bound solely by its past but that there are alternative choices about whether we seek to be a liberal democracy or a social democracy and that the Liberal Party and its values are enlivened best when we extol the virtues of liberalism and a forward-looking vision for our country. To quote his first speech again in my closing remarks:


I have one great hope. I believe that in the vision of the future to meet the challenges of the future, the great solutions and the great motivations not being created by economic instruments will be created by a new philosophy of education. … in rethinking our education research, in studying as our main subject not material science but man, we will come some way towards the solutions. It is high time man was less preoccupied with material science and more preoccupied with the only study that matters—man.


That is to say that we should always have a vision of how we can shape the future. May he rest in peace.

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (11:52):  I stand today to speak on the memory of a great Australian, Sir John Leslie Carrick AC, KCMG. Sir John Carrick was a man who lived a full and rich 99 years of life. He was a father, a husband, a soldier, a politician and a friend of many.


Sir John first heeded the call of patriotism and service to his country in 1940, when he joined the Australian Imperial Force. In 1943 Sir John was captured and taken as a Japanese prisoner of war. He spent more than three years in prison camps, including the infamous Changi Prison camp in Singapore. He also worked on the Burma-Thailand Railway, where he endured the brutality and cruelty displayed towards Australian prisoners of war. Despite all of this, Sir John's love of his country endured, and when he returned to Australia he did not lose his patriotic resolve.


Sir John is seen by many as one of the people most responsible for developing the Liberal Party from an idea into the most representative and influential political party in Australian politics. Sir John served as a Liberal Party senator for the state of New South Wales between 1971 and 1987. During this time he held multiple ministerial positions in the Fraser government, including Minister for National Development and Energy, Minister for Education, Minister for Urban and Regional Development and Minister for Housing and Construction.


I first met Sir John about 20 years ago, and I only met him twice. He spoke clearly about the importance of Liberal ideals in a modern society but, most critically, about how, when they fall in and out of favour—despite the fact that they are timeless—and when they are forgotten, they too often lead to oppression. I once asked him why he was so strongly supportive of state support for Catholic schools in the 1960s. It was one of the most powerful statements that I've heard in public life. He said, 'When I was a prisoner in Changi they didn't ask you if you were a Catholic or a Protestant, because we were all Australians. We were all there fighting to survive but also fighting to preserve freedom and our country. I was not,' he said, 'fighting for a Catholic Australia or a Protestant Australia. I was fighting for Australia, no more, no less.' So when he returned to Australia and found law firms that were Catholic and law firms that were Protestant—even department stores that only employed Catholics and other department stores that only employed Protestants—he said, 'This is not the Australia I had been fighting for. More importantly, this is not the Australia that many of my comrades had died for, that my comrades in arms had died to protect.' So when the time came, when this issue had reached its pinnacle, he said to Menzies, who was then the Prime Minister: 'This is not the country that I fought and suffered for. I fought for a country where your religion did not matter, and that is what state support meant to me.'


Sir John's memory lives on in the hearts and minds of all those in the Liberal Party. As a titan of the Liberal Party—as one of the great three, as Anthony Albanese described him—his name will be remembered in the league of our two most loyal servants: former prime ministers Sir Robert Menzies and John Howard.


Sir John's beloved wife, Lady Angela Carrick AO, like him dedicated her life to the service of others, including her time spent as Chief Commissioner of Girl Guides Australia in the mid-1980s. She passed away in February of this year. I recognise her and her commitment to this country as well.


On behalf of myself and the people of Mackellar, I offer my most heartfelt condolences to his three daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona, as well as to the whole Carrick family. To Sir John I say, 'Thank you for your service to your country through your time in the armed services and in the Australian Senate. Thank you for your contribution to the Liberal Party and for the advice and support you provided to me early on in my career.' Lest we forget.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Gee
):  I understand that it's the wish of honourable members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places, and I ask all present to do so.




Honourable members having stood in their places—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the Federation Chamber.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
) (16:01):  Before I call the minister to propose a schedule for consideration of the portfolios, I'd like to remind all members of the purpose of the consideration in detail stage and outline the way it is expected to proceed. Shortly, the Federation Chamber will be asked to agree to a proposed schedule for the times for consideration of portfolios. This may need to be varied upon. It is a useful guide to assist ministers and members to arrange their commitments. Chairs will not be seeking to enforce this arrangement strictly.


Consideration in detail is a debate, and the call will be alternated between the government and non-government sides as always. Even though this debate sometimes takes the format of question and answer, this is not question time. Ministers and government backbench members both will be considered as speakers on the government side, and should bear this in mind when they seek the call. All speakers are required to be relevant to whichever portfolio is being examined, but there is no requirement of direct relevance in respect of any responses. It might be practical for ministers to respond to more than one speaker when they seek the call, and I note that this general arrangement applied last year and seemed to allow maximum participation in this stage of debate. Each minister and member will have up to five minutes to speak each time they are called, but they may wish to speak for a shorter time. Ministers may wish to make an introductory statement when debate on their portfolios begins, but, as they are not moving amendments, that is a matter for them to decide.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (16:03):  For the convenience of the chamber, I won't make an opening statement. May I suggest that it might suit the Federation Chamber to consider the items of proposed expenditure in the order and groupings shown in the schedule, which has been circulated to honourable members? I also take the opportunity to indicate to the Federation Chamber that the proposed order for consideration of portfolios estimates has been discussed with the opposition, and there has been no objection to what is proposed.
