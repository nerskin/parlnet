Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  Madam Chair, an amendment has been moved, has it not?



The CHAIR:  We did put and pass some amendments. Opposition amendment (1) was passed just before 7.20 yesterday evening. It's up to you; I'm in your hands.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I'm happy to move mine. It's just that, on the running order, the Greens amendments are first.



The CHAIR:  That's fine, Senator Leyonhjelm. You've got the call.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8368 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 4, page 4 (after line 23), after the definition of on-demand program service, insert:



outdoor public place

means an outdoor place to which the public, or a section of the public, ordinarily has access, whether or not by payment or by invitation (including, for example, the open air areas of an outdoor concert or sportsground).


(2) Schedule 1, item 18, page 8 (after line 23), after subsection 9B(6), insert:


(7) For the purposes of this section, an intimate imagedoes not include a drawing, painting or sketch (whether still or moving).




(8)

For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), an intimate imagedoes not include images of a person in an outdoor public place. 


















2






Today we're debating the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. It's a bill supposed to deal with revenge porn, but it goes beyond that in ways that could slap $100,000 fines on people who are not posting revenge porn, including journalists.


My amendments exclude drawings, paintings and sketches from the definition of 'image'. I note that, on page 23, the explanatory memorandum says that the definition of an image includes a drawing. My amendment seeks to exclude these drawings, paintings and sketches so that a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for merely posting a drawing, painting or sketch of someone. If I posted a picture or, indeed, a drawing of President Donald Trump urinating in Central Park, I shouldn't face a $100,000 fine.


My amendments also exclude certain images taken in outdoor public places from the definition of 'intimate image'. As a result, a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for merely posting a picture of someone doing a typically private act in an outdoor public place. For example, if I posted a photo of President Donald Trump urinating in Central Park where no rude bits are showing, I shouldn't face a $100,000 fine.


There is a further result of my amendment regarding outdoor public places. The bill allows a $100,000 fine to be slapped on someone for posting a picture of someone without religious or cultural attire when that person consistently wears religious attire in public. This is reasonable if the picture was taken when the person was on private property or in a public toilet, but it's not reasonable if the picture was taken of the person in an outdoor public place. My amendment would ensure a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for posting a picture of a person out of their usual religious or cultural attire if the person was in an outdoor public place at the time. 


For example, a picture of Cardinal George Pell without his collar would, potentially, come under this bill. A picture of a nun who wasn't wearing her habit in public would, potentially, offend against this bill. A woman who normally wears a burqa but wasn't wearing a burqa in public and had her picture taken would, potentially, offend against this bill, unless my amendment succeeds. 


I acknowledge that the bill already attempts to limit the capacity to impose fines by saying they only apply in circumstances in which an ordinary reasonable person could reasonably expect to be afforded privacy, but this is vague. My additional limitation regarding outdoor public places would add some much-needed clarity. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:36):  Senator Leyonhjelm has asked me to look closely at his amendments, which I have done. I can seek to provide some context to this particular part of the legislation. Let me start with the exclusion of a drawing, painting or sketch from a definition of an 'intimate image' that Senator Leyonhjelm is seeking. 


Under the bill, an intimate image can be a still visual image, such as a photograph, or moving visual images, such as video recordings. Images could be photographs, modified photographs, animations, drawings or other depictions of the person, such as what is known as morph porn, and fake pornographic videos also known as deep fakes. There are exemptions in the bill whereby, if an ordinary reasonable person considered the posting or the sharing of the image acceptable in certain circumstances, it would not be captured by the prohibition. Obviously, we have in mind there things such as satirical drawings or parodies. 


Moving to Senator Leyonhjelm seeking to exclude 'outdoor public place' in the definition of an intimate image, the definition of 'intimate image' includes depiction of a private activity where material will be an intimate image of a person if it depicts or appears to depict the person in a state of undress, using the toilet, showering, having a bath, engaged in a sexual act of a kind not ordinarily done in public or engaged in other like activity in circumstances in which an ordinary reasonable person would reasonably be expected to be afforded privacy. It wouldn't include a situation where a person is in their swimmers at the beach or showering at the beach. 


The government remains of the view that the current definition does afford protection in circumstances where they would expect privacy. I certainly appreciate the sentiment and the motivation of Senator Leyonhjelm and, as he requested, we did look closely at his amendments, but the government aren't, at this point, minded to support those amendments. Obviously, legislation of this sort is always kept under review in the light of practical experience and its real-world operation. The Senate has already determined that there will be a statutory review in three years time, but, in the outworking of legislation, if there appear to be issues before that time, that is naturally something that I'm sure all colleagues would want to examine.

Would a picture of Cardinal George Pell not wearing his collar, his normal religious attire, offend against this legislation? Would a nun who was not wearing her habit but who normally wore her habit was photographed in a public place, would that offend against this legislation?

In response to each of those three examples, the answer would be no. But I do just add the caveat that context is important in these matters and it would depend whether there was some other offensive depiction which might trigger this legislation. But, just in the pared-back examples you have given, the answer would be no in each case.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (09:42):  We do not support these amendments. I would like to remind Senator Leyonhjelm that just because a woman steps into a public space doesn't mean she no longer has a right to privacy and protection. I would think that this is a rather easily understandable point to make and it surprises me that it is lost on the senator in this case. Individuals must have, and can reasonably expect, privacy in various situations where they are in outdoor spaces. An obvious example of a phenomenon that is increasing and quite troubling in this area is upskirting and down-blousing. The highly offensive insinuation, I would argue, behind this amendment, as I have said, is that just because a woman, or any other person, steps out in public, they have given their consent for inappropriate and humiliating images to be taken and shared. Quite frankly, that is a disgusting insinuation to make. We proudly do not support these amendments, and I cannot for the life of me begin to think why such things would be put forward in this place.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:44):  I rise in defence of Senator Leyonhjelm. I do not take it that Senator Leyonhjelm's proposed amendments are based on the sorts of inferences that Senator Steele-John has made, that Senator Leyonhjelm is in any way a supporter of or wants to see legislative exemptions for the inappropriate depiction of women. 


While the government isn't minded to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not question for one second Senator Leyonhjelm's motivation. Senator Leyonhjelm's seeking to examine legislation, to test it and to ensure that, as well as protections, there aren't liberties that are needlessly infringed. I do feel compelled to reject the insinuations that Senator Steele-John makes in terms of the motivation of Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. As I said, while we're not minded to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments;  nevertheless, we do fully appreciate the spirit in which he has moved them.

Senator HANSON

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:46):  My view would be that a courtroom is not a private place and that individuals should comply with what they are directed to do within a courtroom. I'm sure that that context would be taken into account. Also, courts themselves will have certain rules in relation to what can be photographed and what can be recorded, for that matter, within their confines.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendments (1) and (2), moved by Senator Leyonhjelm, on sheet 8368 be agreed to.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-02-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:55):  I move Liberal Democrats amendment (3) on sheet 8368:


(3) Schedule 1, item 18, page 10 (lines 1 to 13), omit section 9E, substitute:




9E Consent



For the purposes of the application of this Act to an intimate image, consentmeans consent that is:


(a) express; and


(b) voluntary; and


(c) informed;


but does not include:


(d) consent given by a person who is in a mental or physical condition (whether temporary or permanent) that


   (i) makes the person incapable of giving consent; or












(ii) substantially impairs the capacity of the person to give consent


This amendment prevents a $100,000 fine from being slapped on a person for posting an image of a child if the child consents to the posting of the image. I point out that a child is anyone under the age of 18. Currently the bill states that a child cannot give consent to the posting of their image, so even if a 17-year-old urged their friend or partner, who may also be 17, to post the image, that friend or partner could face a $100,000 fine under the bill as it stands.


If the image depicts a child in a sexual pose or sexual act, or with someone in a sexual pose or act, or if the image depicts a child's sexual organs, anal region or a female child's breasts then the image is child pornography. Regardless of the claims a person who posts such an image makes about consent, posting such an image is a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years imprisonment, a fine of more than $100,000 or both. The only purpose of ruling out consent by a child in this bill is to impose fines upon a person for posting an image of a consenting child that isn't pornographic. It could be a picture of a child picking their nose or eating their earwax, which seems to be a qualification for becoming a leader of the Labor Party.


I urge senators not to let legitimate concerns about child pornography colour their views about a bill that is not about child pornography. A 17-year-old can consent to the posting of an image of them picking their nose, and the person who does the posting shouldn't face a $100,000 fine for doing so. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:57):  I indicate that the government won't be supporting this amendment. Under the bill, consent to share an intimate image cannot be given by a child, who is a person under the age of 18, as Senator Leyonhjelm points out. This is because, to the extent that the definition of intimate image overlaps with the definition of child sexual exploitation material in the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995, a lower age of consent for the distribution of intimate images would create an inappropriate inconsistency between the criminal and civil frameworks. The effect of this item is that a person under the age of 18 cannot provide consent to the sharing by another person of an intimate image of themselves, as distribution of this image would effectively constitute distribution of exploitative material. I should also point out that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will, under this legislation, adopt a graduated approach to enforcing prohibitions: firstly, seeking the non-formal resolution of a complaint; then issuing formal written warnings, infringement notices and so on; and ultimately through to civil penalties, if those are warranted.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:58):  If I understand this correctly, you're arguing that because of an inappropriate inconsistency if two friends, both of whom are 17, came to an agreement that they would have a nose-picking contest and would take and post pictures of each other picking their noses, and continued to do so repeatedly, notwithstanding warnings from the eSafety Commissioner, potentially they would be each exposed to $100,000 fines. You're saying that because of inappropriate inconsistency with laws relating to child pornography, you can't do anything to mitigate that rather absurd situation?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:59):  In the first instance, someone would need to lodge a complaint. It would also have to be something that an ordinary, reasonable person would consider inappropriate. As with all these things, it's to do with context, but I wouldn't imagine that the particular case or example that Senator Leyonhjelm has cited would result in the consequences that he's flagged.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:00):  If normal, reasonable people like you and me, Minister, were eSafety commissioners, perhaps you could imagine that it wouldn't descend to the point where somebody would receive a $100,000 fine. My point is this: what is to stop that from occurring if the eSafety Commissioner were not as normal and reasonable as you and I?

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:03):  I just want to clarify this; I was preoccupied and am not sure whether I heard your answer correctly. Who will be responsible, subject to a complaint, for the penalty that's imposed in this respect? Senator Leyonhjelm's concern was that a child, a 17-year-old, could be fined $100,000. I'm sympathetic to the point that we accept that children are allowed to make decisions to get into sexual relationships with their peers from the age of 16. Yet we're saying that they're not able to consent to having an intimate image—which conjures up all sorts of suggestions; however, it's not child pornography, as we've described—publicly displayed. Further, I question the circumstances such as the Bill Henson pictures, which caused such a controversy so many years ago—I note the Prime Minister has some—which depicted children in an artistic setting, apparently, without the benefit of clothes. Are they deemed to be intimate pictures, and would someone like Mr Henson be subject to these sorts of penalties?

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:05):  Minister, I'm sorry, maybe you misunderstood my question. Sharing images with third parties—we're not talking about child pornography; we're talking about intimate images, which conjures up scenarios where people anticipate it's pornography, but I think Senator Leyonhjelm's made the point it's not. So where does it leave the circumstance where you have someone like Mr Henson, who is a photographer who takes photos of prepubescent children in a state of undress? Those children are not eligible or able to give consent to having those photos taken, yet what happens if someone shares those images or puts them on public display? Where is this line drawn? I come back to the other point: how is it that children—and this is once again an emotive term, but it's a legal term—minors, are able to have sexual relationships with their peers at the age of 16, and we say they're mature enough, and we're realistic enough to make that assessment, yet they're not able to consent to having their images displayed in a manner of their choosing, in the scenarios which Senator Leyonhjelm has put forward?

 (South Australia) (10:07):  I just raise the question again: so it's okay for an 'artist'—and, for the benefit of Hansard, I put that in quotation marks—to take naked pictures of prepubescent children, but it's not okay for a 17-year-old to say, 'I'm happy for you to publish an image of me that's not a sexual image' to one of their peers? I just find this unusual, and I think that Senator Leyonhjelm makes a valid point—that we attribute any number of things to young adults, albeit, they are minors. We allow them to choose to smoke cigarettes if that's what they do, by legally allowing them to buy them; we allow them to engage in sexual relations; we have people who are advocating that they be allowed to vote; and yet we're not enabling them to consent to having their image shared in the manner in which they choose to do it. I just find that's not consistent with the approach of this legislation.

 (New South Wales) (10:11):  I move Liberal Democrats amendment (4) on sheet 8368:


(4) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (line 17), omit paragraph 44B(1)(d).


As currently drafted, the bill allows someone who posts an image to be hit with a $100,000 fine if they are ordinarily resident in Australia or if the person depicted is ordinarily resident in Australia. This means an Australian could be hit with a fine when no image of an Australian is depicted, so no Australian is harmed. That is wrong. It is the role of our government to protect Australians from harm, not to make Australians conform with a model of behaviour that is harmless to any other Australians. Posting a picture of President Donald Trump going to the toilet in Trump Tower might be in poor taste, but it should not be against Australian law. The government serves the people, not the other way around. The government is not our mother and it is not our nanny.


My amendment would limit the bill so that someone who posts an image could be hit with a $100,000 fine only if the person depicted is ordinarily resident in Australia. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:12):  Senator Leyonhjelm is correct. Under the bill, if there is an Australian link, such as the perpetrator or the victim being ordinarily resident in Australia, the commissioner will be able to exercise his or her powers, including issuing removal notices to sites hosted in overseas jurisdictions. The proposed amendment would mean that the prohibition would only apply if the person depicted in the image is ordinarily resident in Australia, to my understanding. The effect of the amendment would prevent the commissioner exercising his or her powers if the victim wasn't ordinarily resident in Australia. The government won't be supporting the amendment.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:14):  I would like to clarify the point that Senator Leyonhjelm raised. You are saying that if they are a non-Australian and a photo was taken of them which they are not happy with, they can make a complaint with regard to that photo being taken. Therefore, if it goes through the legal system, would they pay for the court case or would it be the Australian taxpayer?


On the other hand, if they are a foreigner who's taken the photo of an Australian resident and they are charged and fined over it, how are we going to recover that money from them and who pays that cost?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:15):  To clarify, the perpetrator or the victim has to be Australian. In terms of who would pay for the enforcement activity, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner has a budget, and within that budget they would, firstly, seek a non-formal resolution of the complaint—if necessary, formal written warnings and infringement notices. Beyond that, matters would go to the Federal Court, who obviously have a budget for their particular activities. In short, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner is provisioned with resources to support the activities outlined in the legislation. 


Question negatived.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:16):  by leave—I move Liberal Democratic Party amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 8368:


(5) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (lines 23 to 26), omit the note.


(6) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (after line 26), after subsection 44B(2), insert:


(2A) Despite section 96 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, in proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of subsection (1), the person does not bear an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2) of this section.


Despite the bill's title, the bill doesn't ban the non-consensual sharing of intimate images; instead, the bill bans the sharing of intimate images and then provides an exception for instances where the depicted person consents. This drafting approach matters because it puts the onus on the person facing the $100,000 fine to prove that the depicted person consented to the image being posted. It would be difficult for either side of a dispute about a posted image to prove consent or the absence of consent. In some cases, there'll be evidence confirming conversations about plans to post the image but in many cases there will be no such evidence. 


I refer to my example of the nose-picking contest—if somebody disagrees or disputes that they posted consent. That highlights the difficulties. The difficulties don't justify reversing the well-founded convention that the party seeking to impose a penalty must prove behaviour in the circumstances that would justify such a penalty. My amendment would simply undo the reversal of the onus of proof. I'm hoping the Senate could be clear eyed on this matter, particularly given that revenge porn involves allegations about female perpetrators as well as male perpetrators. I commend the amendments.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:18):  Under the bill, consent to share an image must be express, voluntary and informed. The evidential burden of proof that consent was given—Senator Leyonhjelm was correct—lies with the person who shared the image in any civil penalty proceedings. Again, I emphasise that this doesn't relate to the sharing of images between two people; this relates to the sharing of those with a third party. Given the serious impact that this conduct of sharing beyond the individuals involved has on the victim, the government is of the view that it's appropriate that the alleged perpetrator prove consent to share an image.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:19):  The proposed amendments go towards addressing the concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. However, we do not believe that the civil penalty is akin to the criminal offence, as suggested by the committee. The penalty provisions are expressly classified as civil penalties. As such, there is no consequence in the form of criminal record. The high penalty reflects the serious nature of sharing an intimate image without consent and the harm and distress that that can then cause. Key concerns that we have expressed in the past related to the burden of proof on the complainant under the use of a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. We do not support placing undue pressure on victims in these cases. The reversal of the burden of proof in this instance allows the commissioner to investigate and determine matters based on evidence that is in the mind of the person around the nature of consent, whether it is expressly given or expressly not given or absent entirely. As such, we do not support these amendments.

(6) Schedule 1, item 26, page 21 (line 28), omit ""A person"", substitute ""An adult"".


As I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate, we have serious concerns around the, hopefully, unintended implications of this legislation for the people under the age of 18 who will potentially face steep civil penalties under this regime. The government have indicated that the application of these penalties to people under the age of 18 is not their intention; however, to ensure that this unintended consequence does not arise, we seek to have this limitation enshrined in the legislation.


I would like to remind the chamber that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's general comment No. 10 states:


Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and their emotional and educational needs. Such differences constitute the basis for the lesser culpability of children in conflict with the law. These and other differences are the reasons for a separate juvenile justice system and require a different treatment for children. The protection of the best interests of the child means, for instance, that the traditional objectives of criminal justice, such as repression/retribution, must give way to rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in dealing with child offenders. This can be done in concert with attention to effective public safety.


The Law Council of Australia also notes:


Financial penalties will rarely be appropriate for children and young people. The Law Council suggests that the civil penalties regime could include not only infringement notices, formal warnings and take down notices, but also diversionary/rehabilitation processes, such as the possibility of a conference, attendance at counselling and participating in courses relating to cyber bullying and sexting.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:32):  Thank you, Senator Steele-John. The government won't be supporting the amendments moved by the Australian Greens. The penalties apply to all persons to ensure that there is a strong deterrent to engaging in the sharing of intimate images without consent.


In practice, as Senator Steele-John alluded to, the eSafety Commissioner will take a very cautious approach in relation to any complaint made against a perpetrator under 18 years of age. The eSafety Commissioner will firstly look to engage with the perpetrator in an informal manner and change behaviour. This informal approach has been successful under the existing cyberbullying regime. The commissioner does have the discretion to use other light-touch remedies, including issuing a formal warning notice. It is expected only light-touch remedies would be required in matters involving a perpetrator under 18 years of age. Strong remedies, including civil penalties, would only be used in exceptional cases, such as for a repeat offender where other remedies have been ineffective.


A contravention of the prohibition in the bill and/or a failure to comply with a removal notice triggers a civil penalty order provision contained in the Regulatory Powers Act. If the eSafety Commissioner does decide to apply for a civil penalty order, the court has the discretion as to whether it orders the person to pay the penalty. When determining the appropriate penalty amount, the court must take into account matters including the nature and extent of the contravention; the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in any similar activity. So I think there are important things to bear in mind in terms of the operation of this legislation.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:34):  I'd like to ask the minister whether he is aware that there is a very, very substantive amount of research in the area of child justice that directly contravenes the idea of the application of criminal or civil penalties to people under the age of 18, due to the physiological reality that the development of a child is not at the same stage as the development of an adult and so it is most appropriate to apply diversionary, rehabilitative and educational approaches in those cases. It is my view that it was never the intention of the government to have this criminal regime apply to children, because I cannot in good conscience imagine that the minister, who is a man of great capacity, could possibly believe that it would in any circumstance be productive or just to apply a penalty of up to $107,000 to a child. So I would ask the minister again: is he comfortable with the possibility created by this legislation of applying such a penalty to children in the face of overwhelming evidence given in many forums, including by commissioners of this government, that such approaches are simply not effective, nor just, in relation to children?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:36):  I should point out that this is not a criminal regime for underage individuals that is being proposed here. This is a civil penalties regime that has application to the whole community. As I indicated before, the intention is that this is something that would be used in the case of repeat offenders, where other remedies have been ineffective. Senator Steele-John is quite right to point out there is a range of alternative remedies and it's appropriate that they are pursued. But, where you have repeat offenders, it is appropriate that we have a civil penalties regime in place. Just because a person is under the age of 18 does not mean that they are necessarily without the capacity to determine right from wrong. We are very much of the view that this is appropriate.


If I do follow the logic of what Senator Steele-John has said, however, I would assume, although I suspect it's not the case, that Senator Steele-John will not be supporting the criminal provisions put forward by NXT, because, to my understanding, they would apply to people below the age of 18. The government is not putting in place, through this legislation, a criminal regime to apply to people below the age of 18. I'm not suggesting that, where there are criminal provisions, they shouldn't apply to people below the age of 18, but I'm just seeking to follow the thread through with Senator Steele-John as to what the implications of his position in relation to the civil penalties regime might be for his stance in relation to criminal penalties amendments that might be moved later.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:38):  As the minister has rightly noted, it would be only in extreme cases that we would reach the stage of intervention in relation to children. Would the minister not agree that there are almost, imaginably, no cases in which a person below the age of 18 would be able to feasibly meet a civil penalty of $107,000? In fact, the burden of meeting this penalty would fall upon the child's family or extended family. In that case, wouldn't it simply be better to follow the advice of the Australian Law Council, guided by the views of the United Nations and embodied within the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and put in place a comprehensive, diversionary, educated, evidence based approach to dealing with this very serious issue in relation to children?


I would also remind the minister at this point in time that these questions with regard to the action of civil penalty regimes on children and their possible impacts are something we could have explored had the government agreed to my suggestion to allow the Senate to perform its role as a house of review and refer this bill to committee. These are serious issues which relate to the community as a whole, with a massive impact on children, both as victims and as perpetrators. This is a complex legislative area and, while I appreciate that the minister is providing us with the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation in this period, it would have been so much easier to answer these questions and produce a piece of legislation as robust, comprehensive and durable as that which is deserved by the victims of this most heinous crime.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:41):  I should point out that the civil penalties are only up to $105,000. As I've indicated before, if there were to be a civil penalty sought by the eSafety Commissioner through the Federal Court then it would be in circumstances where other remedies have been ineffective—where there'd been a repeat offender—and the courts, in determining the appropriate penalty amount, again, have to take into account the nature and extent of the contravention, the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered, the circumstances of the contravention, and whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in similar conduct. The courts can also determine not to apply a civil penalty. But, again, I emphasise that the eSafety Commissioner would firstly seek a non-formal resolution of the complaint, followed if necessary by a formal written warning, followed if necessary by an infringement notice. They have the option of enforceable undertakings, injunctions and, ultimately, civil penalties. So there are really six layers of the graduated approach that could be taken in these circumstances.


In terms of consultation, there was extensive public consultation last year. Senator Steele-John is right that this legislation hasn't been referred to a committee of the Senate for inquiry. That is something that sometimes happens, but often it doesn't happen. In this case I surmise that a majority of colleagues were not in favour of a Senate inquiry, given the extensive public consultation that had occurred and the extensive examination that colleagues have already given this legislation.

 (Queensland) (10:43):  One Nation will not be supporting the Greens amendment to this bill. After listening to the senator's comments with regard to this, I note the Greens speak of people being underage, under adult age, and being children in their development and the way they think and decipher everything. I find this very hypocritical of the Greens, after seeing their policies. They wish to reduce the voting age to 16. The Constitution says that if you want to be a member of parliament you have to be on the roll, and being on the roll you are then entitled to stand for election as a member of parliament. So in one case the Greens say, 'They're underage; they don't have the development or the skills and they should be treated as children,' but on the other hand, in their policies, they're quite happy for someone who is 16 years old to be voting and to have their say.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:44):  Labor will not be supporting this amendment. We acknowledge that the amendment is designed to restrict the application of civil penalties to adults. But we note that the bill is under scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and we also note its report of 6 February this year. The entry for this bill in that report requests the advice of the minister as to whether the severity of the civil penalties that may be imposed on individuals is such that the penalties may be criminal in nature for the purpose of international human rights law. It also seeks advice from the minister as to the nature of penalties: if the penalties are considered criminal for the purposes of international human rights law; whether they're compatible with criminal process rights, including specific guarantees of the right to a fair trial; and the determination of a criminal charge, such as the presumption of innocence. It also refers to the right not to incriminate one's self, the right not to be tried and punished twice for an offence and a guarantee against retrospective criminal laws and whether any limitations on these rights imposed by the measures are permissible and whether the measures could be amended to accord with criminal process rights.


Labor notes that the committee has requested further information from the minister in relation to the penalties under this bill and notes this as further support for a criminal regime for image-based abuse, given the criminal process rights that are afforded to criminal penalties. That aside, Labor notes that the scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights did not identify any concerns in relation to Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.


Labor appreciates and understands the value in having a strong legal framework in place to strengthen the eSafety Commissioner's ability to resolve matters informally and formally. We support the introduction of a graduated suite of redress mechanisms, to which the minister has added some flesh in his comments this morning. These responses include issuing removal of infringement notices, seeking a civil penalty order from a relevant court, enforceable undertakings or seeking an injunction for contraventions of the civil penalty provisions.


Labor acknowledges that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will seek to use established relationships with social media service providers and content hosts to facilitate the taking down images, and, thus, a removal notice or other enforcement action may not be required in every case.


We also understand that the bill affords a number of checks and balances on the impact of the regime on children. Notably, these include affording the eSafety Commissioner discretion around whether an image meets the threshold of being an intimate image and around what responses to use in the event that there is a contravention, taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. These include factors such as the age of the child and the type of image, for example. Only in the most serious of cases, such as repeat offenders, multiple victims or noncompliance by bodies corporate, could the commissioner seek a civil penalty order in the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court, where the perpetrators might be fined up to 500 penalty units, which equates up to $105,000 for an individual and up to five times that amount, $525,000, for bodies corporate.


The need to obtain civil penalty orders in a court of law acts as a check on the potential imposition of civil penalties on child offenders. Labor understands that the application of a financial penalty on a minor would be a response of last resort for the repeat offender who has not responded to other redress mechanisms.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:49):  First of all, I'd like to respond to the ridiculous suggestion made by Senator Hanson of a similarity between my position on this issue and the Greens' general position in relation to the lowering of the voting age, of which I am a proud and long-term supporter. I would say to you very directly, Senator Hanson, through the chair, that having a say in your own future is not the same as being placed in a situation where you may have your future destroyed. There is such a blindingly clear difference between these two issues that I am, quite frankly, stunned by your inability to see the difference.


I now turn to the question of these amendments and the heart of the issue that they go to. I want to put this very clearly for everybody in this chamber: as currently written, the civil penalties regime outlined within this legislation, which could potentially place somebody at the risk of a fine of up to $107,000, is currently applicable to any person over the age of 10. I do not believe, absent of the political context, that any person present in this chamber would believe that a 10-year-old should come within the same galactic distance of a civil penalty of any shape or form. Any expert, or any person in this place who had taken the time to consult an expert or given the opportunity for this legislation to be consulted on and considered by experts—as is the job of this chamber—would have found a resounding suggestion that the clarification within these amendments be enshrined in the law. There can be no benefit to applying a civil penalty to a 10-year-old, regardless of the situation. I ask the minister once again: is he comfortable with the idea of implementing a civil penalty regime that would apply to 10-year-old Australians?

Somebody as young as 10! Do you truly believe that it would not be better for that person in that situation to be diverted, as the Law Council of Australia has suggested? I can tell you now that, had either side of this chamber decided to refer this bill to a committee, the Law Council of Australia would have given the feedback that there are not appropriate diversionary pathways within this legislation. Does the minister sit here seriously suggesting that a 10-year-old child would be better off, under any circumstance, interacting with the Federal Court system?

I think it's important for colleagues to understand that the staff of the Office of the eSafety Commissioner are technically employed by ACMA, so the intention isn't that the entirety of ACMA would have that capacity. This arrangement would permit the commissioner to authorise appropriate staff to be infringement officers. In practice, it's expected that the commissioner would only delegate this power to senior staff with appropriate attributes, qualifications, qualities and relevant experience.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:58):  I again draw the minister's attention. What he has just outlined is the fact that the power to issue these infringement notices can be delegated to those with absolutely no qualifications in the space. You've just expressed that, in practice, you believe it would be best if the commissioner were to delegate those notices and the issues of those notices to those with the appropriate qualifications and that those be senior officers. Again I ask the minister: if that's your aspiration for how this process would work, why not clearly state that within the legislation?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:59):  The delegation is for the eSafety Commissioner to give. There is no automatic right to anyone in ACMA to have the capacity to issue such infringement notices. That capacity rests with the eSafety Commissioner, who can delegate to officers that she deems to be appropriate.


The reason ACMA is specified is because the staff of the eSafety Commissioner are employed by ACMA. So she has the authority to delegate and will do so to appropriate individuals.

This amendment introduces three new offences into the Commonwealth Criminal Code with respect to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images—namely, knowingly or recklessly producing intimate images without consent, knowingly or recklessly sharing intimate images without consent, and threatening to take and/or share intimate images without consent, irrespective of whether or not those images exist. These offences make it clear that it is the victim's consent that has paramount consideration and not whether the alleged perpetrator intended to cause harm. These take into consideration the final recommendations of the Senate inquiry into the phenomenon known as revenge porn.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:08):  I'll just speak briefly to the amendment moved by Senator Griff and outline why the government won't be supporting it. Firstly, the amendment moved is a departure from the bill's intent, which is to introduce a civil penalties regime as opposed to amending the Criminal Code. Existing criminal laws—Commonwealth criminal laws, I should point out—do comprehensively criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. It is an offence to use the internet, social media or a mobile phone to menace, harass or cause offence. There have been a number of successful prosecutions for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images under this offence. There are also extensive child abuse material offences which apply to the sharing of intimate images of children.


Broadly framed provisions of general application are generally preferred for Commonwealth offences. Broad provisions can be used to prosecute a range of criminal behaviours and avoid issues such as technical distinctions, loopholes and difficulties with prosecution that are associated with having similar provisions of slightly different operation against Commonwealth law.


The focus of this bill is the creation of a civil penalty process to provide victims with an alternative avenue for redress without requiring victims to go through the criminal justice system, if that is what they choose. Extensive public consultation during the development of the civil penalty regime confirmed that assistance taking down images is a key priority for victims. I should also point out that, to ensure a nationally consistent criminal framework to protect victims, the Australian government led the development of a national statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The principles are working to ensure a consistent approach by states and territories to criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. They also ensure a consistent response and outcome for victims and perpetrators, no matter where they are located.


I want to highlight that, in not supporting Senator Griff's amendments, the government is in no way indicating a lack of support for, and/or a lack of importance of, having criminal provisions. As I say, we do have some existing criminal provisions at Commonwealth level, and at state and territory level there are also criminal provisions, and there are efforts underway to harmonise those. In this area, there is no single response that can satisfy the need. There needs to be a wide-ranging approach with a number of elements. Criminal provisions are important. Seeking to educate people is important. Non-formal resolution is important. What we're seeking to do through this legislation is to provide an avenue for resolution and an avenue for redress through a graduated civil penalties regime that is not currently in place. I just thought that context might be helpful for colleagues.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:12):  I just want to put on the record, as we're about to approach a vote on the amendment that's put forward here by NXT, the context in which this is happening. Labor support this bill, but we have consistently said that it doesn't go far enough to address the seriousness of image based abuse.


The context is that, in October 2015, Labor introduced a private member's bill that would make the non-consensual sharing of images a crime. Over two years later, the Turnbull government continues to delay criminalising the non-consensual sharing of these private images. In April 2016, the COAG Advisory Panel on Reducing Violence against Women and their Children released a report recommending clarification of the serious and criminal nature of the distribution of intimate material without consent. Legislation should be developed that includes strong penalties for adults who do so. Labor actually went to the last federal election, in the year 2016, promising Commonwealth legislation to criminalise what we're talking about here today—to criminalise what was then called 'revenge porn' but within this legislation is called 'non-consensual sharing of images'. We promised to do that within the first 100 days of being elected because we sensed the urgency of this matter, and we sensed that the urgency that exists about action on this matter to criminalise this sort of conduct is shared by the Australian people.


In October 2016, Labor reintroduced its private members bill into the current parliament. However, it was removed from the Notice Paper on 23 May 2017 because the government refused to call it on for debate for eight consecutive sitting Mondays. It's all well and good for the minister to say that criminal priorities are important, but this is the action, or lack of action, that we've seen.


In June 2017, the shadow minister for communications moved a second reading amendment in the House of Representatives, calling on the Turnbull government to criminalise image-based abuse, but that motion was defeated. It's clear, in our view, that what is proposed in this bill by the government doesn't go far enough. The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is exploitative, is humiliating and is a very damaging form of abuse, and it needs to be treated as such.


Labor is pleased that the Xenophon party has joined Labor in calling for the criminalisation of image-based abuse. Labor has been the proponent of this and has approached it in a very measured way based on our extensive work behind our own private member's bill, which the government refused to bring on. This was a 2016 election policy, and Labor will take it to the next election, if we don't see action from this government. The Xenophon party has adopted Labor's position. Indeed, they have adopted the very words of Labor's private member's bill as their own. Labor's clear and longstanding position has been that the non-consensual sharing of intimate images should be made a criminal offence. We thank the Xenophon team for moving these amendments.


Labor will not oppose what is essentially its own private member's bill that was prosecuted for several years but rejected by the government. While Labor supports the introduction of a civil penalties regime as a step in the right direction, the government's bill doesn't go far enough. Labor supports the introduction of a civil penalties regime. However, we do not oppose this amendment given it's, effectively, our own bill. Labor didn't move the amendment itself, because we didn't want to risk the government packing up its bags and packing up its bat and ball and going home, if this amendment gets up in the Senate. It's important to note that the government has indicated that, potentially, it'll pull the civil penalties bill from the program, if this amendment is carried. That's of great concern. We urge the government to give the four-out-of-five Australians who want criminalisation what they want by letting this bill continue its progress through the parliament, whether or not this amendment succeeds in the Senate.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:17):  I'll put this on the record again—lest anyone who tunes into the debate or is subsequently reading the Hansard is under the impression that there are currently no Commonwealth criminal provisions in this area. Under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 it is an offence to use a carriage service in a menacing, harassing or offensive way. That is section 474 of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty for this offence is three years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $37,800. Since 2004 there have been 927 charges proven against 458 defendants under this offence, including a number of cases in relation to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


As I mentioned before, in May 2017 the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council, which is the ministerial council for the Attorneys-General, published National statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Alignment on key principles is an important initiative, as most offences are likely to be prosecuted at that state level. Can I indicate, in terms of individual jurisdictions, that most states already have criminal laws, and those that do not are considering it or progressing it. I'm advised that New South Wales, the ACT, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia have criminal laws for specific non-consensual sharing of intimate images, that the Northern Territory has introduced a bill with specific laws, and that Queensland and Tasmania intend to introduce specific laws. That is the current status in the Commonwealth, and in state and territory jurisdictions.


As I mentioned earlier, what we're proposing here in this legislation is a civil penalties regime to complement the existing and emerging criminal provisions at Commonwealth, state and territory levels. For those reasons, and because of the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council process, we're not intending to support the amendment moved by Senator Griff. If the amendment moved by Senator Griff is successful in the Senate, it may well be the case, after the transmission of this bill to the House, that it comes back to the Senate again in an amended form from the other place. If that were to occur, I would hope that colleagues at that point would not allow the disagreement over the Stirling Griff amendment to delay the passage of the civil penalties regime into law.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2018-02-14,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (11:21):  Here we are. After what seems like many eternities of considering different aspects of this legislation, we come now to the critical question of whether the government can rise above its own all-too-often inclination towards petulance and actually pass through this place a piece of legislation that would give criminal recourse to the more than five million Australians who live within the Northern Territory and within the state of Queensland and who currently have no criminal recourse in this matter. There may well be a bill before the NT, but we have the opportunity to do something now.


I'm happy to hear the minister allude to the government's intention to pass this bill, amended by NXT, to the other place and that he has expressed the hope that when it returns a disagreement over this issue does not sink the legislation. I say to him that that is a ball firmly within his court. Amended, as suggested by NXT, this legislation addresses the very profound nature in which the different criminal and civil penalty regimes of the states differ. That is critical in addressing this problem. I don't know whether the minister has had the opportunity to review the information given to a current Senate inquiry into the issue of cyberbullying, of which this is an oft talked about aspect, but it was very clear to all of those who participated that variations in state legislation pose significant challenges to victims when seeking recourse in this way.


Indeed, last year my predecessor, Scott Ludlam, expressed his disappointment and frustration that the legislation before the Senate at that time with regard to the sharing of intimate images had been pushed off in the criminal space for the states to handle in a piecemeal manner. I skip ahead eight months now, and states and territories have acted. But, again, I draw your attention to the reality that there are five million Australians currently without criminal recourse. The Australian Greens believe that the civil penalty regime proposed in this legislation complements existing criminal regimes related to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images; however, there is undeniable and inescapable merit in extending criminal redress processes to those Australians currently without it.


There is a need, when considering these issues of such a serious and complex nature, which impact upon the lives of so many Australians in ways which are unimaginable to some members of this chamber yet are a part of the lived experience for others, that we attempt even momentarily to rise above the inclination towards political opportunism and towards discourses which place political gain above the interest of vulnerable community members who are experiencing abuse. In our roles as representatives in this place we have heard on many occasions from victims of these horrific crimes. We have also heard from these individuals that there is a culture in this nation which does not lend itself to the taking of these issues seriously; in fact somebody remarked to me last week that, in relation to the issue of cyberbullying—particularly as it pertains to predatory trolling and the rather violently inclined abuse of our female journalists who work in this place every day—our cultural attitude, our implementation of law and the understanding which our community, law enforcement and employers have is akin to where the conversation with regard to domestic violence was 30 years ago.


Fellow citizens, predominantly women—in many cases people with a disability, members of the LGBTI community, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—suffer daily under the threat that images of themselves in the most private of situations will be shared with a community of billions, due to motivations of hatred and discrimination. A cultural change is needed in this nation. We must now turn towards treating these crimes with the seriousness they deserve. This parliament, by passing this legislation as amended, has the opportunity now to send a very clear message. I urge the government to join us in sending that message and, should the bill return amended from the other place, to support it once again. I urge the minister to utilise his charisma and influence within his party room—not inconsiderable, I'm sure—to convince his colleagues of the need to pass this legislation.


This is an issue of pre-eminent national importance. This is not something which should have been brought on with haste. This is not something which should have been brought on in a political context happening elsewhere. This is not something which should have been dealt with in the fifth year of this government or any government. It should have been something that was dealt with thoroughly, calmly and fastidiously in the first moments of a government's life. But, here we are; this is what we have been given. This is the opportunity before us to make change and to send a message. We support these amendments and I would urge you, as a colleague and as a man who I believe is in possession of profound intellect, to support these amendments as well. I commend them to the House.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:30):  Having heard the minister's responses, it really concerns me that he is continuing to assert that the criminal regime around the country is adequate to deal with this issue. I'm very mindful of the recent social media campaigns, the #MeToo campaign, which put in a public place the level of embedded abuse that is part of the cultural practices of our time. I think it goes to some of the points that Senator Steele-John has just made. The reality is that here today in this chamber, with no further delay, with no more weasel words, the government could take a position to criminalise the sharing of intimate images against someone's will. That's it. It's not like it's a big risk for the government to do this. Four out of five Australians are saying, 'Good on you, you should do it.' We know that Australians want this. We all should know, if we're paying attention to the cultural practices of our time, that a criminal regime is what is called for and what is needed. But still we have these weasel words, still we have this delay, still we have this very passive description of the current structures being adequate. In our view they certainly are not. I have a couple of questions for the minister directly. To what extent, Minister, do you believe a civil penalty scheme will assist the eSafety Commissioner in prosecuting rogue operators, including overseas operators?

When it comes to overseas operators or hosts, I guess, of offending material, the eSafety Commissioner works through a number of global law enforcement networks and also social media networks to endeavour to have offending material taken down. As with all online matters, we always have the challenge that the Australian jurisdiction does not extend beyond the borders of Australia, but this will be further strength to the arm of the eSafety Commissioner.


Just to respond to some of Senator O'Neill's earlier points, the impression that has been left by some of the contributions around the chamber is that there has not yet been the criminalisation of the sharing of intimate images. There already has been the criminalisation of that. Under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, as I have referred to before, it is an offence to use a carriage service in a 'menacing, harassing or offensive' way. Also, I have referred to some of the existing state laws that have criminalised this conduct and some of the laws that are in prospect. So, we do have criminal offences.


What we currently don't have is a civil penalties regime. Delay to the passage of this legislation will be delaying something that does not currently exist, and that is a civil penalties regime. A civil penalties regime will benefit victims practically immediately.


Now, it's entirely legitimate for there to be ongoing discussion and debate about criminal provisions at both the Commonwealth and the state levels, and I'm sure that will continue, but that particular debate is not a reason to tie up this civil penalties regime. I would encourage colleagues to support the passage of legislation which is intended to set up a civil penalties regime and not to have it tied to other debates.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:35):  Minister, with respect, this doesn't have to be an either-or proposition. This amendment gives you the opportunity to do and-and. We've constantly said this, and this chamber has expressed support for the civil penalty regime, but there's an opportunity here for you to do what needs to be done to give people actual choice to prosecute, to go through a criminal scheme to access justice.


Yesterday I made some points about the reality that we have limited choice that's available to victims of the sharing of images to which they haven't given consent. We acknowledge that not everybody will want to pursue the criminal proceedings and some of them would actually prefer to work with the eSafety Commissioner, and a civil regime is okay in that context, but, at the moment, the choice for people to actually prosecute through criminal courts is simply not available to so many Australians. There needs to be a deterrent. Everybody understands this. At least four out of five Australians are saying there needs to be a deterrent. This is sufficiently unpleasant behaviour—this is sufficiently criminal behaviour—that it warrants the Criminal Code, not just a civil regime. That's the view of Australia right at this point of time. I think, Minister, you are completely out of touch with it when you say we have to choose between one or the other.


With regard to your response to my question regarding overseas jurisdictions, we have had, through the eSafety Commissioner's engagement with major social media players, a very good relationship develop, and we have seen improvements in the speed with which images have been removed, because there's reputational damage to those large entities. But, for those overseas rogue players whose business is in fact providing a platform for the sharing of images to which people have not consented, there needs to be some deterrent here at home to stop people from doing that. Criminalising it will provide that deterrent, Minister.


Could you respond to those points and also help me understand: does the minister acknowledge that a criminal regime would provide the eSafety Commissioner with greater clout and capacity to prosecute rogue operators and potentially give the eSafety Commissioner greater success when it comes to enforcement?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:38):  Can I say again: there are existing criminal provisions. If a question is posed to someone, 'Do you think there should be criminal provisions?' they will say yes. And there are criminal provisions. If a question is put to someone with the implication that there aren't currently criminal provisions, then I understand that people would say, 'Yes, there should be.' And there are criminal provisions at the Commonwealth level. There are criminal provisions in most jurisdictions, and those that don't have them are looking to put them in specifically in relation to this matter.


I'm not suggesting, and never have suggested, that this is a case of either-or, of either civil penalties or criminal provisions. I've said that civil provisions complement criminal provisions. We do have criminal provisions at the moment. What we don't have at the moment is a civil penalties regime, and that's what this legislation seeks to put in place.


Senator O'Neill asked, in terms of a criminal regime or further amendments to the criminal regime, if that would be of assistance to the eSafety Commissioner. The answer to that is that, at present, the criminal regime is one that would be pursued by the Australian Federal Police. That could well be the case with further amendments. That is the law enforcement body for criminal provisions at the Commonwealth level.


In terms of enforcing legislation in overseas jurisdictions, while the eSafety office does have a great deal of success in working cooperatively with sites and services hosted overseas to have material removed, as Senator O'Neill has mentioned, it is extremely difficult to compel sites hosted overseas to remove material, because Australian law covers Australia. We don't have an extraterritorial capacity in relation to these matters, and that's where cooperation with partner organisations overseas is extremely important.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:41):  I'm sure the minister is aware of submissions made to the inquiry into this matter by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The concerns that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions expressed were that there are limitations on existing Commonwealth laws to adequately deal with revenge porn. The submission stated those exact words:


There are limitations on existing Commonwealth laws to adequately deal with 'revenge porn' conduct.


Is the minister aware of those concerns from the DPP?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:42):  I'm aware that there is a range of submissions on this subject area. I have never said that the Criminal Code at Commonwealth and state levels is set in stone and should never be altered or examined. My point is that what is before us is legislation to establish a civil penalties regime, that we should have this legislation passed in its current form and that there are other processes and opportunities to examine the criminal law. At the moment, the prime vehicle for that is the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:43):  I read that as the minister being aware of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions pointing out to the government that there are limitations that need a response but refusing to take that on board. Is the minister aware of the comments arising from the COAG Advisory Panel on Reducing Violence against Women and their Children, which recommended:


To clarify the serious and criminal nature of the distribution of intimate material without consent, legislation should be developed that includes strong penalties for adults who do so.


They expressly used the words 'criminal nature'. Does the minister reject or accept the submission seeking to reduce violence against women and their children?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:43):  The civil penalties regime that we're seeking to legislate here is a very strong response and very strong contribution to addressing these issues. As I say, there are existing criminal provisions at the Commonwealth and state levels. As I said before, I have never suggested that they are set in stone or that it's not appropriate to examine those. That is something that is happening through the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council and the national statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:45):  In light of your comments about it being a shared endeavour, I can't understand why this piece of legislation can't undertake a cooperative approach to criminal and civil law at this point in time. The minister has acknowledged that the AFP has a role to play—and there's an integration of services to address these issues. Is the minister aware that, at a Senate hearing, the AFP said 'uniformity in legislation across Australia would be most helpful for police in order to be able to investigate and charge perpetrators'?

Senator STEELE-JOHN:
  I presume he would be aware of the state of Queensland and of the digests. So I can't quite understand—and maybe the minister can elaborate for the chamber—why he continues to assert that there are criminal penalties which protect Australians when 4.6 million Australians are currently without criminal recourse due to the fact that the state of Queensland—which is a state of Australia, as noted in the digest—is without a criminal regime. I would like to ask the minister, given his understanding of the underlying issues, why he does not believe that we should take this opportunity to extend a criminal source of redress to the people of Queensland.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:48):  I've already indicated that Queensland and Tasmania intend to introduce specific laws and that, under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, it's an offence to use a carriage service in a menacing, harassing or offensive way. The Commonwealth Criminal Code Act applies to all of Australia, including Queensland and Tasmania. The Queensland state Labor government stated on 25 November 2017 that, if re-elected—and they have been—it would criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Premier Palaszczuk said at the time:


… the laws will apply to people who send or threaten to send explicit material without consent.


That is the intent of the Labor government of Queensland, which I have already referred to. Again, the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act applies to the whole nation.

(8)

For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), an intimate imagedoes not include images of a person in an outdoor public place. 


















2






Today we're debating the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. It's a bill supposed to deal with revenge porn, but it goes beyond that in ways that could slap $100,000 fines on people who are not posting revenge porn, including journalists.


My amendments exclude drawings, paintings and sketches from the definition of 'image'. I note that, on page 23, the explanatory memorandum says that the definition of an image includes a drawing. My amendment seeks to exclude these drawings, paintings and sketches so that a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for merely posting a drawing, painting or sketch of someone. If I posted a picture or, indeed, a drawing of President Donald Trump urinating in Central Park, I shouldn't face a $100,000 fine.


My amendments also exclude certain images taken in outdoor public places from the definition of 'intimate image'. As a result, a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for merely posting a picture of someone doing a typically private act in an outdoor public place. For example, if I posted a photo of President Donald Trump urinating in Central Park where no rude bits are showing, I shouldn't face a $100,000 fine.


There is a further result of my amendment regarding outdoor public places. The bill allows a $100,000 fine to be slapped on someone for posting a picture of someone without religious or cultural attire when that person consistently wears religious attire in public. This is reasonable if the picture was taken when the person was on private property or in a public toilet, but it's not reasonable if the picture was taken of the person in an outdoor public place. My amendment would ensure a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for posting a picture of a person out of their usual religious or cultural attire if the person was in an outdoor public place at the time. 


For example, a picture of Cardinal George Pell without his collar would, potentially, come under this bill. A picture of a nun who wasn't wearing her habit in public would, potentially, offend against this bill. A woman who normally wears a burqa but wasn't wearing a burqa in public and had her picture taken would, potentially, offend against this bill, unless my amendment succeeds. 


I acknowledge that the bill already attempts to limit the capacity to impose fines by saying they only apply in circumstances in which an ordinary reasonable person could reasonably expect to be afforded privacy, but this is vague. My additional limitation regarding outdoor public places would add some much-needed clarity. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:36):  Senator Leyonhjelm has asked me to look closely at his amendments, which I have done. I can seek to provide some context to this particular part of the legislation. Let me start with the exclusion of a drawing, painting or sketch from a definition of an 'intimate image' that Senator Leyonhjelm is seeking. 


Under the bill, an intimate image can be a still visual image, such as a photograph, or moving visual images, such as video recordings. Images could be photographs, modified photographs, animations, drawings or other depictions of the person, such as what is known as morph porn, and fake pornographic videos also known as deep fakes. There are exemptions in the bill whereby, if an ordinary reasonable person considered the posting or the sharing of the image acceptable in certain circumstances, it would not be captured by the prohibition. Obviously, we have in mind there things such as satirical drawings or parodies. 


Moving to Senator Leyonhjelm seeking to exclude 'outdoor public place' in the definition of an intimate image, the definition of 'intimate image' includes depiction of a private activity where material will be an intimate image of a person if it depicts or appears to depict the person in a state of undress, using the toilet, showering, having a bath, engaged in a sexual act of a kind not ordinarily done in public or engaged in other like activity in circumstances in which an ordinary reasonable person would reasonably be expected to be afforded privacy. It wouldn't include a situation where a person is in their swimmers at the beach or showering at the beach. 


The government remains of the view that the current definition does afford protection in circumstances where they would expect privacy. I certainly appreciate the sentiment and the motivation of Senator Leyonhjelm and, as he requested, we did look closely at his amendments, but the government aren't, at this point, minded to support those amendments. Obviously, legislation of this sort is always kept under review in the light of practical experience and its real-world operation. The Senate has already determined that there will be a statutory review in three years time, but, in the outworking of legislation, if there appear to be issues before that time, that is naturally something that I'm sure all colleagues would want to examine.

Would a picture of Cardinal George Pell not wearing his collar, his normal religious attire, offend against this legislation?

I would think that this is a rather easily understandable point to make and it surprises me that it is lost on the senator in this case. Individuals must have, and can reasonably expect, privacy in various situations where they are in outdoor spaces. An obvious example of a phenomenon that is increasing and quite troubling in this area is upskirting and down-blousing. The highly offensive insinuation, I would argue, behind this amendment, as I have said, is that just because a woman, or any other person, steps out in public, they have given their consent for inappropriate and humiliating images to be taken and shared. Quite frankly, that is a disgusting insinuation to make. We proudly do not support these amendments, and I cannot for the life of me begin to think why such things would be put forward in this place.

While the government isn't minded to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not question for one second Senator Leyonhjelm's motivation. Senator Leyonhjelm's seeking to examine legislation, to test it and to ensure that, as well as protections, there aren't liberties that are needlessly infringed. I do feel compelled to reject the insinuations that Senator Steele-John makes in terms of the motivation of Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. As I said, while we're not minded to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments;  nevertheless, we do fully appreciate the spirit in which he has moved them.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:55):  I move Liberal Democrats amendment (3) on sheet 8368:


(3) Schedule 1, item 18, page 10 (lines 1 to 13), omit section 9E, substitute:




9E Consent



For the purposes of the application of this Act to an intimate image, consentmeans consent that is:


(a) express; and


(b) voluntary; and


(c) informed;


but does not include:


(d) consent given by a person who is in a mental or physical condition (whether temporary or permanent) that


   (i) makes the person incapable of giving consent; or












(ii) substantially impairs the capacity of the person to give consent


This amendment prevents a $100,000 fine from being slapped on a person for posting an image of a child if the child consents to the posting of the image. I point out that a child is anyone under the age of 18. Currently the bill states that a child cannot give consent to the posting of their image, so even if a 17-year-old urged their friend or partner, who may also be 17, to post the image, that friend or partner could face a $100,000 fine under the bill as it stands.


If the image depicts a child in a sexual pose or sexual act, or with someone in a sexual pose or act, or if the image depicts a child's sexual organs, anal region or a female child's breasts then the image is child pornography. Regardless of the claims a person who posts such an image makes about consent, posting such an image is a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years imprisonment, a fine of more than $100,000 or both. The only purpose of ruling out consent by a child in this bill is to impose fines upon a person for posting an image of a consenting child that isn't pornographic. It could be a picture of a child picking their nose or eating their earwax, which seems to be a qualification for becoming a leader of the Labor Party.


I urge senators not to let legitimate concerns about child pornography colour their views about a bill that is not about child pornography. A 17-year-old can consent to the posting of an image of them picking their nose, and the person who does the posting shouldn't face a $100,000 fine for doing so. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:57):  I indicate that the government won't be supporting this amendment. Under the bill, consent to share an intimate image cannot be given by a child, who is a person under the age of 18, as Senator Leyonhjelm points out. This is because, to the extent that the definition of intimate image overlaps with the definition of child sexual exploitation material in the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995, a lower age of consent for the distribution of intimate images would create an inappropriate inconsistency between the criminal and civil frameworks. The effect of this item is that a person under the age of 18 cannot provide consent to the sharing by another person of an intimate image of themselves, as distribution of this image would effectively constitute distribution of exploitative material. I should also point out that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will, under this legislation, adopt a graduated approach to enforcing prohibitions: firstly, seeking the non-formal resolution of a complaint; then issuing formal written warnings, infringement notices and so on; and ultimately through to civil penalties, if those are warranted.

Senator LEYONHJELM

You're saying that because of inappropriate inconsistency with laws relating to child pornography, you can't do anything to mitigate that rather absurd situation?

 (South Australia) (10:03):  I just want to clarify this; I was preoccupied and am not sure whether I heard your answer correctly. Who will be responsible, subject to a complaint, for the penalty that's imposed in this respect? Senator Leyonhjelm's concern was that a child, a 17-year-old, could be fined $100,000. I'm sympathetic to the point that we accept that children are allowed to make decisions to get into sexual relationships with their peers from the age of 16. Yet we're saying that they're not able to consent to having an intimate image—which conjures up all sorts of suggestions; however, it's not child pornography, as we've described—publicly displayed. Further, I question the circumstances such as the Bill Henson pictures, which caused such a controversy so many years ago—I note the Prime Minister has some—which depicted children in an artistic setting, apparently, without the benefit of clothes. Are they deemed to be intimate pictures, and would someone like Mr Henson be subject to these sorts of penalties?

Sharing images with third parties—we're not talking about child pornography; we're talking about intimate images, which conjures up scenarios where people anticipate it's pornography, but I think Senator Leyonhjelm's made the point it's not. So where does it leave the circumstance where you have someone like Mr Henson, who is a photographer who takes photos of prepubescent children in a state of undress? Those children are not eligible or able to give consent to having those photos taken, yet what happens if someone shares those images or puts them on public display? Where is this line drawn? I come back to the other point: how is it that children—and this is once again an emotive term, but it's a legal term—minors, are able to have sexual relationships with their peers at the age of 16, and we say they're mature enough, and we're realistic enough to make that assessment, yet they're not able to consent to having their images displayed in a manner of their choosing, in the scenarios which Senator Leyonhjelm has put forward?

I just find this unusual, and I think that Senator Leyonhjelm makes a valid point—that we attribute any number of things to young adults, albeit, they are minors. We allow them to choose to smoke cigarettes if that's what they do, by legally allowing them to buy them; we allow them to engage in sexual relations; we have people who are advocating that they be allowed to vote; and yet we're not enabling them to consent to having their image shared in the manner in which they choose to do it.

(4) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (line 17), omit paragraph 44B(1)(d).


As currently drafted, the bill allows someone who posts an image to be hit with a $100,000 fine if they are ordinarily resident in Australia or if the person depicted is ordinarily resident in Australia. This means an Australian could be hit with a fine when no image of an Australian is depicted, so no Australian is harmed. That is wrong. It is the role of our government to protect Australians from harm, not to make Australians conform with a model of behaviour that is harmless to any other Australians. Posting a picture of President Donald Trump going to the toilet in Trump Tower might be in poor taste, but it should not be against Australian law. The government serves the people, not the other way around. The government is not our mother and it is not our nanny.


My amendment would limit the bill so that someone who posts an image could be hit with a $100,000 fine only if the person depicted is ordinarily resident in Australia. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

Under the bill, if there is an Australian link, such as the perpetrator or the victim being ordinarily resident in Australia, the commissioner will be able to exercise his or her powers, including issuing removal notices to sites hosted in overseas jurisdictions. The proposed amendment would mean that the prohibition would only apply if the person depicted in the image is ordinarily resident in Australia, to my understanding. The effect of the amendment would prevent the commissioner exercising his or her powers if the victim wasn't ordinarily resident in Australia. The government won't be supporting the amendment.

Therefore, if it goes through the legal system, would they pay for the court case or would it be the Australian taxpayer?


On the other hand, if they are a foreigner who's taken the photo of an Australian resident and they are charged and fined over it, how are we going to recover that money from them and who pays that cost?

Beyond that, matters would go to the Federal Court, who obviously have a budget for their particular activities. In short, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner is provisioned with resources to support the activities outlined in the legislation.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:16):  by leave—I move Liberal Democratic Party amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 8368:


(5) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (lines 23 to 26), omit the note.


(6) Schedule 1, item 26, page 16 (after line 26), after subsection 44B(2), insert:


(2A) Despite section 96 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, in proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of subsection (1), the person does not bear an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2) of this section.


Despite the bill's title, the bill doesn't ban the non-consensual sharing of intimate images; instead, the bill bans the sharing of intimate images and then provides an exception for instances where the depicted person consents. This drafting approach matters because it puts the onus on the person facing the $100,000 fine to prove that the depicted person consented to the image being posted. It would be difficult for either side of a dispute about a posted image to prove consent or the absence of consent. In some cases, there'll be evidence confirming conversations about plans to post the image but in many cases there will be no such evidence. 


I refer to my example of the nose-picking contest—if somebody disagrees or disputes that they posted consent. That highlights the difficulties. The difficulties don't justify reversing the well-founded convention that the party seeking to impose a penalty must prove behaviour in the circumstances that would justify such a penalty. My amendment would simply undo the reversal of the onus of proof. I'm hoping the Senate could be clear eyed on this matter, particularly given that revenge porn involves allegations about female perpetrators as well as male perpetrators. I commend the amendments.

The evidential burden of proof that consent was given—Senator Leyonhjelm was correct—lies with the person who shared the image in any civil penalty proceedings. Again, I emphasise that this doesn't relate to the sharing of images between two people; this relates to the sharing of those with a third party. Given the serious impact that this conduct of sharing beyond the individuals involved has on the victim, the government is of the view that it's appropriate that the alleged perpetrator prove consent to share an image.

However, we do not believe that the civil penalty is akin to the criminal offence, as suggested by the committee. The penalty provisions are expressly classified as civil penalties. As such, there is no consequence in the form of criminal record. The high penalty reflects the serious nature of sharing an intimate image without consent and the harm and distress that that can then cause. Key concerns that we have expressed in the past related to the burden of proof on the complainant under the use of a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. We do not support placing undue pressure on victims in these cases. The reversal of the burden of proof in this instance allows the commissioner to investigate and determine matters based on evidence that is in the mind of the person around the nature of consent, whether it is expressly given or expressly not given or absent entirely. As such, we do not support these amendments.

(6) Schedule 1, item 26, page 21 (line 28), omit ""A person"", substitute ""An adult"".


As I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate, we have serious concerns around the, hopefully, unintended implications of this legislation for the people under the age of 18 who will potentially face steep civil penalties under this regime. The government have indicated that the application of these penalties to people under the age of 18 is not their intention; however, to ensure that this unintended consequence does not arise, we seek to have this limitation enshrined in the legislation.


I would like to remind the chamber that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's general comment No. 10 states:


Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and their emotional and educational needs. Such differences constitute the basis for the lesser culpability of children in conflict with the law. These and other differences are the reasons for a separate juvenile justice system and require a different treatment for children. The protection of the best interests of the child means, for instance, that the traditional objectives of criminal justice, such as repression/retribution, must give way to rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in dealing with child offenders. This can be done in concert with attention to effective public safety.


The Law Council of Australia also notes:


Financial penalties will rarely be appropriate for children and young people. The Law Council suggests that the civil penalties regime could include not only infringement notices, formal warnings and take down notices, but also diversionary/rehabilitation processes, such as the possibility of a conference, attendance at counselling and participating in courses relating to cyber bullying and sexting.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:32):  Thank you, Senator Steele-John. The government won't be supporting the amendments moved by the Australian Greens. The penalties apply to all persons to ensure that there is a strong deterrent to engaging in the sharing of intimate images without consent.


In practice, as Senator Steele-John alluded to, the eSafety Commissioner will take a very cautious approach in relation to any complaint made against a perpetrator under 18 years of age. The eSafety Commissioner will firstly look to engage with the perpetrator in an informal manner and change behaviour. This informal approach has been successful under the existing cyberbullying regime. The commissioner does have the discretion to use other light-touch remedies, including issuing a formal warning notice. It is expected only light-touch remedies would be required in matters involving a perpetrator under 18 years of age. Strong remedies, including civil penalties, would only be used in exceptional cases, such as for a repeat offender where other remedies have been ineffective.


A contravention of the prohibition in the bill and/or a failure to comply with a removal notice triggers a civil penalty order provision contained in the Regulatory Powers Act. If the eSafety Commissioner does decide to apply for a civil penalty order, the court has the discretion as to whether it orders the person to pay the penalty. When determining the appropriate penalty amount, the court must take into account matters including the nature and extent of the contravention; the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in any similar activity. So I think there are important things to bear in mind in terms of the operation of this legislation.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:34):  I'd like to ask the minister whether he is aware that there is a very, very substantive amount of research in the area of child justice that directly contravenes the idea of the application of criminal or civil penalties to people under the age of 18, due to the physiological reality that the development of a child is not at the same stage as the development of an adult and so it is most appropriate to apply diversionary, rehabilitative and educational approaches in those cases. It is my view that it was never the intention of the government to have this criminal regime apply to children, because I cannot in good conscience imagine that the minister, who is a man of great capacity, could possibly believe that it would in any circumstance be productive or just to apply a penalty of up to $107,000 to a child. So I would ask the minister again: is he comfortable with the possibility created by this legislation of applying such a penalty to children in the face of overwhelming evidence given in many forums, including by commissioners of this government, that such approaches are simply not effective, nor just, in relation to children?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:36):  I should point out that this is not a criminal regime for underage individuals that is being proposed here. This is a civil penalties regime that has application to the whole community. As I indicated before, the intention is that this is something that would be used in the case of repeat offenders, where other remedies have been ineffective. Senator Steele-John is quite right to point out there is a range of alternative remedies and it's appropriate that they are pursued. But, where you have repeat offenders, it is appropriate that we have a civil penalties regime in place. Just because a person is under the age of 18 does not mean that they are necessarily without the capacity to determine right from wrong. We are very much of the view that this is appropriate.


If I do follow the logic of what Senator Steele-John has said, however, I would assume, although I suspect it's not the case, that Senator Steele-John will not be supporting the criminal provisions put forward by NXT, because, to my understanding, they would apply to people below the age of 18. The government is not putting in place, through this legislation, a criminal regime to apply to people below the age of 18. I'm not suggesting that, where there are criminal provisions, they shouldn't apply to people below the age of 18, but I'm just seeking to follow the thread through with Senator Steele-John as to what the implications of his position in relation to the civil penalties regime might be for his stance in relation to criminal penalties amendments that might be moved later.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:38):  As the minister has rightly noted, it would be only in extreme cases that we would reach the stage of intervention in relation to children. Would the minister not agree that there are almost, imaginably, no cases in which a person below the age of 18 would be able to feasibly meet a civil penalty of $107,000? In fact, the burden of meeting this penalty would fall upon the child's family or extended family. In that case, wouldn't it simply be better to follow the advice of the Australian Law Council, guided by the views of the United Nations and embodied within the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and put in place a comprehensive, diversionary, educated, evidence based approach to dealing with this very serious issue in relation to children?


I would also remind the minister at this point in time that these questions with regard to the action of civil penalty regimes on children and their possible impacts are something we could have explored had the government agreed to my suggestion to allow the Senate to perform its role as a house of review and refer this bill to committee. These are serious issues which relate to the community as a whole, with a massive impact on children, both as victims and as perpetrators. This is a complex legislative area and, while I appreciate that the minister is providing us with the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation in this period, it would have been so much easier to answer these questions and produce a piece of legislation as robust, comprehensive and durable as that which is deserved by the victims of this most heinous crime.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:41):  I should point out that the civil penalties are only up to $105,000. As I've indicated before, if there were to be a civil penalty sought by the eSafety Commissioner through the Federal Court then it would be in circumstances where other remedies have been ineffective—where there'd been a repeat offender—and the courts, in determining the appropriate penalty amount, again, have to take into account the nature and extent of the contravention, the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered, the circumstances of the contravention, and whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in similar conduct. The courts can also determine not to apply a civil penalty. But, again, I emphasise that the eSafety Commissioner would firstly seek a non-formal resolution of the complaint, followed if necessary by a formal written warning, followed if necessary by an infringement notice. They have the option of enforceable undertakings, injunctions and, ultimately, civil penalties. So there are really six layers of the graduated approach that could be taken in these circumstances.


In terms of consultation, there was extensive public consultation last year. Senator Steele-John is right that this legislation hasn't been referred to a committee of the Senate for inquiry. That is something that sometimes happens, but often it doesn't happen. In this case I surmise that a majority of colleagues were not in favour of a Senate inquiry, given the extensive public consultation that had occurred and the extensive examination that colleagues have already given this legislation.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:43):  One Nation will not be supporting the Greens amendment to this bill. After listening to the senator's comments with regard to this, I note the Greens speak of people being underage, under adult age, and being children in their development and the way they think and decipher everything. I find this very hypocritical of the Greens, after seeing their policies. They wish to reduce the voting age to 16. The Constitution says that if you want to be a member of parliament you have to be on the roll, and being on the roll you are then entitled to stand for election as a member of parliament. So in one case the Greens say, 'They're underage; they don't have the development or the skills and they should be treated as children,' but on the other hand, in their policies, they're quite happy for someone who is 16 years old to be voting and to have their say. One Nation will not be supporting the Greens in this amendment.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:44):  Labor will not be supporting this amendment. We acknowledge that the amendment is designed to restrict the application of civil penalties to adults. But we note that the bill is under scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and we also note its report of 6 February this year. The entry for this bill in that report requests the advice of the minister as to whether the severity of the civil penalties that may be imposed on individuals is such that the penalties may be criminal in nature for the purpose of international human rights law. It also seeks advice from the minister as to the nature of penalties: if the penalties are considered criminal for the purposes of international human rights law; whether they're compatible with criminal process rights, including specific guarantees of the right to a fair trial; and the determination of a criminal charge, such as the presumption of innocence. It also refers to the right not to incriminate one's self, the right not to be tried and punished twice for an offence and a guarantee against retrospective criminal laws and whether any limitations on these rights imposed by the measures are permissible and whether the measures could be amended to accord with criminal process rights.


Labor notes that the committee has requested further information from the minister in relation to the penalties under this bill and notes this as further support for a criminal regime for image-based abuse, given the criminal process rights that are afforded to criminal penalties. That aside, Labor notes that the scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights did not identify any concerns in relation to Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.


Labor appreciates and understands the value in having a strong legal framework in place to strengthen the eSafety Commissioner's ability to resolve matters informally and formally. We support the introduction of a graduated suite of redress mechanisms, to which the minister has added some flesh in his comments this morning. These responses include issuing removal of infringement notices, seeking a civil penalty order from a relevant court, enforceable undertakings or seeking an injunction for contraventions of the civil penalty provisions.


Labor acknowledges that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will seek to use established relationships with social media service providers and content hosts to facilitate the taking down images, and, thus, a removal notice or other enforcement action may not be required in every case.


We also understand that the bill affords a number of checks and balances on the impact of the regime on children. Notably, these include affording the eSafety Commissioner discretion around whether an image meets the threshold of being an intimate image and around what responses to use in the event that there is a contravention, taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. These include factors such as the age of the child and the type of image, for example. Only in the most serious of cases, such as repeat offenders, multiple victims or noncompliance by bodies corporate, could the commissioner seek a civil penalty order in the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court, where the perpetrators might be fined up to 500 penalty units, which equates up to $105,000 for an individual and up to five times that amount, $525,000, for bodies corporate.


The need to obtain civil penalty orders in a court of law acts as a check on the potential imposition of civil penalties on child offenders. Labor understands that the application of a financial penalty on a minor would be a response of last resort for the repeat offender who has not responded to other redress mechanisms.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (10:49):  First of all, I'd like to respond to the ridiculous suggestion made by Senator Hanson of a similarity between my position on this issue and the Greens' general position in relation to the lowering of the voting age, of which I am a proud and long-term supporter. I would say to you very directly, Senator Hanson, through the chair, that having a say in your own future is not the same as being placed in a situation where you may have your future destroyed. There is such a blindingly clear difference between these two issues that I am, quite frankly, stunned by your inability to see the difference.


I now turn to the question of these amendments and the heart of the issue that they go to. I want to put this very clearly for everybody in this chamber: as currently written, the civil penalties regime outlined within this legislation, which could potentially place somebody at the risk of a fine of up to $107,000, is currently applicable to any person over the age of 10. I do not believe, absent of the political context, that any person present in this chamber would believe that a 10-year-old should come within the same galactic distance of a civil penalty of any shape or form. Any expert, or any person in this place who had taken the time to consult an expert or given the opportunity for this legislation to be consulted on and considered by experts—as is the job of this chamber—would have found a resounding suggestion that the clarification within these amendments be enshrined in the law. There can be no benefit to applying a civil penalty to a 10-year-old, regardless of the situation. I ask the minister once again: is he comfortable with the idea of implementing a civil penalty regime that would apply to 10-year-old Australians?

Somebody as young as 10! Do you truly believe that it would not be better for that person in that situation to be diverted, as the Law Council of Australia has suggested? I can tell you now that, had either side of this chamber decided to refer this bill to a committee, the Law Council of Australia would have given the feedback that there are not appropriate diversionary pathways within this legislation. Does the minister sit here seriously suggesting that a 10-year-old child would be better off, under any circumstance, interacting with the Federal Court system?

 (Western Australia) (10:56):  I draw the minister's attention to subsection 46A(2), which would allow the eSafety Commissioner to delegate authority to issue infringement notices to any member of the staff of ACMA, which can be any APS employee. This was an issue raised within the small time of scrutiny that was given by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It was noted as one of their concerns. This allows the delegation of administrative powers to a relatively large class of persons with little or no specificity to their qualifications or attributes. The committee also noted that the explanatory memorandum provides no explanation for the broad delegation of power to issue infringements. Can the minister please justify, in relation to this amendment, the reality that this broad delegation of power gives to any employee of ACMA the ability to issue an infringement notice to a child as young as 10.

I think it's important for colleagues to understand that the staff of the Office of the eSafety Commissioner are technically employed by ACMA, so the intention isn't that the entirety of ACMA would have that capacity. This arrangement would permit the commissioner to authorise appropriate staff to be infringement officers. In practice, it's expected that the commissioner would only delegate this power to senior staff with appropriate attributes, qualifications, qualities and relevant experience.

There is no automatic right to anyone in ACMA to have the capacity to issue such infringement notices. That capacity rests with the eSafety Commissioner, who can delegate to officers that she deems to be appropriate.


The reason ACMA is specified is because the staff of the eSafety Commissioner are employed by ACMA. So she has the authority to delegate and will do so to appropriate individuals.

This amendment introduces three new offences into the Commonwealth Criminal Code with respect to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images—namely, knowingly or recklessly producing intimate images without consent, knowingly or recklessly sharing intimate images without consent, and threatening to take and/or share intimate images without consent, irrespective of whether or not those images exist. These offences make it clear that it is the victim's consent that has paramount consideration and not whether the alleged perpetrator intended to cause harm. These take into consideration the final recommendations of the Senate inquiry into the phenomenon known as revenge porn.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:08):  I'll just speak briefly to the amendment moved by Senator Griff and outline why the government won't be supporting it. Firstly, the amendment moved is a departure from the bill's intent, which is to introduce a civil penalties regime as opposed to amending the Criminal Code. Existing criminal laws—Commonwealth criminal laws, I should point out—do comprehensively criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. It is an offence to use the internet, social media or a mobile phone to menace, harass or cause offence. There have been a number of successful prosecutions for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images under this offence. There are also extensive child abuse material offences which apply to the sharing of intimate images of children.


Broadly framed provisions of general application are generally preferred for Commonwealth offences. Broad provisions can be used to prosecute a range of criminal behaviours and avoid issues such as technical distinctions, loopholes and difficulties with prosecution that are associated with having similar provisions of slightly different operation against Commonwealth law.


The focus of this bill is the creation of a civil penalty process to provide victims with an alternative avenue for redress without requiring victims to go through the criminal justice system, if that is what they choose. Extensive public consultation during the development of the civil penalty regime confirmed that assistance taking down images is a key priority for victims. I should also point out that, to ensure a nationally consistent criminal framework to protect victims, the Australian government led the development of a national statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The principles are working to ensure a consistent approach by states and territories to criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. They also ensure a consistent response and outcome for victims and perpetrators, no matter where they are located.


I want to highlight that, in not supporting Senator Griff's amendments, the government is in no way indicating a lack of support for, and/or a lack of importance of, having criminal provisions. As I say, we do have some existing criminal provisions at Commonwealth level, and at state and territory level there are also criminal provisions, and there are efforts underway to harmonise those. In this area, there is no single response that can satisfy the need. There needs to be a wide-ranging approach with a number of elements. Criminal provisions are important. Seeking to educate people is important. Non-formal resolution is important. What we're seeking to do through this legislation is to provide an avenue for resolution and an avenue for redress through a graduated civil penalties regime that is not currently in place. I just thought that context might be helpful for colleagues.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:12):  I just want to put on the record, as we're about to approach a vote on the amendment that's put forward here by NXT, the context in which this is happening. Labor support this bill, but we have consistently said that it doesn't go far enough to address the seriousness of image based abuse.


The context is that, in October 2015, Labor introduced a private member's bill that would make the non-consensual sharing of images a crime. Over two years later, the Turnbull government continues to delay criminalising the non-consensual sharing of these private images. In April 2016, the COAG Advisory Panel on Reducing Violence against Women and their Children released a report recommending clarification of the serious and criminal nature of the distribution of intimate material without consent. Legislation should be developed that includes strong penalties for adults who do so. Labor actually went to the last federal election, in the year 2016, promising Commonwealth legislation to criminalise what we're talking about here today—to criminalise what was then called 'revenge porn' but within this legislation is called 'non-consensual sharing of images'. We promised to do that within the first 100 days of being elected because we sensed the urgency of this matter, and we sensed that the urgency that exists about action on this matter to criminalise this sort of conduct is shared by the Australian people.


In October 2016, Labor reintroduced its private members bill into the current parliament. However, it was removed from the Notice Paper on 23 May 2017 because the government refused to call it on for debate for eight consecutive sitting Mondays. It's all well and good for the minister to say that criminal priorities are important, but this is the action, or lack of action, that we've seen.


In June 2017, the shadow minister for communications moved a second reading amendment in the House of Representatives, calling on the Turnbull government to criminalise image-based abuse, but that motion was defeated. It's clear, in our view, that what is proposed in this bill by the government doesn't go far enough. The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is exploitative, is humiliating and is a very damaging form of abuse, and it needs to be treated as such.


Labor is pleased that the Xenophon party has joined Labor in calling for the criminalisation of image-based abuse. Labor has been the proponent of this and has approached it in a very measured way based on our extensive work behind our own private member's bill, which the government refused to bring on. This was a 2016 election policy, and Labor will take it to the next election, if we don't see action from this government. The Xenophon party has adopted Labor's position. Indeed, they have adopted the very words of Labor's private member's bill as their own. Labor's clear and longstanding position has been that the non-consensual sharing of intimate images should be made a criminal offence. We thank the Xenophon team for moving these amendments.


Labor will not oppose what is essentially its own private member's bill that was prosecuted for several years but rejected by the government. While Labor supports the introduction of a civil penalties regime as a step in the right direction, the government's bill doesn't go far enough. Labor supports the introduction of a civil penalties regime. However, we do not oppose this amendment given it's, effectively, our own bill. Labor didn't move the amendment itself, because we didn't want to risk the government packing up its bags and packing up its bat and ball and going home, if this amendment gets up in the Senate. It's important to note that the government has indicated that, potentially, it'll pull the civil penalties bill from the program, if this amendment is carried. That's of great concern. We urge the government to give the four-out-of-five Australians who want criminalisation what they want by letting this bill continue its progress through the parliament, whether or not this amendment succeeds in the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:17):  I'll put this on the record again—lest anyone who tunes into the debate or is subsequently reading the Hansard is under the impression that there are currently no Commonwealth criminal provisions in this area. Under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 it is an offence to use a carriage service in a menacing, harassing or offensive way. That is section 474 of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty for this offence is three years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $37,800. Since 2004 there have been 927 charges proven against 458 defendants under this offence, including a number of cases in relation to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


As I mentioned before, in May 2017 the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council, which is the ministerial council for the Attorneys-General, published National statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Alignment on key principles is an important initiative, as most offences are likely to be prosecuted at that state level. Can I indicate, in terms of individual jurisdictions, that most states already have criminal laws, and those that do not are considering it or progressing it. I'm advised that New South Wales, the ACT, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia have criminal laws for specific non-consensual sharing of intimate images, that the Northern Territory has introduced a bill with specific laws, and that Queensland and Tasmania intend to introduce specific laws. That is the current status in the Commonwealth, and in state and territory jurisdictions.


As I mentioned earlier, what we're proposing here in this legislation is a civil penalties regime to complement the existing and emerging criminal provisions at Commonwealth, state and territory levels. For those reasons, and because of the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council process, we're not intending to support the amendment moved by Senator Griff. If the amendment moved by Senator Griff is successful in the Senate, it may well be the case, after the transmission of this bill to the House, that it comes back to the Senate again in an amended form from the other place. If that were to occur, I would hope that colleagues at that point would not allow the disagreement over the Stirling Griff amendment to delay the passage of the civil penalties regime into law.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2018-02-14,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (11:21):  Here we are. After what seems like many eternities of considering different aspects of this legislation, we come now to the critical question of whether the government can rise above its own all-too-often inclination towards petulance and actually pass through this place a piece of legislation that would give criminal recourse to the more than five million Australians who live within the Northern Territory and within the state of Queensland and who currently have no criminal recourse in this matter. There may well be a bill before the NT, but we have the opportunity to do something now.


I'm happy to hear the minister allude to the government's intention to pass this bill, amended by NXT, to the other place and that he has expressed the hope that when it returns a disagreement over this issue does not sink the legislation. I say to him that that is a ball firmly within his court. Amended, as suggested by NXT, this legislation addresses the very profound nature in which the different criminal and civil penalty regimes of the states differ. That is critical in addressing this problem. I don't know whether the minister has had the opportunity to review the information given to a current Senate inquiry into the issue of cyberbullying, of which this is an oft talked about aspect, but it was very clear to all of those who participated that variations in state legislation pose significant challenges to victims when seeking recourse in this way.


Indeed, last year my predecessor, Scott Ludlam, expressed his disappointment and frustration that the legislation before the Senate at that time with regard to the sharing of intimate images had been pushed off in the criminal space for the states to handle in a piecemeal manner. I skip ahead eight months now, and states and territories have acted. But, again, I draw your attention to the reality that there are five million Australians currently without criminal recourse. The Australian Greens believe that the civil penalty regime proposed in this legislation complements existing criminal regimes related to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images; however, there is undeniable and inescapable merit in extending criminal redress processes to those Australians currently without it.


There is a need, when considering these issues of such a serious and complex nature, which impact upon the lives of so many Australians in ways which are unimaginable to some members of this chamber yet are a part of the lived experience for others, that we attempt even momentarily to rise above the inclination towards political opportunism and towards discourses which place political gain above the interest of vulnerable community members who are experiencing abuse. In our roles as representatives in this place we have heard on many occasions from victims of these horrific crimes. We have also heard from these individuals that there is a culture in this nation which does not lend itself to the taking of these issues seriously; in fact somebody remarked to me last week that, in relation to the issue of cyberbullying—particularly as it pertains to predatory trolling and the rather violently inclined abuse of our female journalists who work in this place every day—our cultural attitude, our implementation of law and the understanding which our community, law enforcement and employers have is akin to where the conversation with regard to domestic violence was 30 years ago.


Fellow citizens, predominantly women—in many cases people with a disability, members of the LGBTI community, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—suffer daily under the threat that images of themselves in the most private of situations will be shared with a community of billions, due to motivations of hatred and discrimination. A cultural change is needed in this nation. We must now turn towards treating these crimes with the seriousness they deserve. This parliament, by passing this legislation as amended, has the opportunity now to send a very clear message. I urge the government to join us in sending that message and, should the bill return amended from the other place, to support it once again. I urge the minister to utilise his charisma and influence within his party room—not inconsiderable, I'm sure—to convince his colleagues of the need to pass this legislation.


This is an issue of pre-eminent national importance. This is not something which should have been brought on with haste. This is not something which should have been brought on in a political context happening elsewhere. This is not something which should have been dealt with in the fifth year of this government or any government. It should have been something that was dealt with thoroughly, calmly and fastidiously in the first moments of a government's life. But, here we are; this is what we have been given. This is the opportunity before us to make change and to send a message. We support these amendments and I would urge you, as a colleague and as a man who I believe is in possession of profound intellect, to support these amendments as well. I commend them to the House.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:30):  Having heard the minister's responses, it really concerns me that he is continuing to assert that the criminal regime around the country is adequate to deal with this issue. I'm very mindful of the recent social media campaigns, the #MeToo campaign, which put in a public place the level of embedded abuse that is part of the cultural practices of our time. I think it goes to some of the points that Senator Steele-John has just made. The reality is that here today in this chamber, with no further delay, with no more weasel words, the government could take a position to criminalise the sharing of intimate images against someone's will. That's it. It's not like it's a big risk for the government to do this. Four out of five Australians are saying, 'Good on you, you should do it.' We know that Australians want this. We all should know, if we're paying attention to the cultural practices of our time, that a criminal regime is what is called for and what is needed. But still we have these weasel words, still we have this delay, still we have this very passive description of the current structures being adequate. In our view they certainly are not. I have a couple of questions for the minister directly. To what extent, Minister, do you believe a civil penalty scheme will assist the eSafety Commissioner in prosecuting rogue operators, including overseas operators?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:32):  Thanks, Senator O'Neill. When it comes to overseas operators or hosts, I guess, of offending material, the eSafety Commissioner works through a number of global law enforcement networks and also social media networks to endeavour to have offending material taken down. As with all online matters, we always have the challenge that the Australian jurisdiction does not extend beyond the borders of Australia, but this will be further strength to the arm of the eSafety Commissioner.


Just to respond to some of Senator O'Neill's earlier points, the impression that has been left by some of the contributions around the chamber is that there has not yet been the criminalisation of the sharing of intimate images. There already has been the criminalisation of that. Under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, as I have referred to before, it is an offence to use a carriage service in a 'menacing, harassing or offensive' way. Also, I have referred to some of the existing state laws that have criminalised this conduct and some of the laws that are in prospect. So, we do have criminal offences.


What we currently don't have is a civil penalties regime. Delay to the passage of this legislation will be delaying something that does not currently exist, and that is a civil penalties regime. A civil penalties regime will benefit victims practically immediately.


Now, it's entirely legitimate for there to be ongoing discussion and debate about criminal provisions at both the Commonwealth and the state levels, and I'm sure that will continue, but that particular debate is not a reason to tie up this civil penalties regime. I would encourage colleagues to support the passage of legislation which is intended to set up a civil penalties regime and not to have it tied to other debates.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:35):  Minister, with respect, this doesn't have to be an either-or proposition. This amendment gives you the opportunity to do and-and. We've constantly said this, and this chamber has expressed support for the civil penalty regime, but there's an opportunity here for you to do what needs to be done to give people actual choice to prosecute, to go through a criminal scheme to access justice.


Yesterday I made some points about the reality that we have limited choice that's available to victims of the sharing of images to which they haven't given consent. We acknowledge that not everybody will want to pursue the criminal proceedings and some of them would actually prefer to work with the eSafety Commissioner, and a civil regime is okay in that context, but, at the moment, the choice for people to actually prosecute through criminal courts is simply not available to so many Australians. There needs to be a deterrent. Everybody understands this. At least four out of five Australians are saying there needs to be a deterrent. This is sufficiently unpleasant behaviour—this is sufficiently criminal behaviour—that it warrants the Criminal Code, not just a civil regime. That's the view of Australia right at this point of time. I think, Minister, you are completely out of touch with it when you say we have to choose between one or the other.


With regard to your response to my question regarding overseas jurisdictions, we have had, through the eSafety Commissioner's engagement with major social media players, a very good relationship develop, and we have seen improvements in the speed with which images have been removed, because there's reputational damage to those large entities. But, for those overseas rogue players whose business is in fact providing a platform for the sharing of images to which people have not consented, there needs to be some deterrent here at home to stop people from doing that. Criminalising it will provide that deterrent, Minister.


Could you respond to those points and also help me understand: does the minister acknowledge that a criminal regime would provide the eSafety Commissioner with greater clout and capacity to prosecute rogue operators and potentially give the eSafety Commissioner greater success when it comes to enforcement?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:38):  Can I say again: there are existing criminal provisions. If a question is posed to someone, 'Do you think there should be criminal provisions?' they will say yes. And there are criminal provisions. If a question is put to someone with the implication that there aren't currently criminal provisions, then I understand that people would say, 'Yes, there should be.' And there are criminal provisions at the Commonwealth level. There are criminal provisions in most jurisdictions, and those that don't have them are looking to put them in specifically in relation to this matter.


I'm not suggesting, and never have suggested, that this is a case of either-or, of either civil penalties or criminal provisions. I've said that civil provisions complement criminal provisions. We do have criminal provisions at the moment. What we don't have at the moment is a civil penalties regime, and that's what this legislation seeks to put in place.


Senator O'Neill asked, in terms of a criminal regime or further amendments to the criminal regime, if that would be of assistance to the eSafety Commissioner. The answer to that is that, at present, the criminal regime is one that would be pursued by the Australian Federal Police. That could well be the case with further amendments. That is the law enforcement body for criminal provisions at the Commonwealth level.


In terms of enforcing legislation in overseas jurisdictions, while the eSafety office does have a great deal of success in working cooperatively with sites and services hosted overseas to have material removed, as Senator O'Neill has mentioned, it is extremely difficult to compel sites hosted overseas to remove material, because Australian law covers Australia. We don't have an extraterritorial capacity in relation to these matters, and that's where cooperation with partner organisations overseas is extremely important.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I want to briefly mention two hidden gems of Australia, and they are the Indian Ocean territories of Christmas and Cocos islands. But before I do that, I want to mention another island, which is dear to the hearts of many Australians, and that is the island of Tonga in the Pacific. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that there has been quite a severe cyclone through Tonga, Cyclone Gita, category 4, which has caused widespread destruction of Tonga, including the destruction of their parliament house—where I had the privilege to lead an Australian parliamentary delegation late last year. Whilst so far there are no reported deaths, there have been reports of three people being injured and up to 40 per cent of homes damaged.


As one who has lived through a few cyclones myself, I know the horror of being in the path of the eye of the cyclone, which the people of Tonga have experienced. I know the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is on standby to provide help, including military assistance and humanitarian supplies. I want to extend my best wishes to all of the people of Tonga, particularly the parliamentarians, and I met with a lot of them, including the Prime Minister. I certainly hope that the recovery is speedy for the people of that nation.


On almost the other side of the earth are the islands of Christmas and Cocos. Both were originally British protectorates of some form, but since the 1970s, following their own decision, they became part of Australia and part of the Indian Ocean territories of Australia. Recently, I was privileged again to attend on Christmas and Cocos islands—after an absence of 18 years—with the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia, which is conducting an inquiry into tourism matters in the north of Australia. That committee will no doubt, in due course, report on its findings in relation to its specific brief of tourism potential and opportunities on Christmas and Cocos islands.


I will say in passing—I don't want to pre-empt anything that the committee will report on to parliament later on—that they are both unique islands. They are a bit expensive to get to, and a bit difficult to get to, but for Australians who have been everywhere, they certainly should put Christmas and Cocos islands on their bucket list because they are both magnificent islands. They are both quite different, but in their own way are wonderful places within Australia. I say to those who are looking for something different, you should make plans to visit Cocos and Christmas islands.


I won't go into the issues of transport, cargo and those sorts of things, which the committee will report on in due course, but I do want to mention some other things which still need some attention from the Australian government. A long time ago, I used to be the minister for territories and used to spend a lot of time on both islands. I have to say, 18 or so years later, the issues really haven't changed much, and the difficulties that people who live on those islands experienced are still there.


Christmas Island is made up of a population of about 2,000 people, I think. About 60 per cent are of Chinese descent, about 20 per cent are of Malay descent and the rest are Australians or others. On Cocos Island, most of the population are Cocos Malays, who were brought out by the Clunies-Ross family almost a century ago, to what were then uninhabited islands, to conduct copra operations on the island. They are great examples of multiculturalism and how people from all faiths and backgrounds live together peacefully. In fact, the way of life on those islands is an attraction to many of the tourists we came across there. Many people from Muslim countries go to those islands because they feel safe there. There's great cooperation and friendship and welcoming from all of the people of both islands to any visitors.


Christmas Island has its issues. The phosphate mine that's been going there for a long time is about to run out—the lease of the mines is coming to an end. The company is trying to extend that for five years. There is, of course, opposition from those who believe that the natural environment will be impacted upon. But it's something that I think probably should be given a final five years to provide employment for the people on Christmas Island. Until such time as another source of employment can be found, that is one of the few things that gainfully employs people on the island. On that basis, there's the old Christmas Island casino, which many will remember operated in the late 1980s, as I recall. When I was a minister in the late 1990s, the casino had shut down because of some action taken by the then Indonesian government. The licence was taken away. But there is a renewed attempt to get that casino going again. The promoters believe that they could attract a huge clientele from Indonesia and South-East Asia. As long as it doesn't cost the Australian government anything, I would be a great supporter of it, as I was years ago when I was the minister. I would hope that the Australian government will look seriously at renewing the casino licence as it will provide much-needed accommodation and even more-needed employment for many of the residents of Christmas Island. Land release is a real issue on Christmas Island in particular. During our visit I was pleased to catch up with the relatively new administrator, Natasha Griggs, who is doing a wonderful job there—very professional. It was good to catch up with her and see the respect with which she's held by the local people.


Moving on to Cocos Island, there are a number of issues. It is a wonderful island—a coral atoll—a really magical place. The airstrip there was important back in the old days of the kangaroo route, when the planes landed on Cocos as they hopped across from Australia to London. And, of course, during the war it was a very significant military base. It was often said to be Australia's only aircraft carrier, in that you could land aircraft in the middle of the Indian Ocean. It needs upgrading. Fortunately, the government's white paper indicated that funding would be set aside for the upgrading of that airstrip. Upgrading it will not only help our defence and military personnel but it will allow Virgin to fly in bigger and different planes, which will help travel to there. Accommodation on Cocos has improved much in the last 20 years, but it is still only relatively tiny. The availability of land is an issue. But a lot of people are looking at new resorts and new investment there.


There's also a very interesting story about the Clunies-Ross family. I caught up again with John Clunies-Ross, who I have known for many years. He's an interesting fellow and it was good to see him again and relive some of the history of Cocos. One bit of history I wasn't aware of concerned the survivors from the German ship Emden, which was sunk by HMAS Sydney in the First World War. They came to Direction Island in the Cocos group and then stole a boat of the Clunies-Rosses', took it back to Germany and came back there as heroes. But some artefacts have recently been found in the Western Australian Museum, and there's now a little bit of a contest about who actually owns the artefacts, which are the spoils of war. They are two islands that I recommend many Australians should try to get to during their lifetimes.

Despite posting a $71 million profit in 2014-15, News Corp has paid no net corporate tax in four years. Given that some of Australia's largest companies are not paying any corporate tax, why is the government forcing working- and middle-class Australians to pay an additional $300 a year in tax while pressing ahead with a $65 billion tax cut for big business?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (14:00):  I thank Senator Watt for that question. No wonder the Labor Party are so shocking at managing the economy when they are in government, because they clearly don't understand that company tax, business tax, is imposed on profits, not revenue. Let me tell you, the consequences for investment, jobs, wages and the future prosperity of Australian families will be devastating. If Labor want to introduce a tax on revenue, they should say so. If Labor's policy is to introduce a tax on revenue, they should say so.

The PRESIDENT:  I actually couldn't hear what the minister was saying. Minister, if there is something you wish to withdraw please do so. I did not actually hear it with the noise in the chamber—as Senator Hinch outlined.




Senator CORMANN:
  Clearly Senator Sterle knows who I'm talking about when I say 'shifty, socialist Bill'.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, Senator Wong? Senator Cormann, to assist the chamber I'd ask you to withdraw the term reflecting on a member of the other chamber.




Senator Wong:
  On the point of order, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  I've asked the minister.




Senator Wong:
  On the point of order: I wasn't aware that thinking a company that generated $1.84 billion in revenue should pay some tax was a socialist position.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, you know that is not a point of order.




Senator CORMANN:
  Senator Sterle requested that I refer to him by his proper title, so I'm happy, of course, to do this. The Leader of the Opposition wants to increase the tax burden on business, making it harder for businesses to be successful and profitable so that they can hire more Australians and pay them better wages and pay more tax—because more profitable businesses will pay more tax.


This is what Mr Shorten, as Assistant Treasurer, said when it came to company tax cuts. I'll just read it out to you:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


That was Bill Shorten on 23 August 2011.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Trickle-down isn't working, Mathias; you know that.




Senator CORMANN:
  We now have Senator Collins criticising what Mr Shorten said when he was Assistant Treasurer in the Gillard government. The Labor Party doesn't understand that if we want Australians to be as successful as possible we need the businesses that employ them to be as successful as possible. Nine out of 10 working Australians work for private sector businesses. Their future job security, their future career prospects and their future wage increases depend on the future profitability of those businesses, and do you know what? The future government revenue from business depends on the future profitability of those businesses, so we can continue to fund sustainably the public services of Australia— (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (14:06):  It is actually the Australian Labor Party that wants to increase the tax burden on hardworking Australians. You want to take $1 out of every $2 earned from any Australian earning more than $180,000 a year. You want to take permanently, on an ongoing basis, nearly $1 out of $2, out of their pocket. The Labor Party wants to increase the tax burden on the Australian economy by $165 billion. That will lead to less investment, to lower growth, to fewer jobs and to lower wages. The unemployment queues under the Labor Party will blow out, and no amount of misleading statements in the Senate will mislead the Australian people from the fact that, under Labor, the economy would be worse off and Australian workers would be worse off because there would be fewer jobs, more unemployment and lower wages.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (15:05):  Yesterday Senator Steele-John asked me a question in relation to disabled prisoners. The matters raised by Human Rights Watch relate to people with disability within the prison system in Queensland. We encourage the Queensland government to look seriously at these issues; however, we acknowledge that the issue of people with disability in the justice system is a complex one for all governments, which requires constant collaboration between the National Disability Insurance Agency and state and territory justice and housing systems, with leadership and expertise from the providers of these supports. The National Disability Insurance Agency will continue working with the jurisdictions on the identified areas of action, noting also that the justice interface is one of the priority areas of the senior officials working group.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme planning for people with an offending history is complex and requires consideration of how all services available, including mainstream services, support the person's life goals and reduce the risk of reoffending or breaching order conditions. Concerns have been raised regarding the extent to which the National Disability Insurance Scheme planning practices are inclusive of critical information on a person's current involvement with the justice system and the subsequent balancing of a person's goals and aspirations with forensic needs, order imposed constraints and community safety. Formal arrangements are required to ensure a person's rights are upheld to share essential information for the development of an appropriate NDIS plan. This should include details on mainstream supports in place to reduce the risk of reoffending and support compliance with an order. In addition, the National Disability Insurance Agency is currently developing a tailored pathway for participants with complex needs, and state and territory senior officials have been provided opportunities to attend tailored pathway workshops scheduled through March 2018. We welcome the contributions of all governments and the sector to this goal.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:09):  I move:




That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Watt today relating to company tax cuts.



Yet again here in question time today we have seen senior members of the Turnbull government take the side of big business over working- and middle-class Australians. We've seen this time and time again from this government, proving that it is on the side of big business rather than the average Australian. They've done it on penalty rates, by failing to step in and failing to back Labor amendments which would have restored penalty rates to the hundreds of thousands of Australian workers who depend upon penalty rates to pay their bills and put food on the table. We've seen this government do absolutely nothing about the stagnant wages that we keep seeing across most industries in Australia over its entire term of government, and we see this government do nothing whatsoever to help the hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly in regional Queensland, who are suffering from the burst of labour hire, insecure work and casualisation. Time after time we bring examples of these kinds of things into this chamber and ask the government to do something about it, and time after time we see this government take the side of big business against working- and middle-class Australians. Now they're doing it again when it comes to company tax cuts. On top of ignoring the interests of working- and middle-class Australians around penalty rates, stagnant wages and casualisation—in addition to all of that—we see this government roll up and want to give a massive $65 billion tax cut to its friends in big business.


It's funny that the government should want to do this, because at the very same time they're always out there complaining about the amount of national debt, the deficit and how we've got to take tough action to rein these things in. So you would wonder how it is that the government can come up with the money to pay for a $65 billion tax cut to big business. Well, the way they're doing it is by yet again hitting working Australians, the people who are losing penalty rates, whose wages are stagnant and who are suffering from insecure work. This government is right now in the process of increasing taxes on working Australians by $300 per year, through increases to the Medicare levy and a range of other measures. It's also hitting the average Australian who has aspirations for their kids by increasing the cost of universities and cutting funding to universities to reduce the quality of education that young Australians receive. Even if you're not going to university, they're coming after you as well by cutting funding for apprenticeships and training. So on every front we see this government out there coming after working- and middle-class Australians, ripping money out of their pockets and out of the schools and hospitals that they depend on, to shovel it to its friends in big business with a $65 billion tax cut. This tax cut is bad for households, it's bad for the economy and it's bad in particular for regional Australia.


The National Party representatives we have in Queensland like to talk a big game about coming down to Canberra and sticking up for regional Queenslanders. We know they've been very distracted by all sorts of shenanigans in their own party over the course of this week, but here's another example of where they are bowing down to the Liberal Party as the Liberal Party comes after regional Australia. With a tax cut to big companies, the biggest companies in Australia, where do you think that money's going to land? I don't see too many massive corporations headquartered in Rockhampton, Townsville, Cairns or Gladstone. This is going to be a massive tax cut to big business on the North Shore of Sydney and in Collins Street in Melbourne, at the expense of regional Australians. So yet again we've got the LNP members from Queensland coming down to Canberra, saying they're going to stick up for regional Queensland and yet again putting up their hands to vote for big business in North Sydney and Melbourne getting a big tax cut.


The government says that this is going to increase profits and that's how we're going to get wages growth, but the ABC had a report based on Treasury modelling, the government's own modelling, which shows that, over the last few years, company profits have been higher than they have been at any time since the early 2000s. But what do you know? Over that exact same period of time, wages have been growing at a rate that hasn't been this low since the 1960s. So we don't need to speculate about what's going to happen if this tax cut gets through. We've already got the evidence there. Company profits have never been higher, or at least not for 10 or 15 years, and wages remain low. The evidence is in that this company tax cut will do nothing for ordinary Australians. It will not lift their wages. It will just shovel more money to big business in North Sydney and Melbourne at the expense of regional Queensland, and a lot of it will end up with overseas investors anyway.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (15:14):  I've got to confess I made a new year's resolution and I think I'm going to regret it. The resolution was: every time the Labor Party tells a lie, I'm going to respond by telling the truth. I feel that it's going to keep me very, very busy, based on Senator Watt's contribution. I'm going to address two or three of the untruths that he said. He was just parroting, of course, his union masters: Sally McManus, from the ACTU, and other unions, like the CFMEU.


In Senator Watt's contribution—and we're going to call him out every time; we're going to call out Labor every time they tell a porky, whether it's in this place or anywhere else—he said casualisation is increasing. That's what the ACTU and the Labor Party say and it's what Senator Watt said. Well, actually, the rate of casualisation is not increasing; it's been steady for the last two decades at around 25 per cent. The Fair Work Commission agrees, noting that last year the level of casual employment had not significantly changed since the enactment of the Fair Work Act. So there's porky No. 1. Every time the ACTU or their puppets here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives repeat that lie we'll call it out. It's a lie; it's not true. The Australian people need to know that it's not true.


Another one that came from Senator Watt—again parroting Sally McManus, his union master—is that the use of labour hire is increasing. Not true! The proportion of people employed through a labour hire firm has been broadly stable at around one to two per cent over the past decade. That comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Characteristics of Employment Survey. So you can believe Senator Watt, parroting Sally McManus, who says, 'The law doesn't apply to us'—the truth apparently doesn't apply to Sally McManus or to Senator Watt when he comes into this place—or you can believe the ABS, who say that in fact it is not true.


I will deal with another untruth put forward by Senator Watt in his motion to take note of answers, which was in many ways the more damaging lie, but I will just make one other point on casualisation. There were 400,000 jobs created last year, around 80 per cent of them full time. So not only has it not changed significantly over the last 25 years; we've got record jobs growth, and that record jobs growth includes 80 per cent—the vast majority—that are full-time jobs. That is outstanding news and completely debunks what was put forward by the senator.


I would point out that the other just as significant, and perhaps more significant, untruth that is being put forward by the Labor Party and Senator Watt is that you can keep taxes high and the economy will still grow. You can keep taxes high, according to the Labor Party, and of course it will have no impact on jobs and no impact on wages. Not one credible economist would agree with that statement—not one credible economist. The economics of this are clear: if you want to increase taxes, as the Labor Party does—$160 billion in additional taxes on mum and dad investors; more taxes on renters; and more taxes on mum and dad small businesses, effectively a tax on workers—what will it do? If the Labor Party's policies were implemented, what would they do? They would put downward pressure on wages and see fewer Australians in work. They would see businesses laying off workers. And now we get the suggestion, in today's questions from Senator Watt and others, that there should now be a tax on revenue. That is the implication of the line of questioning from the Labor Party. They are now suggesting one of two things. One is that, if you've got a lot of revenue, you should pay tax; it shouldn't be profit based. We believe that tax should be paid by companies on their profits. We believe that lowering profit based taxes on companies increases the number of jobs in our economy, increases wages and increases prosperity. But the other implication of what the Labor Party are suggesting is somehow that, if companies make losses, they shouldn't be able to offset them against future earnings. That again would have dangerous implications for our economy.


In conclusion, we're going to call out the lies. If Senator Watt and others are going to come in here and make up claims about casualisation of the workforce that are not true, we're going to put the facts on the table every time and call them out so the Australian people can see that they are simply hollow— (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  It just shows you how desperate the government is, for Senator Seselja to put up a straw man imputing that we're suggesting taxes should be levied on revenue rather than profit. That is just a measure of the desperation of the arguments here.


For me, it was disappointing to not hear anything of substance from the finance minister in question time in relation to this particular issue. In our questioning, we have raised very substantial issues of public policy, which are raised today in the very good ABC article authored by Emma Alberici. Some extremely important issues are raised, and what do we see from Senator Cormann? We see insults, derogatory epithets hurled at the Leader of the Opposition, and the suggestion that future government revenue is going to be impacted if we don't bring about these irresponsible tax cuts.


Let's look at the facts as they stand. There are some extremely valid points. I was hoping that the government might come up with some compelling evidence that justifies the tax cuts, which some would argue are somewhat reckless in our current fiscal situation. One would have thought that with the amount of money involved—$65 billion—there could be some compelling evidence put forward to justify them. But, no, nothing of that nature was put forward. In fact, the government's arguments are based on ideology and wishful thinking, not on the evidence that's before us.


Let's have a look at this. This is a government that does support the top end of town. They have abolished the budget repair levy, ignored our calls for tax transparency in closing debt deduction loopholes, ruled out negative gearing and capital gains tax reform, run a protection racket for the big banks whilst ripping off everyday Australians, and they're trying to raise personal income tax across the board, by stealth, through the Medicare levy—and Senator Watt has called them out on that issue.


At the same time, we are seeing wages growth at historical lows. The inconvenient truth is that, at the same time, we have company profits that have risen to levels not seen since the early 2000s, and we've seen business investment at historically high levels over the past decade. If the system was working, and if we were to put more money in the hands of companies, then you would have thought that wages growth would have been impacted by that. But we're not seeing that. We are seeing that the model is broken. To go down the track of huge and reckless company tax cuts for the big end of town, for multinationals, for the big banks, is quite a reckless approach. We are also seeing penalty rates being cut for thousands of already low-paid workers—often disadvantaged workers. The workforce is becoming more casualised, as Senator Watt has highlighted, affecting job security. The cost of living is going up with medical expenses, private health insurance, energy bills, groceries and education.


Under the coalition's watch, the budget is going from bad to worse. We saw in the MYEFO late last year that the $23.6 billion deficit remains eight times larger than the $2.8 billion deficit in the Liberals' first horror budget of 2014. Net debt has blown out by $80 billion, to $343 billion, since 2014. Economic growth is down, on the back of families struggling to pay their bills, and the Liberals' return to surplus continues to rely on the tax hike for middle Australia delivered in this year's budget.


The No. 1 priority for this government seems to be giving their big business mates a tax cut to the tune of $65 billion. Well, perhaps that's not quite true—perhaps their top priority at the moment is figuring out how to get the Deputy Prime Minister to resign—but let's say it is one of their top priorities. Why is it necessary for us to deliver huge company tax cuts for the big end of town when, at the same time, one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years? The IMF report, which is quite interesting to see—and I have highlighted this fact—points to the negative impact of the US tax cut package on growth and says that it's projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards, according to the IMF World Economic Outlook. Labor will continue to lead the charge in cracking down on corporate tax cuts. We don't need tax cuts for multinational multimillionaires. (Time expired)

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:25):  The professional homogeneity of those opposite is certainly on display today, and I think we can all agree that the problem with professional homogeneity is that is translates into uncritical groupthink worthy of dairy cows. I have never heard of such economic rubbish in my life. Clearly those opposite have never run a business, they've never owned a business, they've never employed another person, they've never put their house on the line and they've never lost sleep at night wondering how they were going to pay the wages of others tomorrow. What we see opposite is either an extraordinary display of economic ignorance or complete disingenuousness. It's got to be one of the two.


For those opposite to come in here and say that these enormous companies pay no tax and, therefore, there is no reason to lower company tax rates is the height of ignorance. Let's have a look at some of the companies that do pay corporate tax. The big four banks are extraordinarily large corporate tax players. The Commonwealth Bank pays $3.3 billion, Westpac pays $3 billion, NAB pays $2.4 billion and ANZ pays $2 billion. Those four companies alone employ over 200,000 Australians. Telstra paid $1.7 billion in corporate tax—and they employ 36,000 Australians. Rio Tinto paid $23 billion and they employ 26,000 Australians. Wesfarmers paid $931 billion and they employ 200,000 Australians. Woolworths paid $497 million and they employ 200,000 Australians. In fact, the top 10 company taxpayers in this country paid a quarter of all company taxes collected in the last 12 months, and they are responsible for an enormous proportion of employment in Australia.


So how could anybody with any economic nous, anybody with the ability to connect the dots from A to B, possibly suggest that a company tax cut would not benefit Australian workers? It is a completely false, ignorant and, as I said, potentially disingenuous statement. We say 'disingenuous' for a very good reason. It was not that long ago that their own leader, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said that 'reducing the corporate tax rate sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will then flow onto workers in the form of higher wages, therefore improving standards of living'. This is your leader that said this. It wasn't our leader; this was your leader. Yet somehow you've managed to flip-flop, somehow you've managed to change your minds. I can only think it is political expediency, potentially in the seat of Batman, that has driven you to do so.


Similarly, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has also previously stated—and I love this quote—that 'it is a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth'. This is your shadow Treasurer saying this, not ours. Yet you now have the audacity to walk into the chamber and accuse us of the economics of the top end of town. How extraordinary—particularly when we've seen the company tax cuts delivered to 3.2 million small and medium businesses last year actually taking effect. The verdict is in. That company tax cut has already given small and medium sized enterprises the flexibility to grow their business and to create more and better paid jobs. The results couldn't be clearer.


As my colleague Senator Seselja said 400,000 new jobs were created just in the last 12 months alone, and 300,000 of them are full time. We have had 15 months of consecutive jobs growth—that is the longest consecutive run of jobs growth on record. In January alone, 178,000 jobs were advertised. That's up 6.2 per cent, and the strongest monthly increase in eight years. These results are irrefutable. Despite an economy that's been disrupted by the transition from a mining boom, the laws of demand and supply are still the same: more jobs create better-paying jobs. Company tax cuts are an imperative.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:30):  The government's argument on corporate tax is equal parts sophistry and wishful thinking, and nothing demonstrates this better than a very careful unpacking of Senator Cormann's very glib response to Senator Watt that in Australia we tax profits, not revenue. Let's reflect on what's actually prompting this conversation. Analysis published by the ABC showed that roughly one in five of Australia's largest companies paid no corporate income tax over the last three years. This includes some companies that have been the most vocal in calling for a reduction in the headline rate of corporate tax. Not one of Australia's airlines has paid tax since 2013. Some of Australia's biggest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, have not either, and neither have other financial institutions like BNP Paribas, American Express, Barclays bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as News Corp, Atlassian—supposedly one of Australia's big success stories—and a host of other companies.


Senator Cormann is absolutely correct in saying that Australia taxes profit, not revenue. But that is not the point. It is not the point being made by Labor and it is not the point, incidentally, being made by the ABC analysis. It simply is not credible to argue for a reduction in tax for a bunch of companies, many of whom haven't paid any at all for the last three years. How can you claim that a reduction in company tax is going to lead you to paying workers more or investing more if you are not paying any tax at the moment? It simply isn't credible. The argument that it frees up more cash simply doesn't work, because literally no cash is being expended on tax right now. If you have an accumulated tax loss, a reduction in the company tax rate doesn't affect how much money you've got to spend on other things today—not even a tiny little bit. All it impacts on is how many more years you've got before you need to start paying any company tax at all.


More than that though: Senator Cormann's line about taxing revenue, not profit, is a little disingenuous, to use the word employed by Senator Hume earlier. Let's be clear: for the most part, these companies are very, very healthy. They have a decent listing price. They are able to borrow at reasonable rates. Their executives get performance bonuses, and many of them pay out to their shareholders. In other words, they are profitable by any ordinary understanding of that term. But they don't pay taxes on those profits, because they have very expensive and very comprehensive legal advice which, incidentally, they are then able to write off as a tax expense.


The question for Senator Cormann and the government is this: do they really believe it is fair for these companies to pay even less tax than they do now? After two years of the Senate economics committee on which Senator Hume sits taking evidence about the practices of corporations in structuring their tax affairs to avoid tax, do they really think that these sharp practices are reasonable and ought to be continued?


We are trying to have a public conversation about how to fund the state and the services that every Australian benefits from, and Senator Cormann is palming the public off with glib answers that, frankly, belong in an accounting exam. As economists emphasise, companies don't make investment decisions based solely on the headline tax rate. Instead, companies look to things like roads, rail and other infrastructure, paid for by the Australian taxpayer. They look to the skills of our workforce, educated by the Australian taxpayer. They look to the reliability of our justice system, funded by the Australian taxpayer. If a company is not paying tax then the ordinary Australian is going to think that the company is a leaner, not a lifter. If the government seriously think that the best response to this argument is a technical accounting argument about the difference between profits and revenue, they are more out of touch than I could possibly have imagined.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind advisers that they are to remain in the advisers box and not on the floor of the Senate. I didn't want to interrupt Senator McAllister during her contribution.

  While all state-managed harvests of kangaroos for international export must be approved by the state government, kangaroo management, including animal welfare, is primarily the responsibility of state and territories governments.

There have been no adverse long-term impacts on kangaroo populations after more than 30 years of kangaroo harvest management plans. In fact, there are an estimated 47 million kangaroos across Australia today compared with 27 million in 2010. The National Code of Practice for the Humane Shooting of Kangaroos and Wallabies for Commercial Purposes agreed by all states in 2008 must be complied with under each of the states' management plans.

  Abortion is a confronting and divisive topic charged with emotion. However, despite what might be suggested, abortion is not liberation; it is the abandonment of women at their most vulnerable. Human life is sacred, born or unborn. No matter at what stage of development, they have an inherent right to life and liberty. Unfortunately, the reality today is that that isn't the case. We have seen outrage over the destruction of kangaroos, yet where is the same compassion when it comes to an unborn human? We have seen decisions to terminate a life based solely on a woman's socioeconomic situation. I am proud to be from a state that values life.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The opposition does not believe that complex matters such as the one being raised in this motion should be dealt with in formal business. The purpose of formal business is, by its nature, to fast-track consideration of matters that don't require discussion. I think if we reflect on today's session, as other senators have, it's an example to that point. I rise not to make a partisan point but to note that this is a sensitive matter and one that evokes a wide range of views from all senators in this place. Asking the Senate to vote for a simple motion on this topic does not afford senators the opportunity to outline their individual positions adequately, nor the time frame to address them. I foreshadow that if motions on this issue or similar issues are to become a more regular matter in formal business, then it is likely that some senators will choose not to vote on such motions.

But Senator Anning's statement today made it very clear where he stands. It is appalling. All women deserve the right to choose and to control their own reproductive rights, including in Tasmania and other parts where surgical abortions are now not possible.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-02-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:47):  This is an important motion because in around a month's time the South Australian people will face an election critical to the future and good fortunes of my state. This is effectively the last opportunity we will have in this place to bell the cat about some of the issues that are confronting South Australia and to examine some of the solutions, or non-solutions, that haven't been put forward by some of the major parties. And it's significant because what happens in South Australia will affect the rest of the Commonwealth. It's no secret that there are many people who complain about the additional GST that South Australia receives above what it generates for itself. After 17 March the question is going to be that the government in South Australia is either going to lift its game and grow the national pie or continue to keep begging from the Commonwealth as it seeks to grow the size of government. This is the essence of what we face.


In South Australia industry is in decline and confidence is in decline, and it manifestly resolves around the approach of government. The Weatherill government, which has been a Labor government for 16 years, is as much an indictment on the Liberal opposition as on their own ideological bent. I say that because for 16 years they have got away virtually unchallenged in the parliamentary term. They've rarely been confronted about the most significant issues that our state has had to deal with.


When it comes to elections, the Liberals have done reasonably well. They've had the popular vote on more than a couple of occasions, but they haven't got it in the right spot. Their weakness has allowed the Weatherill government to pursue an agenda which has done an enormous disservice. Firstly, we have a massive focus of employment within the public service, which is unsustainable. There are a legacy of elections where they say they're going to make sure that 5,000 additional front-line public service places are implemented, and over the course of the next two or three years there are tens of thousands of jobs that are created there. You may say that is good, but they're back-office services, they're designed to entrench government as the centre of the economy and they're not delivering prosperity or reasonable outcomes to the people of South Australia.


Nowhere is this more glaring than in the idea of electricity generation. I've been very critical of this for a very, very long time in this place. I do not buy the subsidies for green power, wind power and solar power; I do not accept this is in our long-term interest. The ideological obsession of those on the other side of the chamber—and too many on this side, I might add—against coal, against gas and against fossil fuels has perhaps produced the Petri dish which is called the South Australian electricity industry. It's no secret that we have the most unreliable and unaffordable electricity in the Western world—or almost. It's because the Labor government has been pursuing a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, which I regret the Liberal Party signed up to as well as the Xenophon party. The result is we've got a lot of unedifying windmills, we have a lot of solar panels and we don't have any electricity to drive the things that create jobs and generate wealth.


What's the answer to the blackouts and the unreliability according to the Weatherill government? It's to get Tesla's PT Barnum, the equivalent of the monorail salesman from The Simpsons, Mr Elon Musk, to come out to Australia to spend $100 million on a battery that will power the state for about four minutes should it be required. In the meantime, in order to justify and pretend that there is not a problem, they're burning tens of millions of litres of diesel fuel and funding running diesel generators to keep the electricity on during the day. It is an appalling indictment; it is a sleight of hand.


The Labor Party have been able to get away with it because of the weakness of the opposition. Mr Marshall may be a well-meaning man, but he was hugging windmills when he should have been blowing them up. He was helping to blow up the coal-fired power station, when he should have been saying, 'No, let's retain it.' The man has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to every party position that he has actually had, and I can only reflect on the malaise that is infecting South Australia when I quote someone from the opposition benches. They said, 'We might not be any better than the other mob, but we sure won't be any worse.' What a terrible choice, and little wonder that former Senator Xenophon is capturing this market and never being held to account. This is the travesty: Senator Xenophon and his party are taking on the mantra up here of just throwing billions of dollars of borrowed money at issues, but not fixing them—all care and no responsibility.


This is not what South Australia can afford. We need a principled approach to making South Australia the most competitive it can be, and you do that by cutting taxes. You do that by providing the unique competitive advantage that Australia has hitherto had: the cheapest and most reliable electricity program anywhere in the world. That is what will sustain manufacturing. That is what will attract industry. It will retain people in our state: if there are jobs for them and if the utilities are affordable. The quality of life in South Australia, outside of not having a job or the price of electricity, is amazing. We have an abundance of resources. We have huge potential. We just need governments to get out of the way and actually unleash it. You don't get out of the way by foisting new taxes on individuals and making the cost of living unaffordable for them.


We have to do this. We have to fix states like South Australia in order to fix the Commonwealth, quite frankly. There is no way we can say we're going to reapportion some GST to the Western Australians without there being the consequential damage to another state. And who's going to put their hand up for that? No-one. We have to grow the pie, which means we have to make sure that every state can stand on its own and do it's very, very best. In order to do that, we can't dictate from here. We shouldn't centralise power here. We've got to make sure that we have governments in respective states that are going to deliver the services they want, without mortgaging the future of our children. We need governments that are going to produce the outcomes that are going to entice, attract or retain our young people. That is the great lament for so many people of my age in South Australia: we see our teenagers grow into adults and we watch them go away to university, and we wonder, 'Are they still going to be here in three, four or five years time?'


I reflect that, back in the nineties, we lost a generation of young workers in South Australia because of the malpractice and the malfeasance of the then state Labor government. It was terrible. It virtually bankrupted the state. We weren't alone in that, but we never managed to redress it because there was a lack of conviction from the government that ultimately replaced them. They were consumed by internal turmoil and factional warfare, which they're still paying the price for.


I come back to this: we cannot afford for my state, the state of South Australia—a very important state that is now the heart of defence manufacturing and that has enormous export potential in the grains, seafood, aquaculture and wine industries—to go backwards. That means we have to confront some of the issues that we're dealing with. I have enormous respect for my colleague Senator Ruston, who I'm sure is going to get up and talk about the potential of so much in South Australia and how it has been hamstrung. But there are very few in government who are without sin in this place. We need courage. It is going to take enormous courage to confront the necessary issues in South Australia. We're going to have to start to examine a nuclear fuel cycle in South Australia. We're going to have to recognise that we have 25 per cent of the world's uranium resources, and we're not allowed to use it. We have coal. We have gas. We have potential. We have a wonderful quality of life. We just need a government that is going to embrace it, get behind it, and back it to the hilt.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:56):  I too rise to speak on the matter of public importance that has been put before this chamber by my colleague, and fellow senator from South Australia, Senator Bernardi. As a South Australian and a business owner, I, like Senator Bernardi, know the pain being inflicted on my home state of South Australia by the spiralling cost of energy. Extortionate prices are not the only thing we face in South Australia. In South Australia we contend not only with high prices but also with very unreliable power. This can be totally sheeted home to the ill-considered, ideological energy policy that has been inflicted on my state—



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  and your state, Senator Farrell—by the Weatherill Labor government. Mr Weatherill's absolutely idiotic 50-per-cent-renewable-energy experiment has made South Australia the laughing-stock of the nation. We can now boast the highest-cost, least-reliable power in the country—in fact, we can boast some of the highest-cost, least-reliable power in the developed world. South Australia's crazy solar- and wind-dependent energy policy forgot that, when the wind don't blow and the sun don't shine, we don't have any power. 




Senator Wong:
  That's just not true!




Senator RUSTON:
  I totally support moving to a clean energy future, Senator Wong, but to pursue such a policy without considering the transition process that needs to occur is totally irresponsible. So we now find a totally avoidable disaster occurring in South Australia.


Let me paint a little picture of what it looks like in South Australia at the moment. We have no real base load power, so we're totally reliant on the eastern states when we are without wind or solar energy generation. On any given day, families and businesses cannot be sure that the power won't go off. We've got elderly people in my home state of South Australia who leave their air conditioners off on hot days because they're fearful that they won't be able to pay their energy bills when they come in. We've got businesses installing generators because they fear of outages or power spikes. That costs them anything up to $13,000 per megawatt hour. The Labor Weatherill government's solution to this is a great big battery that can store enough energy to sustain South Australia's peak demand for a whopping 2½ minutes. It's really quite ironic that the battery is located in Jamestown because Jamestown was without power last weekend for four hours due to a blackout.


In addition to this, we have a bank of dirty diesel generators consuming diesel. It's interesting that nobody seems to see the irony that South Australia has paid hundreds of millions of dollars buying carbon-spewing diesel generators to fix the faults of a renewable energy policy. It seems quite extraordinary. I wonder if it's ever been considered what the impact on the cost of diesel is likely to be when 80,000 litres of diesel is consumed per hour by these diesel generators. What do you think that's likely to do to the price of diesel? And who in the community is likely to suffer the most from this? Our transport operators and our agricultural industry. We seem to conveniently forget that much of South Australia's economy is generated in our rural and regional areas. Unfortunately, the policies of this sad, tired Weatherill government are really biting in the country. Take, for example, my home area in the Riverland, on the River Murray in South Australia. We're a region that's entirely reliant on irrigation.



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  This is a region, Senator Farrell, that grows most of the fruit and vegetables that you and your family enjoy eating for dinner most nights of the week. Another irony for many irrigators is that taking up the government's call to improve water efficiency to help restore the Murray to long-term sustainable health has now made them much more dependent on electricity to drive their pressurised irrigation systems. I will quote for you some statistics that came from discussions with the Central Irrigation Trust. This is a trust that supplies water to a large part of the Riverland, all the way from Myponga in the Adelaide Hills to Renmark, where I live. Their electricity costs now account for 37 per cent of their total expenditure. Their prices have doubled in the last eight years. It's yet another sad experiment that has now cost South Australia.


We all know the statistics of the renewable energy policy of the South Australian Labor government and the impact and consequences it has had on South Australia. A 50 per cent renewable energy target without any process to transition, with baseload power cut off, has been an absolute disaster. Sadly, it's not just the Labor Party that is keen to pursue vanity policies on renewables. In fact, it was Peter Humphries, the deposed Nick Xenophon Team candidate, who described South Australia's renewable energy policy as 'a vanity policy', but Mr Humphries's commonsense position on energy didn't fit in with the Xenophon team's policy; hence he is no more. South Australia is left with not only the Labor Party's policy but also the Nick Xenophon Team's policy as quoted by the Xenophon team's member for Mayo, Ms Sharkie, who rejected her colleague, saying:


Well, I wouldn't call it vanity politics. Myself and my team, Nick, Skye, and Stirling—


I'm assuming that's Nick Xenophon, Skye Kakoschke-Moore and Stirling Griff—


we agree with a 50 per cent renewable energy target.


That means that not only will we have a 50 per cent renewable energy experiment under the Labor Party but, if Nick Xenophon gets his hands on any power in South Australia, it will be continued.


The good news is that the state Liberal team have a plan to deal with the high cost and unreliable power fiasco that has been inflicted on South Australia by Jay Weatherill. The even better news is that Steven Marshall and his shadow energy minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, stand ready to work with the federal government to resolve the problem. Instead of the blatant and reckless refusal by the Labor Party to accept that South Australia even has a problem, and more importantly a preparedness to fix it, Steven Marshall and his team are ready to stand up and deal with this problem. Both the federal government and the state Liberal team are focused on keeping the lights on in South Australia and reducing household bills and businesses' energy costs.


In summary, the federal government has put together a suite of measures to assist all Australians with the energy crisis that is before us, and many of these will play out very well in South Australia. The federal government has put their energy policy on the table. In conjunction with the energy cost reduction initiatives of the federal government, Steven Marshall has announced that, if he is elected, his government will implement policies to further reduce household power prices, and they will do so without wasting taxpayers' money on the establishment and operation of government owned permanent standalone gas generators; the South Australian Liberals will instead support the construction of an interconnector with New South Wales to provide South Australia with access to affordable and reliable baseload power. At the same time, we will also provide South Australians with the opportunity to export our excess renewable energy. In addition to that, we are also going to provide a $180 million fund to support home based storage, other initiatives in storage, demand management and grid integration. On 17 March, South Australians have a choice. They can have more expensive and unreliable power at the hands of a Labor government, a Xenophon government or a Labor-Xenophon government, or they can choose a Marshall Liberal government that is ready, willing and able to address this all-important issue.


I thank Senator Bernardi for creating the opportunity for this debate. I look forward to him working with the South Australian Liberal government, should we be lucky enough to be elected by the South Australian public on 17 March, to provide the energy solutions that our home state of South Australia so desperately needs.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:05):  I'm very pleased to stand here and speak on the matter of public importance, and I'm delighted to follow my South Australian colleague Senator Ruston, who is continuing the tried and true tradition of the federal Liberal Party in South Australia, and that is to blame everybody else. It's fantastic. Nearly half a decade after they were elected, we've got a federal government that have presided over a complete mess in our NEM, our National Electricity Market, because they've been so internally divided. Now they want to blame everybody else for the mess they've created.


Meanwhile in South Australia, which is the state probably most exposed by the Commonwealth's failings, we are actually taking matters into our hands and trying to fix the mess—something Mr Turnbull could never do because of the internal division. So the contrast could not be greater: a government here in Canberra that is paralysed, when it comes to energy, by its own internal ideological differences—and you only have to read the reports over the last years that demonstrate that—that is trying to divert attention from its own failings by attacking a state Labor government that is actually trying to take practical steps to deliver more-affordable and more-reliable power.


Let's get a few facts straight. The Liberals here are now into their fifth year in office. The current Prime Minister is into his third. Under Mr Malcolm Turnbull, what's happened to energy prices? Up, up, up, up. The energy crisis has developed on the Liberals' watch. It is their responsibility. It's developed because they are so bitterly divided when it comes to energy. Mr Turnbull couldn't even get his own party room to agree on an energy policy. They still haven't got an agreement on a policy, but they're blaming everybody else. Instead of getting sensible energy policy, you've got the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia bringing lumps of coal into the House of Representatives and seriously talking up the prospects of spending millions or more—or billions—on nationalising clapped-out, failing, old, coal-fired power stations. Well, that is not an energy policy.


And their record on gas is even worse. We've seen gas prices soar. What have we seen from Mr Turnbull? Talk, talk and more talk. When gas prices kept going up, Mr Turnbull warned those gas companies that, if it didn't stop, well, he'd talk some more. In the meantime, hundreds of jobs at manufacturers like Qenos and Incitec Pivot are left hanging in the balance as they struggle to secure affordable gas supplies, with companies being offered supply at prices almost double what the ACCC says they should be.


Australians know that the handshake agreement between the gas companies and Mr Turnbull just won't deliver. What we actually need is a little less of Malcolm's incessant talking and a little bit more action—a government actually doing something to ensure reliable and affordable gas. If they were serious about doing that, about ensuring an affordable domestic supply of gas, they would have used some export controls to put some teeth into their agreements with the gas companies.


Let's contrast this with the action that the South Australian government has taken. Jay Weatherill and the Labor government are taking real action to ensure we secure reliable and affordable energy for South Australia. They have delivered the world's largest battery in record time. They are investing in state-owned power generation. After the Liberals privatised electricity in South Australia, we're investing in state-owned power generation and a solar thermal plant—actually taking charge of our own energy future. And what do the Liberals want? More reliance on the eastern states.


The South Australian Labor government is helping more households make the transition to solar with battery storage for 50,000 households—interestingly, criticised by the Liberals but actually pretty similar to a plan that Mr Frydenberg came to South Australia to announce, but then he slunk away because nothing really happened. We know that renewables mean cheaper power, and that's why the next step is for 50,000 homes with solar and batteries working together, providing cheaper power and more reliability. Energy prices in South Australia are already coming down, with the independent national regulator predicting a $300-a-year price drop over the next two years, and that's just the beginning.


In contrast, what do the Liberals want to do? They want to scrap our Renewable Energy Target—ideology if you have ever seen it. We heard it again from Senator Ruston today: 'Let's send ourselves backwards.' Former Young Liberal and former senator, Nick Xenophon, thinks wind farms cause brain damage. Let's be clear what this debate is about today. Labor says South Australia should be more self-sufficient and has the best plan for cheaper, cleaner and more reliable power. What's the Liberals' plan? They want to use taxpayers to prop up coal-fired power and make South Australia more reliant on the eastern states. The extent to which they have no idea what they're doing is demonstrated by their much vaunted electricity plan that Steven Marshall launched, where he said, 'There will be a $302 drop in prices,' and then just a couple of days later had to walk away; it might be only $60 or $70 in five years time. He couldn't even get his own plan right, because it's the wrong plan.


The sad truth about the South Australian Liberal Party is that the leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia is not Steven Marshall; it's Mr Christopher Pyne. Steven Marshall is Christopher Pyne's patsy. That's the hard reality. Where he should be championing his state, he ends up being Pyne's patsy, because he owes his job—lock, stock and barrel—to the control that Mr Pyne exercises over the South Australian Liberal Party. We see that time and again: Steven Marshall failing to stand up for South Australia when it comes to the GST, water and securing our energy future. The reality is that he is nothing more than a patsy for Mr Pyne. He would have been in a far better position if he had been prepared to stand up for the people of South Australia and the issues they care about, rather than simply doing what his political masters here in Canberra want. He is a weak Liberal leader. He is controlled by members of the federal Liberal Party, and in particular Mr Christopher Pyne. The problem is that South Australians know it. The game is up. If you want to know why former senator Nick Xenophon is as popular as he is, apart from—I acknowledge, Senator Patrick—the fact he that he is a very good politician and media performer, the reason is that people know Steven Marshall does what Chris Pyne wants, not what's good for South Australia.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:12):  Electing a government is a lot like entering into a long-term relationship. With that in mind, and in honour of Valentine's Day, I think the voters of South Australia need to be reminded of the most celebrated romance in Australian history. I'm talking about the famous love affair between Labor and the Greens. I know they deny it and try to hide it, but it seems true love cannot be hidden. I think we can all agree that Labor is so head over heels in love with the Greens that they have changed everything about themselves. It's heartwarming to see someone is prepared to sacrifice for true love.


They've stopped hanging out with their blue-collar mates who worked in the mines and factories and ran the power stations—the same mines, factories and power stations that the Greens got Labor to destroy. Now they have a trendy new haircut and a shiny new Prius, have converted to veganism and moved to Melbourne. I know it's annoying that Labor won't return your phone calls and never has free time to hang out anymore, but that is what happens: people change when they fall in love. Though we might not approve of their love of shutting down mines, power stations and businesses, who are we to stand in the way of true love? I know we might miss them when we are out camping and fishing, but we've all seen their photos on Facebook, and no-one can deny Labor looks very happy with their new-found flame at those poetry slams and protest marches.


I know a lot of Australians feel betrayed, feel like they knew the Labor Party. Some felt like they were going to spend the rest of their lives with the Labor Party. I know Labor promised that they would start a business with you. I know there were grand plans to build mines and dams, but they just found someone better: they found the Greens. It's time to accept that the Labor Party has moved on to greener pastures. Some people might think it was rude of Labor to start a relationship with the Greens when they were already spoken for. But that's what happens: people fall out of love and people move on. So it's time to accept that Labor has moved on. They have moved to Melbourne to start a new life with their true love, the Greens of Batman. The people of Queensland and Tasmania also know of the damage this love affair relationship has done. I hope that South Australia wakes up in the coming election, and all Australians in future elections. Remember Labor in the last election in Queensland—chaos. I can see it. Greens and Labor—chaos.

Senator GICHUHI
 (South Australia) (17:15):  I rise to speak on a matter that is very close to my heart. I arrived in Australia in 1999. I had a resume prepared by an expert writer in Kenya. My resume had details such as next of kin, age, gender and marital status. Under marital status it read 'married with issues'. Clearly, it didn't communicate my skills and capabilities to the Australian labour market. Thankfully, under the federal Liberal government of John Howard and state premier John Olsen, there was a program in South Australia called Interlink. As a new migrant, I was enrolled in this program free of charge and I learned how to do a resume Australian style, how to do an interview with Australian employers and how to communicate my skills, my experience and my capabilities effectively. Needless to say, in four short months I was employed as an auditor in the South Australian Auditor-General's Department, a job I held for the next eight years. It enabled me and my family to settle in this country. This is what Liberal Party policies do best. They create the capacity and opportunity for all Australians to enter the job market and, most importantly, be all that they can be. It is a fundamental core value of the party that everybody deserves an opportunity. I thank my colleague Senator Bernardi for highlighting this important issue, which shows how Liberal Party policies help South Australians not only find a job, not only to grow personally and publicly, but to be all they can be in this country.


As a voter, I believe it is vital we have policies that not only enable us to find jobs but that create jobs through small, medium or even big businesses. That is what the Liberal Party in South Australia can do and would do for all of us. Whether you are looking for a job or for people to fill vacancies that your business has created, the important thing is that their policies and values in place give South Australians the opportunity to choose the path that best works for them. Liberal Party policies in South Australia will deliver significant investment, internships and traineeships, among other opportunities. Both state and federal Liberal governments are committed to providing over $100 million for job creation, which will lead to close to 21,000 additional internships and traineeships. This is part of the government's Skilling Australians Fund, a national initiative for vocational education and training. This is happening through the federal Liberal government's jobactive program, which has placed 5,000 South Australians in the job market. In addition, 3,500 South Australians are participating in other programs. There is another program, ParentsNext, which has trial sites in Playford, Port Adelaide, Port Augusta and Whyalla, where participating parents are given personalised assistance to improve their work readiness and a pathway from welfare.


South Australia was once a jewel in the crown of the nation, known for her ingenuity, courage and the entrepreneurship of her people. She has been suffering for many years, but I have great hope that she will rise again as an ethical and economic powerhouse.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:19):  I note that Senator Fawcett was supposed to speak. When Senator Gichuhi jumped up, I didn't make a point about that, and I can understand why Senator Fawcett would be very embarrassed to have to talk about the South Australian election and the party that he—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Senator Fawcett, I'm hoping this will be a point of order.




Senator Fawcett:
  Yes, a point of order. As Senator Farrell would well know, the speaking order was changed, and Senator Gichuhi took my place.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's not a point of order. Resume your seat.




Senator FARRELL:
  Anyway, I thank Senator Bernardi for giving us the opportunity to speak about the leadership of the South Australian Labor government and encourage all South Australians to re-elect it for an historic fifth term. There are very good reasons for doing that, because South Australians have a very clear choice before them in this election. There are three options, really: they can choose a Labor government, focusing on the issues of our state—jobs, health, education and energy; they can choose a failed state Liberal Party that have made a career out of disappointing themselves; or they can choose a Xenophon party made up of people who failed in the failed Liberal Party.


The state Labor government in my home state has constantly and consistently delivered vital projects and necessary reforms to South Australians. A key example of this is the action taken by Premier Weatherill and Treasurer Koutsantonis on energy policy. As the National Energy Market failed under the Liberals, the federal Liberal government simply stood idly by, but the South Australian government took action. They announced a plan and acted to take control of South Australian energy needs.


But you don't have to take my word for that. I'd like to share a few excerpts from the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper in my home state. On 18 December last year, a headline on the Advertiser website informed us 'South Australian electricity bills tipped to drop by $300 over two years'. That article reports:


Expert modelling shows the price drop in SA—7.3 per cent over the next two years—was among the biggest savings in Australia driven by new wind and solar generation.


Then, on 21 December last year, a headline on the Adelaide Advertiser website read '""That's a record"": South Australia's Tesla battery responds to coal-fired plant failure'. I've seen these batteries, and I encourage you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to go and have a look. They're terrific batteries. This article went on to say:


The world's largest lithium-ion battery, built by tech billionaire Elon Musk, responded quickly last week when the coal-fired Loy Yang power plant tripped and went offline.


The battery delivered 100 megawatts into the national electricity grid in 140 milliseconds—


yes, 140 milliseconds. An article by The Advertiser's political reporter—a very good reporter, Sheradyn Holderhead—published on 9 January this year described the success of the South Australian Labor government's energy policies. That article was titled 'South Australia exporting power to Victoria as eastern state imports tumble tenfold'. I'll share the opening couple of paragraphs with the Senate:


SOUTH Australia has shut off on its reliance on Victoria to keep the lights on and has consistently been exporting power to the east coast, new figures reveal.


Data from the national grid operator shows that every week since July, SA has exported more energy than it has brought in from interstate.


Not only has SA exported more electricity but the total amount of power being brought in from the east has dwindled and was now 10 times less than this time last year.


I know you look amazed, Mr Acting Deputy President. Just to avoid being too parochial in the promotion of The Advertiser, here's a headline from The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday: 'AGL to spend nearly $1bn on wind farms'. In that article we're told:


AGL will spend about $900 million to buy wind farms as part of a plan to replace the power lost when it closes the controversial Liddell coal-fired power plant.


It goes on to say that AGL:


… is turning to a mix of different sources—including wind and solar—as it brings more renewable energy on board.


So you see, Mr Acting Deputy President, senators need not take it from me and my colleagues on this side of the chamber or from our Labor colleagues in South Australia. The fourth estate—that great bastion of our democracy that we collectively refer to as the news media—required as it is to report in an accurate, fair, and balanced fashion, has done what the people opposite refuse to do and has told the truth. The truth is that the South Australian Labor government energy policies are providing reliable and affordable electricity not just for my home state but now for Victoria.


On a more local note, I'd like to advise the Senate about the excellent work being done on the ground by hardworking candidates and members across my home state. Starting in the electorate of Newland—a seat in Adelaide's north-eastern suburbs—local campaign extraordinaire Tom Kenyon is pounding the pavement and mustering the community behind him, even as a redistribution put his seat in the Liberal column. In Adelaide's south the member for Elder, Annabel Digance, and our candidate for Badcoe, Jayne Stinson—a terrific former news reporter—are fighting to passionately represent locals in two tough contests.




Senator Birmingham:
  What about the other faction?




Senator Fifield:
  What about the SDA?




Senator FARRELL:
  We don't have factions in the Labor Party, in South Australia. In Croydon, the rising star, Pete Malinauskas, is campaigning his heart out and filling the huge shoes left by the outgoing member and speaker, Michael Atkinson. In Adelaide, Labor's Joe Chapley is taking the fight to the local Liberal Party members who are foolishly opposed to everything from the tram extensions to the new hospital.




Senator Birmingham:
  She changed factions. She swapped.




Senator FARRELL:
  I know you don't like what I'm saying. I know you don't like the truth, but that is the truth. In Adelaide's northern and western suburbs, Labor candidates and ministers alike, such as Michael Brown, Stephen Mulligan and Tom Koutsantonis, are doing excellent jobs representing Labor values across our communities. I know you'd like to shut me up, and now you have to.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:27):  I'm pleased to speak to today's matter of public importance. I don't think anyone would doubt that the March 17 election is critical for our state. It's vitally important that we turn a corner and move away from the dismal path our state has been on for the last 25 years. It has been a path of economic stagnation, industrial retrenchment, high unemployment and relative population decline. While much of the rest of Australia has thrived, South Australia has struggled, and so much talent—particularly young talent—is being forced to seek opportunities elsewhere. We've become regarded with derision by the national, political and economic commentators. That's not the fault of South Australians. We have an educated and skilled workforce. We have reservoirs of technological expertise. We have excellent universities. We have a diverse and resilient mining sector with significant mineral deposits. We have world-class natural energy resources. Why then has South Australia struggled for so long? The short answer is the absolute failure of our state's political leaders and parties. The Tweedledum and Tweedledee of SA Labor and Liberal have long been much more interested in fighting about which side gets their snout in the trough, rather than what's best for our state.


The Labor government is tired, lacking in vision and more interested in who is in and out amongst its own factions than in having a good state. There has been a failure in the delivery of the most basic of services, but the Liberal alternative doesn't promise anything better. Under Steven Marshall, the state Liberals seem to be driven more by a sense of entitlement that they are overdue for their turn in office, rather than any vision for South Australia.


As SA-BEST leader, former Senator Xenophon, on more than one occasion, has said:


For too long, voters have had an awful choice between a government that deserves to lose and an opposition that doesn't deserve to win.


We don't know what the outcome of the 17 March poll will be; most of the experts are perplexed. SA-BEST is hopeful that we will secure seats in the house of assembly, and, hopefully, the balance of power. The polls suggest that this is a real possibility. Time will tell. If we do enjoy a measure of success, SA-BEST will seek to make parliament work better and to deliver better outcomes for the people of South Australia. Parliamentary reform and big improvements to government transparency and accountability are key SA-BEST priorities. We need a root and branch review of SA's failed health system conducted by a royal commission over the next year.


Both Labor and Liberal have announced elaborate schemes with promises of more reliable and cheaper power. But who can hold them to account? That's where SA-BEST comes into the equation. We're aiming to win the balance of power, not to form government. We want our influence from the sensible centre of politics to drive positive reforms on how we are governed, how essential services are delivered more effectively and how the state's problems are tackled. SA-BEST will use that balance of power position to hold a Liberal or Labor state government to account on the promises they make. If the next SA government doesn't deliver, they could find themselves looking for a job.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-02-14,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:03):  I move:


That the Basin Plan Amendment Instrument 2017 (No. 1), made under the Water Act 2007, be disallowed.


This motion is very important. As a South Australian senator it is increasingly important to my home state of SA and, of course, it is important to the health of the entire Murray-Darling Basin system. After decades of debate on how we share the water throughout the Murray-Darling Basin in a way that would be fair and in a way that would keep the river alive, the Commonwealth and the various states came up with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan five years ago. The nexus of that plan was that too much water was being taken out of the river and the river just simply wouldn't survive unless something was corrected.


Five years on we've seen scandal after scandal, allegations of corruption and water being stolen from the environment—siphoned off by big corporate irrigators, only to simply feather their own nests. Yet hundreds of millions, in fact billions, of dollars in taxpayers' money has been spent buying water that is meant to be for the environment, only to then have no idea—as we've seen from leaked correspondence from the Environmental Water Holder and as confirmed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority themselves—how much water there actually is for the river and for the environment.


There are several investigations underway into a number of these allegations of theft and corruption. We have the issues in relation to Norman Farming. The Queensland senior crimes unit is investigating Norman Farming—which, I might point out, is run by a man related by marriage to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud. The minister's own relative by marriage is being investigated on issues of water theft and corruption. We have investigations underway in Victoria. We have a royal commission into water theft in South Australia. We know that there are New South Wales water bureaucrats being hauled into the Independent Commission Against Corruption because of allegations of water theft and mismanagement.


Despite all of this, we have a regulation before us in this place that suggests the Murray-Darling Basin Plan should be amended to take more water out of the river, to take more water off the environment and to hand it to big corporate irrigators upstream. It is rewarding bad behaviour. That is why today's vote is very, very important. Amongst this cesspool of water theft, corruption and mismanagement, why on earth would this parliament sign off on giving more water to the people who have behaved badly and less water to the river that desperately needs it?


I just want to point out that many people may think that in fact this Northern Basin Review and its results were actually written into the Basin Plan and that, as such, that voting on this disallowance motion is either voting for the plan or not. I want to be very clear: that is not the case here. What the plan allows for is a review, but it is up to the Senate to scrutinise that to ensure it is robust and appropriate. In the environment of all the allegations of corruption, water theft and a lack of credible data or reliance on science, it is right for this Senate to say, 'No, we're not going to take an extra 70 billion litres of water out of the river and off the environment to reward bad behaviour.' In fact what is allowed for in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a review, but there is no insistence that the water going to the environment should be increased or indeed decreased. You'd have to have the evidence on the table for that argument.


Of course, we've seen from many experts who have looked at the detail of the Northern Basin Review that that evidence just isn't there and that the assumptions that have underpinned this regulation are inherently flawed. For example, the modelling assumes compliance. We've seen over and over again that there is no compliance throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. There is no compliance that has been able to stop the theft of billions of litres of water that was meant to be for the environment, paid for by the Australian taxpayer, that is now being siphoned off into dams by greedy, big corporate irrigators in upstream states. In fact, the Ken Matthews review highlights clearly that compliance is lacking and insufficient. Yet that is one of the key assumptions that this regulation put forward by the government is based on, so it is already flawed from the beginning.


The MDBA have said themselves that compliance isn't good enough. We know that the environmental flows downstream must be coordinated, and there is no way that that can be measured properly by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority at this point. Of course, the lack of consultation in relation to this regulation is astounding too. The communities that are inherently going to be affected by this have cried foul and that this government and the process of this were corrupted from the beginning. The trust in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is wafer thin because people can see for themselves the mess that has been created by big corporate irrigators who have been taking too much water, getting too greedy and having a blind eye turned to them by the water minister—particularly the former water minister, Minister Joyce, who perhaps, if he'd spent a bit more time focused on his day job, would have known that this was going on.


But let's be clear: the Nationals from the beginning have not ever supported the Basin Plan to a point that would ensure the environment got its fair share. We know that right from the beginning the National Party criticised, didn't think the environment deserved as much, didn't care about downstream states and always tried to undermine this process. Of course it was the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, who said that it was all a Greenie conspiracy that there were allegations of water theft and irrigators downstream crying poor and saying that the water was being ripped off by their big corporate neighbours. That doesn't sound like a Greenie conspiracy to me. It sounds like community members sick and tired of being ripped off by big players. Of course, the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, boasted that, because the Nationals had the water portfolio, he would do his job to keep as much water for big irrigators as he could. This regulation that is on the table and that we are voting on here today is proof of that.


We know that there are significant problems with the way water is being managed throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. We know that billions and billions of dollars have been spent, and no-one can tell us where the water is and where the money went. We need an independent audit before we start playing with the rules. Voting down this regulation by voting for this disallowance motion will give the Murray-Darling Basin Plan the chance to be fixed, the chance to have integrity so desperately needed reinjected into the process and the chance to ensure that the river, the environment and those communities that rely on a healthy Murray-Darling won't simply be left high and dry.


There are parts of surface water that simply aren't metered at all. I must say, as a South Australian, that I'm very proud of how South Australia manages the water that comes over the border into our state. South Australians overwhelmingly are doing the right thing. Among the states, South Australia has the highest meter rating, with 96 per cent of all take from the river being metered. Meanwhile, as the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's own water compliance review found, in the northern basin it's as low as 25 per cent. That means 75 per cent of surface water diversions are not metered at all. We've got no idea, but what we do know, because communities are starting to cry foul, is that big corporate irrigators got too greedy. They got too ahead of themselves digging trenches, siphoning off water, pocketing the taxpayers' money and hoping no-one would notice. Well, we have noticed. We've noticed right throughout the basin, particularly down in South Australia, and we're not happy about it.


This instrument cannot go ahead if we want a Murray-Darling Basin Plan that is actually going to work for the river and the communities that rely on it. We should not be rewarding bad behaviour. Big corporate irrigators are ripping off the river and ripping off the taxpayer, and all this instrument does is reward them. The Senate should vote for this disallowance motion, send it back to the government and say: until you clean up this mess, there is no way we're going to start to take more water off the river just to give it to those who have already been too greedy by far.

It's useful, I think, to have a little bit of history when it comes to the plan, because it was a long time in the making, in many ways a century in the making. It was agreed only after 11 weeks of negotiations by governments right across the basin, and it was the first time that all basin jurisdictions had come together and agreed to manage the basin coherently.


I went back and looked at the Advertiser articles from that time—written, actually, by the much loved Greg Kelton—and the paper remarked at the time:


Getting all the signatories to agree to the 47 points in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Commonwealth and the states was, according to one source, ""taxing"".


I was the water minister in that room, in that COAG discussion with former Prime Minister Rudd, and together we brokered that deal, and I can tell you that 'taxing' doesn't even begin to describe what we had to go through to get all the states, as well as the Commonwealth, on board. But we did it; we did it as a Labor government with the support of the states.


I would make this point, notwithstanding that very impassioned speech by Senator Hanson-Young: the one party that has not supported the plan, and did not support it when we implemented it in government, is the Greens. They didn't support the plan at the time and, I have to say on this, have been happy to grandstand but have never delivered a single drop to the River Murray. When Senator Hanson-Young goes out in the media and calls on me and other Labor Party senators to stand firm on the River Murray, I would remind people listening that the Greens didn't support the plan and they've never delivered a single drop of water. They continue to lecture me and others in this place about the need to enforce a plan they have never supported. I tell you who did deliver the water, and that is the Labor government. I am proud that as water minister in that government between 2007 and 2010 I secured almost a thousand gigalitres of water for the river, something for which I have been criticised, to this day, by the National Party and various irrigation communities, perhaps even by you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams—as you're entitled to do, but I do make that point. It was something that was hard fought and remains hard fought.


I'm also proud to be part of Labor's ongoing fight to ensure this plan is delivered on time and in full. We will not stand by and see the plan wrecked after a Labor government delivered a historic agreement, at the Council of Australian Governments, that for the first time in a century ensured all the jurisdictions along the Murray-Darling Basin were directed to one end—that is, the health of the basin. I am not going to stand by and see a plan that was delivered under legislation that a Labor government delivered wrecked by this government.


Let's understand why the plan is at risk. The plan is at risk because Mr Turnbull handed the National Party the water portfolio. He did so because, in order to secure his own job, he needed to keep Mr Joyce and his colleagues happy with a plan they did not support. It is the years of backsliding under this government, and particularly under the Deputy Prime Minister, that have brought us to this point, where this Senate is forced to disallow the instrument on the table. This was no accident. Let's remember that it is Mr Joyce who said that the plan didn't have a hope in Hades of being delivered. It is Mr Joyce who said that South Australians should move where the water is. You can't deliver half a plan, and that is fact.


We have had extraordinarily serious allegations of water theft and corruption in the northern basin. They confirm South Australians' worst fears. Yet Mr Joyce's response made it clear he had no intention of doing anything about those allegations. You know what he said? He said it's overwhelmingly an issue for New South Wales. As my friend and colleague Tony Burke pointed out:


The problem for 100 years was that the Murray-Darling Basin was treated as a state issue rather than as a complete river system. What Barnaby Joyce has said today effectively unwinds the entire reason for Murray-Darling reform in the first place.


Even worse, when Mr Joyce thought the media weren't listening, he made his contempt for the plan crystal clear. Out of his own mouth he told irrigators in Shepparton that the Four Corners expose of water theft was a plot to steal their water:


We have taken water, put it back into agriculture, so we could look after you and make sure we don't have the greenies running the show … Four Corners, you know what that's all about? It's about them trying to take more water off you …


These are incredibly serious allegations, with credible evidence of theft and corruption, and he says it's about trying to take the water off irrigators. That's the federal minister responsible for water publicly condoning water theft, for which he is responsible, and making it very clear he had absolutely no intention of backing the plan he was required by law to enforce. He was happy for the water to be diverted and to see the plan wrecked. When we are followed in this debate and in the media by Senators Birmingham, Ruston and others, who I'm sure have a slightly different view to Mr Joyce, let's remember that the people who put the plan at risk are the National Party and the people who put the National Party in charge of the plan are the Liberal Party.


Frankly, Mr Joyce's performance is simply not good enough for all of those whose lives and livelihoods depend upon the health of the Murray-Darling. The person who should shoulder most of the blame for this is Prime Minister Turnbull, because he allowed Mr Joyce to take control of water, knowing full well it was his intention to wreck the plan by walking away from the commitment to deliver the full 450 gigalitres to South Australia. We need to restore confidence in the plan, and that means ensuring what this government promised and committed to is upheld—that is, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan delivered on time and in full—and that the 450 gigalitres of water for the environment will be delivered.


The South Australian government, led by Jay Weatherill, has fought hard for that. It is a key part of the plan. We need to ensure that environmental water, paid for by taxpayers, is not simply diverted to irrigation dams. Until we can guarantee that water purchased by taxpayers gets to the parts of the river where it is needed, it is difficult for us to support the northern basin proposal. Until this government demonstrates it is serious about tackling the allegations of theft and corruption in the basin, we are not in a position to support the northern basin proposal. Let's remember that Labor put this plan in place, fought for additional water for the environment and put money on the table to make it happen. We need the plan to be delivered in full. As Mr Burke has said:


Now, you can't have a situation where the Australian taxpayer is paying for environmental water and environmental watering events being organised and that exact water is being pumped straight back into dams.


We want to make sure that the review is done comprehensively and that the rules that have created significant problems for the integrity of this whole system are dealt with at the same time.


I'm pleased to say that Labor has been in discussions with the new minister for water to try to resolve these issues. We acknowledge the challenges he faces in cleaning up the mess that has been left by the Deputy Prime Minister, and we are pleased that there are signs that this minister, unlike Mr Joyce, does appear to be interested in dealing with these issues, including the issue of water theft. But Labor cannot today say those issues have been resolved. They have not, and time has run out.


We have said the whole way through we cannot allow a reduction in the volume while it is still possible for environmental water to be pumped back into irrigation. We want the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to survive; it is the plan we delivered in government. But we cannot agree today to reducing the volume of water without the proper assurances that the basin will remain healthy and that work is delivered that addresses serious concerns around compliance. These concerns are not just ours and they continue to be aired, whether it's on Four Corners or, I think last night, on 7.30, along with other information that is put into the public arena by people who live in the basin.


We are prepared to work constructively with the government and the authority—the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—to deliver a genuine outcome. I hope this plan doesn't fall apart—we worked very hard on it for many years—but if it does, I'll tell you where the responsibility would lie: the responsibility would lie with the government that has, for the past four years, allowed the Deputy Prime Minister to wreck it for partisan interest at odds with the needs of the river and the needs of the overwhelming majority of the people who rely on the river.


This isn't just about South Australia or Queensland or Victoria or New South Wales; it is about whether our greatest river system has a future. And it is about whether there is a Commonwealth government that is prepared to act in the interests of all Australians to safeguard that river system for all, for now and for the years ahead.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-02-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:26):  I come to this debate relatively late in the piece. My interest in the health and wellbeing of the Murray-Darling Basin system was piqued by the Four Corners report into the allegations of theft and corruption upstream. That's why I joined with most of my South Australian colleagues to say there needed to be a royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin allegations and the theft.


In not knowing what I don't know, I've been open to all sorts of representations. I have to say my judgement has been clouded by the lack of disclosure in some instances, the wilful misrepresentation of particular points of view by those with vested interests. I've tried to balance those against those whom I respect and have judgement for. I do want to acknowledge that Senator Ruston—the second time today I've damned Senator Ruston with faint praise—has tried to be a very straight player in this, and I do accept that what she has told me has been accurate and said in very good faith. But I still labour over this decision. I labour over it because I'm deeply concerned about the long-term wellbeing and health of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


But this is tempered by the fact that I don't like being bullied by people who I think have essentially been crooked in this. For the New South Wales government to say the entire Basin Plan is at risk over 70 gigalitres of water, when they are essentially on the hook for undermining the entire effort—turning a blind eye to it and, I would say, blatant, outright corruption—is appalling. And if bullying or threatening these sorts of tactics are the ways they want to get a resolution, they should think again because they don't have any credibility in this space.


I also happen to agree with Senator Wong about the problems with the Deputy Prime Minister being in charge of the water portfolio. I think there was enormous compromise there. I respect the fact that many people say the new minister is committed. I've had meetings with him, and he's been committed to this program. But my confidence in the new minister was undermined when, shamefully, he decided to put out a press release calling upon a party member of mine, who happens to be in Queensland, to 'stand up for Queensland'. A member of a political party has been told to stand up against this South Australian-centric politician who's here representing the interests of the state and trying to balance it across the whole thing. And the minister said, 'The people in Queensland would be worse off as a result of this disallowance today.'


Where it falls on shamefully hollow ground is the fact that the minister himself is related to one of the people in Queensland who have been accused of rorting the water systems themselves. They've been raided. It doesn't matter whether Mr Norman is the brother-in-law, as reported, or the wife's second cousin. There is a direct link with someone who has been rorting the water system or is alleged to have been, whose farms have been raided by the Federal Police, who has been accused of building 'roads'—in those quotation marks again—that just happen to store piles of water from the flood plains and prevent it getting down the river. The fact that this wasn't disclosed, except by the ABC, and I had to start digging through it and find out about it in recent times is extraordinary.


So, if the minister wants to harangue one of my party members about standing up for Queensland's rights, perhaps the minister would stand up for Queensland's rights and his electorate and tell his brother-in-law, or his wife's second cousin, to bulldoze those illegal structures, to stop ripping off water, to stop ripping off the money from the Murray-Darling Basin system, as have been detailed on the ABC.


I will not stand for the hypocrisy in this place. I do not know what I do not know. I have made efforts to find out what it is. Every time you turn around, you get this stench of crookedness and corruption, and unfortunately it all comes from a very similar space.


I am absolutely proud of what South Australians have done in managing a scarce and precious resource. We—and people far more interested, far more energetic, than me—have worked very, very hard in making sure we manage our water rights absolutely well, and we are being let down by what is happening upstream.


I do not trust them. That is the regret. They want to walk away from this basin agreement, an agreement that they signed up to. But, when they find it slightly difficult because of—who knows?—one of the people that have been on the receiving end of their beneficial allocations, or the illegal water structures, or the mismanagement and misallocation of taps, they go to water, if you'll excuse the pun, and expect the rest of us to pick it up.


As I said, I don't know what I don't know, but what I do know is this: the lack of trust and the lack of accountability fills me with scepticism. For that reason alone, I will be supporting this disallowance, because to make changes of this nature, which could have a profound impact not only on my state but on the entire Murray-Darling Basin river system, due to threats, bullying and intimidation is not the way that business in this place should be done.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",NXT,2018-02-14,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:32):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young. I can indicate to the chamber that the Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting this disallowance. It is a decision that we have considered carefully, and it is a decision that we have not taken lightly. The Murray-Darling river system is a vital national resource. In my first speech I said that ensuring the health of the Murray-Darling river system so that it's sustainable from both an economic and an environmental point of view was an important priority.


There is a rich history behind the Murray-Darling Basin, and the establishment of an overarching management for the whole of the basin was not without dispute. It took the severe Federation Drought, from 1895 to 1902, to bring the states together to start to agree on the management of the Murray. From the 1970s through to the 1990s, state governments undertook initiatives to sustainably manage land and water. An intergovernmental approach was needed, and in 1987 the first Murray-Darling Basin agreement was reached, which established the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. With the passage of the Water Act in 2007, the establishment of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the development of the Basin Plan with bipartisan support, there was a hope that the dispute would be resolved. However, over 100 years later, and five years after the plan was implemented, it is apparent that that dispute still exists.


While NXT is supportive of the plan being implemented in full, there has been a significant reduction in public confidence in the plan's implementation over the past 12 months. We've heard a few of the allegations around the chamber. I did travel to Goondiwindi last year and visited one of the farms that have been talked about on the ABC, and these allegations are serious.


NXT is not alone in its view about the lack of confidence. It is a view that has been expressed by a variety of stakeholders and, indeed, government authorities, and that includes the New South Wales government's Matthews review and the federal Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review. The solution to restoring this confidence lies with a range of measures relating to both transparency and compliance. I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record some of these measures.


NXT is firmly of the view that transparency must be codified before proceeding further with the plan. As a minimum, the following must be released publicly for any proposed water measure, including water buybacks: all modelling and modelling reports, not limited to the final proposals, but those carried out to evaluate the effects of any measures; an independent assessment of the measures; and, in the case of water buybacks, all valuation and assessments made by the government and including independent valuations assessments, which must be made public. The contracts to implement the measures must also be made public. In the case of water buybacks, the contracts should show as a minimum the expenditure amount, the scope of the work associated with the expenditure amount, and the associated volumes of water. In respect of the contracts, we also need to see verification reports showing that the contracts have been complied with. We also need to disclose validation reports—I will talk about those a little bit later—to make sure that we understand that the measure that was intended has been achieved. All complaints in respect of noncompliance must be published on an annual basis, de-identified as required, including a report as to the outcome of any investigation triggered by a complaint.


NXT is also of the view that a number of compliance measures must be put in place before proceeding with the plan. Measures that must be addressed include basin-wide accurate, reliable and tamper-proof metering and the implementation of real-time water accounts. These are not radical ideas. These are ideas that actually reside within the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review recommendations. Furthermore, all water measures should be subject to strict verification and validation procedures to show contract compliance and, again, the effectiveness of the measure. So, we do something to the river and then we measure it to make sure that what we've done is achieving the results that we thought we were paying for. There must be a substantial increase in the number of compliance officers across the basin, including the Murray-Darling Basin Authority compliance officers. New South Wales has one compliance officer per 355 gigalitres of diversions. Queensland has one per 235 gigalitres. South Australia has one per 56 gigalitres.


It is acknowledged that there have been a number of useful recommendations flowing from the Matthews review and the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review, particularly in relation to compliance measures. It is noted that timetables have been put in place to implement the recommendations. Nonetheless, the implementation of the recommendations is subject to risk. That's been overtly stated in the case of the Matthews review.


Time is required for the recommendations to be implemented and to bite into the issues they are intended to resolve. It is not an unreasonable position to delay any changes to the plan until the recommendations start to deliver positive outcomes. It is noted that Queensland's independent audit of Queensland's non-urban water measurement and compliance will not report until March 2018. This may be a critical piece of the compliance puzzle. Let's wait and see what it says.


In relation to the northern basin, NXT has concerns with respect to the modelling associated with the Northern Basin Review. For example, the modelling omitted certain hydrological indicators on the Barwon-Darling River, thereby not properly considering the impact of reduced water recovery on low flows, and the modelling was based on best-case scenarios. Another aspect of the changes, for instance, is a lack of statutory requirement to protect water that is recovered with taxpayers' money. These concerns have been exacerbated by The Australia Institute's 'Northern disclosure' paper, which came out a few days ago, which makes a claim that the effect of the proposed SDL adjustments to South Australia has varied from 20 gigalitres down to four gigalitres without any explanation as to the change. Some light needs to be shed on the reasoning behind those changes so we can be confident that what is finally presented is correct.


I will also talk to the SDL adjustments, because—as I will come to—we need to think about an integrated approach to moving forward. Talking about some of the issues associated with the 36 projects that will be used to offset the 605 gigalitre changes, NXT has sought the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's acceptance of the 36 projects by way of a Senate order for production last week so that we can examine the authority's view on the projects as a counterweight to the public perception, which is currently bad. It is important to see this information in order to be informed with respect to any final decisions on the SDL adjustment mechanisms. I note the government is cooperating.


It is also NXT's understanding that the Water Act states that, in setting the SDLs, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority must act on the basis of best available scientific knowledge and on socioeconomic analysis. They must take into account the principles of ecological sustainment and development and give effect to relevant international agreements. The proposed amendments include a provision for states to request a reallocation of the SDLs between valleys within basin zones, for example, within the northern basin of New South Wales. This amendment suggests the MDBA has left it open to a state to vary the SDLs by valley outside the recommendations in the Northern Basin Review or the SDL adjustment mechanisms. Such a change would be outside any parliamentary process and there is no requirement for the revised SDLs to be set with regard to best available scientific knowledge and socioeconomic analysis, principles of ecological sustainable development or relevant international agreements—so there's a problem there.


Any scientific algorithm that was used to initially justify the SDL can subsequently be replaced by an alternate algorithm by the MDBA and the states behind closed doors, and this proposition is clearly unacceptable. The MDBA did not consult publicly on this amendment. It is NXT's view that changes to the plan should be presented in an integrated package: that being, changes resulting from the Northern Basin Review—and we accept that there needs to be some adjustments—changes to the southern basin SDLs and the 450 gigalitre efficiency measures. Ernst & Young reported into the feasible of the 450 gigalitre efficiency measures, but we note that it is, at this stage, only advice to government. This advice needs to be transformed into an approved action plan, which is presented at the same time as changes flowing from the Northern Basin Review and changes to the southern basin SDL adjustments. NXT support for the changes to the plan are contingent on this sort of integrated approach.


The Nick Xenophon Team strongly believes there is a way forward. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a national plan that represents a sensible compromise across competing requirements, including socioeconomic and environmental requirements. No stakeholder was completely happy with the plan, but they recognised its importance. It is noted that some stakeholders have indicated that the disallowance of the instrument before this parliament would cause the plan to collapse. That is in nobody's interests and it will be for the government to ensure this does not occur. In support of the government, NXT indicates that it is willing to support the passage of the instruments through the parliament, just not under the current circumstances. A pause is required for some issues to be addressed and to permit implementation of the recommendations of the various reviews, including the Queensland review when it reports. The Northern Basin Review instrument can be brought back before the parliament, and NXT is open to agreeing to amend the Water Act to allow the SDL adjustments to come back before the parliament.


There is a suggestion from the New South Wales government that a successful disallowance today would cause them to walk away from the plan. I have to say this is a little disingenuous, considering the New South Wales government has its own serious river compliance problems. Their own Matthews review stated this clearly. Indeed, there is an ICAC investigation underway into corruption on the Barwon-Darling.


Everyone needs to remain cool headed. We are dealing with a national river system that must be managed on a national level. Abandoning the plan would be counterproductive, and, again, the government must act to ensure that does not occur. It seems everyone agrees there is a problem, including governments, and there is general agreement on what needs to be done to fix it. The solution just needs time to be implemented, and the Nick Xenophon Team believes supporting the disallowance on the Northern Basin Review gives us that time.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:45):  I will be brief—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Point of order, Senator Cameron?




Senator Cameron:
  Point of order: a Labor senator jumped up. The normal process is the call should come here. That's how it works.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, it does work like that, but it also works with a bit of fairness, Senator Cameron. We've had the Greens, Senator Bernardi, Labor, the crossbench, and no government at this stage. I'm trying to be fair and go from side to side, as the chair normally does. We just took a speaker from that side of the chamber. Now I'm taking a speaker from this side.




Senator Cameron:
  Well, that's not—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I will seek some advice and I will go on my advice. It's my call, and it's who I saw first. Senator Leyonhjelm, you have the call.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I'm tempted to vote in favour of this disallowance. What holds me back is that I'm not sure if New South Wales and Victoria would, in fact, stand by their decision to walk away from the plan. But I wouldn't be too upset if they were to walk away from the plan, because the plan is deeply flawed. It requires social, economic and environmental issues to be equally balanced in terms of managing the water in the Murray-Darling Basin. However, the problem is that only one of those three—environmental issues—is seriously taken into account.


The plan arose in the context of the millennium drought, the most severe drought for 100 years. It prompted panic about climate change and it led some to conclude that droughts were the new normal, that it would never rain again, that water would always be scarce and the environment was facing catastrophe. Sensible people knew otherwise. Droughts always end, and, in 2010-11, that happened. There was widespread flooding and the recovery of wetlands. Birds bred enthusiastically, frogs and fish proliferated, and life carried on as it always has. Dorothea Mackellar's Australia—'a land of droughts and flooding rains'—was never better demonstrated.


During the drought, this plan was devised—first by the Howard government and then by the Rudd-Gillard government. Its intention was to remove water from agriculture in order to save the environment. The details were negotiated during the Labor government period against a background of panic over the drought, state bickering over water sharing, and the threat to Labor from the Greens. As a result, the plan was one per cent science and 99 per cent politics.


The plan calls for the return of 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment, to be obtained both by buying back water rights from farmers and efficiency measures. There is a further 450 gigalitres to be returned, subject to certain conditions. Water rights have been bought back from farmers in southern Queensland, the northern basin area, New South Wales and Victoria, and a small quantity from South Australia.


In 2015 and 2016, I chaired a Senate inquiry into the effects of the plan's implementation. We held hearings all over the country. What we found was that the loss of irrigation water in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria was having a very profound impact on rural communities. Farms that previously grew irrigated crops—fruit, cotton and pasture for dairy cows—were now growing dryland crops or running a few sheep. They required far fewer inputs—machinery, fertilisers, seeds and so forth—and, as a result, those input suppliers were the ones who were missing out and their workers. The farmers who sold their water were fine, but everybody else who benefitted from those farmers and those farms being active were really suffering. Workers moved away from towns. Communities had fewer people. There were fewer children in schools, volunteer firefighters weren't there and there were fewer customers in local shops and so on.


What we also found was that there's very, very poor understanding of the plan. There's this almost religious belief that the environment simply needs water—just add water and it will all be okay. It doesn't really matter whether it's in the right place, in the right quantities or at the right times—just add water was pretty much what we heard. The fact is, of course, that too much water in the wrong place can do more harm than good.


There is another factor, which nobody seems to be addressing, and that is the river at the moment, in particular the Murray River, is running pretty much right up to the top of the bank. More water added to it, as the 450 gigalitres extra would do, couldn't be carried. The river could not carry that amount of water. Nonetheless, it is often heard that unless that water is added some sort of environmental disaster is going to occur.


I struggle to see why this was ever a South Australian issue, particularly in relation to the Northern Basin Review. The northern basin is all about the Barwon-Darling rivers. The amount of water from those two rivers that ever reach South Australia, or even join up with the Murray at Wentworth, is tiny—on average, across all years, six per cent. It's a tiny amount. It wouldn't matter if irrigation stopped in the entire Queensland and New South Wales areas, where it currently occurs; there would be very, very little additional water ending up in South Australia.


The other problem is: when it does end up in South Australia, what's it used for? It's not as if irrigation in South Australia has been suffering. It ends up in Lake Alexandrina. Lake Alexandrina is kept artificially fresh. It is not a natural freshwater lake. It is an artificial freshwater lake. Large amounts of water, an estimated 900 gigalitres, evaporate in Lake Alexandrina. Here we are taking fresh water, which could be used for agriculture, away from what were thriving rural communities—used for irrigation and so forth to produce food and fibre—and it is running down the river and ending up in South Australia to be evaporated. It's an absolute travesty. If that plan were to blow up and not be re-established unless on more sensible terms, I, for one, would not really mind.


The other issue is South Australia's water supply; it was never in doubt. There is plenty of water for Adelaide. There is plenty of water for South Australia. In fact, there is a guarantee in the plan of 850 gigalitres—more than enough. I am hugely sympathetic to those poor farmers in northern Australia, in Queensland, and in northern New South Wales, who, in the Northern Basin Review, have lost their water. I'm immensely sympathetic to them. Taking more water off them, which would occur if this review were not implemented, would be an absolute tragedy. I will be voting against the disallowance, but, if I thought that voting in favour of it would blow up the plan then that's where my vote would be going.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:53):  Senator Cameron, we have an agreement across the chamber.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  Chair, you indicated in your last ruling on this issue that you would go from side to side—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I did.




Senator Cameron:
  Senator McAllister has been here waiting patiently to get the call. You ignored her last time. You said you would go from side to side. I really think you should do what you said last time—go from side to side, and, as you said, be fair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron. The Clerk has told me it is my call. Senator Ruston has been here since the start of the debate. You have the call, Senator Ruston.




Senator RUSTON:
  I had a point of order, but I won't waste any time so that I can let Senator McAllister speak. I stand here speaking on behalf of the coalition government to stress the absolute importance of the delivery of this plan in full and on time, not just to the people of South Australia, as Senator Leyonhjelm has just described, but to every single citizen of Australia. Every single citizen of Australia has a stake in this plan. This is a shared resource. The importance of making sure that we have a sustainable Murray-Darling system into the future is absolutely paramount because it is the obligation of this generation to make sure that that river is in the same state or a better state and a sustainable state for future generations.


The development of this plan has been a long time coming, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well know. We worked for 100 years to be able to get to this place and this time. In 2012 then-Minister Burke, the Labor minister who was responsible for water, sat down and managed to negotiate the bipartisan support for the delivery of this plan. This plan is not bits and pieces; this plan is a total plan. It includes up-water, it includes down-water and it includes gap water. There are reviews built into it to enable us to adaptively manage as we get more information. This whole plan has been built on the bipartisanship of the support between the coalition—the Liberals and the Nationals—and the Labor Party. So it is with great regret that I stand here today with the suggestion that there is some likelihood that this disallowance motion will get up and put this plan at risk.


I would also say that one of the great things when we as Australians and as people in this place travel around the world is that we are the envy of the rest of the world because of our water management policies in this place and in this country. We're the envy of the world because we tackled a huge problem like the Murray-Darling Basin. We got together and we provided a blueprint for that solution. We are six years into the 14-year delivery on that plan, and it scares the hell out of me that we would suggest that for political reasons—which appear to be the reasons today—we may disallow one of the important components of the plan and that we could actually put this plan in jeopardy. I suppose that, whilst I'm disappointed in Senator Hanson-Young's disallowance motion, I don't suppose I'm particularly surprised. I certainly don't believe she's about the sustainability of the system; I believe this is all about the fact that the Greens don't want us to grow food in the Murray-Darling Basin. They don't want us to take any water out. I'm not particularly surprised at their obstruction.


I would like to put on the record that there were many things in Senator Hanson-Young's contribution that were factually incorrect. There was no acknowledgement for the good practices that have been put in place in the basin. There was a total over-exaggeration in relation to the threat. They come in here and they make allegations under privilege. Senator Hanson-Young came in here and said John Norman was Minister Littleproud's brother-in-law. He's not Minister Littleproud's brother-in-law, and I'm sure she probably knows that. But the inference and the insinuation, by making these accusations, is that something untoward is going on. I would suggest that if she's going to make those insinuations she could go outside of this chamber to make them so Minister Littleproud has an opportunity to respond.


The amendment that is currently before us that we are seeking to pass through this chamber is an amendment that's actually been generated through a review that was put in place, into the Water Act, by Minister Bourke when he was the minister responsible for water in the previous Labor government. What we are seeing here today is a response to a completely complied-with consulted review put in place by Mr Burke. Now we have a suggestion from Senator Wong that they are now going to vote against the very outcome of the review they sought to have. In the northern basin, 200 people's jobs are going to be threatened if this particular amendment is disallowed today. There is no recognition that there is the potential to deliver really good outcomes and really good environmental outcomes in the northern basin with the delivery of the water targets that we are proposing now should be implemented. The livelihood of 200 people—200 families—are not going to be destroyed for the sake of a very nominal and potentially negligent improvement in environmental outcomes. I would call on the Labor Party to think about the hypocrisy of what they are doing here. Think about the hypocrisy of the fact that you are seeking to vote down an amendment that was of your own making.


Can I also say how tremendously disappointed I am in the Nick Xenophon Team for coming in here and indicating that they don't want to support the amendment either; they're going to support the disallowance. This is Humpty Dumpty politics as its absolute worst. I have read the correspondence that we have seen from the Nick Xenophon Team and I have listened to the contribution of the Nick Xenophon Team. They come in here and say they want to work with us and that they want to deliver the plan. But this is Humpty Dumpty: we are going to come in here today and push Humpty off the wall and smash him into a thousand pieces, and then after the South Australian election we will ride in on our big white horse and help you put the plan back together again. Well, let's not break it in the first place, Nick Xenophon Team, because if we don't break it we don't have to put it back together again. And we can walk and chew gum at the same time—we can continue to deliver the plan and at the same time fix up the problems that you have so eloquently highlighted, which we admit are occurring out there in the basin.


Needless to say with Labor, it is politics over the river's health, politics over our local communities, politics over the people who grow the food that we all like to put on our tables so that our children can eat healthy, clean, green Australian-grown food. We're going to put that at risk. We are going to jeopardise the plan. I say to everybody in this place: please don't think of a game of bluff—the New South Wales and Victorian governments have been quite clear that they are going to respond if this disallowance is upheld. I hope they don't. I will work very hard to get them back to the table, as I'm sure you would expect me to. But please don't threaten them. Basically, what you have done is put a gun to their heads and they've now put a gun back to your head. Why don't we all put our guns down and come back to the table and continue to deliver this plan, as we all said we were going to do in 2012.


This is not a game of bluff. If we see an outcome where New South Wales or Victoria choose to walk away from this plan, as they are threatening to do at the moment, it would be an absolute unmitigated disaster for our state of South Australia. We are the great beneficiaries of the plan delivered in full. I want the plan delivered in full, all 3,200 gigalitres of it. I want it delivered in full and I will work with anybody to make sure we deliver it in the best possible way. I'm happy to listen to everybody's comments about how we can do it better, how we can deliver better outcomes and how we can be more efficient with irrigation water and environmental water. So, why don't we all get back to the table and start being constructive, because pulling this thing apart and going in different directions is serving no purpose for anybody.


Today, Professor Williams from the University of Adelaide went into print to say that the danger of blowing up this plan is absolutely extreme for South Australia. Do not call New South Wales and Victoria's bluff, because if they are not bluffing South Australia is in a very serious and precarious state. I would suggest to all of you that you read Professor Williams's comments about the legal consequences. It is all very well and good for Minister Hunt to say he is going to take it to the High Court, but I have to tell you that the losers will be South Australia, our river and our river communities.


I'm not moving away from the serious allegations that have been made about what is going on. But let's fix them. Let's not come in here and blow up the plan. Can I also say that among everybody who has stood up and made a contribution in this place on this particular disallowance motion I haven't seen too many people who live in the basin. I haven't seen too many people whose livelihoods depend on the river. I'm lucky, I have another job, but I wouldn't be earning too much money if this plan fell over. My irrigation business that grows roses—the business you referred to earlier, Senator Hanson-Young—will be in a very precarious state if this plan is not agreed to. It is also interesting that everyone becomes a scientist when they walk into this place. We've employed an extraordinary number of very good scientists. We've consulted to within an inch of our lives on this plan, but all of a sudden everybody in here seems to think they're smarter than the scientists out there.


I call on everybody to stop the blame game—stop blaming each other. Can we please come back to the table, because the only outcome—the best outcome and the only outcome—that is going to serve the interests of Australia, its people and our communities, is going to be the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. Part of that means that we have to allow amendment mechanisms like the one that is before us to pass this chamber. Please, everybody, reconsider your vote on this disallowance motion. We must pass this amendment because we have to get on with delivering the plan.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (19:04):  Make no mistake: the Australian Senate tonight puts the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in peril—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator McAllister, a point of order?




Senator McAllister:
  I understand that a government minister does have precedence, but I will draw attention to the fact we've had Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Ruston and now Senator Birmingham. The call has not been provided to this side of the chamber for some time now. I had wanted to place on record my concerns as a New South Wales senator. It's been widely observed that this is not just a South Australian issue. There are serious issues in relation to New South Wales that do need to be canvassed. I am disappointed I haven't been allocated time in this debate, which is about to expire.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you for your point of order. Unfortunately, I saw Senator Birmingham first. Senator Birmingham, could I ask that you perhaps leave two minutes, out of fairness, for Senator McAllister to make a contribution.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Make no mistake: the Australian Senate tonight puts the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in peril. We've heard plenty of claims made, none of them based on science. No specifics—just pure opportunistic politics, coming, sadly, from too many sides.


I, like Senator Wong, have held the water portfolio. I've been there through all the difficult steps of the development of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I was there when the Water Act was passed initially, by Malcolm Turnbull, back in 2007. It is rank opportunism that now sees, in the midst of a South Australian election and the Batman by-election, the Labor Party, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team play politics with this issue. It puts at risk the basin plan, and, in doing that, it potentially leaves stranded a plan that could have, and should have, secured environmental sustainability throughout the basin and secured the equivalent of 3,200 gigalitres of environmental water support and flows throughout the system. But, instead, it leaves that stranded far, far short. Yes, there are serious allegations of noncompliance in places, and they're being investigated by serious entities: the police, the New South Wales ICAC and others. But, frankly, just because people still commit crimes, we don't throw out the laws.


By destroying and by turning their backs on the commitment that Tony Burke gave as water minister six years ago to deliver a review of the northern basin, the Labor Party are tonight turning their backs on the word they gave by siding with the Greens instead. That's shameful. That puts at risk something that many of us have fought for for over a decade—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, a point of order?



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Well, you might be, Senator Birmingham. But for you to be speaking in that manner, given—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  What's your point of order?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  The point of order is organisation of the chamber, and Senator Birmingham—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You are running down the clock, Senator Collins.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I am running down the clock.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  He was going to give two minutes to your colleague.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  He was going to, but he shouldn't be speaking. We've already had a government minister speak on behalf of the government, and now we have another one attacking the Labor Party in an untimely way.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It's not a point of order, Senator Collins. It's not a point of order at all.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  We remain committed to the plan. We want to work cooperatively with all sides. We invite people to come back to the table and make sure we get this plan delivered, not destroyed.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  That's not encouraging them!

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:08):  I rise to place on the record my grave concerns about the water management operations and the regulation of water in New South Wales. It is those concerns that give rise to the disallowance that's before the chamber today, and it's those concerns that have prompted Labor to indicate its support for this disallowance as the debate has proceeded.


The issue is this: the position just presented by Senator Birmingham—that this is merely a matter of a handful of people committing crimes—is not what is happening in New South Wales at all. What is actually happening is that there has been an ongoing failure of the New South Wales government to put in place the regulations necessary to protect the health of the river.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Where is the evidence? There's no evidence—six inquiries at the one time!




Senator McALLISTER:
  These are the findings of those inquiries that Senator O'Sullivan refers to in his interjection. The Basin-wide Compliance Review at the end of last year, for instance, concluded that there has been a concerning systemic failure to protect low flows in unregulated rivers in the northern basin. That failure is not a failure arising from criminal activity; it is a failure deliberately engineered by the New South Wales water minister. That minister made changes in 2012, which were extremely significant, to allow irrigators to exchange lower-security water licences for higher-security licences at next to no cost, to allow unlimited carryover from year to year, to remove any limits on pump sizes, and to allow an individual take limit of up to 300 per cent in one year. These aren't failures that arise from a handful of criminals; these are systemic failures that arise from a failure of management by the New South Wales government.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young be agreed to.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-02-14,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:03):  I move:


That the Basin Plan Amendment Instrument 2017 (No. 1), made under the Water Act 2007, be disallowed.


This motion is very important. As a South Australian senator it is increasingly important to my home state of SA and, of course, it is important to the health of the entire Murray-Darling Basin system. After decades of debate on how we share the water throughout the Murray-Darling Basin in a way that would be fair and in a way that would keep the river alive, the Commonwealth and the various states came up with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan five years ago. The nexus of that plan was that too much water was being taken out of the river and the river just simply wouldn't survive unless something was corrected.


Five years on we've seen scandal after scandal, allegations of corruption and water being stolen from the environment—siphoned off by big corporate irrigators, only to simply feather their own nests. Yet hundreds of millions, in fact billions, of dollars in taxpayers' money has been spent buying water that is meant to be for the environment, only to then have no idea—as we've seen from leaked correspondence from the Environmental Water Holder and as confirmed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority themselves—how much water there actually is for the river and for the environment.


There are several investigations underway into a number of these allegations of theft and corruption. We have the issues in relation to Norman Farming. The Queensland senior crimes unit is investigating Norman Farming—which, I might point out, is run by a man related by marriage to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud. The minister's own relative by marriage is being investigated on issues of water theft and corruption. We have investigations underway in Victoria. We have a royal commission into water theft in South Australia. We know that there are New South Wales water bureaucrats being hauled into the Independent Commission Against Corruption because of allegations of water theft and mismanagement.


Despite all of this, we have a regulation before us in this place that suggests the Murray-Darling Basin Plan should be amended to take more water out of the river, to take more water off the environment and to hand it to big corporate irrigators upstream. It is rewarding bad behaviour. That is why today's vote is very, very important. Amongst this cesspool of water theft, corruption and mismanagement, why on earth would this parliament sign off on giving more water to the people who have behaved badly and less water to the river that desperately needs it?


I just want to point out that many people may think that in fact this Northern Basin Review and its results were actually written into the Basin Plan and that, as such, that voting on this disallowance motion is either voting for the plan or not. I want to be very clear: that is not the case here. What the plan allows for is a review, but it is up to the Senate to scrutinise that to ensure it is robust and appropriate. In the environment of all the allegations of corruption, water theft and a lack of credible data or reliance on science, it is right for this Senate to say, 'No, we're not going to take an extra 70 billion litres of water out of the river and off the environment to reward bad behaviour.' In fact what is allowed for in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a review, but there is no insistence that the water going to the environment should be increased or indeed decreased. You'd have to have the evidence on the table for that argument.


Of course, we've seen from many experts who have looked at the detail of the Northern Basin Review that that evidence just isn't there and that the assumptions that have underpinned this regulation are inherently flawed. For example, the modelling assumes compliance. We've seen over and over again that there is no compliance throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. There is no compliance that has been able to stop the theft of billions of litres of water that was meant to be for the environment, paid for by the Australian taxpayer, that is now being siphoned off into dams by greedy, big corporate irrigators in upstream states. In fact, the Ken Matthews review highlights clearly that compliance is lacking and insufficient. Yet that is one of the key assumptions that this regulation put forward by the government is based on, so it is already flawed from the beginning.


The MDBA have said themselves that compliance isn't good enough. We know that the environmental flows downstream must be coordinated, and there is no way that that can be measured properly by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority at this point. Of course, the lack of consultation in relation to this regulation is astounding too. The communities that are inherently going to be affected by this have cried foul and that this government and the process of this were corrupted from the beginning. The trust in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is wafer thin because people can see for themselves the mess that has been created by big corporate irrigators who have been taking too much water, getting too greedy and having a blind eye turned to them by the water minister—particularly the former water minister, Minister Joyce, who perhaps, if he'd spent a bit more time focused on his day job, would have known that this was going on.


But let's be clear: the Nationals from the beginning have not ever supported the Basin Plan to a point that would ensure the environment got its fair share. We know that right from the beginning the National Party criticised, didn't think the environment deserved as much, didn't care about downstream states and always tried to undermine this process. Of course it was the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, who said that it was all a Greenie conspiracy that there were allegations of water theft and irrigators downstream crying poor and saying that the water was being ripped off by their big corporate neighbours. That doesn't sound like a Greenie conspiracy to me. It sounds like community members sick and tired of being ripped off by big players. Of course, the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, boasted that, because the Nationals had the water portfolio, he would do his job to keep as much water for big irrigators as he could. This regulation that is on the table and that we are voting on here today is proof of that.


We know that there are significant problems with the way water is being managed throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. We know that billions and billions of dollars have been spent, and no-one can tell us where the water is and where the money went. We need an independent audit before we start playing with the rules. Voting down this regulation by voting for this disallowance motion will give the Murray-Darling Basin Plan the chance to be fixed, the chance to have integrity so desperately needed reinjected into the process and the chance to ensure that the river, the environment and those communities that rely on a healthy Murray-Darling won't simply be left high and dry.


There are parts of surface water that simply aren't metered at all. I must say, as a South Australian, that I'm very proud of how South Australia manages the water that comes over the border into our state. South Australians overwhelmingly are doing the right thing. Among the states, South Australia has the highest meter rating, with 96 per cent of all take from the river being metered. Meanwhile, as the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's own water compliance review found, in the northern basin it's as low as 25 per cent. That means 75 per cent of surface water diversions are not metered at all. We've got no idea, but what we do know, because communities are starting to cry foul, is that big corporate irrigators got too greedy. They got too ahead of themselves digging trenches, siphoning off water, pocketing the taxpayers' money and hoping no-one would notice. Well, we have noticed. We've noticed right throughout the basin, particularly down in South Australia, and we're not happy about it.


This instrument cannot go ahead if we want a Murray-Darling Basin Plan that is actually going to work for the river and the communities that rely on it. We should not be rewarding bad behaviour. Big corporate irrigators are ripping off the river and ripping off the taxpayer, and all this instrument does is reward them. The Senate should vote for this disallowance motion, send it back to the government and say: until you clean up this mess, there is no way we're going to start to take more water off the river just to give it to those who have already been too greedy by far.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:15):  I rise to speak on behalf of the Labor Party on this disallowance motion and make clear that Labor will be voting to disallow this instrument. We do so because we support the plan; in fact, we're the party that delivered the plan. It was Labor that delivered the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in government and it is Labor that will fight today to save that plan—the whole plan, the entire plan—for all Australians.


It's useful, I think, to have a little bit of history when it comes to the plan, because it was a long time in the making, in many ways a century in the making. It was agreed only after 11 weeks of negotiations by governments right across the basin, and it was the first time that all basin jurisdictions had come together and agreed to manage the basin coherently.


I went back and looked at the Advertiser articles from that time—written, actually, by the much loved Greg Kelton—and the paper remarked at the time:


Getting all the signatories to agree to the 47 points in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Commonwealth and the states was, according to one source, ""taxing"".


I was the water minister in that room, in that COAG discussion with former Prime Minister Rudd, and together we brokered that deal, and I can tell you that 'taxing' doesn't even begin to describe what we had to go through to get all the states, as well as the Commonwealth, on board. But we did it; we did it as a Labor government with the support of the states.


I would make this point, notwithstanding that very impassioned speech by Senator Hanson-Young: the one party that has not supported the plan, and did not support it when we implemented it in government, is the Greens. They didn't support the plan at the time and, I have to say on this, have been happy to grandstand but have never delivered a single drop to the River Murray. When Senator Hanson-Young goes out in the media and calls on me and other Labor Party senators to stand firm on the River Murray, I would remind people listening that the Greens didn't support the plan and they've never delivered a single drop of water. They continue to lecture me and others in this place about the need to enforce a plan they have never supported. I tell you who did deliver the water, and that is the Labor government. I am proud that as water minister in that government between 2007 and 2010 I secured almost a thousand gigalitres of water for the river, something for which I have been criticised, to this day, by the National Party and various irrigation communities, perhaps even by you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams—as you're entitled to do, but I do make that point. It was something that was hard fought and remains hard fought.


I'm also proud to be part of Labor's ongoing fight to ensure this plan is delivered on time and in full. We will not stand by and see the plan wrecked after a Labor government delivered a historic agreement, at the Council of Australian Governments, that for the first time in a century ensured all the jurisdictions along the Murray-Darling Basin were directed to one end—that is, the health of the basin. I am not going to stand by and see a plan that was delivered under legislation that a Labor government delivered wrecked by this government.


Let's understand why the plan is at risk. The plan is at risk because Mr Turnbull handed the National Party the water portfolio. He did so because, in order to secure his own job, he needed to keep Mr Joyce and his colleagues happy with a plan they did not support. It is the years of backsliding under this government, and particularly under the Deputy Prime Minister, that have brought us to this point, where this Senate is forced to disallow the instrument on the table. This was no accident. Let's remember that it is Mr Joyce who said that the plan didn't have a hope in Hades of being delivered. It is Mr Joyce who said that South Australians should move where the water is. You can't deliver half a plan, and that is fact.


We have had extraordinarily serious allegations of water theft and corruption in the northern basin. They confirm South Australians' worst fears. Yet Mr Joyce's response made it clear he had no intention of doing anything about those allegations. You know what he said? He said it's overwhelmingly an issue for New South Wales. As my friend and colleague Tony Burke pointed out:


The problem for 100 years was that the Murray-Darling Basin was treated as a state issue rather than as a complete river system. What Barnaby Joyce has said today effectively unwinds the entire reason for Murray-Darling reform in the first place.


Even worse, when Mr Joyce thought the media weren't listening, he made his contempt for the plan crystal clear. Out of his own mouth he told irrigators in Shepparton that the Four Corners expose of water theft was a plot to steal their water:


We have taken water, put it back into agriculture, so we could look after you and make sure we don't have the greenies running the show … Four Corners, you know what that's all about? It's about them trying to take more water off you …


These are incredibly serious allegations, with credible evidence of theft and corruption, and he says it's about trying to take the water off irrigators. That's the federal minister responsible for water publicly condoning water theft, for which he is responsible, and making it very clear he had absolutely no intention of backing the plan he was required by law to enforce. He was happy for the water to be diverted and to see the plan wrecked. When we are followed in this debate and in the media by Senators Birmingham, Ruston and others, who I'm sure have a slightly different view to Mr Joyce, let's remember that the people who put the plan at risk are the National Party and the people who put the National Party in charge of the plan are the Liberal Party.


Frankly, Mr Joyce's performance is simply not good enough for all of those whose lives and livelihoods depend upon the health of the Murray-Darling. The person who should shoulder most of the blame for this is Prime Minister Turnbull, because he allowed Mr Joyce to take control of water, knowing full well it was his intention to wreck the plan by walking away from the commitment to deliver the full 450 gigalitres to South Australia. We need to restore confidence in the plan, and that means ensuring what this government promised and committed to is upheld—that is, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan delivered on time and in full—and that the 450 gigalitres of water for the environment will be delivered.


The South Australian government, led by Jay Weatherill, has fought hard for that. It is a key part of the plan. We need to ensure that environmental water, paid for by taxpayers, is not simply diverted to irrigation dams. Until we can guarantee that water purchased by taxpayers gets to the parts of the river where it is needed, it is difficult for us to support the northern basin proposal. Until this government demonstrates it is serious about tackling the allegations of theft and corruption in the basin, we are not in a position to support the northern basin proposal. Let's remember that Labor put this plan in place, fought for additional water for the environment and put money on the table to make it happen. We need the plan to be delivered in full. As Mr Burke has said:


Now, you can't have a situation where the Australian taxpayer is paying for environmental water and environmental watering events being organised and that exact water is being pumped straight back into dams.


We want to make sure that the review is done comprehensively and that the rules that have created significant problems for the integrity of this whole system are dealt with at the same time.


I'm pleased to say that Labor has been in discussions with the new minister for water to try to resolve these issues. We acknowledge the challenges he faces in cleaning up the mess that has been left by the Deputy Prime Minister, and we are pleased that there are signs that this minister, unlike Mr Joyce, does appear to be interested in dealing with these issues, including the issue of water theft. But Labor cannot today say those issues have been resolved. They have not, and time has run out.


We have said the whole way through we cannot allow a reduction in the volume while it is still possible for environmental water to be pumped back into irrigation. We want the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to survive; it is the plan we delivered in government. But we cannot agree today to reducing the volume of water without the proper assurances that the basin will remain healthy and that work is delivered that addresses serious concerns around compliance. These concerns are not just ours and they continue to be aired, whether it's on Four Corners or, I think last night, on 7.30, along with other information that is put into the public arena by people who live in the basin.


We are prepared to work constructively with the government and the authority—the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—to deliver a genuine outcome. I hope this plan doesn't fall apart—we worked very hard on it for many years—but if it does, I'll tell you where the responsibility would lie: the responsibility would lie with the government that has, for the past four years, allowed the Deputy Prime Minister to wreck it for partisan interest at odds with the needs of the river and the needs of the overwhelming majority of the people who rely on the river.


This isn't just about South Australia or Queensland or Victoria or New South Wales; it is about whether our greatest river system has a future. And it is about whether there is a Commonwealth government that is prepared to act in the interests of all Australians to safeguard that river system for all, for now and for the years ahead.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-02-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:26):  I come to this debate relatively late in the piece. My interest in the health and wellbeing of the Murray-Darling Basin system was piqued by the Four Corners report into the allegations of theft and corruption upstream. That's why I joined with most of my South Australian colleagues to say there needed to be a royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin allegations and the theft.


In not knowing what I don't know, I've been open to all sorts of representations. I have to say my judgement has been clouded by the lack of disclosure in some instances, the wilful misrepresentation of particular points of view by those with vested interests. I've tried to balance those against those whom I respect and have judgement for. I do want to acknowledge that Senator Ruston—the second time today I've damned Senator Ruston with faint praise—has tried to be a very straight player in this, and I do accept that what she has told me has been accurate and said in very good faith. But I still labour over this decision. I labour over it because I'm deeply concerned about the long-term wellbeing and health of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


But this is tempered by the fact that I don't like being bullied by people who I think have essentially been crooked in this. For the New South Wales government to say the entire Basin Plan is at risk over 70 gigalitres of water, when they are essentially on the hook for undermining the entire effort—turning a blind eye to it and, I would say, blatant, outright corruption—is appalling. And if bullying or threatening these sorts of tactics are the ways they want to get a resolution, they should think again because they don't have any credibility in this space.


I also happen to agree with Senator Wong about the problems with the Deputy Prime Minister being in charge of the water portfolio. I think there was enormous compromise there. I respect the fact that many people say the new minister is committed. I've had meetings with him, and he's been committed to this program. But my confidence in the new minister was undermined when, shamefully, he decided to put out a press release calling upon a party member of mine, who happens to be in Queensland, to 'stand up for Queensland'. A member of a political party has been told to stand up against this South Australian-centric politician who's here representing the interests of the state and trying to balance it across the whole thing. And the minister said, 'The people in Queensland would be worse off as a result of this disallowance today.'


Where it falls on shamefully hollow ground is the fact that the minister himself is related to one of the people in Queensland who have been accused of rorting the water systems themselves. They've been raided. It doesn't matter whether Mr Norman is the brother-in-law, as reported, or the wife's second cousin. There is a direct link with someone who has been rorting the water system or is alleged to have been, whose farms have been raided by the Federal Police, who has been accused of building 'roads'—in those quotation marks again—that just happen to store piles of water from the flood plains and prevent it getting down the river. The fact that this wasn't disclosed, except by the ABC, and I had to start digging through it and find out about it in recent times is extraordinary.


So, if the minister wants to harangue one of my party members about standing up for Queensland's rights, perhaps the minister would stand up for Queensland's rights and his electorate and tell his brother-in-law, or his wife's second cousin, to bulldoze those illegal structures, to stop ripping off water, to stop ripping off the money from the Murray-Darling Basin system, as have been detailed on the ABC.


I will not stand for the hypocrisy in this place. I do not know what I do not know. I have made efforts to find out what it is. Every time you turn around, you get this stench of crookedness and corruption, and unfortunately it all comes from a very similar space.


I am absolutely proud of what South Australians have done in managing a scarce and precious resource. We—and people far more interested, far more energetic, than me—have worked very, very hard in making sure we manage our water rights absolutely well, and we are being let down by what is happening upstream.


I do not trust them. That is the regret. They want to walk away from this basin agreement, an agreement that they signed up to. But, when they find it slightly difficult because of—who knows?—one of the people that have been on the receiving end of their beneficial allocations, or the illegal water structures, or the mismanagement and misallocation of taps, they go to water, if you'll excuse the pun, and expect the rest of us to pick it up.


As I said, I don't know what I don't know, but what I do know is this: the lack of trust and the lack of accountability fills me with scepticism. For that reason alone, I will be supporting this disallowance, because to make changes of this nature, which could have a profound impact not only on my state but on the entire Murray-Darling Basin river system, due to threats, bullying and intimidation is not the way that business in this place should be done.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",NXT,2018-02-14,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:32):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young. I can indicate to the chamber that the Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting this disallowance. It is a decision that we have considered carefully, and it is a decision that we have not taken lightly. The Murray-Darling river system is a vital national resource. In my first speech I said that ensuring the health of the Murray-Darling river system so that it's sustainable from both an economic and an environmental point of view was an important priority.


There is a rich history behind the Murray-Darling Basin, and the establishment of an overarching management for the whole of the basin was not without dispute. It took the severe Federation Drought, from 1895 to 1902, to bring the states together to start to agree on the management of the Murray. From the 1970s through to the 1990s, state governments undertook initiatives to sustainably manage land and water. An intergovernmental approach was needed, and in 1987 the first Murray-Darling Basin agreement was reached, which established the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. With the passage of the Water Act in 2007, the establishment of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the development of the Basin Plan with bipartisan support, there was a hope that the dispute would be resolved. However, over 100 years later, and five years after the plan was implemented, it is apparent that that dispute still exists.


While NXT is supportive of the plan being implemented in full, there has been a significant reduction in public confidence in the plan's implementation over the past 12 months. We've heard a few of the allegations around the chamber. I did travel to Goondiwindi last year and visited one of the farms that have been talked about on the ABC, and these allegations are serious.


NXT is not alone in its view about the lack of confidence. It is a view that has been expressed by a variety of stakeholders and, indeed, government authorities, and that includes the New South Wales government's Matthews review and the federal Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review. The solution to restoring this confidence lies with a range of measures relating to both transparency and compliance. I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record some of these measures.


NXT is firmly of the view that transparency must be codified before proceeding further with the plan. As a minimum, the following must be released publicly for any proposed water measure, including water buybacks: all modelling and modelling reports, not limited to the final proposals, but those carried out to evaluate the effects of any measures; an independent assessment of the measures; and, in the case of water buybacks, all valuation and assessments made by the government and including independent valuations assessments, which must be made public. The contracts to implement the measures must also be made public. In the case of water buybacks, the contracts should show as a minimum the expenditure amount, the scope of the work associated with the expenditure amount, and the associated volumes of water. In respect of the contracts, we also need to see verification reports showing that the contracts have been complied with. We also need to disclose validation reports—I will talk about those a little bit later—to make sure that we understand that the measure that was intended has been achieved. All complaints in respect of noncompliance must be published on an annual basis, de-identified as required, including a report as to the outcome of any investigation triggered by a complaint.


NXT is also of the view that a number of compliance measures must be put in place before proceeding with the plan. Measures that must be addressed include basin-wide accurate, reliable and tamper-proof metering and the implementation of real-time water accounts. These are not radical ideas. These are ideas that actually reside within the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review recommendations. Furthermore, all water measures should be subject to strict verification and validation procedures to show contract compliance and, again, the effectiveness of the measure. So, we do something to the river and then we measure it to make sure that what we've done is achieving the results that we thought we were paying for. There must be a substantial increase in the number of compliance officers across the basin, including the Murray-Darling Basin Authority compliance officers. New South Wales has one compliance officer per 355 gigalitres of diversions. Queensland has one per 235 gigalitres. South Australia has one per 56 gigalitres.


It is acknowledged that there have been a number of useful recommendations flowing from the Matthews review and the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review, particularly in relation to compliance measures. It is noted that timetables have been put in place to implement the recommendations. Nonetheless, the implementation of the recommendations is subject to risk. That's been overtly stated in the case of the Matthews review.


Time is required for the recommendations to be implemented and to bite into the issues they are intended to resolve. It is not an unreasonable position to delay any changes to the plan until the recommendations start to deliver positive outcomes. It is noted that Queensland's independent audit of Queensland's non-urban water measurement and compliance will not report until March 2018. This may be a critical piece of the compliance puzzle. Let's wait and see what it says.


In relation to the northern basin, NXT has concerns with respect to the modelling associated with the Northern Basin Review. For example, the modelling omitted certain hydrological indicators on the Barwon-Darling River, thereby not properly considering the impact of reduced water recovery on low flows, and the modelling was based on best-case scenarios. Another aspect of the changes, for instance, is a lack of statutory requirement to protect water that is recovered with taxpayers' money. These concerns have been exacerbated by The Australia Institute's 'Northern disclosure' paper, which came out a few days ago, which makes a claim that the effect of the proposed SDL adjustments to South Australia has varied from 20 gigalitres down to four gigalitres without any explanation as to the change. Some light needs to be shed on the reasoning behind those changes so we can be confident that what is finally presented is correct.


I will also talk to the SDL adjustments, because—as I will come to—we need to think about an integrated approach to moving forward. Talking about some of the issues associated with the 36 projects that will be used to offset the 605 gigalitre changes, NXT has sought the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's acceptance of the 36 projects by way of a Senate order for production last week so that we can examine the authority's view on the projects as a counterweight to the public perception, which is currently bad. It is important to see this information in order to be informed with respect to any final decisions on the SDL adjustment mechanisms. I note the government is cooperating.


It is also NXT's understanding that the Water Act states that, in setting the SDLs, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority must act on the basis of best available scientific knowledge and on socioeconomic analysis. They must take into account the principles of ecological sustainment and development and give effect to relevant international agreements. The proposed amendments include a provision for states to request a reallocation of the SDLs between valleys within basin zones, for example, within the northern basin of New South Wales. This amendment suggests the MDBA has left it open to a state to vary the SDLs by valley outside the recommendations in the Northern Basin Review or the SDL adjustment mechanisms. Such a change would be outside any parliamentary process and there is no requirement for the revised SDLs to be set with regard to best available scientific knowledge and socioeconomic analysis, principles of ecological sustainable development or relevant international agreements—so there's a problem there.


Any scientific algorithm that was used to initially justify the SDL can subsequently be replaced by an alternate algorithm by the MDBA and the states behind closed doors, and this proposition is clearly unacceptable. The MDBA did not consult publicly on this amendment. It is NXT's view that changes to the plan should be presented in an integrated package: that being, changes resulting from the Northern Basin Review—and we accept that there needs to be some adjustments—changes to the southern basin SDLs and the 450 gigalitre efficiency measures. Ernst & Young reported into the feasible of the 450 gigalitre efficiency measures, but we note that it is, at this stage, only advice to government. This advice needs to be transformed into an approved action plan, which is presented at the same time as changes flowing from the Northern Basin Review and changes to the southern basin SDL adjustments. NXT support for the changes to the plan are contingent on this sort of integrated approach.


The Nick Xenophon Team strongly believes there is a way forward. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a national plan that represents a sensible compromise across competing requirements, including socioeconomic and environmental requirements. No stakeholder was completely happy with the plan, but they recognised its importance. It is noted that some stakeholders have indicated that the disallowance of the instrument before this parliament would cause the plan to collapse. That is in nobody's interests and it will be for the government to ensure this does not occur. In support of the government, NXT indicates that it is willing to support the passage of the instruments through the parliament, just not under the current circumstances. A pause is required for some issues to be addressed and to permit implementation of the recommendations of the various reviews, including the Queensland review when it reports. The Northern Basin Review instrument can be brought back before the parliament, and NXT is open to agreeing to amend the Water Act to allow the SDL adjustments to come back before the parliament.


There is a suggestion from the New South Wales government that a successful disallowance today would cause them to walk away from the plan. I have to say this is a little disingenuous, considering the New South Wales government has its own serious river compliance problems. Their own Matthews review stated this clearly. Indeed, there is an ICAC investigation underway into corruption on the Barwon-Darling.


Everyone needs to remain cool headed. We are dealing with a national river system that must be managed on a national level. Abandoning the plan would be counterproductive, and, again, the government must act to ensure that does not occur. It seems everyone agrees there is a problem, including governments, and there is general agreement on what needs to be done to fix it. The solution just needs time to be implemented, and the Nick Xenophon Team believes supporting the disallowance on the Northern Basin Review gives us that time.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-02-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:45):  I will be brief—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Point of order, Senator Cameron?




Senator Cameron:
  Point of order: a Labor senator jumped up. The normal process is the call should come here. That's how it works.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, it does work like that, but it also works with a bit of fairness, Senator Cameron. We've had the Greens, Senator Bernardi, Labor, the crossbench, and no government at this stage. I'm trying to be fair and go from side to side, as the chair normally does. We just took a speaker from that side of the chamber. Now I'm taking a speaker from this side.




Senator Cameron:
  Well, that's not—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I will seek some advice and I will go on my advice. It's my call, and it's who I saw first. Senator Leyonhjelm, you have the call.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I'm tempted to vote in favour of this disallowance. What holds me back is that I'm not sure if New South Wales and Victoria would, in fact, stand by their decision to walk away from the plan. But I wouldn't be too upset if they were to walk away from the plan, because the plan is deeply flawed. It requires social, economic and environmental issues to be equally balanced in terms of managing the water in the Murray-Darling Basin. However, the problem is that only one of those three—environmental issues—is seriously taken into account.


The plan arose in the context of the millennium drought, the most severe drought for 100 years. It prompted panic about climate change and it led some to conclude that droughts were the new normal, that it would never rain again, that water would always be scarce and the environment was facing catastrophe. Sensible people knew otherwise. Droughts always end, and, in 2010-11, that happened. There was widespread flooding and the recovery of wetlands. Birds bred enthusiastically, frogs and fish proliferated, and life carried on as it always has. Dorothea Mackellar's Australia—'a land of droughts and flooding rains'—was never better demonstrated.


During the drought, this plan was devised—first by the Howard government and then by the Rudd-Gillard government. Its intention was to remove water from agriculture in order to save the environment. The details were negotiated during the Labor government period against a background of panic over the drought, state bickering over water sharing, and the threat to Labor from the Greens. As a result, the plan was one per cent science and 99 per cent politics.


The plan calls for the return of 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment, to be obtained both by buying back water rights from farmers and efficiency measures. There is a further 450 gigalitres to be returned, subject to certain conditions. Water rights have been bought back from farmers in southern Queensland, the northern basin area, New South Wales and Victoria, and a small quantity from South Australia.


In 2015 and 2016, I chaired a Senate inquiry into the effects of the plan's implementation. We held hearings all over the country. What we found was that the loss of irrigation water in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria was having a very profound impact on rural communities. Farms that previously grew irrigated crops—fruit, cotton and pasture for dairy cows—were now growing dryland crops or running a few sheep. They required far fewer inputs—machinery, fertilisers, seeds and so forth—and, as a result, those input suppliers were the ones who were missing out and their workers. The farmers who sold their water were fine, but everybody else who benefitted from those farmers and those farms being active were really suffering. Workers moved away from towns. Communities had fewer people. There were fewer children in schools, volunteer firefighters weren't there and there were fewer customers in local shops and so on.


What we also found was that there's very, very poor understanding of the plan. There's this almost religious belief that the environment simply needs water—just add water and it will all be okay. It doesn't really matter whether it's in the right place, in the right quantities or at the right times—just add water was pretty much what we heard. The fact is, of course, that too much water in the wrong place can do more harm than good.


There is another factor, which nobody seems to be addressing, and that is the river at the moment, in particular the Murray River, is running pretty much right up to the top of the bank. More water added to it, as the 450 gigalitres extra would do, couldn't be carried. The river could not carry that amount of water. Nonetheless, it is often heard that unless that water is added some sort of environmental disaster is going to occur.


I struggle to see why this was ever a South Australian issue, particularly in relation to the Northern Basin Review. The northern basin is all about the Barwon-Darling rivers. The amount of water from those two rivers that ever reach South Australia, or even join up with the Murray at Wentworth, is tiny—on average, across all years, six per cent. It's a tiny amount. It wouldn't matter if irrigation stopped in the entire Queensland and New South Wales areas, where it currently occurs; there would be very, very little additional water ending up in South Australia.


The other problem is: when it does end up in South Australia, what's it used for? It's not as if irrigation in South Australia has been suffering. It ends up in Lake Alexandrina. Lake Alexandrina is kept artificially fresh. It is not a natural freshwater lake. It is an artificial freshwater lake. Large amounts of water, an estimated 900 gigalitres, evaporate in Lake Alexandrina. Here we are taking fresh water, which could be used for agriculture, away from what were thriving rural communities—used for irrigation and so forth to produce food and fibre—and it is running down the river and ending up in South Australia to be evaporated. It's an absolute travesty. If that plan were to blow up and not be re-established unless on more sensible terms, I, for one, would not really mind.


The other issue is South Australia's water supply; it was never in doubt. There is plenty of water for Adelaide. There is plenty of water for South Australia. In fact, there is a guarantee in the plan of 850 gigalitres—more than enough. I am hugely sympathetic to those poor farmers in northern Australia, in Queensland, and in northern New South Wales, who, in the Northern Basin Review, have lost their water. I'm immensely sympathetic to them. Taking more water off them, which would occur if this review were not implemented, would be an absolute tragedy. I will be voting against the disallowance, but, if I thought that voting in favour of it would blow up the plan then that's where my vote would be going.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-02-14,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:53):  Senator Cameron, we have an agreement across the chamber.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  Chair, you indicated in your last ruling on this issue that you would go from side to side—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I did.




Senator Cameron:
  Senator McAllister has been here waiting patiently to get the call. You ignored her last time. You said you would go from side to side. I really think you should do what you said last time—go from side to side, and, as you said, be fair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron. The Clerk has told me it is my call. Senator Ruston has been here since the start of the debate. You have the call, Senator Ruston.




Senator RUSTON:
  I had a point of order, but I won't waste any time so that I can let Senator McAllister speak. I stand here speaking on behalf of the coalition government to stress the absolute importance of the delivery of this plan in full and on time, not just to the people of South Australia, as Senator Leyonhjelm has just described, but to every single citizen of Australia. Every single citizen of Australia has a stake in this plan. This is a shared resource. The importance of making sure that we have a sustainable Murray-Darling system into the future is absolutely paramount because it is the obligation of this generation to make sure that that river is in the same state or a better state and a sustainable state for future generations.


The development of this plan has been a long time coming, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well know. We worked for 100 years to be able to get to this place and this time. In 2012 then-Minister Burke, the Labor minister who was responsible for water, sat down and managed to negotiate the bipartisan support for the delivery of this plan. This plan is not bits and pieces; this plan is a total plan. It includes up-water, it includes down-water and it includes gap water. There are reviews built into it to enable us to adaptively manage as we get more information. This whole plan has been built on the bipartisanship of the support between the coalition—the Liberals and the Nationals—and the Labor Party. So it is with great regret that I stand here today with the suggestion that there is some likelihood that this disallowance motion will get up and put this plan at risk.


I would also say that one of the great things when we as Australians and as people in this place travel around the world is that we are the envy of the rest of the world because of our water management policies in this place and in this country. We're the envy of the world because we tackled a huge problem like the Murray-Darling Basin. We got together and we provided a blueprint for that solution. We are six years into the 14-year delivery on that plan, and it scares the hell out of me that we would suggest that for political reasons—which appear to be the reasons today—we may disallow one of the important components of the plan and that we could actually put this plan in jeopardy. I suppose that, whilst I'm disappointed in Senator Hanson-Young's disallowance motion, I don't suppose I'm particularly surprised. I certainly don't believe she's about the sustainability of the system; I believe this is all about the fact that the Greens don't want us to grow food in the Murray-Darling Basin. They don't want us to take any water out. I'm not particularly surprised at their obstruction.


I would like to put on the record that there were many things in Senator Hanson-Young's contribution that were factually incorrect. There was no acknowledgement for the good practices that have been put in place in the basin. There was a total over-exaggeration in relation to the threat. They come in here and they make allegations under privilege. Senator Hanson-Young came in here and said John Norman was Minister Littleproud's brother-in-law. He's not Minister Littleproud's brother-in-law, and I'm sure she probably knows that. But the inference and the insinuation, by making these accusations, is that something untoward is going on. I would suggest that if she's going to make those insinuations she could go outside of this chamber to make them so Minister Littleproud has an opportunity to respond.


The amendment that is currently before us that we are seeking to pass through this chamber is an amendment that's actually been generated through a review that was put in place, into the Water Act, by Minister Bourke when he was the minister responsible for water in the previous Labor government. What we are seeing here today is a response to a completely complied-with consulted review put in place by Mr Burke. Now we have a suggestion from Senator Wong that they are now going to vote against the very outcome of the review they sought to have. In the northern basin, 200 people's jobs are going to be threatened if this particular amendment is disallowed today. There is no recognition that there is the potential to deliver really good outcomes and really good environmental outcomes in the northern basin with the delivery of the water targets that we are proposing now should be implemented. The livelihood of 200 people—200 families—are not going to be destroyed for the sake of a very nominal and potentially negligent improvement in environmental outcomes. I would call on the Labor Party to think about the hypocrisy of what they are doing here. Think about the hypocrisy of the fact that you are seeking to vote down an amendment that was of your own making.


Can I also say how tremendously disappointed I am in the Nick Xenophon Team for coming in here and indicating that they don't want to support the amendment either; they're going to support the disallowance. This is Humpty Dumpty politics as its absolute worst. I have read the correspondence that we have seen from the Nick Xenophon Team and I have listened to the contribution of the Nick Xenophon Team. They come in here and say they want to work with us and that they want to deliver the plan. But this is Humpty Dumpty: we are going to come in here today and push Humpty off the wall and smash him into a thousand pieces, and then after the South Australian election we will ride in on our big white horse and help you put the plan back together again. Well, let's not break it in the first place, Nick Xenophon Team, because if we don't break it we don't have to put it back together again. And we can walk and chew gum at the same time—we can continue to deliver the plan and at the same time fix up the problems that you have so eloquently highlighted, which we admit are occurring out there in the basin.


Needless to say with Labor, it is politics over the river's health, politics over our local communities, politics over the people who grow the food that we all like to put on our tables so that our children can eat healthy, clean, green Australian-grown food. We're going to put that at risk. We are going to jeopardise the plan. I say to everybody in this place: please don't think of a game of bluff—the New South Wales and Victorian governments have been quite clear that they are going to respond if this disallowance is upheld. I hope they don't. I will work very hard to get them back to the table, as I'm sure you would expect me to. But please don't threaten them. Basically, what you have done is put a gun to their heads and they've now put a gun back to your head. Why don't we all put our guns down and come back to the table and continue to deliver this plan, as we all said we were going to do in 2012.


This is not a game of bluff. If we see an outcome where New South Wales or Victoria choose to walk away from this plan, as they are threatening to do at the moment, it would be an absolute unmitigated disaster for our state of South Australia. We are the great beneficiaries of the plan delivered in full. I want the plan delivered in full, all 3,200 gigalitres of it. I want it delivered in full and I will work with anybody to make sure we deliver it in the best possible way. I'm happy to listen to everybody's comments about how we can do it better, how we can deliver better outcomes and how we can be more efficient with irrigation water and environmental water. So, why don't we all get back to the table and start being constructive, because pulling this thing apart and going in different directions is serving no purpose for anybody.


Today, Professor Williams from the University of Adelaide went into print to say that the danger of blowing up this plan is absolutely extreme for South Australia. Do not call New South Wales and Victoria's bluff, because if they are not bluffing South Australia is in a very serious and precarious state. I would suggest to all of you that you read Professor Williams's comments about the legal consequences. It is all very well and good for Minister Hunt to say he is going to take it to the High Court, but I have to tell you that the losers will be South Australia, our river and our river communities.


I'm not moving away from the serious allegations that have been made about what is going on. But let's fix them. Let's not come in here and blow up the plan. Can I also say that among everybody who has stood up and made a contribution in this place on this particular disallowance motion I haven't seen too many people who live in the basin. I haven't seen too many people whose livelihoods depend on the river. I'm lucky, I have another job, but I wouldn't be earning too much money if this plan fell over. My irrigation business that grows roses—the business you referred to earlier, Senator Hanson-Young—will be in a very precarious state if this plan is not agreed to. It is also interesting that everyone becomes a scientist when they walk into this place. We've employed an extraordinary number of very good scientists. We've consulted to within an inch of our lives on this plan, but all of a sudden everybody in here seems to think they're smarter than the scientists out there.


I call on everybody to stop the blame game—stop blaming each other. Can we please come back to the table, because the only outcome—the best outcome and the only outcome—that is going to serve the interests of Australia, its people and our communities, is going to be the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. Part of that means that we have to allow amendment mechanisms like the one that is before us to pass this chamber. Please, everybody, reconsider your vote on this disallowance motion. We must pass this amendment because we have to get on with delivering the plan.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator McAllister, a point of order?




Senator McAllister:
  I understand that a government minister does have precedence, but I will draw attention to the fact we've had Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Ruston and now Senator Birmingham. The call has not been provided to this side of the chamber for some time now. I had wanted to place on record my concerns as a New South Wales senator. It's been widely observed that this is not just a South Australian issue. There are serious issues in relation to New South Wales that do need to be canvassed. I am disappointed I haven't been allocated time in this debate, which is about to expire.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you for your point of order. Unfortunately, I saw Senator Birmingham first. Senator Birmingham, could I ask that you perhaps leave two minutes, out of fairness, for Senator McAllister to make a contribution.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Make no mistake: the Australian Senate tonight puts the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in peril. We've heard plenty of claims made, none of them based on science. No specifics—just pure opportunistic politics, coming, sadly, from too many sides.


I, like Senator Wong, have held the water portfolio. I've been there through all the difficult steps of the development of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I was there when the Water Act was passed initially, by Malcolm Turnbull, back in 2007. It is rank opportunism that now sees, in the midst of a South Australian election and the Batman by-election, the Labor Party, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team play politics with this issue. It puts at risk the basin plan, and, in doing that, it potentially leaves stranded a plan that could have, and should have, secured environmental sustainability throughout the basin and secured the equivalent of 3,200 gigalitres of environmental water support and flows throughout the system. But, instead, it leaves that stranded far, far short. Yes, there are serious allegations of noncompliance in places, and they're being investigated by serious entities: the police, the New South Wales ICAC and others. But, frankly, just because people still commit crimes, we don't throw out the laws.


By destroying and by turning their backs on the commitment that Tony Burke gave as water minister six years ago to deliver a review of the northern basin, the Labor Party are tonight turning their backs on the word they gave by siding with the Greens instead. That's shameful. That puts at risk something that many of us have fought for for over a decade—

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You are running down the clock, Senator Collins.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I am running down the clock.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  He was going to give two minutes to your colleague.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  He was going to, but he shouldn't be speaking. We've already had a government minister speak on behalf of the government, and now we have another one attacking the Labor Party in an untimely way.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It's not a point of order, Senator Collins. It's not a point of order at all.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  We remain committed to the plan. We want to work cooperatively with all sides. We invite people to come back to the table and make sure we get this plan delivered, not destroyed.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  That's not encouraging them!

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:08):  I rise to place on the record my grave concerns about the water management operations and the regulation of water in New South Wales. It is those concerns that give rise to the disallowance that's before the chamber today, and it's those concerns that have prompted Labor to indicate its support for this disallowance as the debate has proceeded.


The issue is this: the position just presented by Senator Birmingham—that this is merely a matter of a handful of people committing crimes—is not what is happening in New South Wales at all. What is actually happening is that there has been an ongoing failure of the New South Wales government to put in place the regulations necessary to protect the health of the river.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Where is the evidence? There's no evidence—six inquiries at the one time!




Senator McALLISTER:
  These are the findings of those inquiries that Senator O'Sullivan refers to in his interjection. The Basin-wide Compliance Review at the end of last year, for instance, concluded that there has been a concerning systemic failure to protect low flows in unregulated rivers in the northern basin. That failure is not a failure arising from criminal activity; it is a failure deliberately engineered by the New South Wales water minister. That minister made changes in 2012, which were extremely significant, to allow irrigators to exchange lower-security water licences for higher-security licences at next to no cost, to allow unlimited carryover from year to year, to remove any limits on pump sizes, and to allow an individual take limit of up to 300 per cent in one year. These aren't failures that arise from a handful of criminals; these are systemic failures that arise from a failure of management by the New South Wales government.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young be agreed to.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
) (19:16):  I understand that, pursuant to order, we now return to discussion of the MPI:


""The vital importance that the South Australian state election on March 17th produces a government focussed on energy reliability, energy affordability, attracting business investment, lower unemployment and a South Australian economy that contributes better to the national economy.""

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:17):  Members opposite made the point that sometimes the media is a better arbiter in some of these discussions about where the truth lies. Senator Farrell quoted a number of things out of South Australian media. If you'd like to play that game, perhaps we could look at articles in the Financial Review that highlighted that the confidence in South Australia's economy under the Weatherill government is so low that ANZ chose to sell out of South Australian government bonds, as they were deemed to be too risky because debt has continued to go up. The ABC reported that the current debt, at the time of the article last year, was $6.2 billion, jumping to $6.7 billion in 2017-18. As reported by The Advertiser, seasonally adjusted unemployment is at 5.9 per cent compared to a national figure of 5.5 per cent, and underlying figures show a drop in South Australia's full-time employment despite the fact that the national average is going the other way. Professor Richard Blandy gave a qualitative critique:


Over the term of the Weatherill Government, South Australia's economic performance has been weak by comparison with Australia's as a whole and the two leading economies of Victoria and New South Wales.


Any assessment of economic outcome should look over the whole term because annual South Australian economic growth figures have been subject to massive revisions. For example, the increase in South Australian Gross State Product in 2015-16 was announced in November 2016 as 1.9%. This has just been revised down to 0.3%.


We see consistently that the outcomes achieved in South Australia are at stark variance with the claims that are made, driven by ideology. We heard people talking before about Premier Weatherill's great big renewable energy experiment that he so proudly boasted about on the world stage. But what do we see following the blackouts? Because of the intermittent nature of the structure that couldn't withstand a shock to the power system, the state government spent $550 million on a catch-up program, over $300 million of which was on diesel generators to provide some level of back-up power. We've seen the failures in things like the TAFE system, the very place that should be driving new jobs and new skills for the future. Compare that to the Marshall opposition's strong plan for a future that has a commitment for some 20,800 apprentices, working constructively with the federal government's Skilling Australians Foundation to give South Australia a strong future.


Debate interrupted.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2018-02-14,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (19:20):  I rise to give in the short time allocated to us tonight a synopsis of the life of the great Dick Bitcon. He was a community leader, a successful family and business man, and, for almost 50 years, a great political activist and advocate for the conservative side of politics—more the agricultural side of politics in my home state of Queensland.


Dick's life story is typical of his generation. It started with not much at all—kerosene lamps and hardships. From a beginning with little help or assistance, he was able to go on and eventually make a very successful life for himself and for his family. In business it was principally along agriculture lines. He started out managing properties and farms and then he bought an agricultural supply agency. He then went on to become a trader of many of the agricultural commodities that were produced on the north central coast of my home state of Queensland.


He was an extraordinary man in terms of his contribution to the community. He was a very distinguished and popular community leader. He worked his way through many of the important tasks in a community in a region that one expects from someone of his calibre—leading the Bundaberg Chamber of Commerce and being involved in the rural race club at Bundaberg, both as the president and later on as the patron.


The bit I really want to concentrate on is that for 49 years Dick Bitcon was a political activist and advocate. He didn't just play from the sidelines. Dick was a zone vice-president for almost a decade within what was then the National Party—a predecessor party to the LNP. He served in the era of the great Joh Bjelke-Petersen and under the tutelage of Sir Robert Sparkes, Mike Evans and other well-recognised names in Queensland. He served in an era when Queensland progressed at a pace that has never been seen again and I doubt will ever be seen again in the future.


Dick was one of those leaders in politics who didn't seek any sort of a political career. In fact, what I know of Dick is that he probably exercised more influence from the sidelines than he may have ever done as a political member of parliament. He was certainly responsible for, in a large part, the career of the great Paul Neville, who was in the House of Representatives here for a long period of time. Dick was responsible for nurturing Paul's career. He played a large part in ensuring that the critical advocate from his region was returned here to parliament on many occasions, despite the fact that it was a very difficult seat for us to hold. 


Dick's contribution—like so many of his type—was delivered quietly. It was influential. It would be impossible, I suspect, to measure the impact that he had on state policies, initiatives and programs, and also at a federal level. There are many Dick Bitcons. We all know our own Dick Bitcon, but he gave 50 years of his life for free—he sought nothing in return—and contributed to influencing regional affairs, state affairs and national affairs. I think recognition of his efforts deserves being enshrined in the Hansard of this federal parliament. To his family and his many friends who are feeling Dick's passing just a month ago, we send the message that his contribution on all of those levels, and most particularly to his regional community, is well-recognised here in the Senate. We wish them all the best as they work their way through the process of life without the great Dick Bitcon.
