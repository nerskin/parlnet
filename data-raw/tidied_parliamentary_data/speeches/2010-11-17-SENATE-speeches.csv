"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—When we finished last night, I was responding to the argument from the opposition as to why these amendments should be adopted. As I indicated last night, the government is not of a mind to agree with the amendments as they are written. I indicated that I thought that, by giving certain classes of people membership of the advisory council, that would indicate that certain classes had a greater right to be part of the advisory council. If we are going to indicate that industry representatives have designated places I think it is therefore reasonable to then indicate that every member of the advisory council should have their class of membership indicated by the legislation.
It is our view that the advisory council should not have prescribed classes as their members. In saying that, can I say that the minister is on the record as saying that consumers will be included. I think that is absolutely essential. The government has agreed to work with industry in having a role to play in the prevention agenda. Work has been proceeding on that. I am aware of a dialogue occurring between the Australian Food and Grocery Council and major supermarkets in order to work towards some voluntary activity to deliver better health outcomes for our community. In conclusion, designating positions for industry representatives on the advisory council is not something that the government wants to contemplate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—Following on from the comment that the minister made, I take the minister to page 15 of the explanatory memorandum. It looks at clause 31 and the appointment of members to the advisory council. It says, ‘While the clause does not specify knowledge or experience requirements for advisory council members’ and talks about ‘expertise’. Do I deduce from your answer that you will be including consumer matters, not necessarily consumer health groups, and that you will only be dialoguing with industry groups? There is a distinction. Perhaps you could clarify that for me. I deduced from your comments that a distinction was made about consumers being included within the parameters of the advisory group and that you would just be talking to industry. That is how I understood the distinction. Could you clarify that for me.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I am certainly aware of a piece of work that occurred some time ago. My understanding is that it is continuing. That is the dialogue that was promoted by the Australian Food and Grocery Council, major supermarket chains and others. I recommend that you do not confuse nor conflate that discussion with the membership of the advisory council. If you go to the explanatory memorandum, it is very clear about the expertise that will be required in order to provide well-rounded advice and well-informed advice to the minister. My recommendation is to not confuse the dialogue which was occurring. I am not close to how that is progressing, but it certainly was occurring. That indicates that the government is prepared to talk to industry on a sensible and realistic basis in order to improve health outcomes for consumers. Reading the EM explicitly will answer that question.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—That is my point, Minister. When you read the explanatory memorandum, it says:
While the clause does not specify knowledge or experience requirements for Advisory Council members, it is anticipated that the following expertise would be represented amongst members ...
Then it lists:
... public administration, business/employer groups, education, intersectoral collaboration, sports and recreation, preventive health including health promotion, community and non-government organisations, consumer issues, social inclusion and disadvantage (including Indigenous Australians), local government, legal/regulatory, and finance
Given that the coalition’s amendment goes specifically to consumer health groups and industry organisations specifically in the manufacture of food and alcohol, I am concerned about understanding why those two important categories have been specifically excluded from what is a highly descriptive and highly inclusive category of people. That is the reason that I am seeking clarification. Minister, with respect, I do not think that your answer addresses the specific question that I asked, and that was about the highly prescriptive—if I can put it that way—description of the membership of the advisory council. They are the two areas that the coalition is very concerned about and they are going to be very much the drivers in relation to consumer health groups. Obviously the manufacture, distribution and marketing of food and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, are very important components, and the two areas have been deliberately excluded.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—If you read it literally, it says:
… it is anticipated that the following expertise would be represented amongst members …
It is not prescriptive at all. The amendment from the opposition requires that there be representatives of certain sectors. This is a question of whether we want expertise in a general sense. The EM indicates a range of people who, it is anticipated, would be represented, but your amendment goes to identifying at least one and perhaps two positions that would be represented in a formal sense. I go back to my earlier comment. If we were going to prescribe classes for the advisory council, then we would prescribe every seat on that advisory council in a formal way. The alternative way of establishing any committee is to say that we expect that certain groups would have to be included rather than identifying the distinct membership of every seat on that committee. We have not gone down that track. I suggest that your amendment goes only part way down that track. If you were going to do it fully, you would indicate every seat on the advisory council rather than indicate one, or perhaps two, for an identified sector that would have an important conversation, but that is only one part of the conversation. I refer to the comments of Senator Xenophon and Senator Siewert around the desirability of having certain groups there who may have a slightly different view to the preventative health agenda.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—Could I seek clarification. Could you put on the record, Minister: does that mean that, amongst the members of the council, there will not be represented people from industry, in the broad sense, and consumer health organisations? That is my question.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—Let us be very clear about your question, because you have given it in the negative. You have asked me whether I can confirm that there will not be industry representatives, and I think my answer is no.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—So there will be people from consumer health organisations and from industry broadly defined as having commercial expertise in the manufacture, distribution or marketing of food or beverages, including alcoholic beverages?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,—That is not what I said.,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—I am just trying to seek clarification as to whether—because of comments that were made by Senator Siewert and Senator Xenophon—they are not in the health preventive agenda or, if I can infer from your comments in a general sense, they are not quite on the same page and therefore they are going to be excluded from the dialogue. That is my concern, Senator McLucas, because you really are excluding a very, very large chunk of organisations that are going to have a very important component. If you cannot bring them on board, there is going to be a real problem in terms of focusing change in preventive health. That is really where I am coming from.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,—We are certainly not excluding industry. We talked about the range of expertise that is going to be required. This is neither inclusive nor exclusive of any particular sector.,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—Minister, I will leave it there. I have pursued this matter in an attempt to get some clarification because of the very definitive words used in the explanatory memorandum. It says ‘would’ and you have underlined the word ‘would’. It does not say ‘may include’; it is actually specific and says, ‘would be represented’. I took that to mean that those categories that are specified would be participants on the advisory council; and, because of the clearly defined nature of it, it would be to the exclusion of others. That is the reason I pursued this.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-11-17,"—I do wish to be recognised, thank you.
—I recognise you.
—Senator Bernardi recognises me as well, Mr Temporary Chairman, so that is all that matters.
—I am sure that is absolutely true, Senator Xenophon.
—The proposed amendment standing in my name that has been circulated in the chamber relates to making the advice of ANPHA public:
The CEO must cause a copy of any advice given or recommendations made in undertaking the CEO’s functions under subsection 11(1) to be published on the ANPHA’s web site within 6 months of providing the advice or making the recommendations.
This is very much about transparency. Initially there was a proposal that this be published within 14 days. I acknowledge that 14 days is too short a period of time and that there needs to be an adequate period of time for the government to consider recommendations made by the agency. But I also think it is important that those recommendations be made public. It is very much in the public interest that those recommendations are out there after a reasonable period of time.
I note that my colleague Senator Siewert from the Australian Greens will be proposing that the period of time be increased from six months to 12 months, and I am quite comfortable about that. I have had discussions with the government about that longer time frame. I think it is fair in the context of this legislation that there is a longer time frame. I have had discussions with Dr Southcott, the member for Boothby, in relation to this. I think it is important that we get the full recommendations. I do not believe that having a summary of recommendations or a precis of recommendations would be adequate. It is important that we see the full recommendations that this body would give to government. Twelve months will be very much in the public interest and will give the government an adequate time frame in which to consider and, if necessary, to act on those recommendations.
So I commend this amendment but I indicate that Senator Siewert may be moving an amendment to increase the period from six months to 12 months.
—Are you seeking to move the amendment, Senator Xenophon?
—There are two ways of doing it, I guess. I will take advice from you, Mr Temporary Chairman, as to whether I move this amendment and Senator Siewert amends it to 12 months. I am in your hands in relation to that.
—I think it would be simplest if you amended and moved your own amendment.
—I move amendment (1) as amended:
(1)    Page 8 (after line 30), after clause 11, insert:
11A  Publication
                  The CEO must cause a copy of any advice given or recommendations made in undertaking the CEO’s functions under subsection 11(1) to be published on the ANPHA’s web site within 12 months of providing the advice or making the recommendations.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—We support Senator Xenophon’s amendment and we would like to make a couple of comments. Of course, this will ensure that the CEO has an obligation to provide details of any recommendations made to the government. It addresses concerns that the coalition has raised that the agency lacked independence and transparency. I must say that there was some great concern about this in the original bill. We believe that the recommendation and advice has to be as transparent as possible, and that it should be open to public scrutiny. By increasing public engagement on the issue of preventative health we are encouraging a dialogue between the public, health and industry sectors.
Before the minister makes further comments I will take this opportunity to ask about the breakdown in the original explanatory memorandum to the bill. In the financial impact statement of the original explanatory memorandum there was a breakdown of funds allocated over the forward estimates. However, this breakdown is not provided in the breakdown to the current bill and thereby restricts the extent to which it can be held accountable. I ask the minister if it was deliberate or if it was simply an oversight that the revised explanatory memorandum does not include the forward estimates?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-17,"—I would like to make some comments on the amendment. We strongly support the issue of the public release of advice from the agency. We think it is very important. We also recognise that there is a process here while the agency develops its advice and recommendations and we do understand that it takes some time for government to then consider it and perhaps develop its strategy about how to implement it. I understand that process.
The Greens are trying to ensure that there is disclosure of the advice because this is an extremely important issue. I touched on this in my second reading speech yesterday; we believe that if the agency is carrying out its job properly it should report without fear or favour of that information becoming public. It is important information and if it is very good advice it will stand up to public scrutiny. We believe that is important.
We also believe it is important that the government should be held accountable and have to explain why it does not accept particular pieces of advice or recommendations from the agency, if that should occur. The government should also be held accountable for why it did not accept a particular piece of advice or if it went in a different direction but supported some of it. That is why I planned to move a similar amendment, although mine was for 12 months. If Senator Xenophon’s amendment is passed I will, of course, withdraw my amendment. That is why we thought a 12-month period was an acceptable length of time between the advice being given and it being made publicly available. We support Senator Xenophon’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—To the question from Senator Fierravanti-Wells: the change to the explanatory memorandum goes to the question of the delay in the passage of this bill. There has been no change in the actual overall funding in those figures, to be frank. There has been no change to the funding for the agency and related proposed expenditure. I can refer you to where you can find those figures in the PBS. It is to do with the delay in passage of the legislation. In that respect, in order to be accurate that is how it had to be changed.
I will now go to the substantive question, and that is the amended amendment from Senator Xenophon. I confirm to the Senate that the agency has to be independent and it has to be able to provide independent advice to the minister, and in doing so the agency has to be able to provide frank and fearless advice to the minister. It would concern me that an officer of the agency could, if they were compelled to publish all advice to the minister, potentially temper that advice. That advice, therefore, may not be as frank and fearless as a good democratic institution would desire.
There is a potential that there would be a tempering—and I use that word rather than watering down—of advice by a public servant who is trying to predict what a government may want. I do not think that is good or sound for the operations of our democracy. We are worried that this amendment would compromise the agency’s capacity to provide that advice to health ministers and therefore to the Commonwealth government.
That is quite a precedent that we would be setting here. I appeal to the Liberal Party in its support of this type of amendment to think about what sort of precedent for other pieces of legislation this is going to create. This requirement to publish all advice is something that does not occur in our democracy. I ask the Liberal and National parties to contemplate what sort of precedent is being set here.
Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you used the word ‘details’—that is not what the amendment says. The amendment says: ‘The CEO must cause a copy of any advice’. It is very clear. I suggest this is quite a significant change from the approach that your party had in government, and have now, to dealing with legislation.
Coming back to Senator Xenophon’s point, whilst we are saying that the advice needs to be frank and fearless, the authority needs to be independent and its advice needs to be provided to a minister in a transparent way. There will be enormous transparency in this organisation. It is important to note that the agency will be subject to the usual Public Service statutory agency checks and balances. It will be required to publish an annual report, to provide strategic plans on its proposed work and to publish a report on the state of preventative health in Australia every two years, and its CEO will appear at estimates. Senators will be able to question the CEO at Senate estimates, to peruse an annual report and to go through all the processes that we expect in our government structures.
For those reasons, we cannot agree to support this amendment. However—and this is a discussion you may have, Senator Xenophon, with Senator Siewert—if you were to require the CEO to publish a summary, rather than a copy, of its advice and recommendations, that would address my concern about the ability of the agency to provide the open, frank and fearless advice that we are expecting of it. That would make the government more amenable to accepting the amendments, if they were to carry. But I absolutely, firmly, say that we are not going to support the amendment in its current form—we will not support an amendment along those lines. Given the position of the opposition, something that I do not think would compromise the function of this agency—and this is quite a serious point—would be the requirement for some sort of summary document within the 12 months of provision of advice. That may be considered. But, once again, I underline that we would not support it on a vote. I thank the Senate and indicate that the government will not be agreeing to Senator Xenophon’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-11-17,"—Before I respond comprehensively to the government’s position in relation to this, Senator McLucas, do you envisage that the CEO of that agency will be appearing at estimates?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,—Yes.,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-11-17,—Will the CEO acknowledge that the advice and recommendations will be subject to freedom of information requests?,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—Senator Xenophon, I think your question is: will the CEO turn up at Senate estimates? My advice is that the CEO will, definitely, and of course will also be subject to FOI requests.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-11-17,"—With respect to the government, I do not see the point of opposing this amendment. It allows for a structure of transparency and openness so that the recommendations made by this body in relation to preventative health will be published on the net for all Australians to see. If the government acknowledges that these recommendations would be subject to freedom of information requests anyway, what is wrong with having a formal structure in place that deals with these so that we know that, within 12 months of such advice being given, it will be made public?
Senator McLucas says that the organisation needs to give frank and fearless advice to the minister—and, in some way, requiring these documents will not allow for that. With respect, I see that as quite a specious argument. The fact is that these documents will, in any event, be subject to FOI and to scrutiny through the estimates process. I think it is important that we have a process to require these documents to be made public within 12 months of the advice being given. The minister says the agency will be a democratic institution and that that is why it is important that we have transparency in relation to this. If the Australian National Preventive Health Agency is to be an independent and effective body which will investigate and make recommendations about what preventative health strategies should be introduced or revised, why shouldn’t its recommendations be made publicly available?
The 12-month time frame suggested by Senator Siewert is a sensible time frame; I acknowledge that. It will give ample time for the government to consider, to review and to implement to varying degrees recommendations by the agency. If the agency makes recommendations that the government fundamentally disagrees with then it can say so. I am sure the government can prosecute its case if it believes that the agency is making an unreasonable or impractical recommendation. But ministers and governments must not have the capacity to ignore or reject out of hand important research based preventative health recommendations, certainly not without providing its reasons for doing so. I would have thought that formalising a structure to allow for the recommendations and advice given by this body to be made public would strengthen it rather than weaken it. In any event, the fact is that this information will be subject to FOI and the estimates process—why not have a system in place whereby we will get to see the advice given to the government on the expiration of 12 months? I commend this amendment to my colleagues. I think there would be inherent dangers in having a summary. It could be subject to a debate as to what has been left in or out. I think having the whole advice is a much preferable course of action.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—This is a new dialogue. We are setting up this agency and it is basically going to tell Australians what they can eat, what they can drink and how they should conduct their lives. For some people this is a nanny state gone absolutely crazy. That may be the view of some people out in the community, but the reality is it is a new dialogue that must be had with the community and we are going to have to change community attitudes. So in that respect I support what Senator Xenophon is saying. I really do think that for full openness and transparency we really do want public engagement and public involvement and, if we are going to have a process, that the agency be open to scrutiny. This is probably the most open to scrutiny that we can have.
I have been the opposition spokesperson on health and ageing in the Senate and over time, in preparation for various estimates, I have delved through the many lists of reports that have been commissioned by the government in the preventative health space. One of the things that really concerns me is that when you go through the list of reports that have been tendered—some subject to tender, some not subject to tender—there are a long list of reports that have been commissioned from consultants that have not been released and that are not available in the public arena in relation to preventative health. I have touched on this in estimates, and it really does concern me. It concerns me even more in the context of my previous comments about the government’s reasons for refusing to support the coalition’s strong push to have industry representation and consumer health organisations on there. This is going to affect many facets of the daily lives of Australians, and I really do think that we should be fully open, fully transparent about this organisation. We need to know what sort of advice is being given and why that advice may or may not be followed in the context of what this agency is going to recommend to government. On that basis we will be supporting Senator Xenophon’s amendment.
I do want to ask the minister some questions. This first question touches on this issue of transparency. In the financial impact statement there is a reference to $102 million for national level social marketing campaigns targeting obesity and smoking. I ask the minister: why do these social marketing campaigns not relate to other matters? Ought they not also relate to the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition, minimising the harmful drinking of alcohol and discouraging substance abuse, for example?
The other question I ask is: why has social marketing not been defined? The government needs to provide clarification as to what the scope of social marketing is. Research has shown that social marketing campaigns carried out in isolation are inadequate in influencing behavioural change and it is important that the agency, in terms of its capacity to operate and integrate with other measures, is working collaboratively with industry. Particularly in light of the comments I made earlier about consumer health organisations and the industry involvement, if they are not going to be represented on the advisory council, in fairness Australians should know what advice is being provided to government and the response, particularly in relation to those two very important measures.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I will respond to Senator Fierravanti-Wells’ questions first, if you do not mind, Senator Xenophon. Essentially that $102 million indicates what we are doing in the first tranche. So that piece of work will be focused on the questions around obesity and smoking. As she would be aware, we have quite a considerable amount of money in social marketing around the abuse of alcohol. That is already underway. That does not indicate that that is the only piece of social marketing that will be undertaken by the authority ever; this is just the first tranche.
You asked: why don’t we define social marketing? I think the answer is inherent in the comments you made. Social marketing has to be responsive and diverse. You cannot say it is advertising—you cannot say it is pictures on buses. By the nature of technology in Australia, it is changing almost minute by minute. If you defined social marketing five years ago, you would not include SMS in it. Now we do. So let us leave social marketing as something that we all naturally understand, and then it can respond to the changing ways that our communities, and particularly some of our target communities in this space, will be communicating with each other. We all know what social marketing means. It used to be defined as advertising when I was a little girl. Now we call it social marketing intentionally so that we capture all of the potential ways of influencing behaviour.
Senator Xenophon, this is quite a considerable precedent that you are asking the authority to set in the way that advice is provided by public servants to governments. This is a significant shift from the system that we have at the moment where the Public Service is there to provide excellent, well-briefed, well-researched advice to government. That is its job, and it is tasked to provide it in the baldest way: ‘Tell us the facts and then when we have all of those facts decisions can be made.’ My concern with your amendment is that that encourages the Public Service to behave in a different way than we would ordinarily expect of it. It would then be tailoring advice to try to understand or pre-empt what the government of the day is thinking. We have seen examples of that in our history in Australia, where public servants have attempted to think ahead of where a minister or a government may be thinking.
That is dangerous. I go back to your words: ‘A copy of any advice’. If that is required to be placed on the internet within 12 months of giving out advice, public servants, because they are human beings, will change their behaviour. We would be making a significant precedent if we passed your amendment today. I do encourage you to contemplate looking at the potential of a summary to be provided. I do take your point that once a summary is provided the next question is, ‘What did you leave out?’ Then I go to the point that we have Senate estimates, we have the fact that the CEO will appear in front of Senate estimates and we have the opportunity for FOI under the normal constructs of FOI. On your earlier point, where you said that FOI would reveal all anyway, there are rules around FOI, as you would know probably more than most, that go to third-party considerations and the public interest test. You made the point: ‘Why don’t you do it anyway, because we will get it through FOI?’ There are rules around FOI, as you know. I think the institutional structures we have around transparency will give the sort of scrutiny you are looking for. To take it to the next step—and that is a requirement that all advice is published—I think that may diminish the power of the authority in a long run, and that would be a shame.
You recognise that our government is one of the first governments—the first government, I think—in the history of Australia that has decided that preventative health investment is the way to improve the quality of life in our country. I would hate to think that that goal could be diminished by this amendment, where the upshot could very well be that we have public servants in the authority a bit scared of telling it like it is. That would be a failing. That would be, I think, unfortunate. It would be terrible if it resulted in decisions being made not on the basis of good information. So I encourage you to look at the alternative, as I have indicated, as a way to potentially solve your concerns but also ensure that those who work in the authority will be providing the best information to the minister and the government so they can make the best decisions in terms of the health of this nation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-11-17,"—I thank Senator McLucas for her response. This is a new agency. It is supposed to give robust and independent advice to government. I cannot see the downside for government if that advice is released after a period of 12 months on the basis that the government does not have to adopt that advice. I think it is important, given the resources being put into this agency and given the importance of preventative health, to actually allow a process whereby the public—the people of Australia; the taxpayers who are paying for this agency—can see what advice is being given. If we want to talk about the whole issue of robust and fearless advice, let’s look at an example of an entity that has been in the news lately—the Productivity Commission. Governments cannot tell the Productivity Commission what advice it should give. The commission regularly gives advice that is made public in its memoranda, its reports and its inquiries that is out there for all to see. I think that enhances the public policy debate. This agency also has a very important role in enhancing the public policy debate in relation to health, particularly preventative health. That is why I think it is important that this agency publishes its recommendations, its advice, after 12 months has elapsed. I do not think anyone would accuse the Productivity Commission of being timid or fettered or frustrated by virtue of its reports be made public, and I think the same argument ought to apply here.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—That is a good way of having the discussion. The Productivity Commission has a completely different role to what this organisation will have. The PC does, as you are aware, a whole range of fundamental research work. It will inquire into an issue, whatever it may be, and provide a considered opinion which then goes into the public arena as a matter of course. That is what happens. Any advice that goes to the minister outside of that commissioned request that the PC undertakes under your provision would then be published. I do not think that is the point you are making; the point you are making is that reports from the PC are published, and that is its role to inform public debate. What your amendment in this debate does is require any advice to the minister to be published—not a commissioned report, not a piece of research, but any advice. I think the distinction is quite clear. The PC has a completely different role in the way our systems work in this country to what the authority will have. It undoubtedly will publish research documents—it will undoubtedly conduct research—but it is important to equate the role of the authority with the role of the PC.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—In supporting Senator Xenophon, first of all I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers answered my question about the consultancies. I did raise that issue and perhaps I should have framed it in that context. At this point I am not sure if the parliamentary secretary has information available on those. I would really be interested to know the number of consultancies, reports, reviews or research on preventative health which has been commissioned and paid for but which has not been released out in the public arena. I am concerned about the balance and the potential balanced approach of the advisory council and the advice that it would give. From the sound of things and from what the parliamentary secretary has said, I do not think there is going to be too much industry representation on this council, nor do I think that there are going to be consumer health organisations there, given the priority that the government has put on social marketing in this agency. That is the bulk of the cost of the setting up of this agency and it will be social marketing versus other priorities such as research, program delivery and transparency.
I think it is really important that the Australian public is made aware of that advice, how that social marketing is undertaken, how that social marketing is interpreted and how that social marketing could in turn be used to try and change attitudes of the Australian public, given that the parliamentary secretary says that effectively the cost structure of this organisation has been shifted over the forward estimates. If you look at the first explanatory memorandum that breaks down the cost, you can see that the bulk of the spending is going to be on social marketing, it is going to be on obesity and smoking, and they are going to be the priority over the next three years—or certainly that is what it indicated in the explanatory memorandum. I think the public are entitled to know what this agency is doing in its attempts to change in particular obesity, smoking and other things that may also come out in its work in those areas, how those social marketing campaigns are carried out and how those social marketing campaigns will interact with other areas to influence behavioural change.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I did not respond to one of Senator Xenophon’s points in his earlier contribution. Senator Xenophon said something along the lines that you cannot see the downside if this information is released and the public can see everything as it is coming through the estimates process et cetera. My point is that the net result of Senator Xenophon’s amendment would happen prior to that point and that potentially there could be a change in the type of advice that is being provided. So no, I do not disagree that would be the downside if everything is released. I cannot disagree with that. Yes, the public will be able to see. My concern is that the behaviour may change prior to the document being written. That is the point I am trying to make.
With respect to Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I am advised that every document that the task force commissioned was published. There were three background papers that were written in the early days of the operation of the task force. They were on alcohol, tobacco and obesity. The purpose of those background papers was to inform the members of the task force, to give them a basis and an understanding across the breadth of the issues that they were going to deal with; so that information was available to inform them. But every document that was commissioned by the task force was proudly published by our government so that the information could be provided to the community.
We are a government that is interested in changing the health of this nation. To do that, information should definitely be made available because, as you said, information will potentially change behaviour. It is quibbling, to be frank, to be focused on three background papers that were part of the process of getting to a monumental document, which was the report of the preventive health task force. Hopefully in history, there will be a point in time that health writers look back to and say, ‘That is the time when Australia changed the way we deal particularly with alcohol, tobacco and obesity.’",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—I am relying on answers that were provided through the estimates process, Minister. I am happy and I will separately identify those reports that have not been released. My question did not go to the agency; it just went broadly to preventative health.
This government has been talking about preventative health for a long time and we are finally here. That is fine; so did the previous government, and I think that in my speech I did put that on the record. But I just make the point that the reason I asked the question, Minister, was not to quibble. The reason I asked the question was that in answers that were provided to me through the estimates process it was clear that certain reports had not been released, and that was the basis upon which I made my comments. If you have more up-to-date information now in relation to that, or perhaps if at some stage separate to this the department wishes to provide me with that information, I am happy to receive that. But I did want to state for the record that I asked that question on the basis of material that had been provided to me at estimates. If that is out of date then that is the reason.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-17,"—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I am advised that the answer I have given you traverses the same questions you asked at Senate estimates. I understand that you put a question on notice. That is still being dealt with. The answer to your question is that everything that the task force commissioned was published—absolutely everything. There were three background papers that were devised to inform members of the task force across the breadth of the three areas that were going to be contemplated and they were provided for information and education, really, of those people who sat on the task force.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-11-17,"—The ongoing relationship between this parliament and the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the very interesting and important aspects of the pharmaceutical benefits process continues with our scrutiny of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010. This bill continues the matters of reform around our pharmaceutical system. It was referred appropriately to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee during the period of the last parliament and then, when this parliament re-formed, it went back to the committee.
When the Minister for Health and Ageing introduced this bill in the lower house, she stated the reasons why this bill was important to our community and to our government. She said:
This bill sets out the PBS pricing arrangements aimed at reducing growth in PBS expenditure, ensuring access to quality medicines at a lower cost to the taxpayer, and providing certainty to the pharmaceutical industry in relation to PBS pricing policy.
She went on to say:
The PBS plays a vital role in Australia’s health system, particularly for the prevention and management of chronic disease, and for the treatment of life-threatening conditions. The PBS provides reliable and timely access to a wide range of medicines at a cost individuals and the community can afford.
In terms of the process, the commitment to ensuring that the PBS continues to serve that function is agreed by all; and, in terms of the discussions we have had, there is great commitment to ensuring that we maintain the PBS. The minister in her speech went on to say:
In the coming years, medicines will continue to be a significant and growing component of health expenditure. Since the previous major pricing reforms in 2007, the growth rate for PBS expenditure has increased from 4.3 per cent in 2006-07 to an estimated 10.5 per cent for the 2009-10 financial year.
            …         …         …
In conclusion—
said the minister—
the reforms in this bill provide a firm basis for achieving a more efficient and sustainable PBS while, at the same time, providing a period of certainty to industry in relation to medicines pricing policy.
That sums up the background to this particular bill.
The committee considered the wide range of submissions—and we always draw a wide range of submissions when we have inquiries into this issue. They are mainly from people in the industry, because this system relies completely on strong, vibrant involvement from all parts of the industry. There were some attempts during the committee process to set up an even more combative arrangement than is necessary in this process between the innovator groups, which are mainly represented by Medicines Australia, and the industry group for generic medicines. These groups provide a great service and are integral to ensuring that we move forward with a strong PBS.
We tried to establish through the committee process the need for further reform. There was some debate about this, but the government continues to say strongly that there needs to be close scrutiny of expenditure in the PBS. There was some attempt in evidence—and it is all in the Hansard—to say that somehow things were going well enough since the 2007 reforms that there did not need to be immediate consideration of further ways to effect savings in this area. The government strongly refutes this argument. There needs to be ongoing and careful scrutiny of all elements of expenditure in this process to ensure that the system remains strong and to ensure that we can continue to provide the service to the Australian community so they can have access to a wide range of new, innovative medications and, after a period of time after the patent expires, generic medicines.
The choice is important, but most importantly for so many consumers—and we have this on the record from consumer groups—is the assurance that, firstly, all the medications available are safe and, secondly, consumers are getting good value for money. Currently we have a co-payment for medications, and that is maintained at a low level. This is reviewed regularly in this place to ensure that it can be maintained. The basis of effective government expenditure continues to be the way that we can minimise the increased costs in the area. That is why these reforms are essential.
We know that the PBS costs continue to grow quickly. We know that in 2008-09 the cost of the PBS was 9.2 per cent higher than it was in 2007-08 and that in 2009-10 expenditure grew a further 9.3 per cent to an annual cost of $8.4 billion. That is significant money, but it is for a really important purpose for Australia. No-one quibbles about the need to have this expenditure, but what we need is to have scrutiny to ensure that that expenditure is the most effective.
The Intergenerational report 2010, entitled Australia to 2050: future challenges, forecasts increased spending on the PBS. That report of course contains estimates for the future, but I think it is important to understand that we need to look to the future in our systems. That report says that the PBS will increase in real terms from $443 per capita in 2012-13 to $534 per capita in 2022-23. Those are sobering but important figures for us to know.
In terms of our role as a government, it is essential that there is strong management of the high-cost growth of the PBS. The importance of that is to ensure that we allow continuing investment in new and innovative drugs, so people in the community have access to them, and ensure that we balance the expenditure that is going on. This is not a contest of any kind between whether you have innovative medications being produced and, after the patent has concluded, the generic industry being able to maintain their fair share of the market. It is not imposing any form of contest; it is actual market engagement.
The 2007 reforms were extremely important in the way that the whole PBS operated. I note from the comments that the opposition put to the legislation committee that they seem to have a particularly glowing memory of how easy the 2007 reforms were to pass. There was great debate both in the committee and in this place when those reforms were being brought into our parliament in 2007. Having sat on the legislation committee that reviewed the 2007 reforms before they came into this place and the reforms we are bringing forward in 2010, the similarity of the arguments is overwhelming in terms of the statements made by the innovative groups and by the generic medicines group about the impact the proposed changes will have on their industry, on their market share and on the future of the modern world as we know it.
If you do take the time to read some of the submissions in both cases, you will see that there was great debate about the need for the changes and about the impact on either group and who was going to hurt more from the changes in 2007—and that continues to this day. However, in 2007 we were able to progress the reforms, but with pain. What is happening in 2010 is that the same proposition is being brought to the parliament. There is an assessment of what has happened up until now, an assessment of what is happening now in the industry and, most clearly, an assessment of what will happen in the future.
This legislation we have brought to the parliament looks at two key points. One of the most debated but essential components of the reforms that happened in 2007, which we are seeking to extend, was the use of price disclosure as an effective mechanism to allow the government, which is paying for these medicines, to get better value for money by taking real advantage of discounting that is occurring in the market. Despite the claims of the industry, particularly the generic industry, in 2007 that price disclosure would not work and would cause them to have no profit in the future and be deeply affected, we have seen significant savings in PBS expenditure on generic medicines.
The first four completed rounds of price disclosure since 2007 have seen a number of drugs take a price reduction ranging from 13 per cent to 72 per cent. Those were extremes; there were not too many drugs where the saving was 72 per cent. The clear aspect of price disclosure is that the government is made aware and is only paying, in terms of the expenditure on generic medicines, the price that is paid to the supplier. That is where the discounting occurs: when generic businesses are, quite rightly, competing for their share of the market, they offer a range of discounts and then the suppliers are only paying a certain amount before they dispense the medication to the patient. What we are saying is that the government wants to get a general view that the amount the government is paying is what the supplier is paying to the generic industry. It is not a scary concept. It is based on averages. But it does mean that there has to be disclosure about price, and that is the core point of the reforms.
What the original reforms in 2007 introduced was that, once a drug was off patent and more people were able to produce that drug, then you could look at price disclosure. At this stage only 45 medications are subject to that process. The core aspect of the price disclosure changes which we are bringing in in this legislation is to extend that to all medications which have generic opportunities. There is a need to disclose the pricing process in all of that, which will mean a considerably larger number of medications will be subject to the process. That is the core reform. We have been open in saying that that is what we want to do. It is based on an existing process, which has been operating since 2007, and we want to extend it.
The generic industry does not want that to happen. It is their right to put up that argument, but that is the core disagreement—they do not want that to happen. In the debate in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee we were confounded by various arguments from the different groups about how much share of the market they had; we were confounded by graphs and statistics all around. Basically the end result is that, within the industry, both the Medicines Australia group—the group that is known as the innovative group—and the generic medicines group have significant market share. They are both important. We also saw that price disclosure will impact on both groups. There is an argument as to which group will be impacted most, but it will impact on both groups. So no-one is protected from having price disclosure as a mechanism.
In the legislative committee process a great deal was made about an MOU that was agreed between Medicines Australia and government about future interaction between those groups and looking for a degree of certainty in the relationship into the future. There was some attempt in the committee to paint this as some kind of conspiracy or unnatural behaviour. The government’s position is that the government is open to discussion with all people in the industry. What it was able to do after a great deal of discussion—we have dates and times of letters between various groups all on record now in Hansard—was to come to an arrangement with the Medicines Australia group which is public. People can see what is in that MOU, and some of things in the legislation reflect that. There was not an ability at the time to come to a similar arrangement with the generic medicines group. That is not to say that it cannot happen at any time in the future. It is to say that before 2010 there was no ability to achieve that agreement. That is our position. We are moving into the future, and the legislation reflects the reality of the moment. Ongoing negotiation and discussion are important and essential to ensuring that the PBS continues to work. There are a number of claims about added benefit to the Medicines Australia group as a result of the MOU. We refute that.
I want to speak about one particular issue in that discussion which came up at length in the legislation committee, and that is to do with the therapeutic groups. In 1997, amidst a great deal of discussion and debate and pain, the government introduced the therapeutic group listing, which allowed for a number of medications which were determined by the PBAC—the group that looks at the technical aspects—to have a highly contested term ‘interchangeability’. The principles of interchangeability are determined and can be discussed with the department and also with the TGA and the PBAC. Through that process, groupings of medicines that were available to the community for their conditions were seen to be interchangeable and pricing through the PBS would be the same—it put groups of drugs together. To this date, seven groups have been determined.
One of the things that have come out of the MOU is an agreement between Medicines Australia and the government that there would be no new therapeutic groups introduced through the period of the agreement, which is until 2014. I have had a look at how many therapeutic groups have been introduced and when. The first four, I believe, were introduced in 1997. The next lot were not introduced until 2007, so there is quite a significant gap between 1998 and 2007, when a further two were introduced. The year after that, another one was introduced, so that is a shorter time frame. In 2009-10, there was an attempt by our government to introduce three new groups. When you look at the records they show that therapeutic groups have been proven to save significant amounts in expenditure on the PBS. That is itemised very clearly in the evidence we received. So the years were 1997-98, then 2007 and then 2010. I will just put on the record that the last three therapeutic groups that our government attempted to introduce for cost-saving purposes to strengthen the PBS have been disallowed by the Senate on the basis that they were not appropriate. So, in terms of the cost-saving element, we have the list of therapeutic groups—I have given the dates—and we now have an agreement with Medicines Australia group through the MOU that there will not be an attempt by the government to introduce another set of these therapeutic groups until 2014.
I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that, if you are saying that this is some deep advantage to Medicines Australia in some way, the history of therapeutic groups indicates that a four-year time frame before something else is introduced is not a major innovation in the process. We are saying that therapeutic groups, the same as price disclosure, is an agreed and effective mechanism to look at in maintaining the financial security of the PBS. I do not think any attempt to paint this particular process as giving an unfair advantage stacks up, particularly in view of the fact that the last attempt for a therapeutic group that the government put up to save money was knocked back by the people who at the moment seemingly, from the additional comments I have read, are claiming that somehow there is a deep advantage being offered to one group and not another.
There was great debate about the process of consultation. Effectively communicating with people continues to be an issue when you are looking at savings and changing practices. That needs to continue to be scrutinised, and no-one has any doubt about that. But there is significant evidence on record about attempts at discussions between the government and the various groups involved. That needs to be looked at into the future, because our system will only survive if that ongoing consultation happens.
I just want to make one other point about what was claimed in the committee and what we need to address—and this will be picked up by other senators. There was, again, an attempt to scare the community by saying that, if we introduce the program as we have discussed in this legislation, there will be threats to the supply of medication and people will not be able to receive the medication that they need on time. The department responded in depth to this and talked about the community service obligation which is in existence. The fact is that there is already an agreement that medication must be available for people who require it. We have the process using wholesaler groups and also the pharmacies to ensure that that happens. There has been a claim by some of the wholesaler groups that they need to have further supplementation of funding to ensure that this program can operate. The department has responded to that by talking about the time frames in which we are placing the situation.
These new arrangements will not automatically happen in December, should this legislation be passed. What will happen in December is that data collection systems will need to be put in place. The real changes to the cost of medication to suppliers—not the public but suppliers—do not come in until 2011. So we need to look at that in the future of this discussion. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-17,"—I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010. I will start by saying that the coalition support the intent of the MOU and do so in the context of the PBS system. We want, at the outset, to acknowledge the many strengths of the existing PBS system. It has in its time offered a wide range of older and newer prescription medicines in a way that has led to the Australian public having a high degree of confidence in it. Maintaining the integrity of the system is very important, and for this reason we support the $1.9 billion savings measure sought to be achieved by this bill.
This bill builds on the extensive reforms of the PBS which were introduced by the coalition government in 2007. However, the issue that the coalition has at this juncture is the extent of consultation. As Senator Moore correctly pointed out, when those reforms were introduced they were not without pain. But they were as a consequence of an extensive and very wide ranging consultation process that, in the view of the coalition, has not been followed in this instance. The 2007 reforms were indeed radical, but they were undertaken after extensive consultation with all stakeholders. That wide-ranging consultation probably ensured that there was widespread acceptance of the reforms. As coalition senators specified in the additional comments that we put forward, that was no doubt a strong reason for the fact that the reforms will yield well in excess of the anticipated savings in the PBS.
The 2007 reforms were intended to be implemented in stages. We are now seeing the fruits of those reforms. From the various assessments it seems that the reforms are likely to yield double the amount that was anticipated. We are probably looking at $6 billion worth of reform. That, of course, is very much supported. Those reforms came with the commitment of the whole industry. In our view, had there been a much more broad-ranging and much more in-depth consultation with all relevant stakeholders in this instance concerning the bill we are discussing today, it is possible—and, again, we pointed this out in our comments—that the identified savings of $1.9 billion and further savings could have been made by the PBS. Broader consultation, in our view, would more likely have resulted in much broader consensus and commitment and could potentially have resulted in much more equitable—and I stress the word ‘equitable’—savings being identified.
In looking at the background to the MOU, how it came into existence, one cannot avoid comments about the chequered history of this Minister for Health and Ageing when it comes to savings measures. Senator Moore tried to attribute to the coalition some sort of conspiratorial attitude. The reality is that you have had in the past an example—and we saw this in 2007—of extensive consultation leading to wide-ranging reforms. In this instance, and it is very clear from the evidence that was given at the inquiry, we saw the Department of Health and Ageing go out to consult with industry about the 2007 reforms and then all of a sudden we saw an MOU come into existence with one body—namely, Medicines Australia. One wonders how this came about. Mr Learmonth, on behalf of the department, was at pains to tell us that the proposal came very much at the suggestion of Medicines Australia and appeared to have been a last-minute thing.
Let us look at another scenario, a scenario that may not be too far off the mark, where, all of a sudden, the minister demands a certain amount of savings over the forward estimates and then the negotiations are worked backwards to arrive at the 23 per cent price reduction that is going to be applicable to F2 medicines in the cycle. I have my suspicions that this would have enabled the minister to lock in savings over the forward estimates and to try and rebuild her image and her chequered history of implementing savings measures. Whilst it may not be conducive to public policy, it is very clear that, although it may be appropriate to pursue measures to better match the price that the government pays to the market price, it is important that this government consult in a much broader sense, and that is the issue.
In light of some of the comments that Senator Moore made, it is interesting that the MOU provides for no new therapeutic groups to be formed for the duration of the agreement. Obviously, it is a trade-off—and an important trade-off as far as Medicines Australia were concerned. I also want to make reference to another term of the MOU—that is, the attempt to make changes in administrative processes to streamline the listing of new medicines. Interestingly, the MOU has a commitment and the Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to implement a maximum time frame of six months for consideration and decision in relation to the listing of new drugs. At estimates we were told that the period of just over six months that it is taking for cabinet to approve the listing of new medicines has blown out to 10 months. The government is prepared to put this in the MOU, and clearly its best endeavours thus far are not achieving much because the six-month period is blowing out to 10 months. So I wish the stakeholders well in this but I think it is going to be very much a hollow commitment, like many of the government’s other commitments.
I will just summarise the coalition’s position. We will not stand in the way of the savings in this proposal but we believe that the savings could be achieved via a more equitable negotiation of the MOU. In our report the coalition senators clearly set out that it is our view that these so-called reforms to the PBS have been handled very ineptly by the government. Key sections of the pharmaceutical industry with manifestly material interests in the nature of the reforms have been excluded from the negotiations that led to the MOU, which is now the basis of the bill before the Senate. Secondly, and more importantly, the reforms in our view are ill considered, targeting only medicines from the F2 formulary and overlooking the opportunity for considerable cost savings to the PBS and patients through the reforms of F1 listings. Also some of the administrative elements of the changes introduced by these reforms have not been thought through properly and could have highly disruptive impacts on pharmacies, bearing in mind the impact that this will have on wholesalers to ensure the timely supply of pharmaceuticals to community pharmacies and in turn to patients. As for the views of the generic medicines industry, the consumer health groups and the wholesalers, in our view, under these new changes, it appears that there has been a failure to consult them, or at least there is a blatant disregard for the concerns that have been raised.
We are very conscious of the need to contain the rising costs of medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As I indicated, we support the general thrust of the reforms in the bill but, as a matter of good public policy, the burden of reform should fall more equitably across all affected parties in the pharmaceutical sector and more evenly between the members of not just Medicines Australia but other groups such as GMIA and other stakeholders involved. As I indicated, our compelling concern is about the government’s failure to adequately consult with all parties with a material interest, and they are, I would like to specifically reiterate: the Generic Medicines Industry Association, the National Pharmaceutical Services Association and the Consumer Health Forum.
Of course, generic medicines drive competition and cost savings for consumers and the government. Our concern is that the government’s proposal may compromise access to affordable, high-quality medicines in the long term. Significant price cuts without volume drivers under this measure may detrimentally affect the viability of the sector which drives PBS savings for the government. These issues could have been avoided through better consultation and actual negotiation with all stakeholders—and our focus is on ‘all’ stakeholders. Evidence suggests that additional savings could be achieved in consultation with all key stakeholders and should be fully explored by the government.
Of course, the coalition successfully implemented a 10-year reform plan for the PBS in 2007, which as I have indicated will deliver far more savings than anticipated. Indeed, the government’s own Impact of PBS reform report shows that the coalition’s reforms will deliver savings of up to $5.8 billion over the 10-year implementation period, compared to the estimated $3 billion under the government’s proposal.
On this basis, the coalition is not in a position to support the bill given the outstanding issues. We do support the intent of the MOU and believe the stated savings and more can be achieved through better consultation, and we stand ready to expeditiously support measures which will achieve this end. To that end, in light of the various concerns that we raised, the deficiencies of process and our misgivings over the content of some of the reforms, the coalition senators outlined in their report that the bill should not be supported in its present form but should be re-presented at a later date following a proper and comprehensive negotiation process or, alternatively, that this bill be withdrawn and a new bill be introduced.
On that basis, we set out four recommendations. I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment which gives effect to these recommendations, which are: firstly, that ‘the MOU negotiated between the Commonwealth and Medicines Australia be set aside’; secondly, that ‘the Commonwealth undertake a fresh set of negotiations to develop a new MOU which will secure the identified $1.9 billion cost savings in a more equitable manner’; thirdly, that ‘all parties possessing a material interest in the outcome of the proposed reforms or whose material interests are affected by the reforms be involved in the negotiations, including the members of the GMiA, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the National Pharmaceutical Services Association’; and, fourthly, that ‘the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 be amended in light of the contents of the new MOU and be re-presented to the parliament in amended form for reconsideration and approval or, alternatively, that the government withdraw the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 and a new bill be introduced’. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add: but that further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the first sitting day after:
the Government sets aside the memorandum of understanding signed between the Government and Medicines Australia on 6 May 2010;
the Government has entered into a fresh set of negotiations to develop a new MOU which will secure the identified $1.9 billion cost savings or other potential savings to the PBS;
all parties possessing a material interest in the outcome of the proposed reforms or whose material interests are affected by the reforms, including the members of the GMIA, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the National Pharmaceutical Services Association, have been consulted in the negotiations for a new MOU; and
the Government has circulated in the Senate amendments to the bill to reflect the contents of the new MOU.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-17,"—As we are aware, the government has signed a memorandum of understanding with Medicines Australia this year, designed to:
… ensure “a stable environment for business and continued access to new medicines for all Australians”.
These measures were announced in the 2010 budget and were predicted to give savings of $1.9 billion to the government over five years, largely achieved through the imposition of price cuts across F2, or off-patent, medicines and through the extension of price disclosure arrangements to all products listed on F2.
… the MOU with Medicines Australia also includes a guarantee that the Government will not seek to impose any further price savings on the pharmaceutical industry before 30 June 2014 or introduce any measure which favours the dispensing of generic medicines, thereby—
this is a concern—
possibly precluding further measures which could deliver additional savings to the Government.
Australians pay some of the lowest prices for new medicines in the OECD, and that is a good thing, yet generic prices are high by international standards, and that is not such a good thing. The big challenge for any government is to ensure that new medicines come on stream while at the same time ensuring that, as drugs move from patent to off-patent, the off-patent generic drugs fall in price to a sufficient degree that taxpayers’ dollars are being used most effectively.
A recent paper by Philip Clarke in the Medical Journal of Australia reported that Australia’s pharmaceutical expenditure could be significantly reduced by up to, the paper stated, $9.31 billion over 10 years if the proportion of generic prescriptions were increased to 100 per cent and the government cost for purchasing medicines from providers were reduced to a similar rate to that of the UK. Having said that, we know that the situation in Australia is different to that in the UK, but it gives an indication of the size of savings that are potentially there.
From January 2005 to October 2009, Australians have paid $900 million more for statins than they would have if the prices were equivalent to those paid in England. The wholesale price of simvastatin, a drug commonly used to treat high cholesterol, is about $30 a month in Australia for a 40-milligram dose, whereas in Britain the same drug costs around $3 a month. That is the size of the cost differences that we are talking about. So we are talking here about significant costs to both the government and the community.
The Greens are concerned that the savings, estimated to be $580 million over four years, resulting from the original PBS reform measures have been revised down to around $103 million, that the estimated savings are yet to be delivered and that now we have a new lot of reforms coming through without our having yet realised the savings from the first round of reforms. The government is putting considerable faith in the prospect of savings of $1.9 billion over five years, and the Greens’ concern is that the budget assumptions that underpin these savings have not been made available to the public. There is also some concern in the community that while it is claimed that these savings will amount to $1.9 million—and the Greens think that those savings are important—the assumptions are not available for us to decide whether we can have faith in those calculations. That concern is intensified by the fact that we are yet to see the full savings from the PBS reforms, and we have been told that that is because some of the costs in the original reform are more upfront and that we will see more savings down the line. I am trying to show that this is a complex area and that the economics and the savings are fairly opaque and your understanding of them fairly hazy when you do not get access to the full budget assumptions underpinning some of the policy positions.
The most contentious aspects of the MOU are not contained in the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010. The proposed amendments are technical and, some would say, overly complicated. They seek to further expand the previous reforms that were brought in under the previous government in 2007. We know that health reform is never easy and that the PBS is no exception. Getting the policy settings right for the PBS is critical in ensuring that Australians can continue to gain timely and affordable access to medicines in the future, and the Greens support the PBS in principle. We recognise that health policy and reform are complicated matters, and we acknowledge the need to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the PBS so that Australians can continue to have access to affordable medicines when they need them. We know that as new or expensive medicines come on line the cost of the PBS increases. We are fortunate that we have a scheme such as the PBS, but we do need to ensure that it is sustainable.
This legislation is complex, and the Greens have some concerns about the effects of the legislation on the availability of medicines, the cost of the PBS to the government and—ultimately—the costs to consumers. The Greens believe we should have a comprehensive debate about the pricing and purchasing of all medicines in Australia, because these issues are part of the debate. I will come to some of the issues a bit later, but the Greens will later be moving a second reading amendment to require a review of the pricing and purchasing of all medicines in Australia. The Greens call on the government to conduct a study of the affordability of prescription medicine and of access to medicines, including generic medicines. The Greens think it would be sensible to focus in particular on the group this measure is likely to affect: those on low incomes who do not qualify for a healthcare card.
In the course of the public debate and the debate in committee on this legislation we spent a lot of time looking at the issues around market share. The Greens are concerned about who really owns the market and about the promises that are made to government on price control. The issue here is which association best represents the off-patent medicine market and which association should therefore be engaged in consultation about the changes proposed in the bill. Representatives from the Generic Medicines Industry Association and Medicines Australia made submissions on this issue during the course of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Inquiry into Consumer Access to Pharmaceutical Benefits, and I must admit that to me it is still as clear as mud which organisation has which market share. Medicines Australia claim that they represent a 60 per cent of the cost to government of the F2 sector while the Generic Medicines Industry Association say that they represent 75 per cent of the volume of this sector, so you can see the confusion.
The Generic Medicines Industry Association acknowledges the difficulties caused by the paucity of data in determining market share, and they stated during the Senate inquiry that this is an imperfect world for market share. Similarly, Medicines Australia acknowledged that the GMIA ‘may have other data that we are not privy to’, suggesting that this may account for the differing figures on share of the off-patent market. So it is still unclear, despite questions at estimates and during the Senate inquiry, which stakeholder can lay the greater claim to market share. This is important because, if you listen to either Medicines Australia or GMIA—your choice depending on which of them you believe to have the greater market share—the argument goes that the changes may adversely affect them, that they will come out of the market and that the cost of medicines may go up as a result. In other words, the benefits of this MOU may not be delivered. That it is the sort of complexity that we are dealing with in this debate. As this example demonstrates, without access to all the information, it is very hard to make a call. If one company does have a 75 per cent share of the off-patent medicines that Australians have access to, a lot of people could be affected. That is still unresolved, and that is why the Greens think further study is needed on the availability of prescription medicines in Australia.
The bill addresses three matters contained in the MOU: statutory price reductions—by international standards, price reductions are low in this country; price disclosure; and under co-payment data. While savings are welcomed, the Greens have concerns about the sustainability of these reforms. The UK introduced a series of price cuts in 2005, and an evaluation in 2007 suggested that the effects of the price cut could be reduced over time. It is still not clear whether the savings here are temporary or long term. The Greens will be moving a second reading amendment that calls for an annual report to be tabled in parliament on all of the available data on cost and volume of under co-payment products, including average price and details of minimum and maximum price range.
Of particular concern, because it is an area dealt with in the bill, are the concerns, of which we have a couple, about medicines priced below the co-payment. First, pricing is at the discretion of the pharmacist and, apart from altruism or competition between pharmacists, there is no incentive for the pharmacist to offer the savings to the consumer. The second is that costs for under co-payment scripts are borne entirely by the consumer. In other words, they do not kick into the $33 mark, as it currently sits. Only the dollar amount is reflected against the safety net, so they do not count towards the safety net. You may have chronic illness and need to be on medicines that do not reach the point where the government payment kicks in, so you pay the full cost of that medicine but it does not go towards your safety net as it otherwise would. We are concerned that this may disadvantage people who do not qualify for a healthcare card.
We welcome the fact that this legislation will enable the collection of under co-payment data from 1 April 2012. However, the legislation is specific about how the under co-payment data will be used. There should be an annual report to parliament on both the volume and price of under co-payment products, including average price and maximum and minimum price. However, we are aware that some of this data is not being collected and that under the MOU it will not be collected. The PBS reforms are supposed to deliver savings to consumers, but this is currently unable to be measured. More importantly, as under co-payment drugs do not qualify for the safety net, it could, as I said, adversely affect consumers in some instances. The Greens are also concerned that there is no dispute resolution or audit process as part of the price disclosure arrangements.
We are concerned about the significant delay between notification of price reduction and the date that it will take effect. For example, the price reductions that will be calculated from the price disclosure cycle—which would have commenced on 1 October 2010; it has now been put back—will not take effect until 1 April 2012. The Greens believe that this should be shorter and we will seek to move an amendment to address that issue. Given the inherent dynamic nature of markets, it is unlikely that price disclosure this year will be an accurate reflection of the market price in 2012, which is a significant period of time away. We are also concerned that under this process arbitrary price cuts may unfairly penalise drugs which are already cost-effective or have already been subject to discounting.
The impact of further cuts to already low-priced drugs was noted in submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into consumer access to pharmaceutical benefits. From the introduction of PBS reform until December 2009, there was a total of 38 drugs that were subject to price disclosure. Of these, only six have been subject to price reduction. For the products that were subject to the reduction, the range of price reduction was considerable, from 14.57 per cent to 71.8 per cent. The GMiA estimates that this has generated savings of $30 million per annum. In the context of an almost $8.5 billion program per annum, we are concerned about what will be the true delivery of savings from this measure—for the government, taxpayers and industry. This goes back to the issue of us not being able to determine accurately whether the $1.9 billion savings, which of course we believe should be achieved, are actually achievable.
International experience suggests that price disclosure arrangements are notoriously challenging to implement and often circumvented. Questions remain about the effectiveness of price disclosure in a market that is not fully competitive. We also have some concerns about the complexity of the policy and the lack of transparency due to the commercial-in-confidence nature of the data that is provided. Furthermore, price disclosure is considered to fail the test of efficient regulation, with high compliance costs. The Greens have put on notice a number of questions around the breakdown of the cost to implement the price disclosure approach.
Two key elements of the bill are to contribute to the sustainability of the PBS and maintain access to quality medicines at a lower cost to the taxpayer. The Greens acknowledge that the ways in which the bill seeks to achieve these goals are not new but rather build on the reforms made to the PBS in 2007 by extending the pricing policies introduced at that time, whilst maintaining the separation of medicines in the Fl and F2 categories and retaining the concepts of statutory price reductions and price disclosure. The Greens further note that the changes proposed in the bill are expected to deliver savings of $1.9 billion over five years. We support those principles.
Price reductions of this magnitude may have an adverse effect on Australia’s pharmaceutical industry and the industry will have to adjust to a more competitive market, a situation that is occurring in many parts of the world, so part of this argument is that these changes will hurt Australia’s industry. We note that we need to improve the situation for costs of generic medicines in this country. Otherwise, we will have an escalating situation under our PBS and will no longer be able to afford it. So it is very important that we do consider reforms, but that we are also mindful of the fact that we need to make sure that the industry itself is sustainable. The MOU in Australia provides a stable framework that allows the majority of the pharmaceutical industry—and, again, I say ‘majority’ very carefully, as we are still not sure because we do not know about market share—the opportunity to adjust to the new, leaner environment and still bring new medicines to the PBS in the future.
Importantly, consumers need to see the benefits of PBS reform: lower prices, quicker listing times and the PBS being able to afford to subsidise new therapies. Consumers, as taxpayers and patients, need cheaper medicines while having subsidised access to the range of new therapies. We believe it is important that we pursue a reform agenda in Australia for the PBS so that we continue to support the benefits. We have been concerned about the issues raised by the GMiA and the level of consultation—or lack thereof—that was had with the government, and part of that turns around what is defined as consultation. We have explored that through the committee inquiry, and I will seek to explore that further when we go into committee. However, it is for the reasons I have just listed and the fact that we believe there will be significant savings that we will be supporting the bill if our amendments are supported. We believe that goes to the issues of collection of data, transparency and accountability. We also believe that we need to be looking at the overall impact, availability and accessibility of prescription medicines in this country. If the amendments are supported, we will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-11-17,"—The aim of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 is to deliver a more efficient and sustainable PBS, better value for money for Australian taxpayers and policy stability for the pharmaceutical sector. The bill seeks to implement initiatives agreed between the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, and Medicines Australia by amending the National Health Act 1953 in relation to price reductions for certain drugs listed on the PBS, price disclosure arrangements, the collection of under-co-payment data and section 100 medicines, and other consequential amendments. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was created in 1948, and we have a world-class PBS that provides timely access to medicines for all Australians. In the coming years medicines will continue to be a significant and growing component of health expenditure. The reforms in this bill will guarantee that the PBS continues to provide this essential service to Australians while at the same time ensuring that every precious health dollar is spent effectively.
It is currently estimated that the PBS will cost $13 billion in 2018, compared to where we are now: around $9 billion in 2010-11. The PBS expenditure will need to be managed if it is to be sustainable in providing affordable access to essential medicines for all Australians. This bill gives effect to further PBS pricing reforms that were announced in the 2010-11 budget and that are a subject of a memorandum of understanding with Medicines Australia, the peak body for the pharmaceutical sector. The reforms will result in savings for the PBS of around $1.9 billion over five years. The amendments in the bill focus on medicines where there is competition in the market. Over time the changes will mean that PBS prices more closely match the price at which the medicines are actually sold. Australians will benefit in terms of lower prices and timely access to innovative treatments. Price disclosure will be accelerated and expanded. Price disclosure requires pharmaceutical companies to advise government of the price at which PBS medicines are sold to pharmacies. This information is used to adjust the PBS price across all brands of a medicine to the weighted average price which is actually being charged in the market, which means the industry, not government, is setting the level of price reduction based on prices already operating in the market. As outlined in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report into the legislation, the main provisions of the bill are price reductions, merging the F2A and F2T subformularies, price disclosure and collection of under-co-payment data. The government report sets out these provisions and their purposes.
I will now address some of the issues raised during the inquiry. With regard to price disclosure, we heard in the inquiry that there is significant discounting of off-patent medicines in Australia. Pharmaceutical companies give big discounts to pharmacists to get them to stock their products over their competitors’ items. Price disclosure was originally introduced as part of the 2007 PBS reforms. We know that 45 medicines currently participate in price disclosure. If this bill is passed the program will be expanded to encompass all medicines that are subject to brand competition. Those are what are known as F2 medicines. This means that we will go from 45 to around 220 medicines participating in the program. The proposed changes to pricing policies recognise that competitive pricing already exists in the market for many PBS subsidised medicines but that Australian taxpayers should be benefiting further from market competition and the lower prices that result from it.
Let’s be clear on price disclosure: these reforms will result in no extra costs for patients. In fact, patients will benefit from price reductions where the price of a medicine falls below the general co-payment amount. The direct saving to consumers from these new measures is independently estimated to save general patients on average close to $3 per prescription. Without price disclosure consumers and taxpayers will continue to pay for medicines well above what they are being sold for. The aim of these measures contained in the bill is to achieve PBS prices that more closely match the prices at which companies sell their medicines to pharmacies.
Another issue raised was industry representation and consultation. Both Medicines Australia, or MA, which represents about 50 companies, and the Generic Medicines industry Association, or GMiA, which represents five companies, were involved in discussions with the government and were asked, as I understand it, to provide proposals to enhance the sustainability of the PBS. Evidence given from the Department of Health and Ageing submits that MA, representing their members—around 50 organisations—represents 86 percent of the total cost of PBS expenditure and nearly 60 percent of the sales of off-patent medicines annually, though this figure is disputed by GMiA. Discussions with Medicines Australia proved positive and resulted in a memorandum of understanding between Medicines Australia and the government.
Consultations with GMiA on options to ensure the sustainability of the PBS were also held. Unfortunately it seems that these discussions with GMiA were not equally positive. GMiA argued that they did not have a good hearing, but in my view this does not seem to be the case. Coalition senators have expressed the view that GMiA were excluded from the negotiations so let us look at the facts. In their submission, the department listed a number of opportunities GMiA had to discuss options for reform to the PBS, including with the senior officials from the Department of Health and Ageing, since November 2009 and prior to the budget. The department’s submission listed these as:
18 November 2009 - Meeting between First Assistant Secretary of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Division and GMiA;
21 January 2010 - Meeting between First Assistant Secretary of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Division and GMiA;
4 February 2010 - Senior Departmental meeting (including the Deputy Secretary) with GMiA;
16 March 2010 - Meeting between the Minister for Health and Ageing and GMiA;
30 March 2010 - Senior Departmental meeting (including the Deputy Secretary) with GMiA; and
22 April 2010 - Meeting between the Minister’s Office and Alphapharm.
To further illustrate the opportunities GMiA were given to engage in discussions on the PBS, I will outline the Minister for Health and Ageing’s view on this matter:
On multiple occasions, GMiA was able to discuss options for reforms to the PBS with the government, including with me, as the minister, in my office and with senior officials of the Department of Health and Ageing. GMiA had a good hearing and the government valued the exchange of views. However, I do need to note here that GMiA’s key proposal to the government in these discussions was that patients should be made to pay some $5 more for off-patent medicines made by originator companies compared to the same drugs made by generic companies. This proposal would have resulted in concessional patients paying nearly twice as much as they currently do for some off-patent medicines. The government could not support this proposal. Notwithstanding these differences of view, the government continues to work closely with the industry on how these reforms will be implemented, through a working group which includes GMiA, pharmaceutical wholesalers and Medicines Australia.
The fact is, GMiA just do not agree with price disclosure so I am not sure what more we could have done. They do not agree on price disclosure and they were not, as I see it, ready to enter into discussions about it.
Another issue raised was the administrative burden on industry. We have an existing price disclosure program and the processes underpinning this program were developed with representatives of both the innovator and generics industry. So industry is already familiar with the operation and requirements of the program. This bill expands the program and the government has retained the key aspects of the program, with feedback from industry to further simplify and streamline the processes for compliance. The government has, through the price disclosure working group—a working group which, as I said, includes the department, GMiA, wholesalers and MA—already met and had ongoing discussions on implementation.
I believe that the impact on suppliers will be low because the major contributor to the savings, price disclosure, does not impose price reductions arbitrarily, nor demand the lowest price for a medicine—the prices will follow the market. As has been stated the disclosure arrangements aim to lower the government price only to the average price actually charged by pharma companies in the market. Also we have a situation where the generics market in Australia is significant and growing. In the last four years we have seen it grow from 27 per cent to 34 per cent. Also eligible wholesalers are sharing in some $950 million to distribute medicines under the Community Service Obligations arrangements, 58 per cent more than the previous agreement. The payments from the CSO supplement the wholesale margin for most drugs.
The issue of the supply of drugs was also raised. This bill is supported by the Consumers Health Forum on the basis that consumers will benefit from continued access to medicines and the savings generated by the measures will result in savings to taxpayers. The Consumer Health Forum’s view is this bill does not represent a threat to the viability of the generic industry, and nor do the measures remove the obligation on pharmacists and wholesalers to maintain supply of PBS drugs. Ms Bennett is executive director of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, the CHF, which is the peak body providing leadership in representing the interests of Australian healthcare consumers. Ms Bennett gave evidence supporting the bill. In part, she said:
Consumers have told us that they want timely access to affordable medicines and that it is essential to them that the PBS remains viable into the future to achieve that. We therefore support the reforms that contribute to the continuing sustainability of the PBS while ensuring that consumers can get the medicines they need at a price that they and the government can afford. The bill gives legislative effect to the MOU between the government and Medicines Australia. We consider—
that is, the CHF—
that the MOU will contribute to that long-term sustainability and the viability of the PBS through statutory price cuts and strengthened price disclosure mechanisms for the formulary 2 medicines.
Further Ms Bennett submitted:
Consumers as both buyers of these medicines and taxpayers will pay less for medicines than under the current arrangements, due to the price cuts and the resulting potentially greater competition and further reduction in prices for generic medicines, particularly in the under co-payment market.
We also welcome the provisions in this bill that will enable faster access to safe, high-quality medications through the mechanisms in the bill that allow for parallel registration and reimbursement processes by the TGA and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the managed entry of new products onto the market and the ‘best endeavours’ commitment to a maximum time frame of six months for cabinet approvals of medicines.
I would like to quote from the government report from the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into this bill. It said:
Two key goals of the bill are to contribute to the sustainability of the PBS and maintain access to quality medicines at a lower cost to the taxpayer. The committee acknowledges that the ways in which the bill seeks to achieve these goals are not new but rather build on the reforms made to the PBS in 2007 by extending the pricing policies introduced at that time, whilst maintaining the separation of medicines in the F1 and F2 formularies, and retaining the concepts of statutory price reductions and price disclosure. The committee further notes that the changes proposed in the bill are expected to deliver substantial savings to government.
I believe that the MOU and the bill now before the Senate will benefit consumers and taxpayers and should be supported.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-11-17,"—The coalition opposes many aspects of this MOU. Once again, there was yet another Senate inquiry which was told over and over that consultation between the government and the relevant stakeholders in this area was insufficient from the perspective of the stakeholders. In report after report we make the point to the Department of Health and Ageing that we continue to be told by stakeholders that they were told what the department was going to do, not asked to assist the department to do it. It is interesting to look at some of the history of this MOU as described by the government and take up the point of whether GMiA was actually deliberately excluded or not from negotiations.
Mr Learmonth from the department has set out a time frame. He has talked about who did what and who said what and he has made the comments in regard to how the discussions came about that, certainly, GMiA were consulted. He said:
In the case of GMiA, again we had a range of discussions. Some of them came off the back of submissions that GMiA had put in before about various ideas, and we talked about sustainability. There were a number of meetings that we detailed in our submission. I would add that no meeting was ever refused—it all was opened to GMiA—but I could not really characterise the way discussions evolved with GMiA as a negotiation in the same way as I could with others. We put our view that we were looking for sustainability, and GMiA made their views extremely clear on what they thought about the notion of price disclosure and any further saving. In other words, they did not really want to be a party to that. They did have some other ideas that were fundamentally about increasing competition.
From that you would get the impression that the department of health had bent over backwards to be helpful except, of course, then we get to Mr Learmonth’s evidence about the memorandum of understanding that the department of health ultimately signed with just one sector of the industry—the innovative pharmaceuticals area. Mr Learmonth, the deputy secretary of the department, said that the government had not actually set out to have a memorandum of understanding and that as far as they were aware the suggestion to have an MOU came late in the piece. He said:
As I said, it was not the intention upfront. Indeed, it was a suggestion from Medicines Australia and not us. My guess would be that it was April this year but I do not think we could even nail down a day. It was not an a priori objective.
Medicines Australia went on to suggest that they did not know who had thought up the idea of a memorandum of understanding. I guess when you look at the favours that this memorandum of understanding, the MOU, does for Medicines Australia you would rather hope that the Department of Health and Ageing would say that it was their suggestion not the company’s. So we have a confusion first over what constitutes negotiation and what constitutes consultation.
Late in the piece, Medicines Australia, who hold about 60 per cent of the market that we are talking about says to the department: ‘Let’s have a memorandum of understanding which gives us a four-year moratorium on the price of many of our products. But we’ll save you money elsewhere.’ The department says: ‘Oh, what a good idea. Let’s do that.’ The department does not say: ‘Gee, we should go back and talk to some of the other stakeholders about what they think about that. Irrespective of the fact that we know that they are not keen on the idea now that a memorandum of understanding, which will give a commercial advantage to about two thirds of the market, is about to be signed, perhaps we should go and talk to the other third of the market. Perhaps also as the Consumer Health Forum pointed out we should talk to the Consumer Health Forum and consumers as well about what they think about the changes that are proposed.’
There was a debate that consumed an awful lot of the inquiry’s time about what percentage of the market these relevant industry bodies represented or what percentage of the market was held by the innovative industry, which includes patented products and products that have come off patent and are now in the generic area. It also includes a number of generic medicines made by the innovative industry. The Generic Medicines industry Australia by contrast makes only generic medicines; they make only off-patent medicines. We had the GMiA saying that they had 75 per cent of the off-patent PBS market in Australia by volume or 68 per cent by value. We had Medicines Australia disputing that claim and saying that members of Medicines Australia accounted for about 60 per cent of the off-patent market by value. Dr Brendan Shaw, Chief Executive of Medicines Australia, said:
Whichever way you cut it, our members account for the majority of the off-patent market.
Well, yes, I agree that 60 per cent would look like the majority if Medicines Australia are right on this point. However, that leaves 40 per cent of the off-patent PBS market supplied by others, and most of that is supplied by the members of GMiA and one or two other generic medicine manufacturers. Forty per cent of the market, which is the lowest figure anyone has ever suggested that generic medicines hold, is, I would argue, a not insignificant percentage of the market.
This is a point I put to Dr Shaw from Medicines Australia, who over and over during the inquiry into this piece of legislation refused to accept that 40 per cent of a market was a significant share of the market. He would not use that dreaded word, ‘significant’! So, finally, we asked the department to provide their figures on who held what in the PBS medicines market. They came back with the figures for the formulary 2 market, which is the off-patents market. Medicines Australia held 57.4 per cent of PBS medicines by expenditure and GMiA held 34.2 per cent, with other generics holding seven per cent. That is 41 per cent by expenditure to the generic medicines area. The Department of Health and Ageing also told us that, by PBS volume, Medicines Australia members held 47.3 per cent of the market and GMiA held 43.8 per cent, with other generics representing 6.1 per cent. That gives generics a total of 50 per cent of the market.
What are we arguing about here? It is completely ridiculous and pointless for the department to claim—irrespective of whether or not we have the correct data for generic medicines—that the most minimal figure for their share of the market has been given as 40 per cent; yet, instead of going back to them when a memorandum of understanding was signed, the department simply went ahead with basically a commercial-in-confidence deal with half to 60 per cent of the market through Medicines Australia and ignored the other half of the market.
The other fact that then came up, which certainly had been mentioned in submissions but not perhaps brought out as strongly as it was during this debate, was that no data is currently collected on medications under co-payment where they cost less than $33 or less than $5. According to the GMiA, a large percentage of products in that area are made by the generic medicines industry, yet the data is currently not collected in this area. GMiA say: ‘We keep our figures on that. We sell the stuff. We know how much of it we make. We know how much of it we sell. We’re not like the department, who has to rely on the PBS figures, where these are not recorded. On that argument, we make a significantly larger amount of the medication and the ones that do not cost the government anything because they are under the co-payment.’
To continue to put the view that this group could be easily excluded from negotiations and simply forced to come along on the coat-tails of the government’s deal with the half of the industry that will benefit substantially from the four-year moratorium on the pricing of some of the formularies is a complete nonsense. We will be opposing and seeking to amend this legislation on that basis.
I go on to point out that the coalition are absolutely in favour of making savings on the PBS. We invented the idea—when our current leader, Mr Abbott, was the health minister—of pushing for savings on the PBS and pushing for price disclosure so that it was transparent to the government what they were paying for and how they were paying for it.
Yes, it is true; PBS costs are growing quickly. In 2008-09 the cost of the PBS was 9.2 per cent higher than it was in 2007-08. In 2009-10 the PBS grew a further 9.3 per cent to an annual cost of $8.4 billion. The continued growth has been recognised by all manner of organisations and especially in the 2010 Intergenerational report—a series of reports which former Treasurer Peter Costello began so that we had a sense of how to have a sustainable Australia and an ageing Australia at the same time. The Intergenerational report for 2010 forecasts that spending on the PBS will increase in real terms from $443 per capita in 2012-13 to $534 per capita in 2022-23.
Not mentioned, of course, in this section of the government’s report are the savings that have already been realised. Since the policies of 2004 to push for cost savings in the PBS and to control prices by price disclosure, the savings that have been made in that area have been significant. The rate of growth of PBS expenditure has slowed significantly. Between 2004 and 2010, twice as much has been saved than was anticipated or forecast when the savings were put in place.
We are talking here about a deal that was done in 2007 for 10 years. The point was to do it for 10 years. It is delivering double the savings that were already anticipated. Yet we have the government incapable of not fiddling with this memorandum of understanding, and not just not fiddling but completely and ineptly overturning some of the benefits that have come out of this arrangement. In my view, the truth about the harm that can be done to the Australian pharmaceuticals market by this legislation lies somewhere between the two views that were given to our committee. It will not be as bad as the Generic Medicines Industry Association of Australia said, nor could it possibly be as good as the government and their current partners, Medicines Australia, claim.
The generic medicines industry makes the point that most of the drugs their members sell are made in Australia. They make the point that, if they cannot manufacture them here and make a profit, they will simply send that manufacturing offshore. We are talking about, at a minimum, 40 per cent of the generic PBS medicines market. I know from importing products in an earlier life that, if there is a storm somewhere in the China Sea or something like that, it can be quite possible for drugs not to arrive up to four months after the time they were supposed to arrive. Let us just hope that the forecasts made by the generic medicines industry in this area do not come to pass. If they do come to pass, we could have very serious shortages in areas of medicines that people simply must take.
This government does not seem to know when it should be subsidising industry to keep jobs onshore and when it should not. The generic medicines industry does not want any subsidies. The generic medicines industry wants a level playing field. They want the opportunity to compete, and one would have thought that even this government could realise that competition is what will continue to drive price reductions in this area, not favouring one section of the industry over another section of the industry.
There was also evidence given by the wholesale distributors, both by their association and by a number of their members, regarding what exactly is going to happen in the weeks leading up to the drop in the value of pharmaceuticals in this area. Whilst the view might be put that this could be very easily handled, we took evidence along the lines of: what pharmacy in its right mind is going to be well stocked with medicines when the price is going to drop something like 12½ or 27 per cent tomorrow morning? Why would you do it? What is the sense of it? You would try to be out of stock at that stage or to have as little stock as possible and then, come D-day in January, you would stock up as fast as you could. The department thinks that all sounds fine; but, if somebody could explain how distributors are going to handle what is basically four or five times the level of business they would normally expect at that time, I would be interested to hear it. Pharmacies certainly have some very serious concerns about it. It is not as if we are running out of one particular brand of cornflakes or something. It is about the fact that these pharmacies will have no stock of particular medicines. I hope that over Christmas the government and the department think about how that will affect Australian consumers and, one hopes, reflect on the anger that they may experience if consumers cannot buy their drugs on prescription when they need them in the new year.
The pharmacists also point out that this change is being imposed on them during one of their busiest periods, the Christmas period. It is not just for medications but for all the other products that pharmacies sell to make a profit—the gift sections and the like. December is their busiest time. Every product in the place has to be re-ordered and repriced in that time. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2010-11-17,"—The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an elemental part of the way in which we deliver good health outcomes in Australia. It has been an institution at the core of the way in which Australians have received their medicines for many decades. We have been fortunate because the scheme works, for the most part, very effectively. It delivers high-quality medicines, it delivers safe medicines and in many ways it delivers medicines which, compared to some countries, are reasonably priced.
But the challenge is to maintain the integrity of the scheme to ensure that the scheme tries to be relatively efficient and continues to achieve those kinds of objectives. The particular challenge with which we are all concerned here in this debate, and a matter with which we are all very familiar, is the rising cost of medicines. To create new medicines is a very expensive business. Not surprisingly, those companies that are creative and inventive enough to produce new medicines for the benefit of the community are able to secure patents and some cost-benefit as a consequence of all of the research that they actually undertake.
We on this side of the chamber are very conscious of the challenge to contain the costs involved in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. So, in the spirit of that concern, we do support the desire to secure these $1.9 billion of savings from the PBS. We support the general direction of these reforms, as my colleagues have said, but we do think—and I am certainly of this view—that these reforms raise some very serious questions which have not been answered by the submissions to the committee. The department was inadequate, to say the least, in providing reassurance during the committee stage of the progress of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 through the Senate.
These are the matters that we think need to be ventilated in this debate. We urge the government to take them seriously. We think the bill needs attention. We think the matters which we raise are serious. I note that the Greens share some of these concerns. In that context I think there is widespread concern about the nature of these reforms amongst members of not only the coalition but other parties in the Senate.
The reforms build on the reforms which were introduced in 2007. They were, I suppose one could say, amongst the most radical that have been introduced to the PBS over its many decades of existence. There were quite wholesale changes to the way in which medicines were delivered. They introduced categories of formularies for medicine. They introduced new pharmacy and wholesale support arrangements. The promotion of generic medicines was an important part of those reforms. There was the streamlining of the approval process for some medicines. Whilst it has not been alluded to in the debate I have heard this morning, there are in fact further changes in relation to the approval process which we on this side of the chamber actually support. The final thing that occurred in 2007 was the introduction of price disclosure as a way of securing significant savings for the future.
These were all very significant reforms. Because they were significant and because people realised what a widespread impact they were going to have on the PBS, they were to be introduced over a 10-year period. In fact, it was significant that only a small number of medicines were actually included in the early proposals for price disclosure—162. My own view is that with these reforms we have created an extraordinarily complex system within the PBS. There are simpler ways of providing medicines to the Australian public which would secure the kinds of cost savings that we all think are important. It would be instructive if we were to take some time to look at other examples around the world and consider whether we should undertake those kinds of reforms in Australia. But that is not the debate we are having today. Mandatory substitution and tendering in relation to medicines, for example, are some approaches that other countries have adopted, but those are issues that are perhaps for another day.
The 2007 reforms, as my colleagues have noted, were anticipated to yield significant benefits to the government—in the vicinity of $3 billion over a 10-year period. The submission to the committee by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia points out that there have been three independent studies of the progress of these reforms so far and each of those studies has demonstrated that the reforms have produced savings to the PBS far in excess of those projected—not just trivial amounts of money or small additional benefits but benefits that range between $5 billion and $7 billion. There is even a suggestion that the returns to the PBS might be considerably greater. It could be in the vicinity of $9 billion over this 10-year period. The calculations which were made in relation to the 2007 reforms are already way out of date, and those changes are already bringing considerable savings to the PBS.
I think it is reasonable to ask: why, in the context of a 10-year reform program that is bringing considerably larger savings to the PBS, are we now, just two or three years into that program, introducing another set of reforms on top of those which the industry has barely accommodated? They were radical reforms, as I said, and they are only now being bedded down. Of course, the answer to that question is that the government is desperate for money. It is desperate because its budget bottom line is in a mess and it needs every means possible to secure more revenue for the Treasury coffers.
These seem to be useful reforms, but the impact of imposing them on a process of reform which is already taking place seems not to have been well thought through or very well considered. There is every potential, as my colleague Senator Boyce said so eloquently, that these reforms will produce a considerable disruption to the supply of medicines to the Australian market. That would have serious consequences. I know the Department of Health and Ageing are disbelieving; they treat such concerns with great contempt. They are not persuaded this is a problem. They are not persuaded by any of the evidence presented to the committee that this is a challenge which has to be met into the future. If you look at the reality of the existing reforms, you can see that there have already been difficulties in relation to 162 listings, including a legal challenge or two. So when we are talking about producing whatever the number of medicines might be—and there seems to be some dispute about whether it is potentially 1,600, but it is a large number of additional medicines, certainly well beyond 162—it is almost inconceivable that there would not be some quite significant issues and problems in relation to administration, data collecting and things of that nature. So the department ought to think seriously about the consequences of these reforms and the impact they are going to have just on the market, let alone on the suppliers et cetera.
There has been considerable debate about the rising cost of the PBS, as I have said. It will grow significantly in the years ahead; there is no doubt about that. As new medicines come on, the costs increase, particularly when they are subject to patents. And the proposition which does not seem to be challenged by anybody is that the costs of medicines in the F1 category will grow more quickly than the costs of medicines in the F2 category. In fact, the Generic Medicines Industry Association said in a submission to the committee that, between 2005-06 and 2009-10, the cost to the government of F2 medicines had declined by 21.4 per cent while the cost of those in the F1 formulary had risen by 35.4 per cent over the same period. So we face a situation where the costs of F1 are rising, the costs of F2 are declining, and the point about these reforms is that they target very specifically the F2 medicines and impose essentially the whole burden of the cost savings on the F2 formulary—save for the fact, which I acknowledge, that some companies that are part of the Medicines Australia group and have generic medicine activities will bear some of the cost pain. But the essential point is that the costs of this reform are being borne by the F2 section of the industry. In fact, not only are they bearing the costs but it would seem that the companies in the F1 market are insulated from further reforms which might actually save further money to the PBS. The MOU which has been signed, and which has been referred to already in this debate, seems to insulate the F1 companies and that section of the market from undertaking any serious reforms.
We take the view, and I certainly take the view, that the Commonwealth should be doing everything it reasonably can to share the burden of the cost savings across the whole of the PBS. All sectors should be contributing to the savings, including the companies in the F1 formulary. They ought to be making a proportionate share of the savings. They certainly should not be in a position where they are being insulated for a long period of time—four or five years—from being required to take steps to save money, save in those circumstances where their drugs might come off patent. That is what the MOU between Medicines Australia and the Commonwealth actually does, because it specifically rules out various measures which might actually save money to the PBS over a period of time. I note that Senator Moore sought to address this issue, but the therapeutic groups seem to be a proven way of saving money to the PBS. This is not just my assessment; it is the assessment and part of the evidence given to the committee by DHA last week. It is recognised that therapeutic groups offer significant cost savings to the PBS, and the creation of new therapeutic groups is actually precluded under the MOU which has been signed between Medicines Australia and the Commonwealth. I am not persuaded that this is in the interests of the Australian consumer. I am certainly not persuaded that it is in the interests of the reforms that are in this legislation. Why the burden of costs should not be shared amongst all parties is a mystery to me. This legislation and the MOU in particular deny that possibility.
We have heard quite a lot about the MOU and the way it was negotiated. I want to add my voice to the concerns that have been expressed by Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Boyce about how it was negotiated. It was very specifically a case where there were only two parties to the negotiation: the group of companies which constitute Medicines Australia and the Commonwealth. We can go through all the rigmarole if we like about the way in which it came about and the various consultations that occurred between various groups, but the reality is that the Generic Medicines Industry Association, one of the groups which had a very significant interest in the nature of this MOU, one of the groups which would be most adversely affected by the consequences of the MOU, was excluded from the negotiations. An argument presented to the committee was that the reason for this was that the GMiA had a relatively small proportion—it was even suggested, an almost insignificant proportion—of the drug market in Australia and therefore it had no standing to be included. The evidence on the proportions of the market which Medicines Australia and GMiA have is highly contentious. The data seems to me to be highly unreliable. One of the consequences of these reforms is that we will be in a position to have more reliable data into the future, and that is highly desirable. But it is a profound shortcoming of this particular process that GMiA members were excluded, particularly when their interests were so badly affected. It reflects no glory on the department that the negotiation proceeded in this way. The evidence before the committee in submissions was that the GMiA had only learnt of the MOU a couple of days before the federal budget was brought down earlier this year.
There are serious shortcomings in this legislation. My colleague Senator Boyce has alluded to many of them. The difficulty is that price disclosure dates and the dates at which the price of medicines will be reduced seem to me to be manifestly too limited. The timetable is not a timetable which is actually going to facilitate the supply lines. It is not going to facilitate the assurance that we all want—that we will have safe drugs coming onto the market and that they will be available in a timely way. It has the potential, not only for drug manufacturers but also for wholesalers, retailers and everybody involved in the industry, to be highly disruptive to their activities.
There is one particular anomaly that I want to allude to in relation to these matters, and that is with regard to the medicines which are in schedule 5 of the act. There are, I think, three medicines—the names of which I do not have with me—that are on patent. So the cost of these medicines cannot be reduced in any way but they are included in the process of price disclosure. That is a manifestly inappropriate way to try to determine the costs of medicines—to include them in the price disclosure activity. If the government does nothing else in amending the bill that is before the parliament, it certainly should remove those three medicines from that schedule because they cannot be subject to price cut because of the fact that they are on patent and they are highly distorting to the actual price disclosure costs. I think it is probably an error that they were there in the first place, but they are and that ought to be rectified because it is not helping the progress of the reforms.
These overall reforms are important. They will yield savings. We want those savings to be yielded to the Commonwealth. Given the estimate we had on the last occasion, I suspect the proposed $1.9 billion of savings will be very much higher—and that of course is to the advantage of the PBS. But there need to be some changes here. We need to see that the failure of these negotiations and the consequences that it actually had are rectified so that we spread the pain more widely throughout the pharmaceutical industry. That would be not only a fair and equitable result but also better for those of us who actually need these medicines in a safe and timely way. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-11-17,"—Reforming the PBS to ensure that government is getting the best value for money is a very important issue. We have an ageing population in Australia, and this means that there is going to be even more spent on the PBS and it is going to increase going forward every year. I am mindful of the reforms that were negotiated back in 2007 under the Howard government, and I do believe that there are compelling arguments to suggest that we can do even more in reforming the PBS. The MOU negotiated between the government and Medicines Australia does go some way towards doing this.
Under the measures set out in the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 there is a projected significant cost saving of $1.9 billion for the taxpayers. That is a good thing. It does not make sense for taxpayers to be paying for medicines at a price which is well above what the pharmacies are paying for them in the first place. There are a number of drugs where the government is paying to the pharmacies a premium of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent above the actual purchase price. This is a waste of taxpayers’ money. It is being forked out, going directly into the pockets of those in the supply chain with no direct benefit to the consumer. It makes sense for the government to try to address this discrepancy, and I support the thrust of what the government is trying to achieve with this bill.
The problem is that the MOU signed between the government and Medicines Australia is by no means perfect. The government are trying to save money and are tackling one part of the supply chain. They have largely focused on the F2 medicines category without, I think, really looking hard enough at the F1 category. Doing this may—and the word to note here is ‘may’—have a serious economic effect on the generic medicines industry. Generic medicines play an important role in making medicines affordable for Australians. They also play a very important role in manufacturing and jobs in Australia. We need to continue to ensure that that industry can continue to thrive and grow. I notice that the government has done this with the car industry.
I am little a concerned that maybe the generic manufacturing industry in Australia is at risk. I am all for the government paying less for drugs on the PBS, but at the same time I believe in supporting manufacturing jobs in Australia and having a vibrant industry on our shores. There is concern that the reforms in this bill have not fully taken into account the concerns surrounding jobs in Australia and the viability of manufacturing. That is where my concerns lie. I have raised the issue of jobs with the Minister for Health and Ageing. I will not put words into the minister’s mouth, but my conclusion is that I do not think those concerns are being taken seriously enough.
I see some merit in what the coalition’s second reading amendment is trying to do. From what I understand from talking to another senator in this place, there could be the idea of putting the vote on the second reading of this bill off until another time to try and work out how we can look at the concerns about jobs in manufacturing of generics in Australia. I will leave it there. I hope that common sense will prevail and that there will be further discussions with the generic medicines industry and a further focus on jobs and the concerns I have in that regard.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2010-11-17,"—In the few moments that I have I would like to say that the coalition supports the intent of the memorandum of understanding. The coalition does not stand in the way of the savings in the proposal but believes savings can be achieved via far more equitable negotiation of the MOU. During the Senate inquiry there were many concerns about the government’s failure to adequately consult all parties with material interest in the sector, particularly the Generic Medicines Industry Association, the National Pharmaceutical Services Association and the Consumer Health Forum.
I will state how the National Pharmaceutical Services Association felt about the consultation process. Unfortunately, as Senate inquiries go on, consultation seems to be a very difficult issue for this government. We find that a number of policies are adopted and the cry is that nobody consulted the industry beforehand. The National Pharmaceutical Services Association made the following comments with respect to consultation: at no stage was the organisation privy to or consulted on the proposed PBS reforms agreed to in the MOU with Medicines Australia; NPSA was not able to negotiate transition arrangements to ensure that supply is maintained under the new arrangements; NPSA would have sought to discuss the need for transition funding if it had been given the opportunity; if consulted, NPSA would also have sought to make recommendations with respect to how to ensure that supply is maintained when the price changes are effected; it is unclear whether the savings in wholesale margin funding are included in either the guild or the Medicines Australia savings; and, if the savings from the wholesale margin have not been taken into account when calculating the $1.9 billion of savings under the Medicines Australia MOU, then any adjustment mechanism in favour of the wholesalers would not impact on the total savings.
The minority report by coalition senators listed some recommendations. The first recommendation was:
The MOU negotiated between the Commonwealth and Medicines Australia be set aside—
until we can come up with some other way of having the other organisations included in the consultation. The second recommendation was:
The Commonwealth undertake a fresh set of negotiations to develop a new MOU which will secure the identified $1.9 billion cost savings in a more equitable manner.
The third recommendation was:
All parties possessing a material interest in the outcome of the proposed reforms or whose material interests are affected by the reforms be involved in the negotiations, including the members of the GMIA, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the National Pharmaceutical Services Association.
The fourth recommendation was:
The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 be amended in light of the contents of the new MOU and be represented to the Parliament in amended form for reconsideration and approval or alternatively, that the Government withdraw the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 and a new Bill be introduced.
Those were the recommendations after hearing the evidence and reading the submissions.
Generic medicines drive competition and cost savings for consumers and the government. It is claimed that the government’s proposal may compromise access to affordable, high-quality medicines in the long term. Significant price cuts without volume drivers under this measure may detrimentally affect the viability of the sector which drives PBS savings for government. These issues could have been avoided through better consultation and actual negotiation with all stakeholders. Evidence suggests that additional savings can be achieved in consultation with all key stakeholders and should be fully explored by the government.
The coalition successfully implemented a 10-year reform plan for the PBS in 2007 which will deliver far greater savings than anticipated. The government’s own report, The impact of PBS reform, shows that the coalition’s reforms will deliver savings of up to $5.8 billion over the 10-year implementation period compared to the estimated $3 billion. Whilst the coalition are not in a position to support the bill given the outstanding issues, we do support the intent of the MOU and believe that more savings can be achieved through better consultation. The coalition stands ready to support the measures which achieve this end. The coalition calls on the government to delay consideration of the bill and renegotiate savings proposed under the MOU with all stakeholders.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-11-17,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 will amend the National Health Act 1953 to deliver a more efficient and sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, better value for money for Australian taxpayers and policy stability for the pharmaceutical sector. The world-class PBS system provides timely access to medicines for all Australians. The reforms in this bill will guarantee that the PBS continues to provide this essential service to Australians while at the same time ensuring that every precious health dollar is spent effectively. The proposed changes to pricing policy recognise that discounting already exists in the market for many PBS subsidised medicines.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I am sure that senators know the scope of the problem that we confront with child abuse. In 2008-09 the Australian Institute of Family Studies indicated that there were 339,454 suspected cases of child abuse and neglect—let alone the numerous unreported occasions. I have twice previously risen to speak in this place about abuse at the other end of the age spectrum: elder abuse. As the Australian government’s seniors website states, ‘Elder abuse and neglect receives less attention than child abuse.’ On this occasion, I will again describe the forms this abuse may take, who the abusers seem to be, and the frequency with which this occurs. I will also raise the very real concern that this abuse can lead to active and even involuntary euthanasia.
What do we mean by elder abuse? The Toronto Declaration on the Prevention of Elder Abuse states:
… a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person. Elder abuse can take various forms such as physical, psychological or emotional, sexual and financial abuse. It can also be the result of intentional or unintentional neglect.
The Health Service Executive of the Republic of Ireland provides more detail, and I will quote from their report, Open your eyes, as there has been an attempt at systematic collection of data for the last few years. Objective data is difficult to collect, as there is serious underreporting of abuse—either by the individual or by the organisation providing their care. The report defines elder abuse as:
Physical abuse, including slapping, pushing, hitting, kicking, misuse of medication, inappropriate restraint (including physical and chemical restraint) or sanctions.
Sexual abuse, including rape and sexual assault or sexual acts to which the older adult has not consented, or could not consent, or into which he or she was compelled to consent.
Psychological abuse, including emotional abuse, threats of harm or abandonment, deprivation of contact, humiliation, blaming, controlling, intimidation, coercion, harassment, verbal abuse, isolation or withdrawal from services or supportive networks.
Financial or material abuse, including theft, fraud or exploitation; pressure in connection with wills, property or inheritance, or financial transactions; or the misuse or misappropriation of property, possessions or benefits.
Neglect and acts of omission, including ignoring medical or physical care needs, failure to provide access to appropriate health, social care or educational services, the withholding of the necessities of life, such as medication, adequate nutrition and heating.
Discriminatory abuse, including ageism, racism, sexism, that based on a person’s disability, and other forms of harassment, slurs or similar treatment.
How often does this occur? That is difficult to assess due to underreporting. Some examples from the report Elder abuse: how well does the law in Queensland cope? will provide some insight:
Feelings of shame when abuse has occurred. For example, this may occur when a son or daughter has been physically violent to an older parent to coerce money from them.
Fear of inciting further violence, or of being punished or abandoned.
The consequences of reporting may be undesirable. If the violence of an adult child to an older parent occurs in the context of the parent residing with the adult child, then the parent may be concerned that reporting will lead to placement in residential aged care. The parent may have complicated feelings about implicating the perpetrator particularly if the person is their spouse, adult child or carer.
Older persons may also not report abuse due to impaired capacity. They may not be able to recognise the behaviour as abuse or, even when they do, they may not be able to articulate or even understand how to report the abuse.
As can be seen, getting an accurate estimate is difficult. This is further complicated by the array of definitions that are used in various jurisdictions to describe elder abuse. The World Health Organisation estimates the number of older people who are abused to be between one per cent and 10 per cent of the population aged over 65. Estimates vary substantially between countries. For example, in Japan it is quite low while in India and China it is quite high. Two studies in Canada gave varying results: six to 18 per cent of over 65s. The Republic of Ireland, who have endeavoured to be more systematic in the collection of this data, suggest that it is about five per cent of the older population. However, this figure excludes incidence of self-neglect. Estimates in Australia suggest between three per cent and seven per cent, although two studies conducted by Monash University which looked particularly at financial abuse indicated that rate of abuse may be much higher. As far back as 1996, a study in New South Wales suggested the average cost of elder financial abuse was $311 per week per person. That is $300 million per year.
Two years of data from Ireland suggest that psychological abuse is the most common form, closely followed by financial abuse. Calls to the Queensland Elder Abuse Prevention Unit—EAPU—hotline between 2006 and 2007 report that 38 per cent of complaints were about psychological abuse and 38 per cent were about financial abuse. However, 38 per cent of calls also reported multiple forms of abuse. This is consistent with other international reports. These are alarming statistics.
During this period of time, the cost of elder abuse to Queensland hospitals was between $9.9 million and $30.7 million. And who is abusing these older people? A very large percentage, between 60 per cent and 80 per cent, depending on the study, are family members or close friends—people with whom the victim has a close relationship. The Monash studies suggest that the most frequent abusers are sons, closely followed by daughters, guardians, spouses, carers, neighbours and significant others. Women are twice as likely to be abused as men, but the abusers are only marginally more frequently male.
Commenting on the recent report by the Queensland Law Society and the Office of the Queensland Public Advocate, Lindsay Irons said:
… the cost to the community is increasing, and in our report we quote figures that very conservative estimates here in Queensland put the financial cost at around $14 million or so, however because it’s very hard to detect and accurately measure research, the more accurate figures are probably in the order of between $1 billion and $5 billion, the cost of financial abuse.
Financial abuse is especially significant for older people, because the opportunity to recover from this assault is negligible.
In summary, elder abuse is an enormous problem. This is only a very limited indication of its scope and gravity. It so serious that I believe it is worthy of investigation by the Senate. Disability support organisations around the world have lobbied opposing euthanasia. Why? Because they see the huge risk that this legislation poses to any disadvantaged group.
In 1995 the Canadian Special Senate Committee on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide wrote:
… legalization could result in abuses, especially with respect to the most vulnerable members of society. The ill and the frail are particularly dependent on those around them and on the health care system. Inevitably, and often without realizing it, these individuals cede control over their lives to the system and to those on whom they are dependent. For this reason, it would be difficult for others to assess whether an informed choice was made without coercion. If assisted suicide were legalized and accepted by the community, how could the expectations of the people surrounding the patient not influence his or her decision, particularly if the patient feels she or he is a burden on the family.
                …            …            …
… some would feel pressured to resort to assisted suicide where financial and institutional resources are scarce. Financial restraints that affect the health care infrastructure could also result in attempts, perhaps unconsciously, to influence patients to die more quickly and conveniently. All of the above factors could make it difficult to establish whether a request for assisted suicide is voluntary.
I intend to give a few examples of events that clearly present this dilemma—that it is not possible to legislate to prevent even ‘narrow’ intentions of euthanasia legislation to be abused. These are classic examples but they are not isolated; the reverse is true—they reflect frequent and widespread examples of what is really happening.
The first example relates to a man of Dutch heritage, a veteran of World War II, who gave his only relative, a niece, his enduring power of attorney. He subsequently developed cognitive impairment. He was admitted to a hostel as a concessional resident, partly on the basis of her statutory declaration. Later, the hostel built a sun room. The man liked to sit there. The hostel manager asked the niece to buy him a hat and gloves. She declined as she said he had no money—even though she had retained the balance of his pension after 80 per cent was paid to the hostel. It transpired that she had sold his properties, bought four penthouses, cashed in his superannuation and sold his car. She had realised $7 million.
The Oregon ‘death with dignity’ law and other similar acts claim to provide safeguards. Kate Cheney, age 85, was refused lethal prescription by her physician as he thought the request for assisted suicide was not Ms Cheney’s free choice but resulted from pressure by her assertive daughter who felt burdened with care giving. The family found another doctor to prescribe the lethal drugs and Ms Cheney died. This was reported in the Oregonian.
The Oregon legislation requires alternatives to assisted suicide to be discussed; however, there is no requirement that these alternatives be made available. Further, the ‘good faith’ provisions of this and other laws render all safeguards effectively unenforceable.
Barbara Wagner, an Oregon resident and recipient of Medicaid, was diagnosed with recurring lung cancer. Her physician prescribed Tarceva—a drug that increases the chance of survival by 30 per cent and increases the chance of survival after one year by 45 per cent. The letter she received from Medicaid denied funding for this chemotherapy but indicated that Medicaid would be prepared to fund doctor assisted suicide. This funding denial was based upon the Medicaid ruling that care which did not provide a greater than five per cent chance of a five-year survival would not be supported.
In 2009, H Rex Greene, former Medical Director of the Dorothy E Schneider Cancer Centre in California described this as:
… an extreme measure that would exclude most treatments for cancers such as lung, stomach, esophagus, and pancreas. Many important non-curative treatments would fail the five-percent/five-year criteria.
As Diane Coleman of disability support organisation Not Yet Dead wrote:
… is society really ready to ignore the risks, tolerate the abuses, marginalize or cover up the mistakes, and implicitly agree that some lives—many lives—are expendable …
Meanwhile, back in the Netherlands, in February 2010 a citizens’ initiative called Out of Free Will demanded that:

All Dutch people over 70 who feel tired of life should have the right to professional help in ending it …

A friend of mine, somewhat inappropriately, insists on talking about cars manufactured in a particular country as ‘throw-away cars’; is life becoming another disposable entity? I surely hope not.
Euthanasia and elder abuse are interlinked. We need to engage in conversations in our communities about these issues before any decisions are made. I would also like to add one of my own personal experiences. An 82-year-old woman who needed emergency surgery was presented to a health system under pressure because of lack of funding. The doctors had to weigh up whether or not the investment in that surgery was worthwhile, taking into account the patient’s age and health—the risks were 40 per cent in favour of survival. A second opinion was sought and the patient was lucky enough to find another doctor prepared to give her the opportunity to have the surgery. That woman is still alive now—two years on.
What will happen if we have voluntary euthanasia legislation in this country? What pressures will be put on that family and that individual? These are the sorts of issues that you cannot legislate on. I see euthanasia and elder abuse as being intertwined and I would encourage and urge those in this place and those in the community to think long and hard about the emphasis that we place on our elderly. We should think about the lack of respect that we are showing older Australians by allowing elder abuse to continue in our community.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-11-17,"—My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, and I will go through it slowly so he can find his brief. Does the minister recall, when announcing the government’s Review of the National Innovation System by an expert panel in January 2008, saying:
… to fulfil our potential we must embrace innovation.
Does he also recall saying that the panel chair, CSIRO director Dr Terry Cutler, is:
… a highly regarded expert on innovation and industry policy.
Further, does he also recall saying on releasing an innovation review paper in September 2008—that is over two years ago:

Can the minister now tell me how he responds to Dr Cutler’s scathing assessment that a ‘dismal silence’ now surrounds the Gillard government’s approach and ‘dust accumulates’ on his review report; that ‘good policy design has remained more observed in the preaching than the practice’; that the government’s attitude to R&D policy resembles ‘disembodied theory’— (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I do recall saying those things, and I also recall that the government brought down a white paper entitled Powering ideas: an innovation agenda for the 21st century, which outlined the largest increase in expenditure in science and research on record. I recall that we brought down a program of measures which actually made up for the extraordinary neglect that we had seen under the Howard government in regard to innovation, science research and industry policy. Dr Cutler, along with a panel of experts, produced a report for us that was able to provide advice to us on a range of matters, including support for the research and development taxation credit, a measure which I understand is to be discussed in the House of Representatives if not today, very shortly. It is a measure which will produce results that will double the level of support for small business and increase by one-third the level of support for large business for research and development, a measure which the opposition is opposing. Like so many other parts of our innovation agenda, the opposition has opposed it because the opposition is essentially made up of people who do not want to support an innovative Australia and who do not want to support the substantive transformational change that is required if we are to bring forward this country, to ensure that we are to maintain living standards and to ensure that Australia remains at the top of the game rather than at the bottom. Our approach is essentially all about that—making sure that Australia is able to go to the top in terms of value adding rather than going to the bottom as occurred under the coalition’s policies.

It goes to the issue of the disembowelment of research and development in this country. The only people who are in the business of disembowelling research and development in this country are those in the coalition. It is the coalition that is opposing our research and development tax initiatives. It is the coalition that is opposing the measures we are taking to actually double the level of support for small and medium sized business in this country. It is the coalition that has rejected, sight unseen, legislation that would ensure that large businesses had increases of one-third in their support. It is the coalition that has not offered one constructive suggestion about how we can improve our innovation efforts in this country.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-11-17,"—This is an important and timely question. Just this week the Minister for Tourism, Mr Ferguson, officially opened the first-ever Tourism Directions Conference here in Parliament House. As minister assisting I also released at the conference the first state of the industry report. There are many positive indicators in the report at what I would have to acknowledge is a difficult time with challenges for the tourism industry. In the face of the global recession, where we saw global international tourism drop by approximately four per cent, the total number of visitors to Australia in 2009 remained unchanged at 5.6 million visitors spending some $23 billion. Tourism contributes some $33 billion to the Australian gross domestic product. It directly employs half a million people. It is Australia’s largest service export industry, representing eight per cent of Australian exports. Forty-six cents in the dollar of tourism is spent in regional Australia, so it is very important from a regional perspective and also for small business. Small businesses make up some 90 per cent of the tourism sector.
In the context of regional benefits, a further benefit is that many overseas visitors commonly known as backpackers fill gaps in the employment market that would otherwise be hard to fill in our low-unemployment environment. They extend their stay in regional Australia and work in industries such as fruit picking and meat processing. What is not commonly known is that backpackers are amongst the higher per capita spenders of the visitors who come to Australia. They spend some $5,753 each, so the money that they earn in our economy is returned to the economy. (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-11-17,"—Yes. I have referred to challenges. There is no doubt there have been major shifts in the global tourism marketplace—for example, the stronger Australian dollar, the growth in aviation capacity and the operation of new, low-cost opportunities. That is increasing Australians travelling overseas. So there is fierce competition. This will only intensify, but there are some positive signs of recovery in inbound travel and in domestic tourism. In the first nine months of this year international visitor arrivals were six per cent higher than in the corresponding period in 2009, and in the first half of this year there has been a recovery in domestic tourism. I understand Terri, Bindi and Robert Irwin from the Australia Zoo in Queensland are in the Senate gallery today, and I would like to welcome them.

The agenda is set out in the national long-term tourism strategy work program. In very brief summary it focuses on reforms to improve productivity, remove unnecessary or duplicated regulation, assist in labour force planning in the sector, encourage investment in areas such as hotels-motels and conference centres and lift general quality standards. We are also encouraging Australians to holiday at home with the No Leave, No Life campaign, which aims to get workers to use their leave and take a short break in Australia. As I am sure everyone is aware, Tourism Australia has successfully secured a visit by Oprah Winfrey, which will include the filming of at least two of her episodes in Australia.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-11-17,"—Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate an answer to a question asked by Senator Milne yesterday on Tuesday, 16 November 2010 in relation to her question to me for the Minister for Health and Ageing.
Leave granted.

The document read as follows—


1. Given the climate change and the ever increasing movement of people, animals and


goods around the world which is increasing the risk of outbreaks of diseases in both human and animal populations, everything from hendra virus to swine flu. Does the government intend to maintain national disease intelligence capacity and Australia’s ability to respond quickly and effectively across state boundaries to contain such


outbreaks.


2. Supplementary question 1:


Why has the government decided not to renew the federal finding for the ANU Master of Applied Epidemiology program, which is in the absence of a national centre for disease control, Australia’s only frontline flying squad of Doctors, Vets and


Nurses to protect Australia’s people and Animal populations from epidemics from communicable infectious diseases.


3. Supplementary question 2:


Could the Minister please explain to the senate why a termination of this funding has occurred and was this the Governments deliberate intent to remove the funding or an unintended consequence of the Governments decision to terminate the public health education and research program and will the Minister come back and tell the senate whether the government has found alternate funding of the ANU program which has been so successful in stemming the spread in Australia of about 200 epidemic time expired.


SENATOR LUDWIG—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:


1. Yes. The Australian Government maintains capacity through bodies including the


Australian Health Protection Committee, the Public Health Laboratory Network and the Communicable Disease Networks Australia to work with the States and Territories to ensure early detection and appropriate management of communicable disease threats.


2. While it is acknowledged that the ANU Program has made an important contribution


to building capacity in epidemiology and public health, the Master of Applied


 
Epidemiology course is only one of a number of courses that provide trained staff to work in disease surveillance as referred to in the answer to question 1 and elsewhere. Students will continue to be able to access this and related University Master courses through the usual funding mechanisms that include sponsorship from their employers. It is not part of Australia’s front-line disease surveillance and control infrastructure.


3. Public health education, research and training in Australia now has an international


profile and Australia has a strong leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region. Public health is marketed overseas and is attracting students and funds from the region and elsewhere.


Australian institutions are now in a position to seek funding within the normal competitive tertiary education environment and the special subsidy for masters of public health courses is no longer justified. 22 training positions funded by the Commonwealth in 2011 will go to trainees in public health medicine


This Government also continues to support training of public health physicians as part of its specialist training program that will increase by another 400 totaling 900 specialist training places by 2014.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2010-11-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Taking note without a particular theme is always fun for senators, but governing without a theme is not a good thing for the country. This is a government without a theme, without a rationale, except of course for political survival. Whatever you think of Labor, you could always say in the past that they were passionate and committed. You cannot argue that any more. Some of my friends sitting down here today argue that Labor’s greatest failure is their incompetence and they always point to things like turning a $20 billion surplus into a $50 billion debt within a year. They think that is pretty incompetent. My friend Senator Joyce said earlier today in his contribution that continuing to borrow $100 million a day is pretty incompetent as well.
I have often argued in this place that the Building the Education Revolution was an absolute and utter shambles. It was a shambles because the Commonwealth did not have sufficient oversight mechanisms to ensure that state governments were spending Commonwealth taxpayers’ money appropriately. That is the argument that sticks in the opposition’s craw. It is a failure by the government to ensure that money is well spent by state governments, and what happened as a result of that? School halls built by state governments cost much more than they should have. That is also incompetent.
We know about pink batts as well. We know there were deaths and electrified roofs, and a massive and expensive clean-up campaign. That was also a shambles, and that has been Labor’s answer to the global financial crisis: pink batts and building school halls. If only President Obama had known it was that simple! But, as you know, Mr Deputy President, I am generous: Labor’s failings are not just their incompetence; Labor’s failings are that they do not have an agenda. When Senator Fifield asked Senator Evans yesterday about Labor’s agenda, Senator Evans, for all his great skill at answering questions, did not have an answer.
The government limps from week to week looking for something to believe in. If the Greens do not provide the government with convictions then Labor cannot find them. It is now the Greens providing the Labor Party with conviction. Labor can no longer claim to be the party of conviction. We have heard Senator Faulkner, one of the respected elders of the Australian Labor Party, in the last few weeks say the ALP is long on cunning but short on courage. Doesn’t that summarise where the Australian Labor Party today is in government? Senator Cameron, whose contributions I always enjoy, said that the Labor caucus is full of zombies who do not believe in anything anymore. They used to but they do not now, except for political survival.
The great salvation apparently is the NBN. Senator Conroy is going to save the government with the NBN. The NBN is going to be the saving grace of the Australian Labor Party. But even Senator Conroy does not believe that the NBN is good value for money, that it would pass the cost-benefit analysis. Senator Conroy does not even believe that because he tells the independent members of this place that it would not pass that test, let alone what the OECD says. So the bottom line is: the Labor Party virtually have nothing left. They believe in nothing, and if you think for a second that the BER was a shambles—and the world now knows that—just think of what is going to happen to the NBN over the next 18 months to three years. It will be failure on steroids.
I know the clock ticks down and Christmas awaits us. Santa Claus will hopefully give a president—sorry, a present—and that might be an agenda for our nation’s future.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2010-11-17,"—Santa will bring a present, Senator Mason, and it will not be a president; it will be a prime minister and it will be Prime Minister Julia Gillard. That will be the present we give to the Australian people. I am not sure where Senator Mason has been for the last two years, because his description of the things that the Gillard government did to ensure that this country avoided the greatest recession, potentially the greatest depression since the Great Depression—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—Order! Senator Cormann, Senator Farrell will be heard.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I always appreciate your protection for a fellow South Australian. Senator Mason, I do not know where you have been for the last two years, because this country, thanks to programs like the one that you are criticising, the BER—the sorts of programs that this government introduced—Australia avoided the great recession. Some people call it a depression. Look overseas at countries like the United States, which has 10 per cent unemployment. Yesterday I was talking to an official in the water industry of Spain. He tells me that in his country there is 20 per cent unemployment. You go through countries in Europe. What is the situation in Australia? We are now the envy of the OECD countries because this government, with programs like the BER, enabled Australians to remain in jobs. Because they remained in jobs, they continued—
—You don’t believe that, Don.
—I do believe it, Senator Mason. I believe it because it is true. You try and explain, if you are such an economic genius—
—I’m not. I don’t claim to be.
—If you are so good on economics, Senator Mason, how come you made a $10 billion mistake in your costings at the last election?
—No, he didn’t. You’re just fiddling.
—Hockey did. Yes, okay. I am sorry; I withdraw that, Mr Deputy President. It was Mr Hockey who made that mistake—the bloke that you are putting up as—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Mason was heard in silence, and I think Senator Farrell should be given a fair go as well.
—Would you like my speech notes, Don?
—I do not need your speaking notes, Senator Bernardi, because I imagine they will say exactly the same things that Senator Mason said and they will be just as wrong as the things Senator Mason said. I would like to talk some more about your economic credentials, but there was one issue that was raised during question time that I would like to refer to, because you have failed to be specific in respect of the taking of note. That is the role of Minister Burke. I had the privilege of being the parliamentary secretary to a large section of Minister Burke’s portfolio. I tell you this bloke works nonstop day and night, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He is going to all of the places where Australians want to see him. He recently came down to Renmark with me. We had a fantastic meeting with irrigators. In fact, even some of your Liberal Party colleagues attended, Mr Deputy President. Patrick Secker came along, as did Tim Whetstone, the new member for Chaffey. He was there, and we had a great meeting with irrigators. The reason that we had a great meeting with irrigators was that, unlike for the whole period of the Howard government, when you took no notice of the problems in the Murray, Minister Burke is concerned about it and he has a plan and a solution.
—After the event.
—No, this is not after the event, Senator Fisher. We want healthy rivers, strong communities and strong food production. That is what Minister Burke is all about, and he is going around the country. Renmark was not the only place he went to. He came down with me and we flew over to see the water coming through the Murray mouth. It was a fantastic scene. We went down to Hindmarsh Island. We also went down to Milang. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-11-17,"—We have just seen Senator Farrell struggle through his five minutes because, as Senator Mason said, the government does not have policy, does not have a plan and does not have direction. That is clearly demonstrated by Senator Ludwig’s answers to my questions today. I asked him three very simple questions: when is he going to announce the funding package for Tasmania’s forest contractors, which is absolutely desperately and urgently needed; will it be subject to GST and company tax; and will it have administration fees taken out of the $20 million—in other words, will it be whittled back? My understanding from conversations that I have had with industry is that the minister promised that this would be announced by the end of this week. I gave him the opportunity to clearly state that today. He hid behind the excuse that he did not want to reveal details of the package. I accept that he does not have to tell us how the money will be spent on the contractors themselves, but he could tell them whether $10 million will be gouged out for GST, whether they will be subject to tax on the money that they receive and whether the administration costs for that program will be deducted from the $20 million. He could quite easily have said that and put that on the table right now.
As Senator Mason said, there is an absolutely complete and utter policy failure here, because the Labor Party did not even issue an agriculture policy for this election. Senator Farrell has talked about how wonderful Mr Burke is. He was so lazy in his policy before the last election that he did not even release a policy. In fact, the Labor Party’s policy in respect of forestry was—I read the heading from the media release of 19 August—’Labor matches Coalition forestry commitment’. That was the Labor Party policy for forestry at the last election. So, when we talk about Minister Burke and how wonderful he might be, he was so lazy that he did not even release a policy at the last election.
Senator Boswell asked questions this afternoon in relation to marine parks. It would be interesting to know—given that Senator Conroy said the environment department were working very hard and Senator Farrell said that Minister Burke works day and night 24 hours a day—why the meetings with the Commonwealth Fisheries Association programmed for this afternoon on the issue of marine parks were cancelled. One of the representatives of the Commonwealth Fisheries Association, who was in my office this afternoon, said: ‘This is the reason: we’ve got nothing to say. We have nothing to tell you.’ This is yet another example of what Senator Mason has said: there is no policy and no plan.
The reason the government are struggling with the $20 million for forest contractors is that they did not do the policy work before the election. They are struggling through it now. Even the Tasmanian Premier said on 10 November:
I am disappointed that it hasn’t happened as rapidly as it should have.
He is quite famous in Tasmania for being slow to get things done, and even the slow Tasmanian Premier believes that this is taking longer than it should. It is a complete and utter policy failure on behalf of the government.
In respect of marine parks, we have been following this process for quite some considerable time. We want to know what the program is and we want to know what the displaced effort policy is, which was the issue which the Commonwealth Fisheries Association was supposed to meet the department about this afternoon. The responses from the department and from the government were, ‘We have got nothing to tell you’. There is complete and utter policy failure on behalf of the government, and now we are in a situation of policy paralysis. A minister cannot even confirm his commitment to an industry association in Tasmania that a policy will be launched this week. It was a very simple question. All he had to do was say, ‘Yes, I made that commitment to the industry and, yes, I am going to follow it through,’ but the government cannot even do that.
And yet again we saw Senator Conroy in response to a question today from another senator about the antisiphoning legislation and proposals. He did not even turn up to the free TV drinks last night—he did not even front. So not only can they not make policy or deliver policy; they will not front up. I spoke to a number of representatives of the industry last night who were very anxious to talk to the minister. They just wanted to put their views to him; they did not necessarily want to harangue, but he would not even front up. This is a demonstration, as Senator Mason said at the outset, of the complete and utter policy failure and paralysis of this government. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-11-17,"—It is actually quite disappointing to see that Senator Colbeck has joined the ranks of other Liberal senators and, indeed, his own leader in continually criticising, blocking and going out there and scaring the community. I think that, as Senator Colbeck would know—
—Senator Colbeck knows a good government when he sees one!
—Excuse me, I listened to Senator Colbeck in silence. I know Senator Cormann does have problems controlling himself, but I would appreciate it if he would—
—I know a bad government when I see one too.
—As I was saying, the Gillard government recognises that native forest harvesting and haulage contractors in my home state of Tasmania are facing severe financial difficulties following a downturn in demand for hardwood woodchips sourced from native forests. We will meet our commitment to provide $20 million, as the minister has said in his answer to Senator Colbeck. We will meet the commitment to provide help to forest contractors and their employees to meet the challenges facing the native forest sector in Tasmania.
The details of the package will be announced shortly, as the minister has said, and it will involve both business assistance and exit assistance and will be designed to increase viability in the sector. As Minister Ludwig also mentioned in his response to Senator Colbeck, he visited Tasmania in his first week of receiving the forestry portfolio. He went down to Tasmania in September to consult with the Tasmanian forestry contractors and other key stakeholders, including the state government, environment and industry associations and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. Since then, the federal and state departments have been working with the Tasmanian government officials, contractors associations and the relevant union, the CFMEU, to develop a $20 million package of support for the Tasmanian forest contractors and their workers. As I have said, this package will include exit assistance and business assistance.
It is a shame that, in his role as the shadow parliamentary secretary, Senator Colbeck has been playing politics with people’s livelihoods and playing on the fears of the sector for the opposition’s own political advantage. The opposition keep talking down the package the government is delivering, when during the election they promised the exact same thing. The opposition must stand up and take responsibility for their comments and stop talking down the contracting sector. The tide of negativity from the opposition only serves to sap confidence in an industry that is already struggling. I ask Senator Colbeck to support the government’s package and to stop talking down the industry.
I also want to take this opportunity to put on record that the Gillard government supports a sustainable and profitable forest industry. We value both the ecological and economic aspects of our native forest resources and believe that there needs to be a balanced and sustainable approach to native forest management. We welcome the landmark agreement between environmental NGOs and the forestry industry in Tasmania on the future of the state’s native forests. I know that many people have worked very hard to get this agreement to this stage. This is a sign of a level of cooperation between the industry and environmental movements that we have not seen in the past.
In the time remaining to me I would like to restate the government’s commitment to supporting regional jobs, to encouraging sustainable investment in forestry and to helping our forest industries prepare for future challenges. That is why we are committed to delivering the $20 million package to the contracting sector which we promised during the election and which the minister confirmed in his answer, once again, in question time today.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-11-17,"—There is an embarrassment of riches with which we can dissect this fragile and, one would say, feckless government. I should start by taking to task Senator Carol Brown for maintaining there was coalition disinterest in and lack of support for the forestry commitment that the Labor Party made. Senator Brown probably does not spend a lot of time reading, but I am reading from a Labor press release here entitled ‘Labor matches Coalition forestry commitment’. That part of matching the coalition’s idea and policy has been lost on Senator Carol Brown as she has been defending Labor’s policy. It is the only policy she can defend, because Labor had to copy ours to get a decent policy. There is no doubt about this: this is a government that is absolutely feckless. It is, as Senator Faulkner, the wise old man of the Labor Party—he is not that old actually; I will take that back, but he is a wise, well-respected man—said: Labor are long on cunning and short on courage. Often I disagree with Senator Faulkner, but I think this sentiment is right.
But Senator Faulkner clearly has not learned the Labor version of courage. The South Australian state Treasurer, Kevin Foley, claimed in the parliament that the opposition did not have Labor’s courage to break their promises. How pathetic is that? You have a South Australian Treasurer boasting that he is courageous enough to break his promises. And, sure enough, clearly that model has been translated into the federal parliament, because this government claim they are keeping their promises and yet they are breaking them again and again. Do you remember the shrill claims by Senator Wong and Prime Minister Gillard about how they would implement every part of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority plan that was to be released? They have walked away from that commitment now even though they signed up to it blindly. They signed up to it not knowing what was in it and yet they made these election promises to the Australian people. Do you remember their promise not to have a carbon tax? Of course you do, because that was in every media statement for weeks on end during the election campaign: we will not be putting a price on carbon. What have they done? They have had to get the spine of the Greens to make them implement a carbon tax, which is now back on the agenda.
What about Senator Conroy today? He makes claims all the time about the broadband plan, when we know perfectly well what the costs of it are going to be. We know it is going to be $43 billion but we do not know what the actual benefits of it are going to be or whether it will be worth the price paid. Senator Conroy does not even know that. He talks all the time about how it has been rolled out in Willunga and the people of Willunga are very happy. I have to tell you, I was speaking to someone from Willunga at five minutes to two, before question time today, who said that they and all their friends have not heard anything about this broadband; it is certainly not connected to their place and they live right in the township of Willunga. So one has to ask: what reckoning is Senator Conroy on? This is another example of what this government is focused on; it is delusion on a grand scale.
It is a government that is like the walking dead. And who has said that but one of their own. He is one of the most entertaining senators in this place, I have to say, but it was humiliating for the Labor Party when Senator Cameron said that this government is full of zombies. It is full of deadheads, and we know it is full of desperadoes because they are desperate to cling to power at any price. We know that. If Labor were a beverage, they would not even be the liquid in the glass; they would be froth at the top. They are the froth—
—They are the dregs on the bottom.
—They could be the dregs on the bottom, indeed, but they are froth on the top of what is now a green beer. We know that this Green menace that is launching into us—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It is torture! This Green menace is now controlling the agenda of the Labor Party. This is an alliance that is so concerned about important issues for Australia, such as borrowing $100 million a day, the reckless and feckless rollout and the waste of government money, that the very first items that they have brought on their lacklustre legislative agenda are about euthanasia, about gay marriage—about things that the Australian people are not consumed with. They are desperate about how they can reduce the cost of living and how they can fight against the interest rate rises that have been foisted upon this country by the reckless and imprudent spending of the Labor Party.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-17,"—I am going to take note of only one of the answers, and that is about the issue of SIHIP and the Aboriginal employment program. I am very concerned and want to clarify the employment and working conditions for Aboriginal workers employed under SIHIP. We want to know under what conditions participants in CDEP, traineeships or Work for the Dole programs are being employed. We have received some very disturbing reports from communities in Central Australia of inconsistent and in fact exploitative treatment of Aboriginal workers. This, surely, should not be happening in what is supposed to be one of our premier infrastructure programs in this country.
The minister proudly proclaimed the meeting of a 30 per cent target of Indigenous or Aboriginal employees. But under what conditions is that 30 per cent target being met, and how many of those are real jobs? We have heard allegations of Aboriginal workers on CDEP or on income management being promised top-up pay that they did not receive or did not fully receive. There are allegations of inconsistent and diminishing rates of top-up pay for workers, so that workers continuously employed to do the same work for the same number of hours a day receive less pay in subsequent pay packets. We have heard allegations of a failure to provide pay slips, employment contracts or other documentation to Aboriginal workers. We have heard allegations of a failure to report on employment outcomes to JSA providers and minimal training for extended periods of work—for example, one day for three or four months of full-time work, and they are still supposed to be trainees.
We have heard of Aboriginal contractors being asked to include CDEP places to reduce costs and receiving less work when they refuse to do so. We have heard of Aboriginal contracting organisations who are fully able to employ full-time people in real jobs being told, ‘No, we want you to do CDEP,’ and when they refuse because they are committed to real job outcomes, they do not receive the work and are cut out of the work. We have heard of different workers doing the same work side-by-side but receiving vastly different pay. We have heard of oversubscription of CDEP workers for the amount of work required. For example, there will be 15 or 20 employees on CDEP work where you would normally have five or six full-time workers—in other words, the figures are being skewed, and maybe that is where some of that 30 per cent so proudly boasted of as being over target comes from. We are concerned that if some or in fact all of these allegations are true, they are undermining the positive employment outcomes that could be achieved by the significant opportunity provided by SIHIP.
Minister Arbib, in answer to my questions around CDEP, claimed that part of the rationale for employing CDEP people under the SIHIP program was to provide long-term training to help aboriginal people get into real jobs. As I have said, the reports coming from Central Australia are that a single day’s training is provided before somebody works full time for three or four months on the job without any further training. I fail to see how this is justifying employing people on CDEP under so-called training when they are not receiving any training. That could be about cheap outcomes for the employer. By any account, we believe that that is in fact real work they are doing. It is not trainee work. These are real jobs and they should be paid as real jobs.
One of the other issues here, of course, is that the people who are working on these jobs are still being income quarantined. Here you have Aboriginal people who are supposedly in real jobs, but they are still getting income quarantined. What is that all about? How is that teaching people to get a job? It was supposed to be about encouraging people into employment; that is about still demonising people and the government having its cake and eating it too. They changed CDEP in the first place so they could income manage people’s work for the dole payments. Now you have people supposedly working full time in real jobs and still getting income managed. It is no wonder Aboriginal people get so discouraged when again they see the promise of real jobs disappearing for more CDEP training, more exploitation, people not getting paid for the work they do and working alongside people who are getting paid full, proper wages. They are working alongside people doing the same work and not getting those wages. That is not fair.
I appreciate the government undertaking to investigate that. It needs to be investigated immediately. I would hope that they have already started investigating it, seeing as these claims came out last week. I hope that the government would have instantly started investigating it. I am disappointed that the minister could not tell us how much of the 30 per cent of jobs that were supposed to have been for Aboriginal employment were full time. How many of those were real jobs? The government has told us time and time again that they are creating real jobs, but the minister could not tell me how many out of that 30 per cent were real jobs. That is unacceptable.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the International Financial Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the Bill

The purpose of this Bill is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act (IMA) 1947 to authorise the subscription by Australia to additional shares in the capital stock at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The purpose of the Bill is also to amend the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Act 1955 to allow Australia to adopt a proposed amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and to amend the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Act 1997 to adopt four amendments to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MICA) Convention which have been recently adopted by the MICA Council of Governors.
The IMA Act 1947 established Australia’s membership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the IBRD (part of the World Bank Group) and makes provisions which allow Australia to meet obligations that may arise by virtue of our membership of these institutions. The proposed amendments to the IMA Act 1947 will authorise the subscription by Australia to additional shares in the capital stock at the IBRD.
The IFC Act 1955 and the MICA Act 1997 established Australia’s membership of the IFC and MICA respectively and makes provisions which allow Australia to meet obligations that may arise by virtue of our membership of these institutions. The proposed amendments do not alter these provisions and therefore introduce no substantive changes to Australia’s obligations to the IFC or MIGA.
The proposed amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the IFC aims to improve the voice and participation of developing and transition economies in the World Bank by increasing their basic votes, implementing the 020 commitment. This will increase the effectiveness and legitimacy of the World Bank as the leading global development institution and enhance the influence that developing and transition countries have over governance, policies and decision making in the World Bank. The proposed voice reform also allows shareholders to achieve voting power adjustments in both the IBRD and the IFC, taking into account different levels of shareholder interest in and support for the different institutions.
The four amendments to the MIGA Convention recently adopted by MIGA’s Council of Governors will modernise MIGA’ s mandate and expand the Agency’s scope, allowing a greater range of projects to be eligible for MIGA coverage. The amendments will permit the Agency to: provide coverage for stand-alone debt; broaden the process for investor registration; broaden the scope for coverage for existing assets; and eliminate the requirement of a joint application by the investor
and the host country to authorise coverage for specific additional non-commercial risks. The amendments do not alter the Agency’s core mandate but are aimed at reducing transaction costs and enabling MICA to insure political risk for projects based on actuarial qualities rather than excluding projects with particular financing structures.
The Treasurer, as Australia’s Governor to the World Bank, is required to vote on any proposed changes to the IFC Articles of Agreement or the MICA Convention. Under Treaty obligations, IFC and MICA members are bound by amendments to the Articles of Agreement and Convention respectively when they enter into force. Any amendment to either institution constitutes a variation in Australia’s treaty obligations and will therefore be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.

Reasons for Urgency

Timely passage of the legislation is necessary for Australia to meet the G20 Pittsburgh and Toronto Summit commitments of ensuring that international financial institutions have appropriate capital for their resourcing needs, ensuring developing countries increase their voting power and modernising the World Bank. It is important that Australia demonstrates its commitment to the G20 agenda by ensuring prompt implementation of these reforms.
Australia’s subscription to the capital increase, whilst not impacting the Budget, will enable the IBRD to provide the lending levels necessary to assist developing countries in their post-crisis recovery whilst maintaining appropriate prudential standards. This additional lending will help developing and transition countries with the finance needed to assist their recovery from the global financial crisis.
Australia, through the G20, has committed to: ensuring that international financial institutions have appropriate capital for their resourcing needs; enhancing developing countries’ voice and influence in these institutions, including through increases in their voting power; and modernising the international financial institutions to foster sustainable development and poverty reduction. Early subscription of capital stock and passage of amendments to increase the voting power of developing countries in the IFC, and amendments to modernise the MICA Convention will demonstrate Australia’s leadership in this important area.
Failure to subscribe to an increase in capital stock early would limit the IBRD’s ability to rebuild its balance sheet and restore lending commitments to pre-crisis levels. The inability of developing countries to increase global growth may significantly impact on the world’s ability to recover from the global financial crisis.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,13,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-11-17,"—I seek leave to make a short statement.
—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—This motion that I am moving today in my name on behalf of the Australian Greens and Senator Simon Birmingham is very simple, and I hope the government will seek leave to make a brief statement as well. In the joint agreement that was signed by the Australian Greens and the Prime Minister, some of the points of agreement were that we would collectively work towards transparent and accountable government and improved process and integrity of parliament. What we are seeing today is the Australian government refusing, if I am to believe the outcome of a press conference the Prime Minister held earlier, to hand over the business model and the business case for the National Broadband Network and to hand over the Australian government’s response to the National Broadband Network implementation study, which was conducted at a cost of $25 million to Australian taxpayers.
While this parliament is meeting this fortnight to discuss matters that are directly relevant to the rollout of the National Broadband Network, it is completely unacceptable for the Prime Minister to say: ‘You can have that document for Christmas. We’ll wait until you have all gone home, and we’ll put it into the public domain then once it has been hit with a black felt marker.’ That is like so much of what falls out of this government these days well after parliament has got up and it is no longer possible to debate it.
In the meantime we are taking a $43 billion project effectively on trust and we are simply being asked to accept the minister’s contention that this is a wonderful project and the numbers all stack up. It will be great to have seen it. It will be great when the public, the industry and the parliament can actually back those figures up by having seen them themselves. It is not acceptable to us that the Australian government would continue to defy these kinds of orders. As part of our agreement with the Prime Minister the Australian Greens will be seeking that the Information Commissioner should be able to resolve these disputes when the parliament and executive clash on matters like this. This is something that we will be bringing to a head now so that the minister cannot continue to defy an order of the Senate. (Time expired)

—I indicate my strong support for this motion. The government is alienating those supporters who believe in a National Broadband Network. It is ‘burning up goodwill’ to use a phrase that Senator Ludlam used earlier today. I find it extraordinary that these documents will not be made available. When we are dealing with a $43 billion piece of information infrastructure, to be asked to make decisions in an information vacuum is simply unacceptable. That is why it is important that this motion is supported by the Senate and that we get the information that the Australian people deserve.

It is just a long-term process for establishing a committee with no outcomes. If you cannot produce anything or even have a meeting before the reporting date, why should the Senate give you a period of extension, as has occurred?

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-11-17,"—I normally rise with some excitement to provide a contribution in the debates on matters of public importance—there are only a few moments of shabby pleasure we take in beating up the other side on their complete failure in most programs—but I have to say that today I rise with a feeling of not only disappointment but also some dismay at the extent of the incompetence and mismanagement of the programs more generally affecting our first Australians but particularly in the provision of housing and the SIHIP fiasco in the Northern Territory.
The standard and quantity of houses in Northern Territory communities has been raised in this place as a serious issues for many years. Inadequate housing supply means it is not uncommon for 15 to 20 people to share a dwelling in remote Territory communities, sometimes with non-functioning bathrooms and toilets—and all of the misery that goes with those sorts of circumstances. Many people now in fact choose to live outdoors under sheets of tin or tarpaulins because it is better to live in those conditions than in the sort of squalor that is associated with overcrowding.
Poor housing was raised as a significant factor contributing to child abuse and neglect in the Little children are sacred report released in 2007, and the Howard government decided it was imperative to take a greater role in providing housing in the Northern Territory. The previous government provided new funding of $514 million over four years on top of the existing budget to repair and build housing in remote Northern Territory communities. As I have said countless times in this place, this was an emergency response that was designed to provide immediate relief to our most vulnerable Australians.
When the coalition lost the election in 2007, it was with some relief that we found that Labor had decided to maintain the previous government’s commitment to housing, through the announcement of the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program, or SIHIP. On 12 April 2008, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, increased the commitment to $547 million over four years with an additional $100 million to be provided by the Northern Territory government. This $647 million, later increased to $672 million, was to provide: 750 new houses; 230 new houses that would replace houses earmarked for demolition; over 2,500 housing upgrades; essential infrastructure to support those new houses; and improvements to living conditions in those town camps. Work was due to begin in October 2008, meaning that, with the government’s four-year timetable, all work would be completed by the end of 2012.
Unfortunately, the Labor government have failed at every turn to deliver on their promise, which is a monumental tragedy and an insult to the people who continue to suffer in Third World living conditions. Instead of construction being underway by October 2008 the alliance partner has only just been announced and will still need time to commence work. In the meantime, consultations about design and housing requirements began with communities. The amount of time and money allocated to these consultations was unprecedented. The community of Maningrida, for example, received nine visits between March and June 2009, but construction was not scheduled to begin until mid-2010. Later it was revealed more than $45 million was spent on consultations, administration and other bureaucratic expenses before a single house slab was poured, a single nail driven or a single brick laid. The reality was that not a single house had been completed by February 2009, despite money having been available since 2007 as part of the Northern Territory Emergency Response.
In July 2009 it was revealed that New South Wales Labor Senator Ursula Stephens had written to Minister Macklin a year earlier, in 2008, warning that no houses would be built under the program until 2011. The government immediately denied that there were any problems with SIHIP other than delays in implementing such a large program. The cover-ups continued, with the Northern Territory minister responsible for the delivery of SIHIP reported in the media on 7 July 2009 as saying that the government had met every deadline for this project—an amazing statement given that it had already been conceded that the program start date had been delayed.
The same month, NT government ministers Anderson and Hampton received a briefing on the program’s status. Ms Anderson alleged that less than 30 per cent of the $672 million budget would actually be used to build and refurbish houses. The NT minister responsible, Rob Knight, described the claim as ‘ludicrous’—and, of course, we can all remember Minister Macklin claiming that the figure was ‘completely wrong’. Both ministers either had absolutely no idea of the status of the program or were deliberately misleading the public. This was confirmed when a review of the program was conducted. Facing growing dissent, the government announced a review of SIHIP on 24 July 2009.
On 17 August 2009, a week before the release of the SIHIP review, the NT minister answered a question in the NT parliament on SIHIP where he said: ‘So they are the facts; work is underway, it is on track, it is a five- year program, and every single house will be built, every refurbishment will be completed, and all those training positions will be filled.’ The next day, on 18 August 2009, SIHIP’s director, Jim Davidson, who gave a briefing to Alison Anderson revealing SIHIP mismanagement, was removed from his position. Free from the constraints of the position, Mr Davidson spoke to the ABC in Darwin. He revealed that the SIHIP budget was only enough to build 300 houses—substantially fewer than the 750 that were promised—meaning that the budget was likely to blow out to over $1 billion. How prophetic that turned out to be.
The government again denied those claims, but in November 2010 it boosted the program’s budget by $456.7 million to a total of $1.1 billion. On 31 August 2009 the review into SIHIP was released. The review found: the program was overly bureaucratic with six layers of oversight; $45.54 million had, in effect, been wasted on inappropriate consultation before construction had commenced; and the promised construction targets could not be met. This meant that, in order to meet construction targets, all vital infrastructure works, including water, sewerage, power and subdivisions would have to be cut from the program’s budget and funded from other sources. The review exposed that all the Labor government’s public assurances that SIHIP was on track, on budget and would deliver what was promised were, in fact, untrue. The government was either totally unaware of the status of its program or deliberately hiding the facts from Australians.
SIHIP had quietly increased to a five-year program—just by media release, of course—and, with a new budget, continued with the government stating that the program was again on track; however, the waste, mismanagement and poor standards continued. The standard of completed renovations was well short of expectations for even the reduced $75,000 budget. Renovations now only include repairs to electrical fittings, bathroom plumbing and fixtures, and supply of a new stainless steel bench instead of a proper kitchen. Houses are not even painted anymore. One house I inspected at Ali Curung after it had been renovated did not have a single cupboard or shelf in the kitchen. That meant there was nowhere to store food or put plates and saucepans, and there was not even a drawer to get cutlery off the floor.
In estimates in October this year, officials revealed that:
… in order to make the limited funding that we have go as far as possible and to make as many houses safe and functional as possible, that functional refurbishment will be the focus for the majority of them.
This statement indicates that the functional maintenance, or ‘fix-and-make-safe’ maintenance, is costing the full $75,000 per house—work that has been achieved in similar communities, which I have also inspected, by qualified tradesmen for around $25,000 per house. The government repeatedly refuses to provide a breakdown of what the alliance partners are paid, effectively hiding this from scrutiny. Worse still, in November 2010—this very month—the Territory opposition received a briefing on SIHIP from NT officials which indicated that even the target of 2,500 ‘fix-and-make-safe’ renovations could not be achieved due to funding constraints. Where has all the money gone? The government refuses to answer this most important question.
The next issue that must be explained relates to the program’s target of 750 new houses. Northern Territory government officials have revealed that 50 per cent of the houses will have two bedrooms or less, while 10 per cent will only have one bedroom. A stack of one- and two-bedroom boxes is not going to alleviate overcrowding, which is a key objective of SIHIP. One of the worst aspects of SIHIP is the extent of the government’s deception about the mismanagement of expenditure and the time frames of the program. In December 2009, a post-review assessment was commissioned by the Australian government to report against the SIHIP review recommendations. When that was released on 17 March 2009 it was accompanied by a media release that said:
… the changes and recommendations of the 2009 review have been implemented, and have put the program on track to achieve its targets of 750 new houses, 230 rebuilds and 2500 refurbishments …
That is complete rubbish.
What is obvious is that millions of dollars have been spent while Aboriginal people continue to live in overcrowded and substandard housing. The government started with hundreds of millions of dollars and the goodwill of Aboriginal people, and it has squandered both. It is time that a full, open and independent inquiry is instigated to stop the waste and mismanagement that has characterised this program. We can no longer tolerate the monumental incompetence and failure that Minister Macklin has demonstrated in her mismanagement of this program. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2010-11-17,"—There is no doubt that, since we came into government in 2007, the federal Labor government—under Kevin Rudd and now under Prime Minister Gillard—has been absolutely committed to closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. We have stated it time and time again. The actions that we have taken in supporting programs and various outcomes and outputs would show that. We are deeply committed to ensuring that the gap is closed and to addressing that in partnership with state and territory governments, and, critically, with Indigenous Australians at the nucleus of any change and any gap that is to be closed. They are the driving force behind anything we want to achieve.
Housing is absolutely essential to the Closing the Gap agenda. It is one of the seven key building blocks that have been agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, as being essential to this outcome. We all know the link between safe and healthy housing and broader life outcomes, such as health, education and employment, has been well established, and we know that getting housing right is critical to restoring positive social norms. Let me digress for a moment in terms of ‘getting housing right’. Getting housing right in an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory means that you consult with Indigenous members of that community. Therefore, each community has had a housing reference group established; each community has negotiated a leasing plan under which the houses can be built on the land that is leased; each community has gone through the process of identifying where they want the houses put; and each community has identified the nature and the type of housing they want. Does that happen overnight? No, it does not happen overnight. It was never meant to happen overnight. It was meant to ensure that Indigenous Territorians drive the outcomes by getting the kind of housing they want, where they want it and the conditions under which they want it. That has been the nucleus of the program that we have embarked upon.
In remote Australia, the state of housing provides the most visible evidence of the persistent failure of governments—I emphasise governments—to address Indigenous disadvantage. For this reason we have taken very strong action to improve the delivery of Indigenous housing in remote Australia. As a government we have committed the unprecedented amount of $5.5 billion over 10 years through the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing to improve housing and living conditions in remote Australia. In talking about living conditions, we also have to look at extension of infrastructure. We have to look at extension of electricity, water and sewerage and, in many cases, an upgrade of that. I think I have already spoken in this chamber of how, when 25 new houses were to be built on Groote Eylandt at Umbakumba, the first thing people realised was that the electricity grid would not accommodate that many houses. Were you going to get a new house overnight? No, you were not, because the first thing you had to do was upgrade the electricity grid that would sustain that extra output of electricity in that community.
People opposite who tend to want to criticise this, day after day and week after week, do not provide the general public or this chamber with the totality of the work and the commitment that is out there. This is the single largest outlay that any government has ever made on Indigenous housing, and we have set ambitious targets for the construction of new and upgraded housing across remote Australia. Perhaps the fault was that we did set the targets. We did actually get out there and set some outputs and some key performance indicators. The opposition would have you believe that we are not achieving those. I and my colleagues who speak after me will prove that we are not only achieving them but achieving them beyond the target. Of course, if some targets had not been set, people on the other side would be jumping up like rabbits out of a burrow saying, ‘How many houses did you expect to build for that?’ or, ‘How many refurbishments did you expect for that?’ Of course, we have set targets—we have been ambitious: we have set KPIs—and we are now driving the agenda to meet those.
The Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program delivered through the national partnership agreement is the largest ever investment undertaken by the federal government and the Northern Territory government in Indigenous housing. Under SIHIP, housing and related infrastructure—and I really want to emphasise ‘related infrastructure’, because it goes hand in hand with any new or refurbished houses—will be improved in 73 remote communities and a number of town camps. Better housing, as we all know, is the cornerstone of healthy, sustainable communities. Yes, there were problems and concerns in the early days of SIHIP—and do you know what? As a government, we had the courage to actually admit that and have a look at what those problems were. The problems emanated from a model and an agreement that was designed under a previous federal government—one minister being Mr Mal Brough. That was a design model and an implementation model that the former federal government signed off with the Northern Territory government. When we got into government, there were problems. We have managed to review that, conduct research, have a look at where the problems were, and work with and iron out those problems along the way.
The transition to an entirely new model of delivering housing, including the introduction of new governance arrangements and a new large-scale procure model, was a major reform. SIHIP is much more than a construction project. It is a strategic infrastructure and housing program. So it is much more than just a construction program. It was always planned, under the delivery model of alliancing—a model that was put together by the former federal government. The SIHIP does not just build houses without addressing other issues of community disadvantage. It will leave a legacy of more functional and sustainable communities by providing real jobs and real economic opportunities for residents. Already the program is exceeding its Indigenous employment target, with more than 30 per cent of the workforce being Indigenous.
At 8 November, 93 new houses have been completed, 139 new houses are underway, 786 rebuilds and refurbishments have been completed, 105 rebuilds and refurbishments are underway and a total of 1,123 housing lots have had work. Three hundred and twenty three Indigenous people are employed on the SIHIP program, and the Indigenous employment rate across the program is currently tracking at 32 per cent of the total workforce. That is because, for the first time ever in the history of managing Indigenous housing programs in this country, we as a government mandated that, before any company could touch any tool, any brick, any piece of aluminium, any glass or any paintbrush, they had to sign up to ensuring that a percentage of their workforce was Indigenous. Did it happen under the Howard government? No, it did not. Was there any guarantee of Indigenous employment and Indigenous outcomes and training under the Howard government? No, there was not. So a very significant change and a very significant KPI under the Labor government is that we have Indigenous people employed. We have them off the Newstart allowance and we have them off CDEP where they choose to go off CDEP. We have them being trained. We have them out there as part of the workforce.
I have to say to my colleague on the other side of this chamber from the Territory: if you get around the Territory, if you went to Elcho Island or if you were at Gumbalunya, like I was last week, you would have seen more than a dozen men in those communities employed by Territory Alliance who are in training, who are very proud of what they are achieving, who boast about the full-time employment and who love the wages that they are bringing home to their families. They talked to me and Jenny Macklin just last week at Gumbalunya about the change they have perceived by being able to take up a trade that they believe will have lifelong benefits for their community. They said that the work experience and training makes them feel good about themselves. But it never happened prior to 2007.
So SIHIP is not just about building a house. It is about infrastructure and it is about changing what happens in those Aboriginal communities by giving people in those communities an opportunity to get into the workforce. That is because we mandated that. That is because you will not get one cent out of this program unless you provide at least a 20 per cent Indigenous employment target. I have to say that the alliances in the Territory have gone to 32 per cent of their total workforce. They are very proud of the fact that on the Tiwi Islands, out in Elcho and down in the town camps, they are getting Indigenous people onboard. They are getting them to be part of this and to own the outcomes. There are enormous legacy issues with housing in remote communities. We are not saying that SIHIP is solving all the housing problems in the Northern Territory; it is one program. There will be a need for more housing programs in the future and for the longer term. But SIHIP is a great start.
You can see the huge differences in the Alice Springs town camps. All 200 existing houses in the camps will be rebuilt or refurbished—43 three-bedroom houses and 42 two-bedroom houses will be built. A major clean-up through a fix-and-make-safe program was completed earlier this year under the $150 million Alice Springs Transformation Plan. In conjunction with the building program, 23 of the 40 staff employed to work on the Alice Springs town camps are Indigenous. And that figure is expected to grow as the construction increases. It has been an enormous transformation for the Alice Springs town camps. The standard of housing and the level of services are finally being lifted to that enjoyed by the rest of the town of Alice Springs. In May this year, Minister Macklin handed over the keys to the first of 85 new houses built in the town camps.
SIHIP is on track to meet its target of 150 new houses across the territory and 1,000 rebuilds and refurbishments by the end of this year. In fact, the national partnerships agreement building program is now being accelerated to deliver housing and housing related infrastructure ahead of schedule as the capacity of the construction consortia gathers strength. To take advantage of this demonstrated increased capacity, the Australian government announced on 10 October that it would bring forward $316.7 million over the forward estimates from the national partnership. Of these funds, $190 million will be used for housing related infrastructure, including sewerage and power. On top of this, the Northern Territory government in partnership is supporting the fast-tracking, by bringing forward $140 million of housing related infrastructure. This means that SIHIP will build around 180 new houses—and perform around 180 rebuilds—sooner than anticipated.
I just want to say in conclusion that, under the previous governments, none of these things were consistently in place—things like Indigenous employment targets, housing targets, funding reallocation where targets were not met and ensuring that skills and training for Indigenous people were happening so they could get a job. None of those things were in place—none of those were KPIs—under the mishmash of Indigenous housing arrangements we had under the previous federal government. There was no consistent measurement of progress, no national employment requirement outcomes, no tenancy standard agreements between landlords and tenants and no consistently secured tenure; there was just millions of dollars spent with abysmal outcomes.
One of the major things at the end of the day about this is that the houses that are built or refurbished become the property of the Territory Housing. They become the property of the Northern Territory government. So a major part of SIHIP has been a cultural change—when Indigenous people go into a SIHIP house, they are tenants of Territory Housing. With that comes all of the education that is required—to learn what a tenant means and what your obligations are. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-11-17,"—The Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program, known as SIHIP, has failed Northern Territory Indigenous people and has in fact become a national disgrace. The program has been dogged by waste, mismanagement and bureaucratic bungling. As Senator Scullion, who led this debate and who is the opposition spokesman on Indigenous matters, clearly pointed out, the waste, mismanagement and lack of information is just criminal. I regret to say that it is another glaring failure of the Rudd and Gillard governments to implement policies in an effective manner. We had the pink batts fiasco, the solar rebates debacle, the boat people mess and the imprudent rush to splurge $43 billion on Senator Conroy’s NBN project; and now we have the SIHIP tragedy.
I call it a tragedy because Indigenous people of the Northern Territory have been promised so much by this government but have received so little. Millions of dollars have been squandered while whole communities continue to suffer living conditions that would not be tolerated in Third World countries. At Ngukurr, a remote community in Arnhem Land, there are 1,300 people living in just 113 homes. That is incredible. In one house, there are 25 people sleeping under one roof. As the ABC reported last week, elders in Ngukurr feel they have been conned by the Gillard government. One of the Ngukurr elders, a man called Walter Rogers, told the ABC that he believed the community had been conned. He said the community was promised some 53 new homes and the repair of all existing homes in exchange for signing a lease agreement, and that promise has been broken. Mr Walters has now been told that the $30 million program in that area will only provide eight extra bedrooms in the whole community. This is a demonstration of the Labor government’s mismanagement of this program. It is a program that promised so much but is now seen as a joke in the Northern Territory. Regrettably, it is a joke on the Gillard government, but I can assure you that members of the Indigenous community are not laughing. The depth of distrust of government is very evident.
While SIHIP relates particularly to the Northern Territory, I will digress a little bit to talk about another chronic neglect of Indigenous housing in an area near where I am based in North Queensland—that is, Palm Island, just off the coast of Townsville. The Howard government approved $762 million for the construction of Indigenous housing there. Mal Brough, the then federal Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, released a plan for 46 new homes on Palm Island under the Howard government’s scheme. Three years later, not a sod has been turned on that project. The disgrace in what is happening on Palm Island is that the money was allocated but not a sod turned, and that reflects what is happening under SIHIP in the Northern Territory.
The Labor Party is simply incapable of managing money, and it is certainly incapable of assisting some of Australia’s most needy people. On Palm Island, up to 30 people are forced to crowd into one three-bedroom home; others are squatting in tin sheds made from scrap iron they got from the tip. So where has the money gone? That $762 million was allocated four years ago, and one wonders what has happened to it. Has it been used for the wages and accommodation of public servants, the very people employed to administer the scheme? No-one seems to know, yet Indigenous people on Palm Island continue to suffer in the sort of accommodation that would not be tolerated in Third World countries. Our first Australians deserve better. No wonder they are disillusioned with this government that is so long on promises and so short on action.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program</title>,Matters of Public Importance,25,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I too wish to make a contribution to this matter of public importance. As we all know, the Strategic Indigenous Housing Infrastructure Program is part of a much larger program, the National Partnership Agreement On Remote Indigenous Housing, which is a $5.5 billion project over the next 10 years to deliver housing to remote Aboriginal communities. I am a massive supporter of the government’s initiative to finally deliver at least some effort to build housing in Aboriginal communities. You, as a proud Western Australian, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, are quite aware from touring many Western Australian Aboriginal communities of the great disadvantage faced by those communities, and no doubt that is accentuated in the top end of Australia as it is in South Australia and the like. But I think it is rather disingenuous for that lot on the other side to carry on as they do—they really have a cheek. They had 12 years in government, and what did they do? All of a sudden they are the experts and, quite frankly, I am sick of it because, Mr Acting Deputy President, given the disadvantage that you and I have seen through Western Australia, those on that side have no right to start lecturing us on what we are at least trying to achieve.
I think Senator Crossin’s was the only intelligent contribution—it was really informative—and I would like to add to it. As we have heard, the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program is a $672 million investment to construct 750 new houses and 230 rebuilds and 2,500 refurbishments of existing houses in the Territory by the end of 2013. I have some information on that which I will share with the Senate. Work is under way in 25 communities and 11 town camps across the Territory. For example, in the Tiwi Islands 22 new houses are tenanted and complete in Nguiu. I am happy to say also that work is under way on the construction of another 21 houses. Rebuild works are complete at Milikapiti, where 30 houses have been substantially rebuilt. In the Nguiu and Pirlangimpi areas, 63 houses have been rebuilt and refurbished, and work is continuing there on a further 17 refurbishments and rebuilds. At Nguiu, 90 new houses will ultimately be constructed over the life of the program, with 23 houses constructed in the first stage.
Let us go further down the Stuart Highway to Tennant Creek, where a total of 78 houses will be substantially rebuilt under SIHIP. I am told that rebuild works are complete at a number of communities around that area, with 39 houses having been substantially rebuilt. Across the remaining town camps, 23 houses have now been rebuilt, and the building of a further six is underway. I am also told that, in the Tennant Creek area, major infrastructure works are complete in a number of communities and that the Australian and Northern Territory government officers continue to work closely with the Julalikari Council Aboriginal Corporation down there to ensure that transitional housing is available when required. We have already heard from Senator Crossin about the Alice Springs town camps.
It is important that we get the message across. Mr Acting Deputy President, you share with me a passion for closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities in Western Australia, and lines on maps should not make any difference at all. I spend a lot of time in remote Aboriginal communities in the west, and it is really rewarding—as the Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development, Senator Arbib, said in question time today—to hear that there are 323 Indigenous employees of SIHIP, who therefore make up over 30 per cent of the program’s workforce. This is absolutely fantastic news, and it should not be clouded by the disgraceful antics of those on the other side. Any program that delivers employment to Aboriginal communities should be applauded, because so far no-one has got it right. Those opposite can sit there and flap on about how wonderful they are, but they were not wonderful. It is only fair to say that at least the Rudd government initiated this program and it is being carried through by the Gillard government, and for that the government should be applauded. In question time today, Minister Arbib was asked by Senator Siewert whether Indigenous workers are on CDP, doing work experience or receiving income support. The rewarding answer that came out of question time was that these Aboriginal workers are being paid real wages at the award rate or higher. My goodness, wouldn’t the people in the communities in Western Australia that I travel through—as you do, Mr Acting Deputy President—love to receive a real wage.
—A lot of them do.
—Real jobs, Senator Adams. Just in case you have not been into any Aboriginal communities I will help you out. I would love to help you out, actually, because you should be standing shoulder to shoulder with me and applauding what is going on in Western Australia. Are you saying no, Senator Adams, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President?
—I beg your pardon.
—Okay, let me talk about Western Australia. Senator Macdonald has given me the opportunity by digressing into Queensland. I should pass a map over to that side so that they understand. Let’s talk about the Dampier Peninsula, Senator Adams; I do not know if you have been there—
—I have worked there, actually.
—If you have, you would have seen the fantastic effort being made by Nirrumbuk Aboriginal Corporation up in Beagle Bay. You have been there—have you seen the fantastic work, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President? Then you would agree with me on the work that Nirrumbuk do up there. It is a fantastic Aboriginal corporation under the guidance of two of the most professional representatives of the Aboriginal community in Marty Sibosado and Ray Christophers. They have done fantastic work.
Nirrumbuk is also an RTO and has trained some 300 Aboriginal workers in that region. They carry out real training for real employment. They also employ through their building company. They are in partnership with, I think, Broad Construction. For you, Senator Adams, five houses are being refurbished in Beagle Bay. Are you aware of Beagle Bay? I actually went up there and visited—
—Is this relevant to this debate?
—You are not aware? Okay, I will help you out; I will send you a map so you can stand with me and congratulate Nirrumbuk on the work they are doing with their Aboriginal employees.
I will give you some more information, Senator Adams, because you are a Western Australian and you are passionate about Aboriginal employment like I am. I do not want to insult you—I know that you probably know anyway—but this is what is going on in the program up in—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I realise that Senator Sterle is more familiar with Western Australia, but this is a motion about the SIHIP, which operates in the Northern Territory. That is the subject matter of this debate. I suggest he might like to return to what this debate is all about, which is a program operating in the Northern Territory of Australia.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, I would just make the point that there has been some leeway demonstrated in this debate by all sides and Senator Humphries is seeking to apply a standard that was noticeably absent with earlier speakers.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—There is no point of order.
—I listened intently. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and thank you, Senator Feeney. Let me just finish on this. The program up in Beagle Bay is part of the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing, which SIHIP is part of. For you, Senator Adams, I think I was up to the number of Indigenous employees in that community in Beagle Bay. Out of 18 employees, 13 are Indigenous. The number of Indigenous employees by percentage is 72.22—remarkable. Imagine if all the mining companies could do that as well—wouldn’t that be fantastic? The number of worked hours by Indigenous employees by percentage is 82.07. If I can, I will give you the job descriptions of our Aboriginal employees up there working on this wonderful housing program. There are nine builders labourers, two carpenters, one wall and ceiling fixer and one plumber. Remarkable, fantastic work, Nirrumbuk—keep up the great stuff.

Senator Humphries interjecting—

—As I was saying, I still have some more information for the Senate on what is going on in the Territory under SIHIP, Senator Humphries. Let’s talk about the Wadeye region, shall we? I would like to share some information with you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, and those on that side who do not have their fingers in their ears. Thirty-five new houses have been completed at Wadeye, work is underway on the construction of a further 27 and a total of no fewer than 105 new houses are being built at Wadeye.

Senator Humphries interjecting—

—Oh, did I pronounce ‘Wadeye’ wrongly? I apologise. I will go through it again just in case you were too fixated on my pronunciation: 35 new houses completed, 27 further houses under construction, and a total of 105 houses altogether. Fifty two refurbishments have been completed there as well, and work is continuing on another 14. Then we go to Groote, where six new houses have been completed, construction is continuing on a further 13, and a total of no fewer than 80 new houses will ultimately be constructed. How the other side can condemn a wonderful initiative that employs Indigenous workers I do not know. You stand condemned.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program</title>,Matters of Public Importance,25,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2010-11-17,"—There is possibly one thing on which I can agree with both Senator Crossin and Senator Sterle this afternoon, and that is that the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program is a very important program and a very important investment of Commonwealth funds. I do no think there is any dispute about that. I do not think there is any dispute from this side of the chamber—no matter what cheap disparagement those on the other side decide is apparently appropriate parliamentary debate—about the importance of the program. I do not think there is any dispute about the importance of addressing the issues that come with a lack of housing or living in the other fraught environments in which so many Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory do.
That is not the point. The point of this discussion is about the mismanagement of a program which is this important. The point of this discussion is about transparency, accountability and responding to concerns which have been raised by locals in communities across the Northern Territory, by administrators who have been sacked, by the media, by members of parliament in the Territory parliament and in this chamber, and by others. I do not think any of those issues are unreasonable, and I do not think we should take as a fact or as a fait accompli that it is good because they say it is good, that it is above board because they say it is above board. Seeking, as elected representatives in this chamber with a responsibility for, and an interest in, these areas, the sorts of information that makes them more transparent and accountable is not an action from which I intend to resile—not now and not ever.
I listened to Senator Crossin carefully. It was certainly a more valuable experience than listening to Senator Sterle. It was valuable in terms of its rhetoric if nothing else. She has the rhetoric down pat, that is true, and the rhetorical story if it were backed by the facts would be a very good one. But our concern is that what matters in this program, as well as the construction of houses, is transparency, accountability and the facts. That is where our issue today with this MPI actually lies.
This is enormously complex and enormously important. It is a massive government spend. I have spent, along with many of my colleagues here now and those who are not in the chamber, hours and hours in Senate estimates and other committees—and Senator Adams would be a leading exponent in that regard—exploring these issues in detail because we all respect the estimates process like many of those on the other side do. It is not always easy to get answers, I have to say. I have a faint hope that we will get the answers to questions taken on notice at the last estimates on this by the due date of return, which I think is 10 December. I have a hope, but I am not going to hold my breath. It would be more helpful for us in our engagement on this program—the importance of which we do acknowledge—if we were able to receive those answers.
What is clear here this afternoon is that, while the Northern Territory government is responsible for providing housing in the broad of the jurisdictional break-up, it is the federal government who is providing the money, who is providing the funding to help with the construction and maintenance, and they have an obligation to ensure that the housing and value for money are actually being delivered. The example that Senator Macdonald referred to earlier of Ngukurr, which has been exposed in recent media reports, is reprehensible. I do not hear it acknowledged by those on the other side. I do not even hear the name Ngukurr come out of their mouths, only the good news stories.
There are good news stories. There is no dispute that the housing being built, and being built to the sorts of specifications and the sorts of requirements which make it appropriate housing, is a good news story. But what about those areas where the transparency and accountability is lacking? What about the community of Ngukurr, which Senator Macdonald referred to, where one particular senior elder is sleeping on his kitchen floor and has 24 relatives living with him? Apparently, this is after the delivery of the program in that area. We have examples, also exposed in the media, of individuals choosing to live outdoors under sheets of tin and tarpaulins because it is better than living with so many other people.
I understand that, as referred to by Senator Scullion, the Northern Territory government has just revealed that the budget for SIHIP will not in fact allow all of the promised 2½ thousand house refurbishments to be completed, that it will not extend to all of the 750 promised new houses, that 50 per cent of them will have two bedrooms or less and that10 per cent will be one-bedroom units. I do not know everything there is to know about Indigenous affairs, not by a long shot—in fact, I doubt many of us standing in this place ever will—but I do know one thing: I am yet to find a community where a lot of one-bedroom units will come in handy. The result of that will be that SIHIP will not be doing what it should be doing in the reduction of overcrowding and the raising of housing standards, and that is what concerns us. Not only is the government not delivering on its promises but it is going over budget as well.
Senator Scullion detailed in his contribution this afternoon a number of the failures that have marked this program. You cannot pretend that it is all peace, love and happiness when you have had an inquiry commissioned by your own minister. You cannot pretend that there is nothing to examine in all of this. When the work was scheduled to commence in October 2008 and not a single house had been constructed by mid-2009, how can you possibly be pretending that it is all peace, happiness and delight? There were reports which Senator Scullion also referred to of briefings of Northern Territory government ministers—last time I looked they were sitting on the same side of the chamber of the parliament there as those opposite us—when those government ministers themselves were forced to raise concerns about the administration of the Commonwealth funds. One minister resigned from the Northern Territory Labor Party, as I recall. Those issues are being obfuscated and ignored by those opposite. These are the concerns that we have.
We want to know where the employment is occurring, we want to know how it is structured, how people are being engaged, what sort of time they are spending, whether they are locals and whether they are imported into communities to work on projects and counted in the same way. We do not have information about those issues and we have been asking for that for some time. These are the sorts of issues which are important in the process. If you are going to claim a 30 per cent employment target being reached, then tell us how, tell us who, tell us how long they are working for, tell us how long they are engaged for and tell us what their roles are. We do not think they are unreasonable questions and we are still waiting for answers on those.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program</title>,Matters of Public Importance,25,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-11-17,"—This government is determined to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. Our government’s commitment to improving the life chances of Indigenous Australians in partnership with Indigenous Australians stands strong. We know that housing is absolutely central to the government’s Closing the Gap agenda. It is one of the seven building blocks agreed by the Council of Australian Governments as necessary to bridging the gap in this disadvantage. We know that the link between the availability of adequate housing and broader life outcomes such as health, education and employment has been well established. We know we need to overcome the historically very ad hoc and manifestly inadequate arrangements of the past in remote Indigenous housing.
We know that in remote Australia the state of housing currently provides the most visible evidence of the persistent failure of governments to address Indigenous disadvantage, and this is something we are moving on from. We know it is critical that we improve the poor standard of housing and infrastructure and that we reduce overcrowding and homelessness in remote Indigenous communities. But logistics in these remote communities are indeed difficult. We know that no family can be expected to function normally in an overcrowded, dilapidated house where you cannot cook a meal, store perishable foods, have a shower or do a load of washing.
I have seen evidence of this on the ground in remote communities in my home state of Western Australia. At Ringer Soak, for example, I witnessed chronic overcrowding, with over 160 adults crowded into 24 mostly two-bedroom houses. At Balgo, a relatively large remote community, I saw massive overcrowding, with up to 10 people in each house, and I saw also distressing evidence of the associated problems of mental health and family breakdown. There are similar problems of overcrowding in the remote communities of Mulan and Mindibunga too, so I do not question the importance of this issue. I know that getting our housing right is critical to restoring positive social norms.
So it is no small thing that this government has committed an unprecedented $5.5 billion over 10 years to the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing to improve housing and living conditions in remote Australia. We know that in remote communities housing has traditionally been managed in a very ad hoc and very unsustainable way. This partnership is a huge step towards addressing this, providing things like regular tenure arrangements, fair and consistent property management and tenant behaviours. It is also the single biggest outlay any government has made to address the living conditions across remote Indigenous Australia. It is on all counts an ambitious reform agenda, representing an unprecedented national commitment to tackling what were previously viewed as intractable problems.
It is no small or easy thing to undertake such significant levels of investment reform, and indeed they are not without their difficulties. In the case of the Northern Territory, there were concerns expressed at the early delays in the rollout of construction activity. But we took swift action in response to concerns about the slow progress in capital works. A specific Office of Remote Indigenous Housing was established within Minister Macklin’s department, and senior staff were deployed to key jurisdictions to oversee the rollout of the national partnership. In response to a comprehensive review process in the Northern Territory, we have established an independent expert quality assurance team to inspect and assess new houses and refurbishments.
The government is confident that these steps will streamline implementation and ensure high-quality outcomes are delivered. The transition to an entirely new model of delivering houses, including introduction of new governance arrangements and a new large-scale procurement model, is a major reform. In this context, I very firmly believe that our management of the SIHIP is not a failure. It is, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, a significant achievement.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program</title>,Matters of Public Importance,25,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2010-11-17,"—I rise to join this debate and say that, if this program is considered a significant success, I would like to ask the government to explain the basis upon which they make that claim. We have a program here which is supposed to cost, at this stage, over a billion dollars. It was supposed to have been originally a four-year program, yet even those opposite admit that to date, after almost four years of operation, only 93 houses have been built—93 houses out of a $1.12 billion program which began in one form back in the middle of 2007. If that is a success, you guys have redefined success to a very, very low standard.
The opposition is raising these concerns because if ever there were warning signals about a program they are applicable to the SIHIP running in the Northern Territory. We are concerned about the cost overruns. When Minister Macklin announced the revamping of this program in April 2008, she said it would cost $647 million. Recently that figure has been revised to $1.12 billion but without any significant increase in the scope of the project. We are still going to have 750 new houses, supposedly. We are still going to have 230 houses replaced rather than demolished and we are still going to have 2,500 housing upgrades, apparently with associated infrastructure. Nothing more is being provided, but the cost is almost doubling.
We are concerned about delays. This was supposed to be a program that began in July 2007. Now it is going to run for five years, rather than four years as originally planned, from April 2008. With a program which has already been underway for almost three years, to have had only 93 houses built out of the 750 promised you would have to say that it is not looking good, given those serious delays when it comes to delivering on the expected level of housing.
The third point that we are raising is about poor value for money. Senator Scullion and others in this debate have already spoken about the incredibly poor-value outcomes people are getting in remote communities for very substantial amounts of money spent. Just this week in the Northern Territory News we saw pictures of some of the houses which have had so-called renovations under the SIHIP, and they look absolutely disgusting. There are houses covered in graffiti, with very poor quality work done on them. What was supposed to be a full refit of these houses, costing $75,000 per house, has turned out to be just repairs to electrical wiring, bathroom plumbing and fixtures, and new stainless-steel benches installed instead of a proper kitchen.
Senator Scullion made reference to his being invited to view a house at Ali Curung where, after it had been renovated, there was not a single cupboard or shelf in the kitchen, just a sink and bench. There was nowhere to put food, nowhere to put plates and saucepans, not even a drawer for cutlery. The house had a hole in the lounge room wall with the edges of the hole neatly painted, and outside there was no lid on the septic tank. That was a house where children were expected to live and it was anything but safe. That was for, apparently, an average cost of $75,000. Anybody else anywhere in Australia who saw that kind of work being completed would complain and say it was not acceptable, but, apparently, under this government it is perfectly acceptable.
The good intentions those opposite have to do something big in Indigenous housing and the commitment they have to close the gap are apparently adequate substitutes for actually delivering. If any program that this government is running has not delivered so far—and there are plenty of contenders for that title: home insulation, green loans et cetera—it is this program. The evidence is very clear that they are simply not bringing it together. There is clear evidence of concerns by individual contractors in individual communities, by individual tenants and by individuals all the way through to the Northern Territory government—one member of which felt so strongly about this mismanagement that he actually resigned not just from the government but from the Labor Party itself. This is a clear indication of the serious problems that everybody associated with this program has with it.
It is also not clear whether this program is providing the Indigenous employment which it is supposed to be providing. We have already heard that serious concerns are being expressed by contractors about people being employed not under full employment contracts but under Work for the Dole type arrangements or CDEP arrangements, which means they are not being paid at the appropriate rate. That comes from people actually working on the ground in Indigenous communities who are struggling to find the workers to employ and who are not employed at the appropriate rate. That is not an indication of a program in good health.
Senator Crossin pointed out that this is an unprecedented amount of money—the largest amount that any government has ever committed. Of course, when the costs are blowing out, it is not surprising it is a very large amount of money, and the amount will get bigger if the costs keep blowing out. If you want to deliver these sorts of outcomes but do not lift your sights with respect to what you are going to deliver and end up having to increase the costs because you cannot manage the programs competently, then of course the costs are going to be big. Big costs are no substitute for value for money for the Australian taxpayer and good outcomes for Indigenous people in these remote communities.
I acknowledge that this is not an easy problem to solve. I acknowledge that Indigenous communities have not had good outcomes under governments of all persuasions: territory, federal and probably many state governments as well. It is not easy to deliver in this area. We are simply saying to the government: pursuant to the principles of accountability which you signed up to under so-called Operation Sunlight, the warning signs for this program are very clear—things are going very badly. We are not getting value for money from this program, and the sooner the government accepts that and starts to act on these concerns rather than sweeping them away with the kinds of broad statements and glib comments we heard in today’s debate the better.

the Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010; and
the Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 2010.
The Federal Financial Relations Bill seeks to give effect to reforms to the financing of health and hospital services set out in the National Health and Hospitals Agreement endorsed by the States (except WA) on 20 April 2010. 
Proposed section 15A establishes the NHHN Fund in the form of a standing appropriation to facilitate payment arrangements with the States. No justification for this approach is provided in the explanatory memorandum, though it is noted that the amounts to be credited will be based on an intergovernmental agreement.
The Committee is concerned that the proposed arrangement does not ensure sufficient parliamentary scrutiny and intends to seek the Minister’s advice as to whether funding for the proposal can be subject to the standard annual appropriations process.
The Committee commented on the content of this Bill in Digest No. 7 of 2010 and the Committee has since identified an error in its commentary. Inadvertently two items were treated as falling within an exemption under table item 41 of section 44 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, when in fact this is the case only for one of them. I draw the Senate’s attention to new text the Committee has issued in relation to both of these items at pages 11 and 12 of Alert Digest No. 9.
In relation to its Ninth Report, the Committee acknowledges Ministers for the number of timely and comprehensive replies it has received to issues raised in earlier alert digests. This greatly assists the work of the Scrutiny Committee and improves the quality of bills brought before us for consideration.
Despite the very helpful information provided to the Committee, I draw the Senate’s attention to continuing concerns about provisions in the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 discussed in the report.
I commend Alert Digest No. 9 of 2010 and the Ninth Report of 2010 to the Senate.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-11-17,"—I note that I am continuing remarks on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 that were commenced by Senator Sherry earlier today. The government’s reforms will ensure that Australian taxpayers should benefit from this discounting and the lower prices that result from it. The reforms will result in no extra costs for patients. In fact, patients will benefit from price reductions where the price of a medicine falls below the general co-payment amount. The direct saving to consumers from these new measures is independently estimated to be, on average, close to $3 per prescription for general patients.
The opposition’s threat to block or significantly delay $1.9 billion in PBS savings is another example of the Liberals’ irresponsible budget management. Right now, taxpayers are paying inflated prices for many medicines. These reforms will stop this waste and help support the funding of new and innovative life-saving medicines. But the Liberals’ threat to block this landmark measure has put in jeopardy the ongoing sustainability of the PBS. The opposition are effectively keeping taxpayers’ costs for medicines artificially high, threatening the listing of new and innovative life-saving drugs being added to the PBS. This is just another example of how Tony Abbott’s Liberals are economically irresponsible and do not have any serious credentials in reforming our Australian health system.
During the debate some senators raised the issue of consultation with industry on these reforms. The government negotiated collaboratively and closely with the pharmaceutical industry to develop these reforms. Both Medicines Australia, which represents about 50 companies, and the Generic Medicines Industry Association, the GMiA, which represents some five companies, were involved in discussions with the government and were asked to provide proposals to enhance the sustainability of the PBS. Discussions with Medicines Australia proved to be very fruitful, and the matters agreed between Medicines Australia and the government were ultimately given expression in a memorandum of understanding. On multiple occasions the GMiA was able to discuss options for reform to the PBS with the government, including with the minister in her office and with senior officials of the Department of Health and Ageing. GMiA had a good hearing, and the government has valued the exchange of views. However, GMiA’s key proposal to the government in these discussions was that patients should be made to pay some $5 more for off-patent medicines made by originator companies compared to the cost for the same drugs made by generics companies. This proposal would have resulted in concessional patients paying nearly twice as much as they currently do for some off-patent medicines. The government could not support this proposal.
I note that the position of the generics industry on these reforms is in fact very similar to the position they took on the original 2007 PBS reforms, which were introduced under the former, Howard government. At that time, the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, had this to say on the matter, on 16 November 2006:
… the Generics Medicine Industry Association is not, as I understand it, especially happy with these changes. It believes that these changes will make it harder for them to maintain market share by removing the scope for them to offer discounts to pharmacists.
            …         …         …
… I point out that 70 per cent of the Australian generics market is occupied by companies which are not members of the Generic Medicines Industry Association, they are in fact members of Medicines Australia. They are the manufacturers and marketers of innovative patented drugs as well as of off-patented drugs.
            …         …         …
… by removing the gross discounts from the system, we should ensure that domestic generic manufacturers are less at risk from predatory newcomers such as some of the Indian generic drug manufacturers.
Those were the words of Tony Abbott in 2006, but the opposition are now indicating that they will block the sensible extension of the 2007 PBS reforms which, in government, they introduced. I think it demonstrates the gross economic irresponsibility of the opposition that they are prepared to wreck $1.9 billion of savings for taxpayers, despite having supported precisely these types of changes when they were in government.
In summary, the government’s bill provides value for money for taxpayers while also providing stability and certainty for the pharmaceutical industry.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-11-17,"—Whilst we are waiting for some other senators to come down, I thank you for this opportunity to address the Senate. There are a number of concerns that the people of Australia are engaged in, and they want their politicians—the government and the opposition—to prioritise these concerns. Not least of all is the struggle that many families are finding themselves coming to terms with in day-to-day life regarding their financial and budgetary requirements. It is a genuine concern that many families today are struggling enormously with day-to-day living expenses—with rising electricity costs, with rising food prices, with the rise in everything that is necessary to them. A lot of the discretionary purchases that they can make are dropping in price but the necessities are going up in price.
There is concern amongst many people that some government policies are assisting in this. I make specific mention of the injection of capital into the money supply. I know the government argue that they need to prop up jobs and things of that nature. We do not dissent from that, because the coalition did endorse parts of the stimulus spending package. But, when you inject too much money into the economy, it fuels inflation and the people who suffer the most are those on regular wages. I note that the Australian Financial Review yesterday reported that the cost of living for a salaried employee has risen 60 per cent faster than the inflation rate. There are very real concerns for many families, and I would like the government, in its limited wisdom, to consider the real challenges that many families are facing. I sense that Senator Carol Brown is ready to give her speech. I thank the Senate, once again, for this brief opportunity to speak.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Cost of Living</title>,Adjournment,34,1,speech
