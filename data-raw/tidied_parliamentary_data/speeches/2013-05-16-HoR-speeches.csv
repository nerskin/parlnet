"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:36):  by leave—The government is committed to providing regular updates to the parliament on Afghanistan generally, including detainee management, operational incidents and other issues associated with Australia's compliance with its legal obligations in Afghanistan.


Today, I provide an update on detainee management and Australian Defence Force (ADF) inquiries into civilian casualties and Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS) processes as well as local source allegations.




Detainee Management Framework



Australia approaches its responsibility for treating detainees with dignity and respect with the utmost seriousness and is committed to managing detention matters in accordance with our domestic and international legal obligations.


Australia's detainee management framework for Afghanistan has two priorities:


First, removing insurgents from the battlefield, where they endanger Australian, ISAF and Afghan lives; and


Second, to ensure the humane treatment of detainees, consistent with Australia's domestic and international legal obligations.




Monitoring



As part of our detainee management framework, Australian officials monitor the treatment, welfare and conditions of all detainees transferred from ADF custody to Afghan custody.


Between 1 August 2010 and 15 May 2013, the monitoring team has conducted 140 monitoring visits. This includes: 64 visits to the National Directorate of Security facility in Tarin Kot; 24 visits to the Tarin Kot Central Prison; and 52 visits to the detention facility in Parwan, now called the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan.




Numbers of detainees apprehended



During the period 1 August 2010 to 15 May 2013, the ADF detained 1,898 suspected insurgents. Of these: 158 detainees have been transferred to the National Directorate of Security in Tarin Kot and 105 detainees have been transferred to the detention facility in Parwan.




Capture/recapture



Between 1 August 2010 and 15 May 2013, the ADF recaptured 15 people who had previously been captured and were subsequently released. Seven of the individuals in question were released as there was insufficient evidence to warrant their continued detention.


For eight of these detainees there was sufficient evidence to warrant their transfer and prosecution. Four were subsequently transferred to US custody at the detention facility in Parwan, and four were transferred to Afghan custody at the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Uruzgan.




Allegations of Mistreatment



Australia takes all allegations of detainee mistreatment seriously. Since August 2010, I have provided regular updates on complaints and allegations of mistreatment the ADF has received. During the period 1 August 2010 to 15 May 2013, there have been 198 allegations of mistreatment against Australian forces. Of these, 175 relate to treatment or an incident at the point of capture. To date, 193 of these allegations have been considered and have been assessed as being unfounded. Five allegations remain under review.




Treatment of detainees by ANSF



Australia is committed to holding our own personnel to the highest standards on detainee treatment. If ADF personnel become aware of concerns regarding the treatment of detainees by our International Security Assistance Force or Afghan partners, this is also treated seriously. During the period 1 August 2010 to 15 May 2013, 61 allegations of detainee mistreatment have been made against the Afghan National Security Forces at the point of capture.


On 11 March this year, Australian officials were informed of two allegations of mistreatment raised by non-Australian Defence Force transferred detainees at the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Tarin Kot. The allegations do not involve detainees apprehended by the ADF. In light of these allegations, on 15 March this year the ADF suspended the transfer of detainees to the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Tarin Kot.


At the time of suspension on 15 March there was one ADF transferred detainee in the NDS detention facility. He was visited by Australia's Interagency Detainee Monitoring Team on 12 March and he advised that he had not been mistreated. That detainee was transferred to the Tarin Kot Central Prison on 19 March, where he is still subject to regular monitoring visits.


No ADF transferred detainees remain in the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Tarin Kot. Since the suspension has been in place, the ADF has released 14 detainees from the international screening facility in Tarin Kot. One detainee has been transferred to the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan since the suspension has been in place.


Australia have raised our concerns about this matter with Afghan authorities, Afghan and international human rights organisations and the International Security Assistance Force. On 21 March, I advised Afghan Foreign Minister Rassoul of our concerns about this matter. This occurred during his visit that day to Canberra, the last day before the parliament rose before Easter.


Australia has reiterated the importance of the proper treatment of detainees and the need to investigate any allegations of detainee mistreatment in a robust and transparent manner. Afghan authorities advise they are taking these allegations seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation, which is ongoing.


It is appropriate for Australia to await the outcome of the Afghan investigation into this matter, and advice on any action proposed to be taken, before Australia considers a resumption of the transfer of ADF-apprehended detainees to Afghan authorities in Tarin Kot.




Detainee Management Transition



In line with the broader transition of lead security responsibility from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces, Afghan forces are increasingly taking the lead in detention operations. As operations in Uruzgan transition to an Afghan lead, this will inevitably see the ADF apprehending fewer detainees in partnered operations with the Afghan National Security Forces. The ADF has taken 58 detainees from 1 January to 15 May this year.




Closure of the Initial Screening Area



The purpose-built initial screening area (ISA) is the central element of Australia's current detainee management framework in Afghanistan. On 26 March, the Prime Minister and I welcomed the decision by ISAF to close Multinational Base-Tarin Kot in Uruzgan Province by the end of the year. In line with the broader redeployment and remediation process at Tarin Kot, the initial screening area will be dismantled and remediated in the last quarter of this year.


Just as Australia reviewed the ADF's detainee management framework and requirements in the run-up to the withdrawal of the Dutch from Uruzgan and put in place the current detainee management framework in August 2010, Australia will review the ADF's detainee management requirements as the transition process proceeds.




Transfer of the detention facility in Parwan to Afghan control



I have previously provided the House with updates on the status of the transfer of the previously United States-run detention facility in Parwan to Afghan responsibility. On 9 March 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed a memorandum of understanding to commence the transfer of the Parwan facility to Afghan control. The official ceremony to mark the transfer of the facility to Afghan authorities and the renaming of the facility as the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan occurred on 25 March 2013. The official transfer is a positive development for the Afghan government and is a reflection of the transition of security across Afghanistan.


Australia will continue to transfer ADF-apprehended detainees to the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan. We have received ongoing assurances from the Afghan authorities that our monitoring team access to ADF-transferred detainees at the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan will continue under our existing arrangement with the Afghan government. As at 15 May 2013, there are 68 ADF-apprehended detainees in the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan. These detainees are regularly monitored by the Interagency Detainee Monitoring Team and, to date, no concerns have been identified with their treatment. Australia will continue to engage with our partners to ensure that ADF transferred detainees continue to be treated humanely in accordance with the applicable domestic and international law.




Allegations of Procedural Misconduct



I first advised the House in my March 2011 ministerial statement to parliament, that in late January of that year, the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS) had initiated an investigation into allegations of non-compliance with the management and administrative procedures for the processing of detainees at the ADF detainee screening facility in Tarin Kot. As advised in my February 2013 update to the House, four previous members of the first Detention Management Team in Afghanistan, involved in managing the Initial Screening Area (ISA), had been charged with service offences of falsifying service documents which related to the administrative processing of detainees. Trials under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 have been concluded and I can now provide the House with a final update.


The Director of Military Prosecutions charged four members of the first Detention Management Team, including the former officer in command of the team. The trial of the former officer in command of the first Detention Management Team commenced on 19 March 2013 and concluded on 3 April 2013. The member pleaded not guilty to a range of charges, including suppressing a service document and making false entries in service documents.


He was convicted of two counts of making a false entry in a log book which provides a record of detainee processing, and acquitted of four related charges. The prosecution alleged that the false entries were made to conceal the fact that a detainee was held for four and a half hours longer than is permitted under the detainee management policy and to falsely represent that a subordinate member of the Detention Management Team had made the required entries in the log book. The former officer in command was reduced from the rank of major to the rank of captain for both offences.




Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS)



I first advised in my 24 May 2012 ministerial statement to the House that a number of matters had been raised in the context of an Inspector General of the ADF (IGADF) inquiry into allegations of flawed ADFIS processes in the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO). The allegations included: the incorrect orientation of caskets used to repatriate ADF human remains; that ADF human remains were not repatriated in accordance with Defence policy; that the remains of an Afghan local national were handled inappropriately; and that a 16-year-old Afghan minor was detained inappropriately.


Part 1 of the IGADF inquiry was completed on 15 October 2012. Part 2 of the inquiry was completed on 21 December 2012. I am now providing the House with a final update.




Allegations of mishandling the remains of Australian soldiers



With regards to the allegation that the human remains of ADF personnel were incorrectly oriented in their caskets, the inquiry found that on two occasions in 2011, ADFIS personnel initially placed the remains of ADF personnel in caskets which had been incorrectly inverted. At no time were the remains of ADF personnel upside down. The caskets themselves were incorrectly oriented. The incorrect orientation of the caskets was identified and the caskets were correctly oriented before being flown back to Australia. The soldiers' remains were treated with utmost respect and dignity at all times, while the caskets were corrected. The errors arose due to unfamiliarity of ADFIS personnel with the caskets themselves. Instructions on the use of the caskets have since been amended to provide clear guidance on the correct orientation. 


With regard to the allegation that medical devices were inappropriately removed by ADFIS personnel from the human remains of ADF personnel, the inquiry confirmed that ADFIS personnel had removed medical devices from the remains of ADF personnel prior to their return to Australia.


The removal of medical devices by ADFIS personnel did not breach criminal or coronial legislation or guidelines, nor was there any requirement for the removal to be approved or undertaken by medical officers. Departmental instructions have been amended to provide clear guidance on the management of medical devices in human remains. These allegations that the remains of ADF personnel were not repatriated in accordance with Defence policy, the subsequent investigation and attendant publicity would have been distressing for the families of our war dead, and our thoughts are with them. 




Allegations of mishandling of the remains of an Afghan insurgent



With regard to the allegation that the remains of an Afghan insurgent were transported off the multinational base Tarin Kot by taxi, the IGADF inquiry found that confusion appears to have arisen over two incidents in which the remains of two Afghan insurgents who died after engagements with Australian Forces were removed from the multinational base Tarin Kot.


In an incident in August 2010, the remains of an Afghan insurgent were transported back to the ISAF role 2 medical facility at the multinational base Tarin Kot by Australian Forces after an engagement between Australian forces and insurgents. The Afghan insurgent had died prior to his remains being located by ADF personnel. Accordingly this matter was not treated as a death in custody and ADFIS had no responsibility for nor involvement with the remains. The inquiry found that it is probable that the remains were transported by taxi to the local morgue, in accordance with standard operating procedures of the relevant ISAF partner who had custody of the remains and had established local arrangements in place. 


In an incident in October 2010, an Afghan insurgent was wounded in an engagement with Australian forces. He was treated by ADF personnel and transferred under ADF custody to the ISAF role 2 medical facility at the multinational base Tarin Kot for further treatment, where he later died. As is normal procedure for a such a death, ADFIS personnel conducted an investigation, including a forensic examination. ISAF medical staff arranged for the remains to be handed over to the family, and the deceased Afghan insurgent was later buried. The remains were handled in accordance with ISAF role 2 practice at the time. 


The inquiry found that Defence policy did not provide clear direction on the management of human remains of non-ISAF personnel who die in Australian custody, and recommended amplification and amendment of the policy.




Allegation of mistreatment of an Afghan minor



With regards to the allegation that an Afghan minor, who entered the multinational base Tarin Kot in October 2010 to locate his father, was arrested by ADFIS and transferred to US custody, the inquiry found that an Afghan minor did enter the base in October 2010 and was detained by ADF personnel after undergoing standard screening processes by ISAF security. The inquiry found that the juvenile, who was assessed during medical in-processing to be 16 years old, was detained for approximately two hours by the ADF before being released. The juvenile was questioned by ADF personnel. 


While in ADF custody the juvenile was provided treatment appropriate to his age in accordance with Australia's detainee management policy. At no time was the juvenile mistreated or transferred to United States custody. The inquiry found the processing of the juvenile was conducted in accordance with Australia's detainee management policy, except for one minor error in completion of the paperwork, which was not found to be significant.




Inquiry report



The findings and recommendations of the inspector-general's inquiry have been redacted to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 and these are available on the Defence department's website. 




Civilian casualties



Australia remains committed to transparency and providing information on civilian casualties in Afghanistan. The ADF takes the question of civilian casualties very seriously. The ADF operates under strict rules of engagement intended to minimise civilian casualties, and deeply regrets any loss of innocent life. In my February update to the House, I advised on outstanding inquiries into suspected civilian casualty incidents. In the materials I present and will table in the House later I provide an update on those incidents and one additional incident.




Conclusion



The rule of law is an essential basis for international relations and for national security policy. On the ground in Afghanistan, the law of armed conflict—including the principles of military necessity, proportionality, distinction and discrimination—provides the framework for Australia's rules of engagement. International humanitarian law provides the basis for Australia's detainee management framework in Afghanistan.


The ADF has built a reputation over the years for professionalism. The ADF has prided itself on its high standards and it has a well regarded international reputation for doing so. When, for example, there are incidents involving possible breaches of the rules of engagement, such as in relation to civilian casualties, they are investigated and the results of those investigations are made public. Similarly, where there have been possible breaches of the detainee management framework, they are investigated and the results of those investigations are made public.


These two foundation principles—the rule of law and transparency—have served the ADF and Australia well in Afghanistan. Australians can be rightly proud of the professionalism and honour with which the ADF has conducted itself in Afghanistan.


I present a paper tabled in conjunction with my ministerial statement and I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak in reply to the statement for a period not exceeding 18 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr STEPHEN SMITH:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Robert speaking for a period not exceeding 18 minutes.


Question agreed to.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:55):  I rise to lend a few brief comments in response to the Minister for Defence's detailed statement he has made to the House this morning on Afghanistan. I thank him for his statement and his commitment to keep the House informed across these range of matters. I rise today to reiterate once again the very strong tradition of the coalition that we offer and take seriously bipartisan support for combat operations not just in the wider Middle East area of operations but wherever Australian soldiers, sailors and air men and women serve. Our support has not wavered on this. It has been universal. We have given support for the last six years of combat operations, especially when it has been difficult and hard. We also support the combat force wind down in Tarin Kot and the handover of the Tarin Kot base to the Afghan National Army and the residual clean-up and logistics handover work that goes with that.


I rise also to join the minister in thanking our fighting men and women for what they are doing. It remains tough and difficult work. Our hearts and our prayers go to them as they continue to uphold the great traditions that our military has borne for so many years. The coalition's bipartisan support goes to the detainee management framework, governance monitoring operations and reporting as well. 


I join the minister in noting we are a First World nation. We abide by the rule of law, particularly in armed conflict. Concepts such as rules of engagement and orders for opening fire are not simply acronyms; they are an important basis upon which we as a First World nation prosecute our combat operations. It is important to note that our enemies do not follow such a distinguished way of operating. Let the other nations of the world judge them and let the nations of the world judge us by our standards. I agree with the minister that our standards are high and that our accountability is strong, yet we remain open to criticism and we confront it when it is raised. We are not afraid for this nation's parliament to point out where we may have erred, what we have done to investigate it and how it has been resolved. Australians should be proud of that degree of openness.


I note the detainee numbers in the last 20 months have risen to 1,898 suspected insurgents. That is an enormous number of insurgents for our soldiers ostensibly to have captured on the battlefield, suspected or stopped at roadblocks or in other areas. That is an enormous rate of effort for our troops in understanding the environment and ensuring that local civilians are safe from insurgent activity. It is a testimony to our efficiency in operations. I also note that the recapture rate is exceptionally low considering the very high number of detainees. That speaks volumes about our capacity in terms of our tactical questioning, our interrogation capabilities and the entire process. 


I thank the minister for his update on the allegations of mistreatment by Australians of insurgents. I note that they are all properly and thoroughly investigated. I note that 90 per cent of allegations of mistreatment were at the point of capture. That is quite understandable when those being captured do not want to be captured and put up a degree of resistance. Nor is it surprising that 100 per cent of the allegations have been found to be untrue. Nor do I find it surprising that the insurgents that we fight continue to fabricate stories even when conclusive CCTV footage shows that what they are saying is absolutely, palpably and completely untrue. Again, you can hardly find a greater dichotomy between the way we prosecute operations and the way our insurgents prosecute theirs.


I note the minister's comment on the suspension of transfers to the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Tarin Kot. Is my contention that if the minister is concerned about allegations he is right to suspend transfers, and he has done so. I note that those allegations do not surround any of the ADF transferees, and I note that this is a completely Afghan-run facility. I also note that the one ADF transferee detainee that was at the facility at the time of the suspension has been visited. I understand from the minister's statement that he has personally advised that he has not been mistreated in any way. The ADF has, then, ensured that its duty of care to its detainees has been properly met.


MINDEF has also raised with the Afghan authorities—indeed, with Afghan Foreign Minister Rassoul personally—our disappointment at what is happening in the facility, and I believe that Minister Rassoul is investigating this appropriately and thoroughly.


I thank the minister for his update on the initial screening area within TK, and I note that when the Tarin Kot base closes for ADF involvement and is handed over to ostensibly the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army, that initial screening area will close and the team will move out in line with our ADF troop withdrawal. I also thank the minister for procedural misconduct and regulation updates. I note the investigations and we note the outcomes.


We also note the minister's update on the incredibly regrettable instances of civilian casualties. We acknowledge the investigation officer's report into areas where Australian troops have been involved. We note the CJOC response and I also note that there are some reports outstanding. I still remain concerned, Minister, at the time that is being taken for these reports to eventuate. It is a concern, I believe, you may well share as well. Again, I reiterate our request that more resources, if needed, are applied to ensure that reporting does not continue to be delayed.


I join the minister in concluding that we praise our fighting men and women for what they have done. Their professionalism is of the highest standard. Their accountability is of the highest standard. In terms of accountability for the prosecution of combat operations, in the history of Australia's war craft, this conflict would have to be the one where our men and women are held to the highest levels of accountability—where the reporting is thorough, where individual instances are investigated thoroughly—and we as a nation should be incredibly proud of that. We are a First World military. We take our combat operations and the legalities and the rules of engagement around that seriously. We are not above the law. Indeed, we are a standard-bearer for the law on the grounds upon which we fight. I think we are all very proud of what our men and women are doing overseas. I am, I know the minister is and I know the parliament is. I thank them for the great work they are doing.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (10:14):  On behalf of the Special Minister of State, I move 


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Air Warfare Destroyer Ship sustainment facilities at Garden Island, Randwick Barracks and HMAS Watson in Sydney, New South Wales.


The new air warfare destroyer will replace the Navy's Adelaide class guided missile frigates with three Hobart class air defence capable ships. 


The air warfare destroyers currently under construction in three shipyards in Newcastle in New South Wales, Williamstown in Victoria and Osborne in South Australia will be the most intense and complex warships introduced into service in the Royal Australian Navy. The first new air warfare destroyer, HMAS Hobart, is due for delivery in 2016. The air warfare destroyer ship sustainment facilities project will provide permanent maintenance, systems support and infrastructure at Garden Island and training facilities at Randwick Barracks and HMAS Watson in Sydney New South Wales.


Garden Island in Sydney will be operational base for the new air warfare destroyers, and the project proposes to co-locate and share certain facilities with the new landing helicopter dockships that will also operate from Sydney. At Garden Island there will be berthing infrastructure upgrades to the walls and a new shared three-storey office building to accommodate personnel involved in maintaining and keeping the ships operational. At Randwick Barracks there will be new air warfare destroyer training centres for crews which also co-locate and share certain facilities with the landing helicopter dock training centre. At HMAS Watson there will be a new air warfare destroyer command team trainer to practise and hone the ship's command teams in the profession of maritime warfare. 


The estimated cost of the proposal is $109.9 million plus GST and includes all delivery costs from management and design fees, construction costs, information communication technology, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and allowance for escalation. Capital investment in the project will have economic benefits for the Sydney region and local industry with significant opportunities for subcontractors in the construction industry over the next three years. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works should proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence later this year and be completed by late 2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (10:18):  On behalf of the Special Minister of State, I move:




That, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Public Works Committee Act 1969
, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: AIR 9000 Phase 8 MH-60R Seahawk Romeo facilities project. 



The Air 9000 Phase 8 project is a key Defence capability initiative that would deliver 24 MH60R Seahawk Romeo maritime combat helicopters with associated support systems and weapons. The MH60R Seahawk Romeo will replace the existing 16 ageing S70B2 Seahawk helicopters and will provide Navy with advanced anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Infrastructure and building works are required to support the operations, maintenance training and ordinance storage facilities that are to be constructed at HMAS Albatross near Nowra in New South Wales, HMAS Stirling in Western Australia and Twofold Bay at Eden in New South Wales.


This capital investment will bring economic benefits to these locations for the local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and construction industry associated therewith over the next four years. Works at HMAS Albatross are anticipated to generate an estimated 100 full-time jobs over a period of 16 months, peaking at approximately 260 full-time jobs. Works at HMAS Stirling are anticipated to generate an estimated 15 to 20 full-time jobs  for each of the three project elements over a period of 46 months, peaking at approximately 45 full-time jobs. Works at Twofold Bay are anticipated to generate an estimated 15 full-time jobs over a period of six months, peaking at approximately 25 full time jobs.


The estimated cost of the proposal is $201.3 million plus GST and includes all delivery costs including management and design fees, construction costs, information communication technology, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingences and an allowance for escalation. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, staged construction is scheduled to commence in late 2013 and is planned to be completed on all sites by mid-2017. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (10:20):  On behalf of the Special Minister of State, I move: 




That, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Public Works Committee Act 1969
, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Australian Broadcasting Corporation Melbourne accommodation project, Southbank, Victoria. 



The Australian Broadcasting Commission, the ABC, currently operates three sites in Melbourne: one at Southbank and two at Elsternwick. In 1999, the ABC purchased the site immediately adjacent to its existing Southbank Centre with the long-term objective of consolidating all its Melbourne based staff and operations, with the exception of television outside broadcast operations, on one site at Southbank. The proposed Melbourne Accommodation Project will achieve this objective together with a range of other ABC strategic, functional and financial objectives.


In an era of converging media, the proposed MAP will build an efficient and flexible working environment for ABC staff that reflects and supports the ABC charter. The proposal also aligns with a range of government policy objectives in the areas of the transition to digital television and digital radio services in metropolitan areas, environmental sustainability and the delivery of high quality and diverse broadcasting services including international television. The project involves construction of purpose built accommodation on the site immediately adjacent to the current Southbank broadcast site in Sturt street, Southbank. The consolidated facility will house all ABC radio, television and online production in Melbourne as well as broadcast and support facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $176.4 million, including project management, design, construction, building fit-out and the ABC's broadcast technological fit-out.


In its report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has recommended that these works proceed and, subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in late 2013 with project completion estimated to be late 2016. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its work and support. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new post-entry quarantine facility at Mickleham, Victoria.


The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry currently leases and operates five post-entry quarantine facilities for the management of imported animals and plants under the Quarantine Act 1908. Existing leases on all properties are due to expire between 2015 and 2018 with no opportunities for lease extensions. The new facilities are required to satisfy contemporary quarantine standards and meet all future demands, particularly in the area of high-risk species. A single consolidated facility has been determined to be the best option to respond to this need. The proposed post-entry quarantine facility project will be delivered by the Department of Finance and Deregulation, which owns the project site and facility. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will operate and manage the proposed entry quarantine facility. The estimated cost of the proposal is $293.1 million plus GST and includes all of the costs associated therewith. The land for the project was purchased in Mickleham, Victoria, at a cost of $35 million in June 2012, utilising funds provided for this purpose in the 2011-2012 budget. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these projects and works proceed. Subject to the parliamentary approval, the construction will commence in late 2013 and will be completed by late 2018.

The Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) is the leading Defence organisation agency charged with applying science and technology to protect and defend Australia and its national interests. In addition to the specialist advice and innovative solutions DSTO provides to the Australian Defence Force, the expertise that resides in DSTO also delivers unique capabilities to support the Australian government's broader national security requirements.


The DSTO Human Protection and Performance Division—HPPD—is located at the DSTO Melbourne site, Victoria, which is also known as DSTO Fishermans Bend. The mission of the HPPD is the application of innovative science to improve the protection and performance of personnel in physically challenging environments. The project proposes to enhance site security at DSTO Fishermans Bend and to rectify inadequacies in existing facilities to improve their ability to generate capability in support of the ADF and other Australian government organisations and agencies. The estimated project cost is $41.1 million plus GST and includes construction costs and management fees et cetera.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Landing Helicopter Dock Ship sustainment facilities at Garden Island and Randwick Barracks in Sydney, New South Wales.


The new Amphibious Deployment and Sustainment, ADAS program, provides a number of projects to enhance the Australian Defence Force amphibious capability, including the acquisition of two new Canberra Class Landing Helicopter Dock, LHD, amphibious assault ships for the Royal Australian Navy. The ADAS program aims to provide the Australian Defence Force with a multidimensional manoeuvre capability to support the Australian Defence Force's Future Joint Operating Concept. The two new Canberra Class LHDs will replace the heavy landing ship, HMAS Tobruk and the two amphibious landing ships, HMAS Manoora and HMAS Kanimbla.


Each new LHD will be capable of embarking, transporting and deploying a force of over 1,000 personnel by air and sea, along with all their weapons, ammunition, vehicles and stores. The LHDs will also be capable of conducting and supporting humanitarian missions and will be jointly crewed with personnel from Navy, Army and Air Force.


The LHD hulls are being built in Spain. The hulls are then transported to Australia as individual lifts on a float-on, float-off heavy-lift ship. Construction of the LHD superstructures and their consolidation with the hulls are then conducted by BAE Systems in their Williamstown shipyard in Victoria. The first LHD hull arrived at the Williamstown shipyard in October 2012. The first completed LHD, HMAS Canberra, is due for delivery in early 2014.


This project will provide permanent maintenance systems support and berthing infrastructure at Garden Island, plus training facilities at Randwick Barracks, Sydney, New South Wales. Garden Island, in Sydney, will be the operational base for the new LHDs and the project proposes to collocate and share new facilities with the new air warfare destroyers that are also operated from Sydney.


At Garden Island, there will be berthing infrastructure upgrades to the wharves and a new shared three-storey office building to accommodate personnel involved in maintaining and keeping the ships operational. At Randwick Barracks, there will be a new LHD training centre for crews, which will also be collocated and share facilities with an Air Warfare Destroyer training centre, as I said earlier.


The estimated cost of the proposal is $60.3 million plus GST, involving delivery management design and other types of costs, including an allowance for escalation. Capital investment in the project will have an economic benefit for the whole Sydney region, and local industry can also get access to subcontracting work in the construction industry over the next three years.


In its report, the public works committee recommended these works proceed and, subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence later this year and to be completed by late 2015.


On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Multi National Base Tarin Kot Remediation Project, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan.


The Australian Defence Force—ADF—has developed an extensive infrastructure footprint at the Multinational Base, Tarin Kot, in Afghanistan—which I will refer to as 'the base' in the course of this speech—to support its mission over the last eight years, ranging from simple accommodation building to utilities such as water treatment plants.


In March 2013, the government announced Australia's redeployment from, and closure of, the base at the end of this year. This decision was made in conjunction with the International Security Assistance Force and Afghan authorities. The announcement confirmed the transfer of lead security responsibility in Uruzgan province to the Afghanistan National Security Forces, the Australian Defence Force redeployment from the base and the remediation of Australian infrastructure and facilities at the base.


In anticipation of this announcement, the Department of Defence has developed a demanding remediation program to achieve the government's intent and international obligations. The cost at worst case will be $47.2 million to ensure the safety of the full site, for future Afghan use, and environmental cleanliness.


In its report, the public works committee has recommended that these works proceed, subject to parliamentary approval. The remediation is scheduled for completion by the end of 2013. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.

The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of new leased premises at site 5 and 6 of the revitalised Central Dandenong project, Dandenong in Victoria. The ATO has a substantial presence in the Dandenong region and is currently located in a building in Mason Street, Dandenong, which has a lease in place that expires on 31 December 2015. It is expected that the relocation into a new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies, and long-term viability through improvements in building infrastructure.


The estimated cost of the proposal is $21.3 million plus GST, and includes all costs associated with an integrated fit-out, as well as furniture, workstations and builders' costs. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in August 2014 and be completed by 1 October 2015.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development and construction of housing for Defence at Warner, Brisbane, Queensland


Defence Housing Australia proposes to undertake the development and construction of housing for the Department of Defence at Warner, Brisbane, Queensland. The Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, Brisbane, is one of the Australian Defence Force's major bases and home to units of the 7th and 11th Brigades, as well as the headquarters of the 1st Division and 16th Aviation Brigade. The on-base facilities are currently undergoing a major expansion. In conjunction with this on-base expansion, DHA has identified a need over the next five years to provide additional housing accommodation for families of defence personnel working in the Brisbane area.


The Warner site is a 35.71 hectare greenfield parcel of land at the corner of Kremzow Road and Old North Road, Warner, located approximately 20 kilometres north of the Brisbane central business district. DHA proposes to develop approximately 465 allotments for the provision of developed land and housing to assist in satisfying future demand. Housing for defence families will be constructed on 130 lots over three years with the remaining 335 residential lots to be sold to the general market.


The estimated overall cost of the project is $91.3 million, including GST contingency and escalation costs but excluding the cost of land. Subject to parliamentary approval, site works are scheduled to commence in November 2013 with construction to be completed by December 2016. I commend the motion to the House.

Defence Housing Australia proposes to undertake redevelopment and construction of housing for the Department of Defence at Samford Road, Enoggera, Brisbane. I might add that DHA has undertaken a massive investment in the Brisbane and Ipswich regions in the past few years as a result of the expansion of the military bases located in Brisbane and at Amberley in Ipswich. This has been a major boost for South-East Queensland, particularly in relation to construction and tradesmen. It has also brought in a massive amount of money into South-East Queensland.


It is proposed to demolish the current seven two-storey brick and weatherboard townhouses that are outdated and do not meet Defence guidelines. The current townhouses will be replaced by seven new townhouses and 48 apartments, all of which are to be occupied by Defence members and their families. This opportunity to redevelop an existing DHA owned site will meet the dual goals of greater housing choice and a reduction in rent allowance in a location where the majority of commuting by both the members and their families can be by walking or accessing public transport. The estimated overall cost of the project is $24.6 million including GST and escalation costs, but excluding the cost of land.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:50):  While there are some who choose to regard Gough Whitlam as the founding father of the Australia Council, it was in fact the creation of Liberal prime ministers John Gorton and Harold Holt.



Mr Garrett interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  I am glad that the minister is listening closely to what I have to say. In his address to the 40th anniversary celebration of the Australia Council, its Chair, Rupert Myer, put the council's history in its proper context. This is a direct quote from his speech:


""In November 1967, then Prime Minister, Harold Holt, informed the House of Representatives that a new Commonwealth agency would be formed to fund the arts in Australia.


That new body, arms-length and administered by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, with support from officials from other relevant government departments, and people from the arts, the law, the financial sector, and other areas of professional life, met for the first time under Prime Minister Gorton in July, 1968.


It assumed responsibility for theatre, arts and filmmaking and existed alongside the other agencies responsible for the arts—the ABC (symphony orchestras), the Commonwealth Arts Advisory Board (Visual Arts), the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the Commonwealth Assistance to Australian Composers.


Some of these had been in existence for most of the last century.""


So let there be no doubt that the Australia Council has always enjoyed, as it continues to today, the support of both Labor and Liberal Governments over the past half century.


Senator George Brandis, the coalition's most recent arts minister, in 2007 addressed the National Press Club and detailed some aspects of the coalition's support during the Howard government years. He said:


... funding for the Australia Council, which makes direct, arms' length grants to individual artists and performing arts companies, has risen from $73 million 12 years ago to $161 million in this year's budget—an increase of more than 110%.


So when the coalition talks about our concern for the future of the Australia Council, these are concerns borne of a longstanding and committed history of support for the organisation.


And it is in keeping with that longstanding commitment to the Australia Council that today we remain concerned that these bills propose what can only be considered the most radical changes in over 40 years to the body that administers the bulk of Commonwealth grants and funding to Australian artists and arts organisations. According to their most recent report, the Australia Council administers around $164.5 million in Commonwealth grants and direct funding to artists and arts organisations across the nation. The Australia Council provides Commonwealth funding to everything from Australia's major performing arts companies, like the Australian Ballet, the Melbourne Theatre Company, and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, to the wide range of community and regional arts organisations across Australia—around 170 of them in total. This bill and its associated bill seeks to introduce a radically different management structure, one which may not need actual artists and, for reasons that still remain unclear, makes changes to the list of legislated functions that the Australia Council performs. The coalition notes today that the minister, having publicly noted he did not favour amending these bills, has now capitulated and allowed for some amendments that acknowledge the government's more embarrassing oversights, like forgetting about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts practice.


The coalition does not oppose these amendments and it will not oppose these bills in this chamber. But that said, even with these amendments, the coalition remains concerned about what is contained within these radical changes. We also note that the government has not explained why it has waited until there were only 12 sitting days left in the Senate before introducing these bills. Nor has it explained why the review of the Australia Council was released in May 2012 and it has waited for nearly a year before introducing this legislation. Despite these failures on behalf of the government, we do not oppose these bills and these measures but we do remain concerned about the impact of these radical changes.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:54):  As a keen fan of the arts, particularly dance and visual arts, and as a former director of the Cultural Facilities Corporation here in Canberra, it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, which is particularly close to my heart. I have experienced first-hand both in Australia and overseas the important work of the Australia Council. While working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I was privileged to hold the position of cultural attaché to India. In this position, and also while working in Indonesia, I grew to understand the important role the Australia Council plays in showcasing the breadth of Australian talent to the world. While in India in 1996, Australia managed a huge intercountry promotion where we showcased everything about modern Australia and technologically advanced Australia. Through showcasing Australian in five cities over the course of a year, we had the opportunity to highlight some of our achievements in the arts—in dance and in visual arts. We had a major Indigenous exhibition, probably the largest that has ever been to India, hosted in New Delhi and the Australia Council played a very, very important role in making much of that happen.


What was particularly important about that year in India was the fact that the Australia Council hosted a week's conference where they met with their Indian counterparts to explore ways of engaging in further dialogue on the arts in every element of the arts and in further collaboration and mentoring as well as residences and a range of other activities. So I know from my own experience of being in foreign affairs, that the Australia Council plays a very active role in Australia but also internationally.


In Indonesia we also hosted an intercountry promotion in 1994, I think, and again, it provided us with the opportunity to highlight the range of artistic genius that is available in this country through dance, through visual arts, through musical works and a range of other activities as well as residences. It provided the opportunity for artists to engage with other artists in a range of collaborative efforts.


Labor has a long and proud history of supporting arts and culture. In 1908 the Commonwealth Literary Fund was established in order to provide pensions for needy writers or their families. This was the first of many boards and funds that would proudly support Australian artists over the years. It was under the Whitlam government in 1973 that the decision was taken to establish a single statutory body whose role would be to provide a coherent framework for the arts in Australia, encompassing the roles of many of the previously existing boards and funds.


In 1973, a new but interim body, the Australia Council for the Arts, was established and it sat within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Then in 1975, the Australia Council Act was passed and the Australia Council was established as an 'arm's-length' statutory authority.


The enabling legislation for the Australia Council is now 40 years old, and it is time that our proud tradition of supporting the arts is brought into the 21st century. The legislation we are debating today will ensure that the Australia Council has the capacity to adequately reflect the diversity, innovation and excellence of Australia's contemporary arts and cultural sectors. It will also ensure that the Australia Council is well placed to support the goals of Australia's national cultural policy, Creative Australia.


One of the key features of this legislation is the reform of the Australia Council's artform board structure to allow for greater funding flexibility. Currently, every member of the Australia Council's artform boards is appointed by the responsible minister. This bill devolves that power and gives the council new flexibility to engage expert responses to the demands of the sector. Under this legislation, the council's governing boards will have the power to appoint sector-specific advisory committees. This reform will empower the council to appoint a greater diversity of artists as peers to help support the strategic planning and funding assessment processes of the council. It is a particularly important role. This reform will mean that artists will be more easily and directly involved in deciding how the Australia Council funds projects.


One of the premier arts organisations in my electorate of Canberra and its surrounding region is the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. Founded in 1950, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, or CSO, has grown from amateur beginnings to its current position as the largest professional performing arts organisation and the largest employer of professional musicians in the region. It is also one of the only professional pathways for talented young musicians in the Canberra region. As the only professional Australian symphony orchestra with an Australian chief conductor and artistic director, Nicholas Milton—who is brilliant—the CSO is also a leader in the performance of Australian repertoire. Since 2007 the annual program of seven concerts has included at least two Australian works each season and in 2013 it will feature two world premieres and one Australian premiere of works by Australian composers.


The vision of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra is to create and foster symphonic music of the highest quality, to serve as a regional hub for music and to secure the future of fine music performance in the Canberra region. The CSO also engages in a fabulous program called Noteworthy for little kids. I have been to a number of these sessions, where members of the orchestra, dressed up in the Wiggles type outfits, introduce young children, aged from about three to nine or 10, to the wonders of live music performances and the wonders of classical music. The sessions only go for half an hour, because the attention span of children at that age is relatively limited, but what is wonderful about them is that the members of the orchestra gets these little children crawling around the floor like little tigers and flying like birds throughout Llewellyn Hall to wonderful pieces of music. This wonderful program is supported by the ACT government and it is a great way of introducing small children, our future generations, to the wonders of classical music in particular. Classical music is so important to provide soul food. From a young age I studied ballet, so at that stage I was introduced to classical music. It is particularly important that you get an understanding and appreciation of classical music at a young age and it can mature as you mature.


To achieve its big vision, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra requires a commitment of recurrent additional funding. The CSO first received Commonwealth funding in 2007 as a result of the Strong review into Australian orchestras: $100,000 a year was approved and has been received annually since then. In 2013 the CSO will receive funding through the Australia Council of a total of $101,606, plus GST. This funding is significantly less than comparable state orchestras receive. In fact, this constitutes just 0.2 per cent of the total of $48 million in funding distributed to Australian state orchestras annually.


Despite receiving significantly less funding than the other state symphony orchestras, the CSO, on a proportional basis, delivers outstanding results. It has the highest percentage of corporate sector and philanthropic support; it has the highest percentage of income earned outside of government funding; and it has the lowest government subsidy per seat, at $14—three times lower than the next orchestra, with some orchestras receiving a subsidy of over $150 per seat. Proportionately, it has the second highest ticket sales after the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Most importantly, it has extremely high subscriber loyalty, with an annual retention rate of over 90 per cent, which I am sure most arts organisations would kill for.


I believe that the reforms that will be implemented under the legislation we are debating today will, hopefully, allow for the more appropriate funding of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. I implore the future governing board of the Australia Council, and the future music advisory committee it appoints, to favourably consider the case of the CSO.


However, it is not just the CSO or my electorate that will benefit from this legislation. Across the country, countless worthy arts and cultural organisations, big and small, will benefit from these reforms. Artists will have new access to the Australia Council and new opportunities to influence its strategic planning and funding assessment processes, which is particularly important. This legislation will enable the Australia Council to become increasingly responsive to the changing needs and demands of the arts sector, including supporting emerging areas of artistic practice. These bills provide for the much-needed modernisation of the Australia Council and I commend them to the House.

Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:05):  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak today on the Australia Council Bill 2013. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge some of the country's amazing people committed to the administration of the arts and to its promotion in Australia. I have met a number of them and they are truly extraordinary people. They work not just for money but because they are truly committed to artistic endeavour in this country. I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding talents of artists in Australia and the contribution they make to the quality of life, providing a great deal of enjoyment to all of us.


But mostly I would like to raise some concerns in relation to the bill which were brought to my attention during a recent meeting with Andy Farrant, who is the former chief executive officer of Country Arts Western Australia and Regional Arts Australia. Andy held those positions during the Howard government and did an outstanding job in that field, taking arts to the broader community. Indeed, I think the community was well served under the Howard government policy and by the then minister, Rod Kemp, who served with distinction and gave great support to the arts community.


Mr Farrant has explained that many in the arts community, not just himself, are concerned about the wording of functions of the Australia Council in this bill which fails to enshrine the four fundamental principles of community participation, arts that reflect the diversity of Australia, upholding and promoting freedom of expression, and the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.


The bill changes the intent of the Australia Council and it does seem to abandon some of the core principles on which successive Australian governments have built their vision for an Australian culture. In fact, there seem to be a number of inconsistencies in this bill with other important policy and legislative instruments that have come before this parliament. For example, there is an inconsistency between the principles contained in the national cultural policy, Creative Australia, and the Australia Council Bill. There is also an inconsistency between the stated functions of the Australia Council in this bill and the Australian Sports Commission Act, and between this bill and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.


I want to revisit a little of the history, because I think it is instructive. The Australia Council is Australia's primary funding body for the arts, focusing on the highest levels of artistic endeavour. After its creation in 1968 as a division of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, it was established in 1973 as a separate agency operating at arm's length from government. It was Dr HC Coombs who described the conditions in the sector that led to the Council's conception and ultimate creation. He said that at that time:


In the performing arts professional companies, with one or two exceptions, were small, precariously financed and inexperienced. Even among the handful of large companies, none was more than two decades old.


…while in literature, visual arts and the crafts many creative individuals were forced to compromise their standards in order to survive. The Aboriginal arts, except where they struggle to survive underground, were largely depreciated or ignored.


The separation from political influence was seen as critical, particularly as controversy engulfed the arts after the 1973 purchase—who can forget it?—by the National Gallery of Australia of Jackson Pollock's abstract Blue Poles for $1.3 million. I frequently go down to the gallery here when I have an opportunity and I often sit and ponder that particular work. I think most Australians today have great affection for the work, and of course it is probably one of the most valuable assets of the National Gallery today. That is what really set the cat amongst the pigeons. Despite the criticism of the artwork purchase at the time, in the public and the political sphere, that work has become one of the most prized possessions in the gallery's collection.


To ensure that the vision of Nugget Coombs was preserved, and that there was no political interference into what the arts should be, the Australia Council Act was passed in 1975 with legislation explicitly setting out what the council's role, responsibilities and areas of concern were to be. This effectively quarantined arts funding in Australia from arbitrary executive influence. It allowed Australian culture to develop as explored through the arts and provided a means through which Australian artists could remain in Australia. In bringing the legislation to parliament, then Prime Minister Whitlam noted that the council would foster and support excellence in Australian artistic practice to 'ensure that our greatest artists remain in Australia, and that the whole Australian community is the richer for their presence.'


After 40 years it has broadened its focus from traditional art forms to a broad agenda supporting artists and organisations from the singular artist to major performing arts companies. In 2010-11 the council delivered grants and project-funding of nearly $164 million in the form of almost 1,900 separate grants, enabled the creation of over 7,500 new artistic works and provided direct funding to over 900 artists and 1,000 organisations. It now offers funding across 50 separate grant categories and 40 initiatives.


In August 2011 the then Minister for the Arts, the Hon. Simon Crean, launched the 'National cultural policy' discussion paper, and a review of the Australia Council was conducted as a review had not occurred for more than 20 years and the artistic landscape has changed dramatically. Despite the concern over the change in the artistic landscape, the first key conclusion of the review of the Australia Council, released in May 2012, found that Nugget Coombs'  original vision of the Australia Council, namely:


to ensure the best is encouraged, and those who produce it are given the greatest opportunity to achieve the highest quality of which they are capable—


remains relevant today. The review also supported continuing to keep the Australia Council at arm's length from government, but did note that the multifaceted purposes of the current act required clarification.


As a result of that review, the government decided to repeal the original act and substitute it with this bill we are debating the House today, but a number of previous functions of the Australia Council have been removed from the list contained within the current bill with no apparent rationale. For instance, the bill removes the function specified in the current act that the Australia Council promote the general application of the arts in the community. I think this is incredibly important. The removal is inconsistent, as I said before, with the national cultural policy with which the Council's functions are interwoven and which states the need to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to be involved with the arts as creators and as audiences. Unfortunately, all too often people in our rural and more remote areas do tend to miss out.


Instead, the bill outlines that the role of the council should be to support and promote the development of markets and audiences for the arts. This is a clear shift from community engagement and citizens as creators to a monetised approach, inconsistent with the vision of ensuring the best is encouraged, not just that which sells the most for now.


The bill also removes the current function that the Australia Council foster the expression of national identity by means of the arts meaning that the Australia Council will not have a legislative basis for supporting Australian arts and culture. The bill only outlines a fostering of excellence in Australian arts practice and the support of a diverse range of activities. Whilst excellence has always been the foundation for Australia Council, it exists also to promote an Australian identity and culture.


The review of the Australia Council explicitly notes that before the creation of the council Australia still looked heavily toward the UK in terms of our identity generally and artistically. That was the specific reason for including supporting Australian arts and culture in the current act. Now contemporary culture has moved away from the UK and is more heavily influenced perhaps by the United States, so, even though the dominant cultural influences change, the same rationale still applies. Support is still necessary for Australian arts and culture, and the Australia Council's efforts should be focused in that direction, continuing to uphold the foundation principles of the Australia Council.


A related issue is that nowhere in this bill is there reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture; unfortunately, there is also no reference under the current bill as well. That is despite the fact that Nugget Coombs specifically mentions Aboriginal art as a founding reason for the council, as I outlined earlier.


Creative Australia, the national cultural policy, has as its first goal the recognition, respect and celebration of the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. Therefore, it is only logical that a similar statement should be found within the Australia Council Act, as it will be the body that breathes life into the projects that will see the cultural policy become a reality. The fact that these critical issues are missing or have been deleted in this current bill was the subject of much debate during the inquiry held into this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I would commend a read of that by anyone interested in the future of the arts in Australia.


Rodney Hall, the former Chairman of the Australia Council, said: 'What is it about the existing Australia Council functions that warrants deletion? It seems to me that all of them are very worthy aims.' Emeritus Professor David Williams said, 'It does seem that some of the very best of the 1975 Act has gone by the book', and a similar view was put by Ms Tamara Winikoff, representing the National Association for the Visual Arts, who also preferred the existing functions with some modest updating. Mr Rowan Ross, representing the Australia Major Performing Arts Group, told the committee that he was unaware of the reasons why the existing functions had been changed; and Ms Gabrielle Trainor, who co-chaired the review which gave rise to the legislation, told the committee that the review had not specifically recommended the removal or re-drafting of any particular functions. Why then is it that provisions that have served Australia for well over 40 years have been changed? If we are to update them, such changes should be modest, Ms Tamara Winikoff notes, and include a focus on Indigenous arts and culture rather than a dramatic re-drafting.


It would seem that too much focus has been placed on the review's comments that the cultural sector has become a true economic force, contributing over $30 billion towards GDP per annum, exceeding the contribution of the agriculture, forestry& fishing industries. Instead, the aims of this bill should conform to the second half accompanying that statement, that:


…there are wider benefits that are not as easily quantified or identified. These benefits are seen in non-arts areas of our economy such as education, social cohesion, national imagination and health.


The original principles of the Australia Council should be upheld, and in my view these must be enshrined in legislation. To suggest that these issues could be dealt with in regulation is to put them under the control of the executive government of the day. The whole purpose of establishing the council under its own act was to ensure that it acted at arm's length from government—a view that was upheld by the review. Retaining the original aims of the Australia Council is critical to ensuring that Australian arts and culture have a strong foundation into the future and that we give the best support possible to Australian arts and culture in this country.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (11:19):  I assure everybody that has got concerns about this that I will be very quick. I want to do three things.


First of all, I want to congratulate the outgoing minister for arts for the enthusiasm which he brought to his portfolio. I think that needs to be acknowledged, and I wish to congratulate the parliamentary secretary on his elevation to this important task. I know that he shares the enthusiasm of the previous minister.


The second aspect is that I want to take this opportunity to ask, even though we have stressed the independence of the Australia Council, that the council take on board the need to make sure that all parts of Australia have access to the arts. Some people would be bemused that I am making comment because people know that I spell arts 'yartz' and I think that a great artistic performance is Jonathan Brown running with the flight of the ball, taking the mark and then drilling a goal from outside the fifty metre arc. As I prepare for retirement and my wife and I are looking for artistic pursuits to attend, I have to often indicate to the member for Melbourne Ports that I have not sought a visa to come into his electorate because, of course, Melbourne is the epicentre of the arts. I apologise to him for encroaching upon his territory, I know that he knows that I am no threat. I thank him for the recommendation to attend the NGV Monet exhibition, which I will be doing.


The third thing is that—and I hope that ministers that have had previous interest in local government will understand this—I wish to congratulate the City of Whittlesea, who won the National Local Government Award for a community art project. This was a project called, importantly, 'Into the Light 2012—the unfolding story'. It was a community project that the city of Whittlesea organised in King Lake. The project aimed to use art to address the ongoing recovery issues in the region, break down isolation and build connections between the fire affected communities. I think that it was a most worthwhile project, well worthy of its recognition. I thank the House for allowing me to be so self-indulgent.


I support the bill.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports—Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (11:22):  I welcome this opportunity to sum up on the Australia Council Bill 2013 and the accompanying Australia Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 in the second reading debate. This legislation is a key element of Creative Australia, the national cultural policy that has been discussed by so many speakers in this debate, including by the member for Scullin in his very kind remarks.


In introducing this legislation the Australian government is delivering a key recommendation of the 2012 review of the Australia Council and bringing about the most significant legislative reform of the Australia Council in nearly 40 years since the great days of Nugget Coombs. At the core of the reform agenda is the introduction of a new legislative mandate for the council. In fact, 10 of the 18 recommendations of the 2012 review of the council are relevant to the council's enabling legislation to the extent that a whole new act was called for.


I want to stress that these reforms are taking place in dialogue and in conjunction with the arts sector. The Australia Council is the nation's principal arts funding body so it is vital that the tens of thousands of people who work in our creative arts help shape and embrace the council's future directions. A sector as diverse as the arts has a range of strong and passionate views. The government—through the former Minister for the Arts, who was mentioned correctly by the member for Scullin as the honourable member for Hotham; the current Minister for the Arts, the member for Watson; and me, the parliamentary secretary—have heard the views of the creative community and we have acted. In prompting this discussion the member for Hotham set out a vision for the future of the Australian arts sector through Creative Australia, the national cultural policy. Through its $235 million package of new initiatives and reforms it has already been enthusiastically embraced by the sector, as the member for Canberra outlined in her remarks.


The Australia Council is fundamental to our Australian artistic identity for the reasons outlined by Nugget Coombs as quoted by the member for Pearce. The government is committed to growing the council's success and to its significant legacy. This is why the government accepted the recommendations of the review of the council, including investing an additional $75.3 million in the council over the next four years. This brings the investment in the Australia Council to over $200 million a year. This spending was confirmed in the budget. This funding will support unfunded excellence. It will support a new program of research and data collection so that the Australia Council can advocate effectively for the arts in all of its diversity. It will support innovation in our major performing arts companies, the flagships of Australian art practice. It will invest in supporting Australia's cultural leaders.


Now, with these bills amended to take into account issues raised by stakeholders in the Senate committee, we are introducing reform of the Australia Council—reform that is necessary and overdue, reform that the sector has called for and reform that sets the council up for the next 40 years and beyond. The bills have been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. At that time my colleague the Minister for the Arts, the honourable member for Watson, welcomed the inquiry as a further opportunity to hear the sector's views. He also noted a commitment to progress the legislation at the same time he was open to the committee's recommendations.


The House amendments developed in consultation with the Greens and the Senate committee are the result of the art sector's endeavours to ensure certain protections for artists in the day-to-day operation of the Australia Council. The member for Pearce suggested in her remarks just now that a number of principles by which the Australia Council was originally established were somehow at stake, but she did not seem to fully address the fact that these issues were addressed by the amendments and taken on as a result of the Senate committee's wishes.


These changes, importantly, recognise and celebrate the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to our nation's artistic identity. The member for Stirling and his distinguished colleague in the other place will be pleased that I am mentioning the function 'to uphold and promote freedom of expression in the arts'. There have been some suggestions that it was the government's intention to remove these provisions from the bill. This is simply not the case. The original bill stated that the council must take into account the rights of persons to freedom in the practice of the arts. Nevertheless, to remove any doubt about this, the amendment inserts 'freedom of expression in the arts' in the new functions of the council. It is very clear. I point that out to the members for Stirling and Pearce in particular.


The funding must also be delivered in a way that reflects the diversity of the arts and promotes the engagement of the community. Both those issues raised by the member for Pearce are addressed in these amendments. The arts are no longer simply passive experiences for audiences; community members are often actively involved in the process of a project and even the performance, and art is enriched as a result. The amendment recognises this important shift. An amendment also ensures that the committees have representatives immersed in established and emerging art forms to ensure quality peer assessment.


I thank everyone involved in the Senate committee for these valuable improvements to the bill. The government have listened to the views of stakeholders and to the arts community and we have heeded the committee's recommendations. The legislation put to the House in March has been updated accordingly. I can now confidently say that these bills with amendments respond to the issues raised by representatives of the tens of thousands who toil creatively in the arts sector. The framework for most of the proposed amendments is provided by the goals of Creative Australia. 


While the framework for drafting of the bills in the first instance was the Australian government's response to the 2012 review of the council, the release and positive reception of Creative Australia has raised expectations in the arts sector that the goals of the policy should be reflected in the new enabling legislation for the Australia Council. Now the council's role in supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts practice is explicit in the functions of the council. This reflects the first goal of Creative Australia to 'recognise, respect and celebrate the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to the uniqueness of Australian identity'. New functions are included that recognise the importance of diversity and the role of communities in shaping Australia's cultural identity. The very issues that the member for Pearce raised are addressed by these amendments.


The Australia Council is specifically empowered to support Australian arts practice that both reflects the diversity of Australia and promotes community participation in the arts. This is consistent with the second goal of Creative Australia—that government support the arts must reflect the diversity of Australia and that all citizens, regardless of their background or circumstances, have a right to shape our cultural identity and its expression. 


The intent of a function from the original Australia Council Act 1975 has been retained to ensure that the upholding and promoting of freedom of expression in the arts remains core business for the Australia Council. That was included in the initial bill as a matter that must be taken into account by the council in the performance of its functions. But in response to stakeholder feedback and the Senate inquiry, we are including it in a function of the amended bill.


On the bill's introduction the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Minister for the Arts noted that, since its inception the Australia Council supported Australian artists and organisations with two guiding principles: the pursuit of artistic excellence based on peer assessment—the very issue that comes from the vision of Nugget Coombs addressed by the member for Pearce in her queries about this bill, so there are consistencies there; and that funding decisions be made at arms-length from government. The government's commitment to these principles has not changed and will not change. Indeed, this legislation strengthens these principles. 


The final amendment to be moved by the government is the firming up of peer assessment principles. Under this amendment, should a committee be established by the governing board of the council to advise or make recommendations about policy or the provision of financial assistance in relation to any of the arts, the membership of the committee must include at least one person with relevant experience in the arts. This is being included to provide assurances to the sector that the longstanding principle of peer assessment of funding decisions is enshrined in legislation.


The amendments further strengthen provisions contained in the first draft of the bill and make explicit other provisions. The bill delivers on the Australian government's response to the review of the Australia Council and is consistent with the goals of the Australian government's 10-year plan for the arts set out in the vision framed by the previous Minister for the Arts, Creative Australia.


The Australia Council (Consequential Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 is a companion bill and contains consequential amendments and transitional arrangements related to the proposed reform of the Australia Council. In the main, the bill repeals the Australia Council Act 1975 and provides for the business continuity for the Australia Council, including its staff. It will ensure that the transition to the new operational arrangements are seamless—indeed, serendipitous. 


Ensuring that the continuity of key governance roles during the organisation's transition to new operating environment will be important for the broader reform agenda of Creative Australia to be implemented. Accordingly, provisions are included which allow for the appointments of the current chair and deputy chair to be carried over into the new operating environment. For similar reasons, transitional provisions will also apply to the office of the CEO.


Together these bills will bring the Australia Council into line with other modern statutory authorities and into the 21st century. I thank the member for Watson for his support in steering this, my first bill, through the House. I thank members for their contributions to this debate and support for this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:35):  The Greens support the amendments that are being moved. Many of these amendments come out of discussions that our leader, Christine Milne, and also our spokesperson for the arts has had with the government, and that has been reflected in the parliamentary secretary's statement.


The member for Scullin mentioned little while ago that sometimes he feels like you need a visa to cross the river to go south in Melbourne to visit some of the extraordinary galleries and the like that exist there. I know the feeling sometimes that there can be an impenetrable divide to cross south of the river in Melbourne, but I can say to the member for Scullin and to all others that we have very porous borders on the north of the river, and you can always come into the electorate of Melbourne any time you feel! Because, not only do we have a number of what might be considered to be orthodox expressions of the arts—very excellent galleries, performance companies and theatres—but what there also is in Melbourne, and this goes to the reason for the amendments, is a large number of people who work very much at the grassroots and the community level, especially in areas like Indigenous arts, doing things that really contribute to the culture of this country and contribute to what we would all call creativity in the arts, but who for many years have found it hard to knock on the doors of the Australia Council and of other funding bodies and have their activities recognised.


It is the leadership of many people, including those in Melbourne, and the artistic practices that they support that have led in part to this bill and to these amendments, and I congratulate the government for proceeding with this bill. For example, we have had the Next Wave Festival and people like the former director of that, Mr Marcus Westbury, who for many years have argued for reform in this areas—reform to the funding systems to enable the funding that comes, including from this place, to better reflect what is actually happening in the artistic community. The amendments that we have secured will reflect and strengthen that. I support the amendments and I commend the amendments and the bill to the House.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:50):  While there are some who choose to regard Gough Whitlam as the founding father of the Australia Council, it was in fact the creation of Liberal prime ministers John Gorton and Harold Holt.



Mr Garrett interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  I am glad that the minister is listening closely to what I have to say. In his address to the 40th anniversary celebration of the Australia Council, its Chair, Rupert Myer, put the council's history in its proper context. This is a direct quote from his speech:


""In November 1967, then Prime Minister, Harold Holt, informed the House of Representatives that a new Commonwealth agency would be formed to fund the arts in Australia.


That new body, arms-length and administered by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, with support from officials from other relevant government departments, and people from the arts, the law, the financial sector, and other areas of professional life, met for the first time under Prime Minister Gorton in July, 1968.


It assumed responsibility for theatre, arts and filmmaking and existed alongside the other agencies responsible for the arts—the ABC (symphony orchestras), the Commonwealth Arts Advisory Board (Visual Arts), the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the Commonwealth Assistance to Australian Composers.


Some of these had been in existence for most of the last century.""


So let there be no doubt that the Australia Council has always enjoyed, as it continues to today, the support of both Labor and Liberal Governments over the past half century.


Senator George Brandis, the coalition's most recent arts minister, in 2007 addressed the National Press Club and detailed some aspects of the coalition's support during the Howard government years. He said:


... funding for the Australia Council, which makes direct, arms' length grants to individual artists and performing arts companies, has risen from $73 million 12 years ago to $161 million in this year's budget—an increase of more than 110%.


So when the coalition talks about our concern for the future of the Australia Council, these are concerns borne of a longstanding and committed history of support for the organisation.


And it is in keeping with that longstanding commitment to the Australia Council that today we remain concerned that these bills propose what can only be considered the most radical changes in over 40 years to the body that administers the bulk of Commonwealth grants and funding to Australian artists and arts organisations. According to their most recent report, the Australia Council administers around $164.5 million in Commonwealth grants and direct funding to artists and arts organisations across the nation. The Australia Council provides Commonwealth funding to everything from Australia's major performing arts companies, like the Australian Ballet, the Melbourne Theatre Company, and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, to the wide range of community and regional arts organisations across Australia—around 170 of them in total. This bill and its associated bill seeks to introduce a radically different management structure, one which may not need actual artists and, for reasons that still remain unclear, makes changes to the list of legislated functions that the Australia Council performs. The coalition notes today that the minister, having publicly noted he did not favour amending these bills, has now capitulated and allowed for some amendments that acknowledge the government's more embarrassing oversights, like forgetting about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts practice.


The coalition does not oppose these amendments and it will not oppose these bills in this chamber. But that said, even with these amendments, the coalition remains concerned about what is contained within these radical changes. We also note that the government has not explained why it has waited until there were only 12 sitting days left in the Senate before introducing these bills. Nor has it explained why the review of the Australia Council was released in May 2012 and it has waited for nearly a year before introducing this legislation. Despite these failures on behalf of the government, we do not oppose these bills and these measures but we do remain concerned about the impact of these radical changes.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:54):  As a keen fan of the arts, particularly dance and visual arts, and as a former director of the Cultural Facilities Corporation here in Canberra, it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, which is particularly close to my heart. I have experienced first-hand both in Australia and overseas the important work of the Australia Council. While working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I was privileged to hold the position of cultural attaché to India. In this position, and also while working in Indonesia, I grew to understand the important role the Australia Council plays in showcasing the breadth of Australian talent to the world. While in India in 1996, Australia managed a huge intercountry promotion where we showcased everything about modern Australia and technologically advanced Australia. Through showcasing Australian in five cities over the course of a year, we had the opportunity to highlight some of our achievements in the arts—in dance and in visual arts. We had a major Indigenous exhibition, probably the largest that has ever been to India, hosted in New Delhi and the Australia Council played a very, very important role in making much of that happen.


What was particularly important about that year in India was the fact that the Australia Council hosted a week's conference where they met with their Indian counterparts to explore ways of engaging in further dialogue on the arts in every element of the arts and in further collaboration and mentoring as well as residences and a range of other activities. So I know from my own experience of being in foreign affairs, that the Australia Council plays a very active role in Australia but also internationally.


In Indonesia we also hosted an intercountry promotion in 1994, I think, and again, it provided us with the opportunity to highlight the range of artistic genius that is available in this country through dance, through visual arts, through musical works and a range of other activities as well as residences. It provided the opportunity for artists to engage with other artists in a range of collaborative efforts.


Labor has a long and proud history of supporting arts and culture. In 1908 the Commonwealth Literary Fund was established in order to provide pensions for needy writers or their families. This was the first of many boards and funds that would proudly support Australian artists over the years. It was under the Whitlam government in 1973 that the decision was taken to establish a single statutory body whose role would be to provide a coherent framework for the arts in Australia, encompassing the roles of many of the previously existing boards and funds.


In 1973, a new but interim body, the Australia Council for the Arts, was established and it sat within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Then in 1975, the Australia Council Act was passed and the Australia Council was established as an 'arm's-length' statutory authority.


The enabling legislation for the Australia Council is now 40 years old, and it is time that our proud tradition of supporting the arts is brought into the 21st century. The legislation we are debating today will ensure that the Australia Council has the capacity to adequately reflect the diversity, innovation and excellence of Australia's contemporary arts and cultural sectors. It will also ensure that the Australia Council is well placed to support the goals of Australia's national cultural policy, Creative Australia.


One of the key features of this legislation is the reform of the Australia Council's artform board structure to allow for greater funding flexibility. Currently, every member of the Australia Council's artform boards is appointed by the responsible minister. This bill devolves that power and gives the council new flexibility to engage expert responses to the demands of the sector. Under this legislation, the council's governing boards will have the power to appoint sector-specific advisory committees. This reform will empower the council to appoint a greater diversity of artists as peers to help support the strategic planning and funding assessment processes of the council. It is a particularly important role. This reform will mean that artists will be more easily and directly involved in deciding how the Australia Council funds projects.


One of the premier arts organisations in my electorate of Canberra and its surrounding region is the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. Founded in 1950, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, or CSO, has grown from amateur beginnings to its current position as the largest professional performing arts organisation and the largest employer of professional musicians in the region. It is also one of the only professional pathways for talented young musicians in the Canberra region. As the only professional Australian symphony orchestra with an Australian chief conductor and artistic director, Nicholas Milton—who is brilliant—the CSO is also a leader in the performance of Australian repertoire. Since 2007 the annual program of seven concerts has included at least two Australian works each season and in 2013 it will feature two world premieres and one Australian premiere of works by Australian composers.


The vision of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra is to create and foster symphonic music of the highest quality, to serve as a regional hub for music and to secure the future of fine music performance in the Canberra region. The CSO also engages in a fabulous program called Noteworthy for little kids. I have been to a number of these sessions, where members of the orchestra, dressed up in the Wiggles type outfits, introduce young children, aged from about three to nine or 10, to the wonders of live music performances and the wonders of classical music. The sessions only go for half an hour, because the attention span of children at that age is relatively limited, but what is wonderful about them is that the members of the orchestra gets these little children crawling around the floor like little tigers and flying like birds throughout Llewellyn Hall to wonderful pieces of music. This wonderful program is supported by the ACT government and it is a great way of introducing small children, our future generations, to the wonders of classical music in particular. Classical music is so important to provide soul food. From a young age I studied ballet, so at that stage I was introduced to classical music. It is particularly important that you get an understanding and appreciation of classical music at a young age and it can mature as you mature.


To achieve its big vision, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra requires a commitment of recurrent additional funding. The CSO first received Commonwealth funding in 2007 as a result of the Strong review into Australian orchestras: $100,000 a year was approved and has been received annually since then. In 2013 the CSO will receive funding through the Australia Council of a total of $101,606, plus GST. This funding is significantly less than comparable state orchestras receive. In fact, this constitutes just 0.2 per cent of the total of $48 million in funding distributed to Australian state orchestras annually.


Despite receiving significantly less funding than the other state symphony orchestras, the CSO, on a proportional basis, delivers outstanding results. It has the highest percentage of corporate sector and philanthropic support; it has the highest percentage of income earned outside of government funding; and it has the lowest government subsidy per seat, at $14—three times lower than the next orchestra, with some orchestras receiving a subsidy of over $150 per seat. Proportionately, it has the second highest ticket sales after the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Most importantly, it has extremely high subscriber loyalty, with an annual retention rate of over 90 per cent, which I am sure most arts organisations would kill for.


I believe that the reforms that will be implemented under the legislation we are debating today will, hopefully, allow for the more appropriate funding of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. I implore the future governing board of the Australia Council, and the future music advisory committee it appoints, to favourably consider the case of the CSO.


However, it is not just the CSO or my electorate that will benefit from this legislation. Across the country, countless worthy arts and cultural organisations, big and small, will benefit from these reforms. Artists will have new access to the Australia Council and new opportunities to influence its strategic planning and funding assessment processes, which is particularly important. This legislation will enable the Australia Council to become increasingly responsive to the changing needs and demands of the arts sector, including supporting emerging areas of artistic practice. These bills provide for the much-needed modernisation of the Australia Council and I commend them to the House.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:05):  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak today on the Australia Council Bill 2013. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge some of the country's amazing people committed to the administration of the arts and to its promotion in Australia. I have met a number of them and they are truly extraordinary people. They work not just for money but because they are truly committed to artistic endeavour in this country. I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding talents of artists in Australia and the contribution they make to the quality of life, providing a great deal of enjoyment to all of us.


But mostly I would like to raise some concerns in relation to the bill which were brought to my attention during a recent meeting with Andy Farrant, who is the former chief executive officer of Country Arts Western Australia and Regional Arts Australia. Andy held those positions during the Howard government and did an outstanding job in that field, taking arts to the broader community. Indeed, I think the community was well served under the Howard government policy and by the then minister, Rod Kemp, who served with distinction and gave great support to the arts community.


Mr Farrant has explained that many in the arts community, not just himself, are concerned about the wording of functions of the Australia Council in this bill which fails to enshrine the four fundamental principles of community participation, arts that reflect the diversity of Australia, upholding and promoting freedom of expression, and the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.


The bill changes the intent of the Australia Council and it does seem to abandon some of the core principles on which successive Australian governments have built their vision for an Australian culture. In fact, there seem to be a number of inconsistencies in this bill with other important policy and legislative instruments that have come before this parliament. For example, there is an inconsistency between the principles contained in the national cultural policy, Creative Australia, and the Australia Council Bill. There is also an inconsistency between the stated functions of the Australia Council in this bill and the Australian Sports Commission Act, and between this bill and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.


I want to revisit a little of the history, because I think it is instructive. The Australia Council is Australia's primary funding body for the arts, focusing on the highest levels of artistic endeavour. After its creation in 1968 as a division of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, it was established in 1973 as a separate agency operating at arm's length from government. It was Dr HC Coombs who described the conditions in the sector that led to the Council's conception and ultimate creation. He said that at that time:


In the performing arts professional companies, with one or two exceptions, were small, precariously financed and inexperienced. Even among the handful of large companies, none was more than two decades old.


…while in literature, visual arts and the crafts many creative individuals were forced to compromise their standards in order to survive. The Aboriginal arts, except where they struggle to survive underground, were largely depreciated or ignored.


The separation from political influence was seen as critical, particularly as controversy engulfed the arts after the 1973 purchase—who can forget it?—by the National Gallery of Australia of Jackson Pollock's abstract Blue Poles for $1.3 million. I frequently go down to the gallery here when I have an opportunity and I often sit and ponder that particular work. I think most Australians today have great affection for the work, and of course it is probably one of the most valuable assets of the National Gallery today. That is what really set the cat amongst the pigeons. Despite the criticism of the artwork purchase at the time, in the public and the political sphere, that work has become one of the most prized possessions in the gallery's collection.


To ensure that the vision of Nugget Coombs was preserved, and that there was no political interference into what the arts should be, the Australia Council Act was passed in 1975 with legislation explicitly setting out what the council's role, responsibilities and areas of concern were to be. This effectively quarantined arts funding in Australia from arbitrary executive influence. It allowed Australian culture to develop as explored through the arts and provided a means through which Australian artists could remain in Australia. In bringing the legislation to parliament, then Prime Minister Whitlam noted that the council would foster and support excellence in Australian artistic practice to 'ensure that our greatest artists remain in Australia, and that the whole Australian community is the richer for their presence.'


After 40 years it has broadened its focus from traditional art forms to a broad agenda supporting artists and organisations from the singular artist to major performing arts companies. In 2010-11 the council delivered grants and project-funding of nearly $164 million in the form of almost 1,900 separate grants, enabled the creation of over 7,500 new artistic works and provided direct funding to over 900 artists and 1,000 organisations. It now offers funding across 50 separate grant categories and 40 initiatives.


In August 2011 the then Minister for the Arts, the Hon. Simon Crean, launched the 'National cultural policy' discussion paper, and a review of the Australia Council was conducted as a review had not occurred for more than 20 years and the artistic landscape has changed dramatically. Despite the concern over the change in the artistic landscape, the first key conclusion of the review of the Australia Council, released in May 2012, found that Nugget Coombs'  original vision of the Australia Council, namely:


to ensure the best is encouraged, and those who produce it are given the greatest opportunity to achieve the highest quality of which they are capable—


remains relevant today. The review also supported continuing to keep the Australia Council at arm's length from government, but did note that the multifaceted purposes of the current act required clarification.


As a result of that review, the government decided to repeal the original act and substitute it with this bill we are debating the House today, but a number of previous functions of the Australia Council have been removed from the list contained within the current bill with no apparent rationale. For instance, the bill removes the function specified in the current act that the Australia Council promote the general application of the arts in the community. I think this is incredibly important. The removal is inconsistent, as I said before, with the national cultural policy with which the Council's functions are interwoven and which states the need to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to be involved with the arts as creators and as audiences. Unfortunately, all too often people in our rural and more remote areas do tend to miss out.


Instead, the bill outlines that the role of the council should be to support and promote the development of markets and audiences for the arts. This is a clear shift from community engagement and citizens as creators to a monetised approach, inconsistent with the vision of ensuring the best is encouraged, not just that which sells the most for now.


The bill also removes the current function that the Australia Council foster the expression of national identity by means of the arts meaning that the Australia Council will not have a legislative basis for supporting Australian arts and culture. The bill only outlines a fostering of excellence in Australian arts practice and the support of a diverse range of activities. Whilst excellence has always been the foundation for Australia Council, it exists also to promote an Australian identity and culture.


The review of the Australia Council explicitly notes that before the creation of the council Australia still looked heavily toward the UK in terms of our identity generally and artistically. That was the specific reason for including supporting Australian arts and culture in the current act. Now contemporary culture has moved away from the UK and is more heavily influenced perhaps by the United States, so, even though the dominant cultural influences change, the same rationale still applies. Support is still necessary for Australian arts and culture, and the Australia Council's efforts should be focused in that direction, continuing to uphold the foundation principles of the Australia Council.


A related issue is that nowhere in this bill is there reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture; unfortunately, there is also no reference under the current bill as well. That is despite the fact that Nugget Coombs specifically mentions Aboriginal art as a founding reason for the council, as I outlined earlier.


Creative Australia, the national cultural policy, has as its first goal the recognition, respect and celebration of the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. Therefore, it is only logical that a similar statement should be found within the Australia Council Act, as it will be the body that breathes life into the projects that will see the cultural policy become a reality. The fact that these critical issues are missing or have been deleted in this current bill was the subject of much debate during the inquiry held into this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I would commend a read of that by anyone interested in the future of the arts in Australia.


Rodney Hall, the former Chairman of the Australia Council, said: 'What is it about the existing Australia Council functions that warrants deletion? It seems to me that all of them are very worthy aims.' Emeritus Professor David Williams said, 'It does seem that some of the very best of the 1975 Act has gone by the book', and a similar view was put by Ms Tamara Winikoff, representing the National Association for the Visual Arts, who also preferred the existing functions with some modest updating. Mr Rowan Ross, representing the Australia Major Performing Arts Group, told the committee that he was unaware of the reasons why the existing functions had been changed; and Ms Gabrielle Trainor, who co-chaired the review which gave rise to the legislation, told the committee that the review had not specifically recommended the removal or re-drafting of any particular functions. Why then is it that provisions that have served Australia for well over 40 years have been changed? If we are to update them, such changes should be modest, Ms Tamara Winikoff notes, and include a focus on Indigenous arts and culture rather than a dramatic re-drafting.


It would seem that too much focus has been placed on the review's comments that the cultural sector has become a true economic force, contributing over $30 billion towards GDP per annum, exceeding the contribution of the agriculture, forestry& fishing industries. Instead, the aims of this bill should conform to the second half accompanying that statement, that:


…there are wider benefits that are not as easily quantified or identified. These benefits are seen in non-arts areas of our economy such as education, social cohesion, national imagination and health.


The original principles of the Australia Council should be upheld, and in my view these must be enshrined in legislation. To suggest that these issues could be dealt with in regulation is to put them under the control of the executive government of the day. The whole purpose of establishing the council under its own act was to ensure that it acted at arm's length from government—a view that was upheld by the review. Retaining the original aims of the Australia Council is critical to ensuring that Australian arts and culture have a strong foundation into the future and that we give the best support possible to Australian arts and culture in this country.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (11:19):  I assure everybody that has got concerns about this that I will be very quick. I want to do three things.


First of all, I want to congratulate the outgoing minister for arts for the enthusiasm which he brought to his portfolio. I think that needs to be acknowledged, and I wish to congratulate the parliamentary secretary on his elevation to this important task. I know that he shares the enthusiasm of the previous minister.


The second aspect is that I want to take this opportunity to ask, even though we have stressed the independence of the Australia Council, that the council take on board the need to make sure that all parts of Australia have access to the arts. Some people would be bemused that I am making comment because people know that I spell arts 'yartz' and I think that a great artistic performance is Jonathan Brown running with the flight of the ball, taking the mark and then drilling a goal from outside the fifty metre arc. As I prepare for retirement and my wife and I are looking for artistic pursuits to attend, I have to often indicate to the member for Melbourne Ports that I have not sought a visa to come into his electorate because, of course, Melbourne is the epicentre of the arts. I apologise to him for encroaching upon his territory, I know that he knows that I am no threat. I thank him for the recommendation to attend the NGV Monet exhibition, which I will be doing.


The third thing is that—and I hope that ministers that have had previous interest in local government will understand this—I wish to congratulate the City of Whittlesea, who won the National Local Government Award for a community art project. This was a project called, importantly, 'Into the Light 2012—the unfolding story'. It was a community project that the city of Whittlesea organised in King Lake. The project aimed to use art to address the ongoing recovery issues in the region, break down isolation and build connections between the fire affected communities. I think that it was a most worthwhile project, well worthy of its recognition. I thank the House for allowing me to be so self-indulgent.


I support the bill.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports—Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (11:22):  I welcome this opportunity to sum up on the Australia Council Bill 2013 and the accompanying Australia Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 in the second reading debate. This legislation is a key element of Creative Australia, the national cultural policy that has been discussed by so many speakers in this debate, including by the member for Scullin in his very kind remarks.


In introducing this legislation the Australian government is delivering a key recommendation of the 2012 review of the Australia Council and bringing about the most significant legislative reform of the Australia Council in nearly 40 years since the great days of Nugget Coombs. At the core of the reform agenda is the introduction of a new legislative mandate for the council. In fact, 10 of the 18 recommendations of the 2012 review of the council are relevant to the council's enabling legislation to the extent that a whole new act was called for.


I want to stress that these reforms are taking place in dialogue and in conjunction with the arts sector. The Australia Council is the nation's principal arts funding body so it is vital that the tens of thousands of people who work in our creative arts help shape and embrace the council's future directions. A sector as diverse as the arts has a range of strong and passionate views. The government—through the former Minister for the Arts, who was mentioned correctly by the member for Scullin as the honourable member for Hotham; the current Minister for the Arts, the member for Watson; and me, the parliamentary secretary—have heard the views of the creative community and we have acted. In prompting this discussion the member for Hotham set out a vision for the future of the Australian arts sector through Creative Australia, the national cultural policy. Through its $235 million package of new initiatives and reforms it has already been enthusiastically embraced by the sector, as the member for Canberra outlined in her remarks.


The Australia Council is fundamental to our Australian artistic identity for the reasons outlined by Nugget Coombs as quoted by the member for Pearce. The government is committed to growing the council's success and to its significant legacy. This is why the government accepted the recommendations of the review of the council, including investing an additional $75.3 million in the council over the next four years. This brings the investment in the Australia Council to over $200 million a year. This spending was confirmed in the budget. This funding will support unfunded excellence. It will support a new program of research and data collection so that the Australia Council can advocate effectively for the arts in all of its diversity. It will support innovation in our major performing arts companies, the flagships of Australian art practice. It will invest in supporting Australia's cultural leaders.


Now, with these bills amended to take into account issues raised by stakeholders in the Senate committee, we are introducing reform of the Australia Council—reform that is necessary and overdue, reform that the sector has called for and reform that sets the council up for the next 40 years and beyond. The bills have been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. At that time my colleague the Minister for the Arts, the honourable member for Watson, welcomed the inquiry as a further opportunity to hear the sector's views. He also noted a commitment to progress the legislation at the same time he was open to the committee's recommendations.


The House amendments developed in consultation with the Greens and the Senate committee are the result of the art sector's endeavours to ensure certain protections for artists in the day-to-day operation of the Australia Council. The member for Pearce suggested in her remarks just now that a number of principles by which the Australia Council was originally established were somehow at stake, but she did not seem to fully address the fact that these issues were addressed by the amendments and taken on as a result of the Senate committee's wishes.


These changes, importantly, recognise and celebrate the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to our nation's artistic identity. The member for Stirling and his distinguished colleague in the other place will be pleased that I am mentioning the function 'to uphold and promote freedom of expression in the arts'. There have been some suggestions that it was the government's intention to remove these provisions from the bill. This is simply not the case. The original bill stated that the council must take into account the rights of persons to freedom in the practice of the arts. Nevertheless, to remove any doubt about this, the amendment inserts 'freedom of expression in the arts' in the new functions of the council. It is very clear. I point that out to the members for Stirling and Pearce in particular.


The funding must also be delivered in a way that reflects the diversity of the arts and promotes the engagement of the community. Both those issues raised by the member for Pearce are addressed in these amendments. The arts are no longer simply passive experiences for audiences; community members are often actively involved in the process of a project and even the performance, and art is enriched as a result. The amendment recognises this important shift. An amendment also ensures that the committees have representatives immersed in established and emerging art forms to ensure quality peer assessment.


I thank everyone involved in the Senate committee for these valuable improvements to the bill. The government have listened to the views of stakeholders and to the arts community and we have heeded the committee's recommendations. The legislation put to the House in March has been updated accordingly. I can now confidently say that these bills with amendments respond to the issues raised by representatives of the tens of thousands who toil creatively in the arts sector. The framework for most of the proposed amendments is provided by the goals of Creative Australia. 


While the framework for drafting of the bills in the first instance was the Australian government's response to the 2012 review of the council, the release and positive reception of Creative Australia has raised expectations in the arts sector that the goals of the policy should be reflected in the new enabling legislation for the Australia Council. Now the council's role in supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts practice is explicit in the functions of the council. This reflects the first goal of Creative Australia to 'recognise, respect and celebrate the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to the uniqueness of Australian identity'. New functions are included that recognise the importance of diversity and the role of communities in shaping Australia's cultural identity. The very issues that the member for Pearce raised are addressed by these amendments.


The Australia Council is specifically empowered to support Australian arts practice that both reflects the diversity of Australia and promotes community participation in the arts. This is consistent with the second goal of Creative Australia—that government support the arts must reflect the diversity of Australia and that all citizens, regardless of their background or circumstances, have a right to shape our cultural identity and its expression. 


The intent of a function from the original Australia Council Act 1975 has been retained to ensure that the upholding and promoting of freedom of expression in the arts remains core business for the Australia Council. That was included in the initial bill as a matter that must be taken into account by the council in the performance of its functions. But in response to stakeholder feedback and the Senate inquiry, we are including it in a function of the amended bill.


On the bill's introduction the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Minister for the Arts noted that, since its inception the Australia Council supported Australian artists and organisations with two guiding principles: the pursuit of artistic excellence based on peer assessment—the very issue that comes from the vision of Nugget Coombs addressed by the member for Pearce in her queries about this bill, so there are consistencies there; and that funding decisions be made at arms-length from government. The government's commitment to these principles has not changed and will not change. Indeed, this legislation strengthens these principles. 


The final amendment to be moved by the government is the firming up of peer assessment principles. Under this amendment, should a committee be established by the governing board of the council to advise or make recommendations about policy or the provision of financial assistance in relation to any of the arts, the membership of the committee must include at least one person with relevant experience in the arts. This is being included to provide assurances to the sector that the longstanding principle of peer assessment of funding decisions is enshrined in legislation.


The amendments further strengthen provisions contained in the first draft of the bill and make explicit other provisions. The bill delivers on the Australian government's response to the review of the Australia Council and is consistent with the goals of the Australian government's 10-year plan for the arts set out in the vision framed by the previous Minister for the Arts, Creative Australia.


The Australia Council (Consequential Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 is a companion bill and contains consequential amendments and transitional arrangements related to the proposed reform of the Australia Council. In the main, the bill repeals the Australia Council Act 1975 and provides for the business continuity for the Australia Council, including its staff. It will ensure that the transition to the new operational arrangements are seamless—indeed, serendipitous. 


Ensuring that the continuity of key governance roles during the organisation's transition to new operating environment will be important for the broader reform agenda of Creative Australia to be implemented. Accordingly, provisions are included which allow for the appointments of the current chair and deputy chair to be carried over into the new operating environment. For similar reasons, transitional provisions will also apply to the office of the CEO.


Together these bills will bring the Australia Council into line with other modern statutory authorities and into the 21st century. I thank the member for Watson for his support in steering this, my first bill, through the House. I thank members for their contributions to this debate and support for this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (13:40):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report entitled Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, together with the evidence received by the committee.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—As much as I am very interested in the aged-care debate, I am glad to be speaking now on this report on the oversight of ASIC, which is of great interest to the community, particularly to those who work in the sector and those of us who rely on ASIC, along with APRA, to provide a stable and safe banking and investment sector. This report is part of the committee's ongoing oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in which it seeks to determine if ASIC is fulfilling its statutory responsibilities. 


As the corporate markets and financial services regulator, ASIC is responsible for monitoring the integrity of Australia's financial system. Areas within ASIC's remit include promoting financial literacy and consumer education, corporate financial services, consumer credit regulation and the supervision of trading on Australia's licensed equity derivatives and futures market.


The inquiry focused on key areas of ASIC's responsibility as well as issues of particular interest to the committee relating to topical and significant matters before ASIC. The standard of audit quality has been a concern for ASIC in recent years. ASIC's most recent audit quality report found a further decline in auditing standards. In its quest to improve audit quality, Australia has two crucial and unique attributes: firstly, an audit regulation framework and, secondly, an audit review process and in particular ASIC's audit inspection program. ASIC is a statutory body under the federal legislation, and accounting and auditing standards and auditor independence are all legally enforceable under the Corporations Act. These factors contribute significantly to the robustness of the audit regulation framework.


The ASIC oversight hearings in March 2013 provided the committee with an opportunity to explore audit quality issues with some of the bodies involved in the auditing process, including the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the Financial Reporting Council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, CPA Australia, Treasury and ASIC. The committee recognises that auditors play a crucial role in the system and is keen to ensure that ASIC retains a strong focus in this area. ASIC has responsibility for the supervision of real-time equities trading on Australia's domestic licensed market. Part of ASIC's remit is to examine market changes and determine the adequacy of the existing regulatory regime. ASIC's key objective is to promote investor confidence through fair and efficient markets.


Australia's financial markets are undergoing significant structural and behavioural changes. Two areas of evolution both within Australia and globally are high-frequency trading and dark liquidity, which is also referred to as 'dark venues' or 'dark pools'. High-frequency trading and dark liquidity have been the subject of considerable media attention and public concern. On 18 March 2013 ASIC released two reports on high-frequency trading and dark liquidity. The committee has examined these reports and will be pursuing the issues raised in these reports at the next oversight hearing.


The committee's 2009 inquiry into financial products and services led to the introduction and passing of the future of financial advice legislation to reform the financial services industry in Australia. ASIC undertook a consultative process on developing the FoFA reforms, including well-attended workshops in capital cities around Australia. ASIC has now finalised its regulatory guidelines on the FoFA reforms and has indicated it will take a constructive and facilitative approach to compliance in the first year.

  by leave—As much as I am very interested in the aged-care debate, I am glad to be speaking now on this report on the oversight of ASIC, which is of great interest to the community, particularly to those who work in the sector and those of us who rely on ASIC, along with APRA, to provide a stable and safe banking and investment sector. This report is part of the committee's ongoing oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in which it seeks to determine if ASIC is fulfilling its statutory responsibilities. 


As the corporate markets and financial services regulator, ASIC is responsible for monitoring the integrity of Australia's financial system. Areas within ASIC's remit include promoting financial literacy and consumer education, corporate financial services, consumer credit regulation and the supervision of trading on Australia's licensed equity derivatives and futures market.


The inquiry focused on key areas of ASIC's responsibility as well as issues of particular interest to the committee relating to topical and significant matters before ASIC. The standard of audit quality has been a concern for ASIC in recent years. ASIC's most recent audit quality report found a further decline in auditing standards. In its quest to improve audit quality, Australia has two crucial and unique attributes: firstly, an audit regulation framework and, secondly, an audit review process and in particular ASIC's audit inspection program. ASIC is a statutory body under the federal legislation, and accounting and auditing standards and auditor independence are all legally enforceable under the Corporations Act. These factors contribute significantly to the robustness of the audit regulation framework.


The ASIC oversight hearings in March 2013 provided the committee with an opportunity to explore audit quality issues with some of the bodies involved in the auditing process, including the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the Financial Reporting Council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, CPA Australia, Treasury and ASIC. The committee recognises that auditors play a crucial role in the system and is keen to ensure that ASIC retains a strong focus in this area. ASIC has responsibility for the supervision of real-time equities trading on Australia's domestic licensed market. Part of ASIC's remit is to examine market changes and determine the adequacy of the existing regulatory regime. ASIC's key objective is to promote investor confidence through fair and efficient markets.


Australia's financial markets are undergoing significant structural and behavioural changes. Two areas of evolution both within Australia and globally are high-frequency trading and dark liquidity, which is also referred to as 'dark venues' or 'dark pools'. High-frequency trading and dark liquidity have been the subject of considerable media attention and public concern. On 18 March 2013 ASIC released two reports on high-frequency trading and dark liquidity. The committee has examined these reports and will be pursuing the issues raised in these reports at the next oversight hearing.


The committee's 2009 inquiry into financial products and services led to the introduction and passing of the future of financial advice legislation to reform the financial services industry in Australia. ASIC undertook a consultative process on developing the FoFA reforms, including well-attended workshops in capital cities around Australia. ASIC has now finalised its regulatory guidelines on the FoFA reforms and has indicated it will take a constructive and facilitative approach to compliance in the first year.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (13:45):  Last Wednesday was World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. Every year on 8 May we honour the birthday of Red Cross founder Henri Dunant and celebrate the work of Red Cross members, volunteers and staff, who work all year round to support vulnerable people.


The International Committee of the Red Cross was founded in 1863 to provide humanitarian assistance for people affected by conflict and armed violence and to promote international humanitarian laws to protect victims of war. Australian Red Cross has been responding to emergencies and providing a range of humanitarian assistance since 1914 and is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, with national societies in 188 countries. In November Australian Red Cross will host the international movement in Sydney for its biennial global meeting.


Along with the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, and other colleagues, I am proud to be one of the one of the four co-convenors of the Parliamentary Friends of the Australian Red Cross, and I know you, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, join me in urging our colleagues to be part of this important group. Indeed, go one step further and give blood at the Red Cross bus, which will be parked outside Parliament House on 24 June. We encourage everyone to roll up their sleeves and give blood. One in three Australians needs blood in their lifetime; one in thirty donate each year. We need 27,000 donations each week, and I look forward to seeing many of our colleagues there.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1,speech
"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:16):  Three years ago in his 2010 budget night address, the Treasurer announced:


A strategy that will see the budget return to surplus in three years' time, three years ahead of schedule …


Two years ago the budget speech insisted:


We will be back in the black by 2012-13, on time, as promised. The alternative—meandering back to surplus—would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.


One year ago he announced: 



The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy …'



On Tuesday this week, in this year's budget, he says:


We have taken the responsible course to delay the return to surplus.


'Delay the return to surplus'! Under Labor there will never be a surplus. In spite of promising 500 times, going way back to 2010, that there would be a surplus in 2012-13, there is no surplus and there is, frankly, no surplus in sight. Five record budget deficits and two more at least yet to come. But no-one really believes that Labor has a plan in place which could actually deliver a surplus. The current Treasurer is pathologically incapable of doing it. The government is incapable of managing its finances to deliver a surplus. The government is so wasteful, so imprudent, so unable to manage its own affairs that there will always be deficits.


What alarms me about this government is that they do not even seem to care anymore about the deficits. We keep getting excuses: 'It doesn't really matter. There are other people with bigger deficits than us, so it doesn't really matter anymore.' What this government with its cavalier approach is doing is sentencing future generations of Australians to paying for their inability to manage their affairs. They are relying on an incoming government sometime in the future to pick up the bills for promises made but not funded in this budget—for the failure to be able to deliver a balanced budget over so many years.


The government has been incapable of balancing this budget, even though it collects $80 billion more in revenue than the last budget of the Howard government. The Treasurer keeps giving us excuses about the global financial crisis, coolness in the resource sector or a range of other excuses. But whatever his excuses are, the facts are he has at his disposal in this budget $80 billion more than the Howard government had in its last budget. That budget produced a surplus. Labor cannot produce a surplus, even with $80 billion worth of extra revenue. The reason for that, fundamentally, is that it is spending $120 billion more than the last Howard government.


People might not mind so much if it were not wasted or if in fact there were genuine measures put in place to ensure that that amount could be paid for. But, in reality, the money has been wasted. Labor is spending its way into deficit. There has been no loss of revenue; there have been increases in revenue. What there has been is an extravagance of expenditure: on pink batts, on overpriced school halls, on all sorts of other wasteful programs—things that in actual fact have not delivered a more productive society.


Today we see complaints again about a loss of revenue. There has been one phrase missing in Labor's rhetoric during this budget—one we heard a lot during the last budget—and that was the phrase that Labor was 'spreading the proceeds of the boom'. Today, the bad news is: there isn't any boom. This government has destroyed it. This government has driven away the incentive to invest. It has taxed away the capacity for people to want to actually invest in this country and deliver the boom. Labor has destroyed the boom. There are no proceeds left to distribute.


You just have to look at the mining tax. When it was originally proposed, Labor said it would collect $4 billion this year. Later they had to revise it downward to $3 billion and then $2.2 billion. But how much are they actually collecting? Two hundred million dollars. That is the proceeds of the boom: $200 million.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TRUSS:
  Lucky they are not in business—absolutely. And the prospects are not too much better for the future. The promised $22 billion is now down to $3.3 billion. As a result, they have had to go in and axe programs like the regional investment fund—$2 billion gone from the promises made to regional Australia. I wonder where the member for Lyne and the member for New England are. These are the people who backed the mining tax because they were given a promise that there would be investments in regional Australia. That promise was broken this week in this budget. The $2 billion promised is gone—the spreading of the proceeds of the boom that no longer exists. The government often talk about the extra tax that they would receive if they collected the same share of GDP as the Howard government collected. Well, if they spent the same share of GDP as the Howard government did, they would be in surplus.


Families have nothing to show for this government and its expenditure. What we got on Tuesday night was more debt, more deficits and more deceit. The Prime Minister's 'we will all share in the gain' mantra has now turned into 'we will all share in the pain'. Australian families are to be slugged with $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years. There are more taxes on super, the higher Medicare levy, the removal of promised cuts to family tax, and a range of other tax increases. Labor like to say that they have made $43 billion worth of savings in this budget, but of that $43 billion worth of savings $25 billion is actually new taxes. It is not savings at all; it is taking more off Australian families and businesses for Labor's spending program.


The Treasurer has now confirmed that the gross government debt will not just exceed the $300 billion debt ceiling but bust it wide open at $370 billion. Yesterday in question time, when asked about this matter, the Treasurer said that gross debt in 2012-13 is $292.8 million; in 2013-14, it will be $321.3 million; in 2014-15 it will be $345 million; and the peak is $356 million. Putting aside the fact that he got his millions and billions mixed up—not altogether surprising for this Treasurer, particularly when he is drawing up his expenses and his receipts—he actually stopped the answer because, if he had read one more year, he would have got a peak of $370 billion. When they legislate to increase the credit card limit, which is what will have to be done for the fourth time, they will need a minimum of about $400 billion to keep up with their runaway expenditure—the debt that Australians have to pay back. The government cannot make light of it; it all has to be paid back.


It is even worse when you consider that they inherited, in the bank, $70 billion. They have squandered the inheritance, and the money that was put aside to help future generations pay for the extra health and welfare costs of an ageing society has all been spent and wasted rather than being a legacy that could be used when it is going to be needed to meet the extra costs of an ageing society.


When the previous Labor government left office, they had a $96 billion mess of net debt to be cleaned up. Paying that back took the coalition government the best part of a decade. It required prudent and responsible economic management by the Howard government and a really mature and patient understanding from the Australian people. There are 16 of us in the coalition who were ministers through those years, and we know the discipline that was required. It is staggering to think that paying back Labor's debt over the same period would require a $30 billion surplus every year. This government has never produced a surplus. The next government is going to have to find a surplus of $30 billion a year just to remove the debt, let alone starting to rebuild the nest egg that is going to be necessary to meet the cost as our society ages and to meet the costs that will be required to manage our economy and our society in the way we would wish.


Labor's idea of prudent financial management, at a time when cost-of-living pressures are skyrocketing, is adding more baggage to families and to businesses to further constrain the economy. The Treasurer keeps saying that, no matter who is in government, they will have the same challenge of falling tax receipts, which would have to be confronted in a tough budget. Well, the basic premise that receipts would have fallen even under a coalition government is wrong. Falling revenues directly correlate to the crisis of business and consumer confidence that has been created by this government. Hopefully, we will do things better, take advantage of the global situation and be able to build on Australia's natural strength. We have seen failed policies that impinge on investment—like the mining tax, the carbon tax and the chopping and changing in superannuation taxes that undermines people's retirement savings. Families are frightened about what is going to happen next under Labor. They are fearful that, if they stick their heads up and make a go of something, this government will come down on them like a tonne of bricks. Business investment is being deferred, and big-ticket consumer spending is also being deferred.


The government is always desperate for excuses, but each one of these excuses is hollow. The Treasurer said again today that the high value of the dollar was the reason why the government was in financial crisis. Well, the reality is that the government does not get many figures right in its budget—some say it gets none—but, in the 2012-13 budget, the government predicted that the average value of the Australian dollar would be US$1.03. And guess what it was: US$1.03. That was the only figure the government got right. It budgeted on it being US$1.03, and now it wants to make an excuse because it got its budget right on one number.


They said, 'The trade weighted index has moved against us.' They got that right. They predicted it would be 77 in the last budget, and that is exactly what it has turned out to be. Now they want to use that as an excuse. This government has placed intolerable pressures on Australian families. Since Labor was elected, electricity has gone up by 93.8 per cent, water and sewage by 63.1 per cent, utilities by 79 per cent, gas by 61.8 per cent, insurance by 45.4 per cent, education by 38.7 per cent, rents by 30.2 per cent and housing by 29.6 per cent. Labor has imposed all of these additional burdens on families at a tough time. Yet through this budget they have means-tested family tax benefits. They have got rid of the baby bonus. They have frozen family tax benefits A and B. They introduced a flood tax in a previous budget and now there is a levy on Medicare. The government has cut and capped the childcare rebate. They have means-tested the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. They have means-tested the medical expenses tax offset and now require an extra amount before anyone can claim it.


There are dozens of these additional tax burdens that Labor has imposed on Australian families. This is a government that has lost its way. It cannot balance a budget. It has no idea how it can turn our nation to prosperity to pay off its own debts. It has no plan for the future. The only way Australia will ever get its budgets balanced and be able to work with families to achieve a better life style for themselves and for their communities is for there to be a change of government. May the next budget be delivered by a different Treasurer and a different government which will be competent and manage our economy properly.

"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (15:31):  I am delighted with this opportunity to respond to the very real ways that the budget of this government is assisting with the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. In doing so, I will do something that you did not hear once out of the 15-minute rant we just heard from the member opposite. That is to actually talk about some real measures, some real policies, some real costings and some real funded responses to benefit Australian families.


Did anyone hear one single policy from those opposite that would assist Australians with their cost-of-living pressures? Not one single idea, not one single real funded policy at all was put forward on a day when we are meant, according to the Leader of the Opposition, to hear a detailed plan from those opposite outlining what they would do in a budget put in place today to assist Australians with cost-of-living concerns.


I am going to start with one very simple principle that has led this government since our very first day. That is that one of the very best ways to address cost-of-living pressures for families is to foster an environment that provides jobs for families and that is exactly what this government have done. As a result, since we came to government more than a 950,000 jobs have been created. That is 490 jobs per day created since we were elected in 2007, whilst around the world we saw millions join unemployment queues. Around the developed world nations todays are still dealing with unemployment rates double, triple and more than what we have here in Australia. We were not prepared to sit back on our hands during the GFC as those opposite would have had us do and see Australia slip into recession. We know that the best support we can give for Australian families is an economy that supports jobs and support growth. So we are proud to be presiding over an unemployment rate right now that stands at 5.5 per cent, one of  the lowest in the industrialised world. In this budget we have kept our commitment to helping Australians to get and keep jobs, real commitment unlike the uncosted lack of policies and rants from those opposite. 


Through funding in this budget, the great work of our local employment coordinators will continue in 20 regions that are doing it the toughest in this country. There we will work at the grassroots and stand shoulder to shoulder with the communities that are not sharing in our prosperity. This is a great program. It is a program that has been singled out by the OECD as a best practice example of helping people get into jobs. Regions right around Australia will benefit from the $10.7 million announced in this week's budget for investment in local projects and partnerships. Communities in Ballarat, Bendigo, Bundaberg, Cairns, south-east Melbourne, south-west Perth, the Tweed and Clarence Valley and in northern Adelaide will benefit. 


The program also includes support for more jobs and skills expos, something that this government has been incredibly proud to put on in places right around Australia that were hit hardest during the GFC. These have been incredibly successful. What we are talking about is real results and real support for Australian families and we know that, through the jobs expos we have already held, over 26,000 Australians have been placed in jobs. That is a real support not just to those individuals but to their families and their local communities and local economies. This is something that we are proud to continue to support in the budget that the Treasurer outlined this week. 


We know that throughout the GFC we have focused on keeping people in jobs, in creating new apprenticeships and on maintaining economic growth. Our responsible budget strategy has seen Australia achieve the AAA credit rating from all three global ratings agencies for the first time in our history, something that the Liberals could not achieve in over 11 years in office. When it comes to our responsible strategy, the proof is in the pudding. In the worst economic conditions in 80 years, our economy is 13 per cent larger. We have had solid growth and we have had contained inflation. We are the 12th biggest economy in the world, up from 15th. With Labor, our economy has grown more than six times faster then the economies of Germany and the United States. This is how we assist Australians with cost-of-living pressures, this is how we budget to make sure that Australians who would be left behind under the control of those opposite are supported by their government. 


But if we want to talk about some more specific facts-and we did not hear a single one of from those opposite—let's put some on the table. Let's talk about some of the other supports that we have in place through this budget for families with their cost-of-living pressures 


Perhaps we could talk about the lower taxes, the three consecutive rounds of tax cuts in addition to tripling the tax-free threshold, and the one million fewer people who are paying income tax—anyone on $50,000 is paying $2,000 less in tax. That is a very real measure, one that we are proud to have put in place. We could talk about the schoolkids bonus giving eligible families with two kids—one in primary school and one in secondary school—over $1,200 a year. The schoolkids bonus is one of the few measures we have heard those opposite actually outline. They would scrap it and rip it away from those families who need it the most, making their cost of living issues even harder. We could talk about the historic increase to the age pension. Single pensioners on the maximum rate are now $5,300 a year better off. We know we are a government that wants to support those who are most vulnerable in our community, who wants to ensure that people do not get left behind and that recognises that older Australians, who worked their guts out for decades to build this country, should be looked after in their older age.


DisabilityCare Australia, the NDIS, is now law and will support hundreds of thousands of Australians with a disability in their families. We know that, in terms of cost of living, bulk billing rates have never been higher than under this government, reaching a record high last year with an average of 81.7 per cent of GP services bulk billed. This is a stark contrast to when Tony Abbott was health minister, when the bulk billing rates hit rock bottom at just 67 per cent.


Before I get to specific measures—and measures which were mentioned by those opposite interjecting earlier—in my portfolio area, around childcare in particular, I want to talk about a couple of other budget decisions which will be incredibly important for those who have been struggling with cost of living issues. Perhaps in the budget from 20 March next year we could look at lifting the income-free area for Newstart and other allowances from $62 to $100 a fortnight. We will also be making study more rewarding for single parents on Newstart by allowing them to keep the pensioner education supplement. Finally, we will also let single parents who are transitioning from the parenting payment and off income support to keep their pensioner concession card for 12 weeks instead of two. All of these are real supports. All of these will assist Australians and their families with their cost of living issues. All of these stand in stark contrast to the policy-free zone that we see opposite us in this parliament, just months out from a national election, where they do not have a single policy to help Australians with these critical issues. There is our $1.1 billion income support bonus from this week's budget being rolled out. That is more than $210 for singles and $350 for couples, a permanent increase to payments paid for by this government—something that the coalition voted against. These are all facts, something that those opposite seem to be allergic to. 


I would like to particularly focus on an area where I know it can be really hard for families: the area of childcare fees. That is an additional burden on their budget, and we have provided extra in that regard. In this area, our government and those opposite are absolutely worlds apart. In fact, what we saw in this week's budget is that we have more than tripled the investment in early childhood education and care from the level that those opposite were happy to see it stand at when they were in government. We do this because we know that these are the most critical years in a child's life. We also do it because we know it is incredibly important for parents to have some fee assistance when they are juggling the costs of this. We know that this is a record investment to improve access to quality care. 


In a time that is a tough budget environment, in a time where we have found $48 billion in savings, we have increased our assistance in this vital area for Australian families. We have already increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have already increased the cap from $4,354, where it stood under those opposite, up to $7,500 per child per year. In this budget, we have made a number of key choices around this. We know that it is vital for families to have assistance when it comes to childcare. We have decided that the rebate is not reduced; it stays at 50 per cent of the total cost for families. The cap on that rebate is not lowered; it stays at $7,500 per child per year. There are an unlimited number of childcare places that we will continue to fund. These payments are not means tested and are available for parents right across Australia so that we can assist them with their cost of living pressures and their move back into the workplace.


But let's talk about choices. We know that those opposite would put all of these vital childcare payments for Australian families under threat, because, rather than having a policy, rather than confirming that they will not cut, means test or reduce the cap on the childcare rebate back to where in was when they were in government, they say to the Australian public, 'We'll do a review after the election and then we'll tell you what we are going to do your childcare assistance.' They say to the Australian public: 'Just trust us. We're not telling you that we won't means test it; we're not telling you that we won't cut it; but we will let you know after the election how much childcare fee assistance we will give you.' 


I say to the Australian public that we have seen this before. We have seen this from state governments right around the country—and we know what this means. This means, 'We will cut your assistance, we will cut your programs and we will not tell you until after the election.' Every time those opposite say: 'We'll review childcare payments. We'll send it to the Productivity Commission to do an inquiry and report back to us and we won't give any assurances about what will or will not remain in place,' I would just  remind people of one thing: every time we have asked the Productivity Commission to look at childcare, they have come back with the same recommendations. The recommendations are that we roll it into a single payment and that we introduce means testing. That is what they have said previously and that is what those opposite have refused to rule out doing after the election. I believe that cost of living pressures are incredibly important for Australian families. I believe that childcare fee assistance is incredibly important to Australian families. I believe that Australian families deserve to know what sort of fee assistance they would get under those opposite and I believe that tonight, in the budget reply, those opposite should come clean about what their plans are for childcare fee assistance and stop hiding under a post-election review.


But, of course, we know it is not just about childcare. It is right across the board. They have already outlined that they will follow the pattern laid out by state governments around Australia. They will look at an audit post the election. They will look at what they can slash and what they can cut just like their state colleagues have done.


And, of course, when talking about the cost of living, we are hearing more and more about their real plans on industrial relations. We have heard more and more over the last few days. When it comes to cost-of-living support what Australian families need to know is that they have real penalty rates. They need to know that their wages are safe. They need to know that their conditions at work are not under threat. We know that it is in the DNA of those opposite—and we have heard it over the last few days and again today from Peter Reith—that they cannot be trusted. The party of Work Choices was and always will be the party that will be looking to strip wages and conditions from Australian workers.


I am very proud to talk about the real supports that we have put forward in our budget. The core principle of giving everyone a fair go and constantly striving to ensure that no-one gets left behind is in Labor's DNA. We know that it is in our DNA to put in place new and real measures to assist with the cost of living. That why this is a budget which protects those measures, which introduces real supports and which has funded policies and plans—which stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who say nothing except, 'Trust us; we will tell you what we are going to do after the election.' Today is the day that we all say that that is not good enough.


Tonight is the opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to spell out exactly how he would assist Australian families with cost-of-living pressures, exactly how those policies will be funded and exactly what will be cut to the bone in order to support their ideology and the measures that we are seeing right across Australia. If anyone out there wants to see what this Liberal Party would look like if they came to federal government I would say to them that they should look to Queensland. Look to Campbell Newman. Look to the job cuts. Look to the programs that have been slashed. Look at what they are doing, in stark contrast to the assistance we are giving Australian families.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (15:46):  The reality is that Australian families are paying for the economic and fiscal incompetence of the Gillard-Rudd government. Not only is this an incompetent government—perhaps the most incompetent government that has ever graced the Treasury benches in this place—but it is also one that is fundamentally dishonest. From the very start, this has been a government that has been prepared to deceive the Australian people—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Prime Ministers are often remembered for a phrase or some words. John Howard's famous quip about 'deciding who would come to Australia' is remembered by Australians. Well, if there is one phrase that Australians will remember this Prime Minister by it will be: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


That promise that she made and then ripped up when it became politically convenient to ensure that she was able to sit in that chair and take her place in The Lodge set the tone for the Labor government that we have seen ever since. And the budget presented this week again shows the fundamental dishonesty of this government. We had it last year with the overblown spin and hype from the Treasurer, with words to the effect of: 'I'm announcing tonight four surpluses over the forward estimates into the future.' They were the words that the Treasurer started last year's budget speech with. Well, here we are just over 12 months later. What has happened to those four fabulous surpluses that the Treasurer promised the Australian people 12 months ago? You had to be listening hard to his budget speech this year to actually find what the deficit for this year is. That fabulous surplus turns into a $19.4 billion deficit for this financial year.


But it is not just this year; next year there is an $18 billion deficit and the following year an $11 billion deficit. So four years of surplus suddenly turns into $19 billion plus $18 billion plus $11 billion worth of deficits—all accumulating and adding to the total debt of the Commonwealth of Australia. Those on the other side pretend that the debt of the Commonwealth of Australia somehow does not matter. But the frank reality is that it is the debt of all of us. We are the Commonwealth of Australia. You are the stewards for the people of Australia. And how have you conducted your stewardship? With fundamental incompetence and dishonesty.


Those opposite cannot even be honest in the way they describe things. Listen to the conceptual language used by the Treasurer in question time today and on other occasions—the corruption of language which has occurred under this government. They talk about 'saves'. If you ask an ordinary Australian what a saving is they would say that a saving is that you do not spend what you might have otherwise spent—when you put the money in the bank, so to speak. That is what we understand a 'saving' to be. But we have got this new piece of political corruption of language going on in which the Treasurer and others opposite talk about 'saves'. What are those 'saves'? A large proportion of those 'saves' are actually tax increases. If you said to ordinary Australians, 'Saving money involves increasing the taxes on Australians,' do you think that people would believe that that is actually a saving? Of course not. That again goes to the fundamental dishonesty of this government—dishonesty in terms of the language that is being used in this place and elsewhere, where a 'save', connoting somehow that that is a saving in terms of expenditure, is actually an increase in taxes on ordinary Australians.


Let's go to the slogan that is being used about this budget. This is a budget, we are told, that is about growth and jobs. If somebody said positively that this is something about growth and jobs, what would your expectation be from the budget, from the government's program? The expectation would be that growth is going to increase and, equally, that jobs are going to increase. That is fair enough. That is what they are trying to pretend to the Australian people that this budget is about—growth and jobs. Well, lo and behold, look inside the budget papers themselves and see what they actually show. In terms of growth, the forecast from the Treasury is that growth is going to go down, not up. So it would be more accurate to say that this is about a lack of growth, about an absence of growth, about a decline in growth, than to somehow pretend, through their slogans and spin—their fundamental dishonesty with the Australian people—that this is somehow about growth.


And what about jobs? Again, look inside the budget papers. In those papers it shows the unemployment rate in Australia increasing, not decreasing. If we are talking about an increase in jobs then the corollary of that is that the unemployment rate goes down. And yet the detail of these budget papers shows the employment rate going up to 5.75 per cent from 5.5 per cent where it is now. Even to use the expression that this is a budget about growth and jobs is a fundamental dishonesty. It is trying to pretend one thing to the Australian people when in fact the opposite is happening, and that is why I say this is not only the most incompetent government we have probably seen in the history of the federation of the Commonwealth of Australia, it is a fundamentally dishonest government as well. If you look at that in terms of what this means for ordinary Australians, it means that they are going to pay for it. Australian families are paying for this incompetence.


Consider the position of families in Australia under this government. In he cost-of-living increases since Labor came to power—the December quarter of 2007 through to the March quarter of 2013—nationally, across Australia, Australians are paying 93.8 per cent more for their electricity, almost a doubling in electricity prices under this government. Australians are paying 63.1 per cent more for their water and sewerage. For utilities, they are paying 79.2 per cent more—again, almost a doubling. Gas, up by 61.8 per cent. Even insurance has gone up under the duration of this government by 45.4 per cent. The government talks about schools—and I will come to that in a moment—education expenses and education costs have gone up by 38.7 per cent. Medical and hospital services—these are fundamental services that we are talking about—increased by 40.9 per cent. If you do not own your house and you are renting—many Australians are in that situation—30 per cent increase in rental prices in Australia. Of course, that has been compounded since the introduction of the carbon tax because, since the introduction of that, we have had electricity up by 18 per cent, and gas and other household fuels have increased by 14.1 per cent since the introduction on 1 July.


If you want to go to the dishonesty again in this government, I said that education prices have gone up by 38.7 per cent. Again, if you listen to this government, it says one of the lynchpins of this government is an increase in actual education reforms. Somehow, after the Gonski reforms we are going to be better off. A graph taken for the budget papers—it is not our graph, it is the budget papers' graph produced by the Treasurer—shows that over the next three years there are going to be more savings for the government from education reforms than there are from increased school expenditure. Once again, pretending one thing, spinning it one way, trying to convert the Australian people to believing that the government is doing the right thing. When you go to the detail in the budget papers themselves, what do we find? Totally the opposite. 


So Australian families are paying for the incompetence of this government. Whether or not it is the changes to the family tax benefits, whether it is the slashing of the baby bonus—a measure put in place to try and do something to ensure that we maintain a replacement level, or near replacement level, of fertility rate in Australia, these changes and the other changes are being paid for by Australian families, and why? Because this government is incompetent, and now it is being dishonest about it. The combination of an incompetent and dishonest government is something which Australians have found out and they know about it, because as I go around this country—as all my colleagues do—wherever you go in this country, people will tell you straightaway, 'Why can't we have an election tomorrow?' They want to have an election tomorrow because they are sick and tired of the incompetence and now sick and tired of the dishonesty of this government. 


The reality is that until we get a decent Treasurer—if somehow the Labor Party win the next election, you can be assured that Mr Swan will not be the Treasurer, his colleagues would make sure that—we are not going to have a decent command of the books in Australia, and Australia will not be prosperous as a result.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie—Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation) (15:57):  It is my pleasure to speak on this matter of public importance. I was starting to wonder whether in fact we were speaking on the matter of public importance. It took the member for Wide Bay nine minutes to mention the word 'families'—




Mr Wyatt:
  One minute.




Mrs D'ATH:
—and it took the member for Menzies nine minutes to use the word 'families'.




Mr Andrews:
  It was in my first sentence



Honourable members interjecting—  




Mrs D'ATH:
  My question is in relation to Australian families. At what point did we redefine the meaning of 'Australian families' to exclude people with disabilities? When did we stop thinking of people with disabilities as part of a family? Those on the opposite side keep saying there is nothing in this budget for families; there is no help for families in this budget. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, 'No hope in the budget.' We see from the MPI that according to the opposition there is no help for families, no easing of cost-of-living pressures. 


Despite hearing from the other side that they support the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the establishment of DisabilityCare Australia, what we see is the real truth when it comes to the opposition—how they value real reform in relation to disability care. They say there is nothing in this budget for families, and I say there is everything in this budget for families. There are families all over this country with children who have disabilities, family members who have disabilities, husband and wives who have disabilities, parents who have disabilities that are being cared for by family members. When do we in this country acknowledge these people as being Australian families? It is about time the opposition did. 


We want to hear about slogans and what leaders are known for. We heard the member for Menzies talk about phrases from leaders, what they are known for and what people remember. I also remember the Leader of the Opposition saying there would be paid parental leave 'over my dead body'. The question is: if there was paid parental leave over his dead body, why is it that, in coming into government, the opposition would like to slug over 3,000 companies with a new tax to pay for paid parental leave? If we want to talk about well-known statements by leaders in this country I am happy to talk about the statements that the Leader of the Opposition has made in the past.


But let us acknowledge what we are doing for people with disabilities in this country. It would be really great to hear from those on the other side that they actually appreciate the value of that help and what it means for the hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability and for their families and carers. That money will also mean peace of mind for every Australian. Anyone who has or might acquire a disability will have a new safety net to rely on. To those who say that there is nothing in this budget, my question is: what are you actually saying in relation to disability reform in this country that you are not genuine about supporting it?


This government is about providing a stronger, smarter and fairer system in this country. It is about supporting jobs and growth in this country. Again, those from the other side who have spoken on this MPI talked about there being no support for jobs or employment, in this budget. What do they think comes from investment in infrastructure? I was very disappointed to see that the member for Wide Bay, a Queenslander, did not stand up and support a budget that supports investment in infrastructure in Queensland. I heard him criticise the flood levy, a flood levy that helped rebuild Queensland after the significant floods in 2011. But when we talk about this budget, about investment in Brisbane—the Cross River Rail, the Gateway upgrade north, the Ipswich motorway, the $4.1 billion into the Bruce Highway package, the Warrego Highway upgrade, the Moreton Bay rail link—where was the opposition on these issues, on this investment in infrastructure?


We talk about what we are doing, about cost-of-living pressures and families. How about the fact that it is this government that introduced Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, that it is this federal Labor government that lifted the childcare rebate to 50 per cent, that it is this government that introduced the schoolkids bonus, that it is this federal Labor government that lifted the rate of the family tax benefit part A for teenagers, and that it is this federal Labor government that introduced the dad and partner pay? We do not hear those opposite talking about these initiatives.


We also heard that there are tax slugs for families. What about the fact that under this federal Labor government we have lower interest rates than at any time under the Liberals, saving more than $100 per week on an average mortgage? What about the lower taxes? There have been three consecutive rounds of tax cuts in addition to tripling the tax-free threshold. One million fewer people are paying income tax, and anyone on $50,000 is paying $2,000 less—that is how you help families in this country. I do not hear the opposition talking about those things. What about the fact that over 950,000 jobs have been created at a time when 28 million have been lost worldwide? What about the fact that our unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent is less than half that of Europe's, of 11.9 per cent? What about our AAA rating? If you want to take pressure off families, these are the things you have to talk about. What about low-income superannuation contributions? They were put in place from 1 July 2012—a tax cut of up to $500 per financial year to help low-income earners save for their retirement. How about the fact that if you actually want to help families into the future you give them the best education possible; you invest in high skills, in high-paying jobs. You do that by investing in education, industry and innovation in this country. You invest in research and development. That is what you do.


It took a federal Labor government to introduce a national curriculum across the country. For the first time, no matter where you go to school, you are learning the same thing. As someone who moved across borders as a child, I appreciate how far it can set a kid back to move across schools and find that they are teaching a single subject in a completely different way. You do not even have to move across borders; just by moving across government schools within a local area you would find they were teaching different things in subjects. That sets a kid back. A national curriculum is important, but so is investing in computers, libraries and multipurpose halls and new classrooms. What did the opposition do when they were in government? They provided flagpoles. That is great, but it does not help these kids' education.


How about investing in social housing and rental affordability? We have just announced a further $1 billion in new funding under the latest National Rental Affordability Scheme. If you want to talk about how to ease cost-of-living pressures on families, how about easing those rental costs in properties? I welcome the new NRAS properties in my electorate and the ones that have been built that have supported jobs in our local community and have provided more affordable accommodation in our local area.


If you want to talk about electricity prices and the carbon price, let us do that. Let us talk about the fact that the annual review shows that the household assistance has come out and provided adequate and effective support for families, because those cost-of-living pressures—electricity prices—as a component of the carbon price have gone up by less than the amount we have provided to families. If you look at what the individual states are providing in that area, you will see from their own figures—not ours—that last month in New South Wales the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal electricity price determination ascribed $3.25 to the carbon price there. In South Australian the regulator ascribed a $1.47 per week increase because of the carbon price; in Western Australia, $2.50 per week; and in Tasmania, $2.45 a week. So if those opposite want to talk about electricity prices, be honest: it is the network charges that are the problem, but I do not see one Liberal state government stepping up and doing anything about those cost-of-living pressures.


Let us talk about the opposition. We heard the member for Wide Bay say, 'We hope we would do better if we were in government.' Let us look at the 11 years that the Howard government was in government and having a surplus. Did they invest in health? No, they took money out. Did they invest in education? No. Did they improve the lives of people with disabilities? No. Did they invest in infrastructure across this country? Not at all, and we hear that they will still not do it. And they would not put one dollar into rail across this country. Urban rail is not a priority. Did we see them lift the base pension for pensioners when they were in government? No. It is only federal Labor that does that. (Time expired)

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (16:07):  I heard members on this side start with a statement about Australian families. Australian families deserve a stable, competent government that lives within their means and serves the best interests of those they supposedly seek to serve, and particularly to relieve the cost-of-living pressures that everyday Australians—mums and dads, families, single-parent families, families that are endeavouring to make a way for their children—face on a daily basis. 


This week the families of Australia have been hit once again by the economic mismanagement of an incompetent government. Families are endeavouring week by week, day by day, month by month, to juggle their income and their expenses; making decisions between paying a bill or buying food, whether to meet the needs of their children at school, paying for an excursion or paying a lighting bill. These are the challenges that everyday families are facing on a day-to-day basis. 


It seems that the other side, the government of the day, fails to understand. My question is: are you really listening? Are you listening to the needs of your communities? I am not sure that you are. In fact I question that on a daily basis when I speak to the families in my community, when I knock on their door, when I see them when I am out at a street stall, and they come to me and say, 'Louise, I cannot pay my bills.' 


The budget does nothing to help Australian families deal with cost-of-living pressures, economic uncertainty and poor services. It does little to provide them with hope for their future. After six years of rising prices and increasing costs, our families need a break. The phrase 'cost of living' is not just a phrase; it bears little weight I think with the government of the day. What the government of the day fails to understand is that behind this phrase are thousands of families—small families, large families, single-parent families—that are doing it tough. These families are living with the fear of getting hit with another bill that they simply cannot afford. They plan a budget but then the bills keep rising. The budget blows out. But they are endeavouring to manage to live within their means; something that this government is failing to do. 


Families are trying to make household budgets stretch, to pay rents or mortgages, groceries, bills, petrol, school uniforms, textbooks, excursions. It all adds up. We know that parents try to do the best they can, but sometimes the numbers just don't add up and parents may have to go without to provide for their children.


The Australian people have clearly lost faith in this government. At the heart of this growing discontent lies very deep and very real concern that this government is pursuing a course of extraordinary political and economic mismanagement that will burden our nation and people for decades to come. 


At the start of National Families Week, this week, Labor's budget has delivered another cruel blow to Australian families. The budget delivers more debt, more deficits, more taxes, more broken promises and a greater level of uncertainty. 


Let's look at this government's track record—and this was alluded to by members earlier. Since 2007, the cost of electricity has increased by 93.8 per cent. Water and sewerage has increased 63.1 per cent. Gas has increased 61.8 per cent. Medical and health services are up 40.9 per cent and rents have increased by 30.2 per cent. The member for Menzies mentioned earlier that these are not luxuries; these are basics. These are things that every family, every individual and every community needs to spend money on every week, every month, every year.


And this is just the start. There are numerous initiatives in this budget that disadvantage families. The abolition of the baby bonus is an example; an initiative delivered courtesy of the Intergenerational Report to ensure that Australia maintains an adequate birth rate. This will mean more than 150,000 families will be worse off. The increase to the Medicare levy will also hit family budgets. The average Australian family earning $70,000 a year will be $350 worse off. There was also the broken promise of child care. Child care was talked about earlier. Labor have broken their promise that the indexation of the childcare rebate would recommence in 2014. 


Labor simply cannot be trusted. What is written in black and white by this Labor government today cannot be trusted tomorrow. At a time when childcare costs are increasing for more families, this decision will hurt financially. Families will also be worse off under Labor after the government announced an extension to the indexation pauses on income thresholds for family payments and FTB supplement payments until 2017. This decision will impact the 1.5 million families who receive family tax benefit part A and the 1.3 million families who receive family tax benefit part B, as the FTB supplement payments fail to keep pace with the rising cost of living. 


In the electorate of Macquarie there is a strong loss of confidence in both the economic and social future of our country. Families are clearly struggling. I spoke recently to the Stubbs family in Windsor, who have three children; two at school and one in child care. Their main concern has been the rising costs, particularly of their electricity bills. Every quarter it gets harder for them to predict what their bill will be—what will it look like—and it causes incredible levels of stress and uncertainty. 


Our welfare centre in Katoomba, run by the Salvation Army, has reported a growing number of families reaching out for help over the last 18 months. This is reflected in every single non-government organisation that hands out emergency relief. People are requesting more help with paying bills, assistance with buying food and clothing. 


In fact many of these agencies refer to the 'working poor', families with one or two incomes who are struggling to pay their bills. That is something that was not happening five, six or seven years ago. They have also experienced an increase in participants in their program to assist families with their household budgets. This pattern is consistent across the nation. The number of families needing financial and material assistance through not-for-profit organisations has increased considerably. 


Can I say: this was not necessary. Only the coalition has a clear plan for easing the cost-of-living pressures for families. The coalition and I believe in Australia. We believe that all Australians deserve a brighter and more optimistic future. That is why we have a plan to build a stronger, more prosperous nation, so that all Australians can have opportunities in a global economy. 


We believe that strong families underpin a strong and flourishing society. They are our foundation. We must support families. We must create an economy and provide opportunities and rewards for hardworking parents. As a coalition we have a clear commitment to families. We will abolish the carbon tax, which has caused significant damage to families with rising utility costs. This tax has failed to achieve reductions in emissions and is hurting everyday Australians—pain with absolutely no gain. We will put downward pressure on prices, getting the ACCC to make sure that prices do not remain artificially raised when we abolish the carbon tax. We will fund personal income tax cuts for individuals and families. We will protect and strengthen Medicare by restoring the private health insurance rebate as soon as we possibly can.


We understand the urgent need for accessible, affordable and flexible child care for families, and we will have the Productivity Commission urgently undertake a major inquiry into the childcare system. We will look at different ways child care can become more flexible and responsive to the differing needs and lifestyles of parents. It is clear that work patterns and demands on parents are different today than they were even a decade ago. We will deliver a genuine paid parental leave scheme to give mothers six months leave based on their actual wage. This will mean that young families are given options and flexibility to balance work and family and will not be forced to survive on a single wage. The truth is, only the coalition understands economic pressure on families and only the coalition has a clear way forward for them.


The government has a spending problem. It has been given enough chances to get it right. Enough is enough. The budget delivers more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years, 99 per cent of which will hit Australians after the next election. After six years of chaos, debt and spin, Australians deserve stable and competent economic management so they can have confidence in a government that will live within its means and that will work to ensure that families have priority and that they have the opportunities, on a foundation that is firm, to step into their future with confidence.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (16:17):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance today because I hold great concern for the people of Macarthur, who are struggling to make ends meet. I am concerned, but not surprised, that this week's budget has failed to address the cost-of-living pressures on all Australians. Since elected, this Labor government has done nothing to ease cost-of-living pressures for families in my electorate and around the nation. Since 2007 the cost of electricity has increased by 93.8 per cent, the cost of water and sewerage by 63.1 per cent, the cost of gas by 61.8 per cent, the cost of medical and health services by 40.9 per cent, and the cost of rents by 30.2 per cent—certainly not a track record the government would be proud of.


The rising cost of living has had a huge impact on the quality of life of many families in Macarthur. To put it simply: they have had enough. The people of Macarthur are hardworking, honest people who want nothing but the best for their children and the future generations of this country. More than 70 per cent of the workers in my electorate commute out of the area to work every day so they can earn a decent wage and compete with the rising cost of living. They are working hard to pay off their mortgage and balance the family budget. They are trying to decrease their own debt and reduce their credit limits. So you can imagine how frustrating it would be for them to see their own government's wasteful spending result in almost $300 billion of debt, reaching national debt record interest payments of $7.8 billion per year. That is almost $50 million per day in borrowings. The government does not have a revenue problem; it definitely has a spending problem.


Recently thousands of people across Macarthur raised with me, through Macarthur's biggest survey, their concerns about the rising cost of living. More than 90 per cent of our residents who took part in the survey said the cost of living was too high. Many families in my electorate are struggling to make ends meet. I recently met a lovely family in Rosemeadow, who said the rising cost of living means that their children are missing out on some of the things that they once took for granted. Mum and Dad are both working. One income covers the mortgage and the other income barely covers the electricity bills, water bills, grocery bills and council rates—all of which have gone up thanks to this Labor government's record debt and toxic carbon tax. This means there is no money left for the children in this family to take part in after-school activities or sports teams with their friends. There is simply not enough money left in the family budget. Since when did joining a local sports team become a luxury expense? These parents want nothing more than the best for their children but said that there are times when they wonder if working hard to pay off a mortgage and refusing to depend on government handouts is the right thing to do. They want their children to have a bright future but are struggling to stay on top of the bills and keep food on the table because of the rising cost of living.


It is obvious to me that, since this Labor government began its wasteful spending, new taxes and broken promises, the quality of life of many people in my electorate has diminished. Labor's carbon tax only adds insult to injury for household budgets that are already under pressure. The carbon tax was met with great contempt by the people of Macarthur. The increased cost for small businesses and the rise in electricity prices for local residents mean they are struggling to make ends meet. I have shaken the freezing-cold hands of pensioners in their homes, where they are too scared to turn on their heaters because of their fear of rising electricity prices. One lady told me she has cut back to eating one meal a day and showering every second day because she is fearful of her rising electricity bills—fear, insecurity and instability all caused by this reckless government. The message I am hearing in Macarthur is very clear: families and small businesses are desperate for a government they can have confidence in . Families are struggling with the rising cost of living, and businesses are closing down under the uncertainty of this Labor government. The two most frequent issues raised with me by residents in Macarthur have been the rising cost of living and this government's debt. The decent, hardworking people in my electorate are really doing it tough, and the government is not paying attention.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr MATHESON:
  It is a bit like the member for Shortland: the lights are on, but nobody's home. She also interjects all the time.


Not only are they struggling with the cost-of-living pressures, but they also see no relief in this week's budget from a government that has lost touch with everyday Australians. On Tuesday night Macarthur residents were let down by another bad budget. Labor have delivered a fifth record deficit in five years, yet they claim they will return the budget to surplus in three years. How can you trust them? The people of Macarthur and the people of Australia are not easily fooled. They have been let down too many times before and see that this Labor government have no credible path back to surplus. Revenue in 2013-14 is projected to be $80 billion higher than at the end of the Howard government. Yet with this budget spending in 2013-14 will be $120 billion higher than it was at the end of the Howard government.


Over the past five years the government has spent $192 billion more than it has raised. Expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been higher every year under a Labor government compared with the last years of the Howard government. Labor's interest payments are now at almost $20 million a day. The budget delivers more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years. To rub salt into the wounds of all Australians, this budget includes an extra $100 million in spending on government advertising. How can this government justify the $100 million on advertising when pensioners in my electorate cannot afford to heat their homes or have a shower every day?


This week's budget has certainly failed to address the rising cost of living. In fact, it has only made it worse. Families will be worse off with the government's announcement to extend the pause on the income thresholds for family payments and the family tax benefit supplement payments until 2017. This decision will impact upon 1.5 million families who receive family tax benefit part A and 1.3 million families who received family tax benefit part B, as these supplement payments fail to keep pace with the rising cost of living. The Labor government's decision to scrap these planned family tax benefits will impact upon 12,261 families in Macarthur. This benefit would have provided up to $300 to eligible families with one child and up to $600 for families with two or more children. What happened to the government's promise to spread the benefits of the boom? It is just another broken promise and other let down for the people of Macarthur.


Labor also made promises on company tax for businesses at the last election and then took them away last year, saying the money would go towards family payments instead. Now those family payments have been taken away before they were meant to start. Families across the country are literally paying the price of this government's reckless spending and waste.


I can tell you now that more than 12,000 Macarthur families have taken a clear message away from this decision: Labor cannot be trusted to keep its promises nor honour its word. Labor promised no carbon tax, a budget surplus, 500,000 new jobs and increased family payments. Every one of these promises has been broken. The people of Macarthur deserve a government that sticks to its word. They deserve a government that will focus on sensible economic management, with a strong plan to pay back the debt and return to balanced budgets. Labor's latest attacks on family support payments and household budgets have come at a time when families can least afford it.


Macarthur families will also suffer as a result of this budget's broken promise on child care. At a time when childcare costs are increasing, Labor has broken its promise that the indexation of the childcare rebate would recommence in 2014. Another broken promise. The increase to the Medicare levy will also mean that the average Australian family earning $70,000 will be $350 a year worse off.


Record debt and rising costs of living for Australian families are also the result of a long list of incompetent polices that this government has blundered in its short time in office: the border protection fiasco, pink batts, set-top boxes and the BER school halls debacle. They raised 'cash for clunkers' and dropped it like a hot potato. Then there is the carbon tax promise. All of these failed policies have come at a huge cost to taxpayers across Australia and have contributed to the massive debt we find ourselves in.


It is not just families and businesses that are struggling with the rising cost of living. Charities in my electorate are also feeling the pinch. Charities and not-for-profit agencies have to spend much of their hard-earned money on rising bills rather than on those doing it tough in the community. In this country we now have an urgent need for a government that is focused on the needs of all Australians.


I stand here today as a proud member of the coalition, because I know that a stable and secure coalition government will help the people of Macarthur. The first thing we will do is get rid of the carbon tax. We will reduce regulation by $1 billion. We will cut back on government waste and mismanagement. We will introduce new economic policies that will ensure a stable and well-run economy. The coalition has the experience and the discipline to return a budget to sustainable surpluses, reduce debt and provide real support for Macarthur families to help them get ahead again. A coalition government would give businesses in Macarthur the certainty they need to prosper. We will create stronger jobs growth by building a diverse, world-class, five-pillar economy and we will generate one million new jobs over the next five years.


My hope for the sake of my children and future grandchildren is that this country will never again be in the financial mess that it is in now. The people of Australia and the people of Macarthur deserve better. They deserve a government that will reduce the cost of living by bringing the budget to sustainable surpluses and reducing the debt. They deserve the right to be excited about the future of our country and the future of their families. After six years of chaos, debt and spin the people of Macarthur are desperately seeking stable and competent economic management. A coalition government will build a strong, prosperous economy, a safe and secure Australia and restore the hope, rewards and opportunity that the people of Macarthur deserve.


Discussion concluded.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (16:27):  by leave—I would like to inform the House of progress with preparations for the centenary of the First World War—the 'Anzac Centenary'.


I am pleased to report that Australia is well placed for the Anzac Centenary. The Centenary will be one of the most significant commemorative events in our history. Central to this will, of course, be the dawn service in Gallipoli, in 2015. Another key event will be the Armistice Day, in 2018. And, of course, there will be many important dates to commemorate over the four-year centenary period.


The government is confident that the programs and initiatives identified so far will ensure that our nation will be able to proudly acknowledge the service of all servicemen and women.


I welcome the bipartisan approach taken by the opposition in regard to the Anzac Centenary. The government and the opposition, and all other members of parliament, recognise the significance of the Centenary for the nation.


On 4 August 2014—some 15 months away now—worldwide commemorations marking the centenary of the First World War will start.


For Australia, the Great War was tragic, profound and transformational. From a nation of some four to five million people at the time, over 400,000 Australians volunteered and more than 330,000 served overseas. More than 60,000 never came home. Alongside the carnage and the suffering, we were witness to courage, tenacity, resilience and mateship—values that helped shape a young nation.


During the Anzac Centenary, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice of those Australians who permanently linked these values and qualities with the name, 'Anzac'.


Planning by the government for the Anzac Centenary began on Anzac Day 2010 with the establishment of the National Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary.


The commission—led by former prime ministers the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser PC, AC, CH and the Hon. Bob Hawke AC—reported to government in March 2011 and recommended the establishment of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board to carry the baton forward by developing a blueprint for a program of Anzac Centenary initiatives.


Since its establishment in October 2011, the board has provided regular advice to the government on the development of a blueprint for the Anzac Centenary Program. The board has also undertaken extensive consultation with the states and territories and local communities. On 21 April 2013, the government released the board's report on a program of initiatives to commemorate the Anzac Centenary. The board report put forward 25 recommendations, all of which the government was pleased to accept.


I would like to thank the board and its chair, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC, AFC (Ret'd) for their excellent, well-considered document. This report will be fundamental to shaping how we see the Anzac centenary and how we commemorate it.


I want to turn now to the details of the proposed Anzac Centenary Program. The centenary will be a time when we commemorate a century, or more, of service and sacrifice by Australian service men and women in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has participated, and continues to participate. It will be a time when we will honour generations of Australia's service men and women, past and present, and when we will see the continuity and the strength of the ANZAC inheritance. It is very much with us today, and will be with us into the future.


In delivering the report to government, Air Chief Marshal Houston noted that unfortunately we live in a world that is far from peaceful and Australian servicemen and service women will continue to face dangers. Learning from the experience of Australians at war, and their families, over the last century or more remains vitally important and relevant today.


The national flagship initiative for the centenary will be a travelling exhibition. This will be an exhibition unlike anything most Australians have seen before. The government is determined that it will bring the Anzac centenary to rural, regional and urban communities across the country. It is intended that the travelling exhibition will immerse participants in simulations of the sights, sounds and objects of the major battlefields in which Australians fought. The exhibition will travel throughout Australia during the centenary period, potentially meeting 85 per cent of the population. The government has provided $10 million in seed funding for the travelling exhibition to ensure its planning can proceed. I am confident that the private sector will wish to contribute substantially to bring this initiative to fruition.


Community participation will be the main way we ensure the Anzac legacy is passed to the next generation. This is one of the main aims of the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program which the government announced in early 2013. The program will provide $100,000 to each of Australia's 150 federal electorates, from 01 July 2013, to support communities commemorating the centenary in ways of their own choosing. Community involvement in developing projects to be considered for funding is already well underway. I encourage honourable members to work with their communities to generate ideas and make the most of this initiative.


Another iconic project is the protection and preservation of the Australian submarine HMAS AE2. Many Australians are probably unaware that the largest Australian relic from the Gallipoli campaign was not located until 1998 and lies, where it sank, at the bottom of the Sea of Marmara in present-day Turkey. It was scuttled by its crew after being struck by fire from an Ottoman torpedo boat. Its role and fate are not well understood. This vessel is at risk of damage and deterioration. The funding provided to the centenary program will enable a sound level of the protection and preservation to be undertaken.


An educational campaign aimed especially at schoolchildren will also be funded. The government is also providing initial funding to the ABC to develop, in conjunction with Screen Australia, 10 hours of programs using a range of stories and storytelling devices to raise awareness of the Anzac centenary.


Funding is also being provided to make The Australians at War Film Archive accessible to all Australians. This archive consists of interviews with over 2,000 Australians who participated in wars and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has been involved since the First World War, covering the battlefield and the home front. We will ensure that the entire archive is digitised and preserved so that it will be easily accessible, including for educational research purposes. We will also develop the minimum 100 personal stories for broadcast during the centenary using this extraordinary archive. These stories will blend human interest with a broad sweep of history. 


The government has also agreed to fund the National Archives of Australia to digitise a sample of the repatriation records of those servicemen and service women who survived both Gallipoli and the Western Front. These Australians fought in some of the most atrocious battles of the war and had then to re-engage in civilian life, often carrying physical, emotional and mental wounds. This project will assist new research and I am sure will be of considerable interest to the families and descendants of those individuals who were repatriated.


In recognition of the importance of the education and research throughout the centenary period, we will establish a history grants program for research related to the Anzac centenary. This will not only contribute to the academic research but also be open to community and family-based research. We have also committed funding to ensure we properly commemorate the role of Albany in Western Australia as a departure point for the first convoys to Egypt and Gallipoli. The Australian government has already provided over $6.5 million for the development of a physical and online ANZAC interpretive centre at Albany. Now the government will provide $2.7 million toward an event to commemorate the gathering and departure of the first convoy from Albany that occurred on 1 November 1914. This funding will be in addition to the contribution to the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and possibly vessels from New Zealand and other navies to the commemoration. The event is intended to be a curtain-raiser for the Anzac Centenary Program and will be broadcast nationally.


While the Anzac Centenary is a time to honour our Australian servicemen and women, past and present, it should also be a time to look broadly and honestly at Australia's military experience. This means recognising where facets of service and sacrifice have been underplayed in the past, and working to remedy the situation. The key role that Australian troops played on the Western Front throughout WWI has often been overshadowed by the events at Gallipoli. Australian troops in Europe played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Central Powers—and paid a terrible price for doing so. Over 75 per cent of Australia's war dead from the First World War died on the Western Front. Furthermore, we cannot forget the tragedy in the months and years that followed, when thousands of Australian troops died here at home from their wounds, putting the actual toll closer to double the number who died during the conflict.


One of the key ways we are recognising our relationship with the Western Front is the Australian Remembrance Trail. The trail was initiated by my predecessor, the Hon. Alan Griffin, and is being developed in partnership with local authorities in France and Belgium. This is an excellent initiative. The Australian government is contributing $10 million towards the trail, which will link the sites of the most significant Australian battles along the Western Front. Considerable progress has already been made across the various locations. It will build upon the efforts of local communities to commemorate Australian service.


This project highlights the collaborative approach we have taken to working with our international counterparts in commemorating the First World War. The government has forged strong relationships with the governments of Belgium, France and the United Kingdom in planning for the events that will mark the 2014-2018 period in Europe. In April, I met with my French and UK counterparts and signed a MOU with French minister Kader Arif that will provide a framework for Australia's participation in commemorations in France. This mirrors the MOU I signed with the Belgian government last year.


The government has now made a number of funding commitments to the Anzac Centenary. These include $83.5 million in the 2012-13 budget, notably $27 million for the refurbishment of the Australian War Memorial's First World War galleries and refurbishment of war graves. The government has committed a further $25 million in this year's budget. Our total commitment to the centenary program is now in excess of $140 million for a diverse range of projects and initiatives. This is a substantial commitment. To supplement this commitment, we will establish an Anzac centenary public fund to collect corporate donations. I commend the significant role being played by Mr Lindsay Fox in encouraging corporate donations. I call on corporate Australia to contribute to the fund and participate in this unique commemoration to help leave an enduring legacy.


There is much to be done to implement the Anzac Centenary Program but the government is well advanced. States and territories are also progressing their initiatives, as are local communities with their involvement. Members of parliament will start submitting their Anzac Centenary local grant applications at the end of this month. I welcome the continuing role of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board as ambassadors, informing the community about the program of Anzac Centenary events and assisting in the successful delivery of the program by providing strategic advice to government. 


While the focus of the Anzac Centenary will be on domestic activities, the desire of Australians to participate in commemorations marking the centenary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli is great. The initial landings by the Anzacs occurred just before dawn on 25 April 1915, when Australians came ashore and engaged the Turkish defenders on the ridges inland. By the end of the day, more than 20,000 Australians and New Zealanders had been put ashore, mainly in a small bay to the south of Ari Burnu that soon became known as Anzac Cove. More than 2,000 Australians were killed during the first day and it has been estimated the opposing Turkish units suffered around the same number of casualties. During the eight-month campaign our men fought bravely, with many paying the ultimate sacrifice in the numerous battles including Krithia at Cape Helles, as well as in the August offensive battles at Lone Pine and the Nek.


Although the Gallipoli campaign will forever be remembered in our history as a tragic event resulting in the great loss, often needlessly, of young lives, we should also recall the successful evacuation that occurred without the loss of a single life. We will always remember the more than 50,000 Australians and 8,500 New Zealanders who served at Gallipoli. By the end of that Gallipoli campaign, 8,709 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders had died, with thousands more casualties. It is also important that we as a nation acknowledge the extensive loss of life suffered by the Turkish people throughout the Gallipoli campaign. More than 56,000 Turkish soldiers were killed, some 107,000 were wounded and another 11,000 were taken prisoner during the Gallipoli campaign. We should never forget that the Anzacs and the Turks held each other in quite high regard during those eight months. Over the years, that high regard has turned to friendship, camaraderie and mateship between our peoples.


In 2015 the Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli will follow the same program as in any other year. We rely very much on the support and cooperation of the Turkish authorities and we should never underestimate the extent of their commitment to this event each year. For example, they ensure the security of the site, coordinate access to the peninsula and provide health services for foreign visitors. The Anzac commemorative site, where the dawn service is held, is located in the Gallipoli historical national park—a rugged and remote part of Turkey. The site is surrounded by thick scrub, steep terrain and bounded by the Aegean Sea. It is subject to heritage and conservation restrictions and is extremely constrained and there is no opportunity for expansion. To ensure the safety of visitors, extensive investigations of the Anzac commemorative site have been conducted. 


In January this year, the Turkish government confirmed that the maximum number of attendees for the Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in 2015 is 10,500 people. This was reaffirmed to me in April this year, after the Anzac ceremonies, during meetings with Dr Ismet Yilmaz, the Turkish Minister for National Defence, and Dr Ibrahim Kalin, Deputy Undersecretary of State and Foreign Advisor to the Prime Minister, and also with the Governor of Canakkale, Gungor Tuna.


The Australian government, of course, wants to see as many Australians as possible having the opportunity to attend the Dawn Service. However, we need to ensure that the service is solemn, dignified and safe for all those that attend. On that basis, we have agreed with the government of New Zealand that 8,000 places of the 10,500 places will be available to Australians and 2,000 places will be available to New Zealanders. This distribution is based on the relative number of casualties suffered by Australia and New Zealand during the campaign.


In September last year, the Australian and New Zealand governments announced that a ballot would be held to allocate attendance passes to people wishing to attend the Anzac Day centenary commemorations at Gallipoli. A ballot is seen as the most fair, equitable and transparent process for allocating attendance passes to this significant occasion.


Public forums were held in 36 locations across Australia to discuss what we should do about the Centenary of Anzac. We had a website which was used for those people who wished to make online comments. The views of Australians have helped inform the government's decisions on the ballot process. It was also clear from the feedback that many people believe priority should be given to the sons and daughters of Gallipoli veterans and other direct descendants.


People will be able to register for the ballot from 1 November 2013. A concurrent ballot will be run in New Zealand. The ballot will provide for special representatives, including:


War widows from the First World War, of whom we believe there are around 200 still alive;


direct descendants of those who served in the Gallipoli campaign, with first preference for the sons and daughters of Gallipoli veterans;


veterans with qualifying service or who have deployed on operations outside of Australia, whether they are warlike, non-warlike or peacetime operations; and


400 secondary school students and their chaperones with their selection managed by the states and territories.


For Australia generally there will be 6,000 passes. Those successful in the ballot process will have around 12 months to arrange and pay for the costs of their travel to Gallipoli.


Attending the annual Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in any year is a truly moving and unique experience for any Australian. Visiting Gallipoli around Anzac Day in 2015 will be the busiest and most difficult time to explore the area. Australians are encouraged to consider visiting Gallipoli throughout the year, which would allow for easier access to the battlefields and cemeteries and provide greater opportunities for personal reflection.


It should never be forgotten that we Australians are invited to Gallipoli each year to commemorate Anzac Day, thanks again to the people of Turkey. It is by the goodwill of the government and the people of Turkey that so many Australians are welcomed so warmly each year. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Australian people, the Turkish authorities and people who help us to stage the Anzac Day services. For example, the Gendarma, the 2nd Army Corps and the Straits Commander do an exemplary job in managing the safety and security of thousands of people who gather each year. I think we also owe a great deal of thanks to the people of the Canakkale region and the Governor of Canakkale, Gungor Tuna, and his predecessors for their support and goodwill.


Australians are incredibly fortunate to have the friendship of the Turkish people. Each year around Anzac Day, we proudly remember that from those days of war, almost a century ago, a friendship has grown strong. On behalf of the Australian government, I wish to extend Australia's appreciation to the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the ongoing cooperation and support provided and for allowing us to hold commemorations on a yearly basis on Turkish soil. Our long-standing relationship and combined dedication to preserving and protecting the Gallipoli battlefields is paramount to the commemoration of the service of our forebears.


I present a copy of my ministerial statement, Planning for the ANZAC Centenary 2014-18, and ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for 22 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr SNOWDON:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Robert speaking for a period not exceeding 22 minutes.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (16:50):  I rise to respond to the ministerial statement today on behalf of the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on the Centenary of Anzac, Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson. It has been more than 18 months since the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of Anzac gave this chamber and the Australian people an update on the Centenary of Anzac. It is a fact, indeed a regrettable one, that the community has been preparing for the Centenary of Anzac in a vacuum, a vacuum devoid of ministerial leadership. So bad has been the government's stewardship of the Centenary of Anzac that Senator Ronaldson was forced to deliver a shadow ministerial statement calling for the government to take action and show leadership. That was in November last year.


At that time, Senator Ronaldson said this in relation to Minister Snowdon's silence on the Centenary of Anzac and the lack of leadership being shown:


Journalist Patrick Carlyon was, I suspect, far too close to the truth when he wrote:




Veterans'
 Affairs Minister Warren Snowdon has adopted a literal approach to the Gallipoli story.  He has conjured a shambles.



This Government's apparent agenda for the Centenary of ANZAC appears to be an excessive outsourcing of decisions and responsibility to a paid Board whose reported activities, to date, give the impression that its size is making it incapable of actually making those decisions.


The Minister's refusal to make a statement to Parliament outlining the Government’s agenda, the decisions which have been taken or the considerations, if any, which are limiting the options available to the Government on the commemoration, is concerning.


If we are to make this commemoration a success through community engagement, if we are to leave a lasting legacy for future generations, then it is incumbent upon this Government to be open, honest and upfront about what we should expect.


Now, seven months on, the government has chosen to respond to Senator Ronaldson's shadow ministerial statement. Not a moment too soon, Minister—but why so long?


The minister is right when he says the coalition from day one has offered bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac; however he also knows that this not a blank cheque. He knows that the government has been stretching this goodwill. Our goodwill, and that of the community, is being sorely tested by this government and their approach to the centenary.


In Australia, 25 April is a day for solemn reflection, remembrance and commemoration. It is not about celebration, but of commemoration for the service and sacrifice of those who have come before us and given their lives in defence of our freedoms and way of life. 25 April 2015 will perhaps be this nation's most important day of national commemoration. It will mark the 100th anniversary of the arrival of thousands of brave young men from Australia and New Zealand on a foreign beach as part of the so-called 'war to end all wars'.


Conceived as a swift battle to overcome the Turks and seize the Dardanelles for the Allies, the ensuing eight-month campaign took more than 8,000 Australian lives and many more were wounded. Many of those who survived Gallipoli then went to fight on the Western Front, where three-quarters of our World War I dead remain today. This bloody conflict, which cost in excess of 60,000 lives, scarred a nation for a generation. Not one community in this nation was left unaffected. Families were left without sons and brothers, wives left without husbands. Children were left without fathers, and those who did return did so as changed men. 


These men and their families built what is today regarded as the world's best repatriation system. As a nation we vowed to honour the service and sacrifice of our veterans and we vowed to never forget their service. The Centenary of Anzac gives this nation an important opportunity to ensure the legacy of Anzac continues. It will be about ensuring future generations understand what we fought for, where we fought and why we fought for it. It will be about rededicating ourselves to not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as the shameful way our Vietnam veterans were treated on their return from service in our nation's name. It is about honouring, it is about ensuring we uphold the unique nature of military service and honouring the obligations this nation has to those who served.


Labor's chaos and general division and dysfunction have, regrettably, extended to the Centenary of Anzac. Despite repeated calls from the community and the coalition to show leadership on the Centenary of Anzac, Labor has been found wanting and the community has been left in limbo because of their silence. Last November, Senator Ronaldson stated in the Senate:


It is clear that leadership on the centenary of Anzac from this government and the minister is lacking. While I do not accept the view of some that Minister Snowdon appears totally disinterested, I do strongly urge him to take the ministerial ownership that is required and to take control of a situation that is short on time and long on expectation.


Today's ministerial statement does not achieve this in and of itself. It requires ongoing engagement on the issues facing the community to ensure the Centenary of Anzac is the success it must be.


The minister says that the government announced its ballot arrangements in September last year. This is despite newspapers reporting the details as early as June. They then spent close to $400,000 on so-called 'consultation' about how the ballot would operate. This was on top of $600,000 in other consultant fees into things such as the Centenary of Anzac logo and community perceptions of Anzac Day and 'why' we commemorate it! The veteran and ex-service community remains particularly angry at the government's spend on consultants for the Centenary of Anzac. They are also angry that the so-called ballot consultation 'road-show' was such an expensive exercise in spin which delivered little by way of substance. Regrettably, this has been this government's hallmark.


As Senator Ronaldson noted in his shadow ministerial statement last year, one forum in Sydney cost in excess of $15,000 and there were just 15 attendees including three DVA staff and two paid consultants. At more than half of the forums, which were held at the odd time of 6pm, fewer than 10 people were in attendance. One forum had one attendee, another just one couple. That there would be a ballot was a foregone conclusion. It begs the question: just what did this all achieve?


After announcing a cap of 10,500 people for the dawn service on 25 April 2015, the minister sat on a consultant's report confirming this figure for nearly two years. The coalition has been forced to seek this document through freedom of information. In the absence of this report, the coalition and the community have only been able to take on face value the figures quoted by the government and their reasons for limiting capacity to this number. It does beg the question: why did the government not release this report earlier—what were they seeking to hide? In due course the community will come to understand why the government did not release this report earlier and why it was delivered under the cover of darkness to Senator Ronaldson at 8:10pm last Tuesday, budget night, arguably, the busiest night in the nation's capital and certainly in Parliament House.


The adoption of the Local Grants Program model from the highly successful Australia Remembers program pioneered by former Labor veterans' affairs minister, Con Sciacca, is welcomed. That it took so long for Labor to confirm this and the guidelines which govern it, is of course a concern, but hardly surprising given their track record. The Australia Remembers program was hugely successful because it was driven from the ground up. It engaged local communities in the process of commemoration. This Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program will operate over the next financial year and will provide $100,000 per electorate. To assist members in allocating funds, committees will be established in each electorate to assist with decisions about projects to be supported. These grants are not just for the veteran and ex-service community. Schools, service organisations, church groups and others who wish to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac can apply for funds against the established funding criteria.


The government's announcement of seed funding of $10 million for an interactive travelling exhibition to ensure commemoration is national is welcome. We note that the project will require the financial support of the private sector and that Lindsay Fox is very generously giving his time to seek high-level corporate fundraising support for the centenary. There will, of course, be many calls for funds for projects associated with the centenary and the government has indicated that the first priority is this travelling exhibition. We know that there is a long list of projects seeking funding, a list which the government has not yet released publicly. Whilst the exact details of the proposed travelling exhibition have not been released, we do understand that two 12-metre-long interactive panels transported on the back of trucks will move around Australia to assist with education and understanding of the Centenary of Anzac and the stories associated with it.


The shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on the Centenary of Anzac, Senator Ronaldson, has outlined that, if elected to government, the coalition will take a much-needed hands-on approach to the management of the Centenary of Anzac. We will be upfront with the Australian people and ensure that all Australians, no matter where they live, will be able to participate in the Centenary of Anzac in their own way.


In the four months remaining until the election, we call on the government to finally show leadership on the Centenary of Anzac. We urge the minister to do as Labor minister Con Sciacca did and personally drive the Centenary of Anzac program. In finalising my comments on behalf of Senator Ronaldson, can I again confirm the coalition's full, bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac program.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (17:00):  I move:


That the amendments be agreed to.


This bill will ensure that asylum seekers who unlawfully arrive anywhere in Australia by boat without a visa will be subject to the same regional processing arrangements as asylum seekers who arrive at an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island. The government's amendments to the bill, which address the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, will further build on these mechanisms to ensure transparency for regional processing arrangements. 


The amendments moved today will require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to cause to be laid before each house of the parliament, within 15 sitting days of that house after the end of the financial year, a report on the following: arrangements made by regional processing countries during the financial year for unauthorised maritime arrivals who make claims for protection under the refugees convention as amended by the refugees protocol, including arrangements for assessing those claims in those countries and for the accommodation, health care and education of those unauthorised maritime arrivals in those countries; the number of those claims assessed in those countries in the financial year; and the number of unauthorised maritime arrivals determined in those countries in the financial year to be covered by the definition of refugee in article 1A of the refugees convention as amended by the refugees protocol.


The reporting requirements recognise that a regional processing country is a sovereign country and that the minister will be able to include information in the report as is provided by the regional processing country. For this reason, a proposed amendment obliges the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to report on the arrangements only so far as information provided by the regional processing countries makes it reasonably practicable to do so.


In addition, an amendment will prevent that report from including the name of a person who is or was an unauthorised maritime arrival, or any information that may identify such a person, or the name of any person connected in any way with any person who is or was an unauthorised maritime arrival or any information that may identify that other person. The first report to be tabled in each house of the parliament will be for the period commencing 13 August 2012 and ending on the first 30 June after the commencement of the bill.


I thank all those who have contributed to this debate. This of course is the realisation, in effect, of recommendation 14 of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers. I do indeed commend the amendments and the bill to the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (17:03):  I welcome the fact that we have finally arrived at this point. I welcome the fact that a bill that was passed by this House in November last year and had the full support of the coalition all through the process and that sat in the Senate unattended to since February while boats arrived on the mainland, has finally been addressed on the last day of this sitting week. That required the coalition's support in the Senate for the suspension of standing orders for the matter to be dealt with, otherwise it would not be here today and we would have gone through another few weeks before it was actually dealt with.



Mr Brendan O'Connor interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  I respond to the minister's interjection by simply saying this: this minister let this bill sit unattended to for absolute months. If it was not for the coalition hounding the government to bring it back into this place, who knows if it would have even come back this month. Last time the government had the opportunity to consider this matter in the Senate they thought it was more important to deal with their gag media laws. As a result, it sat by the wayside. What this has demonstrated to me is that there are many failings of this government when it comes to border protection but the one they are becoming most guilty of now is their lack of any sense of urgency on this matter.


This matter had full bipartisan support and it went nowhere for months and months and months, demonstrating the situation with regard to policy issues. The government likes to make all sorts of claims about the coalition's position on this. There is one outstanding matter, and that relates to the Malaysia people swap. But, as the minister full well knows, not even that matter is in a position where it could be considered by the parliament because he has not proceeded with it at all in terms of the recommendations of the Houston panel to put more effective protections in place. That policy remains red-lighted by the Houston panel. As a result, all the other matters in that report, to my understanding, are being progressed and, finally, this one has been progressed here this afternoon. It would not have been progressed were it not for the coalition's sense of urgency on this matter and forcing the government's hand to get this matter dealt with today.


I welcome the bill coming back into this place. The coalition are happy to accept the amendments, as we did in the Senate. When this bill finally receives royal assent we would hope there would then be a deterrent for people seeking to target the mainland, as they have been doing while this government has again sat on its hands and sought to blame the opposition for its own border failures. The $10 billion blow-out, the record levels of arrivals—more than 2,000 per month—fit squarely and surely on the shoulders of this government's failed border policies. If you want a sense of this government's lack of urgency, then just look at the passage of this bill while it is dragging its feet once again. 


That can change at the next election, because the coalition will bring a sense of urgency to this matter that it has been demanding for absolute years. That will be an opportunity for the Australian people to settle this matter once and for all. My hope would be, if we were elected later this year, that never again would a government abolish measures that worked. In this area, this government abolished the measures that worked. The cost and chaos and tragedy that has followed sit fairly and squarely on the shoulders of this government. We are pleased, as we always have been, to support the bill.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (19:31):  Tonight, I want to directly address you, the Australian people. 


While it is easy, and understandable, that you should be pessimistic about this government, everyone should be optimistic about our country. 


Our health researchers have saved hundreds of millions of lives through breakthroughs in everything from infectious diseases to cancer vaccines to ulcer treatments.


Our military personnel stand ready to protect people in some of the world's worst trouble spots.


Our universities are educating the future leaders of our region. 


Our musicians, artists, actors and film-makers are making their mark all over the world.


Our resource exports have helped hundreds of millions to move from the Third World to the middle class.


And, with the right product, our manufacturing, too, is capable of competing with the best in the world, even with the high dollar—as demonstrated by Cochlear, Blackmores, Murray Goulburn and RM Williams, whose boots I'm wearing tonight.


We are a great country and a great people let down by a bad government.


Bad governments pass.


What should never dim is our faith that Australia's best years are ahead of us. 


So my purpose tonight is to assure you that a coalition government will do what's needed to restore the hope, reward and opportunity that should be your birthright.


Our Real Solutions Plan will build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. 


Margie and I know the pressure that every Australian—that each one of you—is under.


We are not crying poor but we run a household with power bills, rates, health and education costs to be paid all the time. 


Margie runs a community based childcare centre which has to live within its means just like every small business and every family.


Government's first job is not to make your life harder. 


But this government has—with its carbon tax, broken promises, and skyrocketing debt.


Australian families are paying for this government's mistakes yet all you ever hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are excuses and promises to do better next time.


Should the coalition win the election, there will be no nasty surprises and there will be no lame excuses. 


No surprises and no excuses.


The coalition's plan has two objectives: first, to take the budget pressure off Australian households; and second, to strengthen our economy so that, over time, there is more to go around for everyone. 


Only by delivering a strong economy can government deliver a sustainable National Disability Insurance Scheme as well as better schools.


You need certainty to plan your future and you need cost-of-living relief.


So tonight I announce a major initiative to ease the financial pressure on Australian families.


A coalition government will keep the current income tax thresholds and the current pension and benefit fortnightly rates while scrapping the carbon tax.


The carbon tax will go but no-one's personal tax will go up and no-one's fortnightly pension or benefit will go down.


So with a change of government, your weekly and fortnightly budgets will be under less pressure as electricity prices fall and gas prices fall and the carbon tax no longer cascades through our economy. 


This will strengthen our economy—because there will less tax hitting Australian businesses but not their overseas competitors.


And it will help families—because you will have tax cuts funded by smaller government, not by taking money out of one pocket just to put it in the other.


Our plan starts with recognition of economic reality. 


Government does not create wealth; people do.


Government does not spend its own money; it spends your money.


This year's spending is either this year's taxes or it is this year's borrowing—and that is next year's taxes. 


Government spending is not a free gift but something that everyone is paying for, now or in the future.


That is why good governments are at least as careful spending the money they hold on trust from the people as you are when making decisions that affect your family's budget.


Parents do not mortgage their children's future and neither should government.


Last year, the Treasurer began his budget speech with this declaration, and I quote:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the … success of our policies.


Well, surpluses would have been a vindication.


But there are no surpluses. 


Not this year. 


Not next year.


Not the year after. 


The Treasurer now says that there will be a surplus in four years time.


That is four years after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that the surplus had actually been delivered and spent tens of thousands of your dollars boasting about it in letters to their constituents.


If a public company made these sorts of claims, its directors would most likely face serious charges rather than asking to be re-elected.


If this had been the only dodgy promise, they might have got away with it. But this government never, never gets it right.


It got the mining tax numbers wrong.


It got the carbon tax numbers wrong.


And last year's budget commitments to boost family payments and to cut taxes did not even make it to this year's budget.


This year's supposed revenue shortfall went from $7 billion to $12 billion to $17 billion in just two weeks. So how can ministers possibly predict a decade ahead?


The Prime Minister guaranteed there would be no carbon tax, but there is.


She guaranteed there would be a surplus—165 times she guaranteed there would be a surplus—but there is not, and there never will be under this government.


After seven deficits totalling $220 billion, the Treasurer can hardly congratulate himself over an almost invisible surplus, if nothing goes awry, if he is still there in four years time in his ninth budget.


The government originally said that the deficit was temporary.


With seven in a row, the Second World War was more temporary than this government's deficits. 


The government promised a surplus over the cycle, but this is not a cycle; it is a spiral deeper and deeper into debt, which is now surging towards $400 billion even on the government's own figures.


The last time a Labor Treasurer stood in this parliament to actually deliver a surplus was way back in 1989, so it is hardly surprising that this year's Labor surplus promises are no more believable than last year's.


In the second line of this week's budget speech, the Treasurer said it was a budget for jobs and growth.


In fact, unemployment increases and growth decreases.


The Treasurer spent much of his speech complaining that he was the victim of a sudden collapse in government revenue.


In fact, revenue is up six per cent this year and will be up seven per cent next year.


Next year, revenue will be up $80 billion on six years ago.


That is right, this Treasurer has $80 billion more to balance his budget than Peter Costello ever had, yet Costello delivered surplus after surplus.


We have a $20 billion deficit now, rather than the $20 billion surplus then, not because revenue is down but because spending is up by $120 billion.


In 121 days there will be an election.


It will be a tipping point in the life of our country.


The choice could hardly be more stark: three more years of broken promises, nasty surprises and weak excuses.


Or change for the better with an experienced team that will not just rebuild the economy, but also the bonds of trust that should exist between you, the people and your parliament.


The last coalition government grew GDP per person by well over two per cent a year. Under this government, it has limped along at well under one per cent.


The former government grew jobs by 2¼ per cent a year, or enough to create over two million new jobs within a decade.


Since then, they have grown by just 1.6 per cent a year.


With the coalition, you could trust government to save.


With Labor you can be sure government will spend, which is why worried households are saving at the highest rate in a generation.


During the Howard years, real wealth per person more than doubled. Since then, it has actually declined thanks to weaker growth, subdued house prices and lower share prices.


Change will not come overnight, but a coalition government will do what is needed to strengthen economic growth and prosperity.


All of the coalition's main policies are designed to make it easier for you to get ahead and for businesses to be more productive.


We will abolish the carbon tax, because that is the quickest way to reduce power prices and take the pressure off cost of living and job security.


Let me repeat: we will abolish the carbon tax because it is a kind of reverse tariff that hurts local businesses but not our overseas competitors.


There is no mystery as to how this will happen.


What one parliament legislates, another parliament can repeal, and the carbon tax repeal bill, should we be elected, will be the first legislation that a new parliament considers.


We will reduce emissions. We will do it with targeted incentives, not clobbering business with the world's biggest carbon tax.


We will abolish the mining tax, because that is the quickest way to support investment and jobs.


We will cut red tape costs by at least $1 billion a year to give small business the much-needed break they deserve, and we will have parliamentary sitting days dedicated to repealing laws, not passing them.


By cutting tax and regulation we will boost productivity.


That will give Australian manufacturers the more level playing field they need to remain at the heart of a five pillar economy along with services, education, agriculture and resources. 


We will have a once-in-a-generation commission of audit so that government is only as big as it needs to be to do what people cannot do for themselves.


We will set up a root and branch review of competition policy to ensure that small business gets a fair go and small business will be a cabinet portfolio within the Treasury department. 


There will be an affordable and responsible paid parental leave scheme because women should get their full wage while on maternity leave just as men should get theirs while on annual leave. 


We will revitalise work for the dole because people who can work should work, preferably for a wage but, if not, for the dole.


Within three years, the coalition's NBN will deliver broadband speeds at least five times faster than the current average for $60 billion less than Labor's version. 


We will start work within 12 months on Melbourne's East-West Link, Sydney's WestConnex, Brisbane's Gateway Motorway upgrade, Adelaide's South Road, and Tasmania's Midland Highway, as well as key roads in Perth and parts of the Bruce Highway, because when you are stuck in traffic jams, you are not at work or at home with your family.


We will duplicate the Pacific Highway, finally, well within this decade.


We will establish a one-stop shop for faster environmental approvals so that new projects can get up and going far more quickly.


We will re-establish a tough cop on the beat, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, to deliver (as it previously did) $6 billion a year of productivity improvements in a troubled industry.


We will return the workplace relations pendulum to the sensible centre, under the existing Fair Work Act, with fairer rules for right of entry and for new projects.


And we will establish a new, two-way street version of the Colombo Plan taking our best and brightest to the region as well as bringing their best and brightest here.


It will be part of a foreign policy that is focused on Jakarta, not Geneva. 


All these commitments are affordable and deliverable. 


We will deliver them in our first term of government, if we win, and we will provide all the funding details after the pre-election fiscal statement is released. 


But tonight, I set out specific savings to cover keeping tax thresholds and pension rates without a carbon tax to fund them. 


The coalition has already announced that we will rescind the increase to the humanitarian migration intake because until the boats are stopped, and stop them we will, it is the people smugglers who are choosing who comes to Australia.


We have announced that we will reduce by at least 12,000, through natural attrition, the size of the Commonwealth public sector that is now 20,000 bureaucrats bigger than in 2007.


We have also announced that we would scrap Labor's green loans scheme for projects that the banks will not touch. 


Tonight, I confirm that we will not continue the twice a year supplementary allowance to people on benefits because it is supposed to be funded from the mining tax and the mining tax is not raising any revenue. 


As well, we will not continue the low income superannuation contribution because that is also funded from the tax that is not raising any revenue.


I announce that we will delay by two years the ramp up in compulsory superannuation because this money comes largely from business—not from government—and our economy needs encouragement as mining investment wanes and new sources of growth are needed. 


These measures alone will produce nearly $5 billion a year in savings which is more than enough for tax cuts without a carbon tax.


The coalition will not shirk the hard decisions needed to get our budget back into surplus.


Living within your means is not mindless austerity, it is simple prudence.


It is recognition of the reality that you cannot spend what you do not have.


Households know this and it is time government did too.


At least for a first term, until we are on an honest path not just to surplus but to repaying debt, an incoming coalition government will resist new spending commitments that are not fully funded, nearly always by offsetting expenditure reductions.


As far as the coalition is concerned, the next election will not be an auction, because talking to people all around the country, the last thing they want—the last thing you want—is more 'historic' announcements or so-called 'revolutions' that never justify the government's hype.


Let me be clear.


Many of the measures in this budget are objectionable: the attacks on Medicare; the abolition of the baby bonus which the government had promised never to touch; robbing Peter to pay Paul on education; and forcing more businesses to do the tax paperwork monthly, not just quarterly.


But thanks to Labor's poor management over five years, there is now a budget emergency. 


Hence the coalition may decide not to oppose any of them; does not commit to reverse any of them; and reserves the option to implement all of them, in government, as short-term emergency measures to deal with the budget crisis Labor has created.


Far from cutting to the bone, we reserve the right to implement all of Labor's cuts, if needed, because it will take time to undo all the damage this government has done 


By keeping, if needed, all Labor's budget cuts and by not implementing any of their budget spending measures unless specified, we will achieve the first duty of every government: namely, to preserve the nation's finances. 


We will keep the announced spending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and we will ensure that the scheme reflects the Productivity Commission's recommendations rather than becoming just another big government bureaucracy.


I would not have ridden 1,000 kilometres, the week before last, to raise money for Carers Australia if I was half-hearted about the NDIS and I would never claim for just one side of politics this reform that should be an achievement for our whole nation.


On the other hand, the key to better schools, at least as much as more money, is better teachers, better teaching, higher academic standards, more parental involvement, and more principal autonomy.


So that is what we will work with the states to deliver.


We will not back a so-called national education system that some states do not support especially as this government has a sorry history of spending more while schools' performance actually goes backwards.


Regardless of normal political allegiance, Australians are sick of leaders who play politics ahead of governing the country and who blame everyone but themselves when things go wrong and the numbers do not add up.


You want a grown-up government like the ones that John Howard and—yes—Bob Hawke too used to run.


As soon as people know there is a government in this country with an economic strategy to build the country rather than just a political strategy to save its own skin, confidence will start to return to our economy. 


Tax reform starts with immediately repealing the carbon tax and the mining tax and giving a modest company tax cut as soon as it is affordable—but it does not end there. 


Within two years, an incoming coalition government, consulting with the community, will produce a comprehensive white paper on tax reform. 


We will finish the job that the Henry review started and this government squibbed. 


We want taxes that are lower, simpler and fairer and will take proposals for further tax reform to the following election. 


Right now, the blame game between the Commonwealth and the states that Kevin Rudd promised to end has become worse than ever. 


Typically, over the past three years, the Prime Minister has announced massive new programs in areas that are the states' responsibility so she can claim the credit but the states have to pay. 


It is no way to run the country and it is no way for adult leaders to behave.


Within two years of a change of government, working with the states, the coalition will produce a white paper on COAG reform, and the responsibilities of different governments, to ensure that, as far as possible, the states are sovereign in their own sphere. 


The objective will be to reduce and end, as far as possible, the waste, duplication and second-guessing between different levels of government that has resulted, for instance, in the Commonwealth employing 6,000 health bureaucrats even though it does not run a single hospital. 


Again, a coalition government will seek a mandate at the subsequent election for any proposed changes.


One of the best ways to ensure that governments do not make mistakes is to have a proper cabinet process.


That is how Bob Hawke and John Howard ran their governments but that is not how government is run now, as the four former ministers now sitting on the backbench have eloquently testified. 


My ministers will not need to learn how to be a good government because they have been one before.


Sixteen members of the coalition shadow cabinet were ministers in the last government that actually delivered surpluses, as opposed to just promising them. 


Those surpluses were not just John Howard's and Peter Costello's.


They were my surpluses and Joe Hockey's surpluses and Julie Bishop's and Warren Truss's and Malcolm Turnbull's and Chris Pyne's and Andrew Robb's. We were all part of the last government that Australians knew was competent and trustworthy. 


Unlike the current government, which never makes an announcement that is not supposed to be the most important thing ever, what I am proposing is not unprecedented and should not even be remarkable. 


I am offering what should be normal: careful, collegial, consultative, straightforward government that says what it means and does what it says. 


That would be change for the better. 


The next election, to which this budget is a mere prelude, should not be about who becomes prime minister. 


It should be about who can do more for our country—because our country is more important than any of us in this parliament. 


My colleagues and I have a plan to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.


It is not about us.


It is about you, the Australian people.


We pledge ourselves to your service.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (19:31):  Tonight, I want to directly address you, the Australian people. 


While it is easy, and understandable, that you should be pessimistic about this government, everyone should be optimistic about our country. 


Our health researchers have saved hundreds of millions of lives through breakthroughs in everything from infectious diseases to cancer vaccines to ulcer treatments.


Our military personnel stand ready to protect people in some of the world's worst trouble spots.


Our universities are educating the future leaders of our region. 


Our musicians, artists, actors and film-makers are making their mark all over the world.


Our resource exports have helped hundreds of millions to move from the Third World to the middle class.


And, with the right product, our manufacturing, too, is capable of competing with the best in the world, even with the high dollar—as demonstrated by Cochlear, Blackmores, Murray Goulburn and RM Williams, whose boots I'm wearing tonight.


We are a great country and a great people let down by a bad government.


Bad governments pass.


What should never dim is our faith that Australia's best years are ahead of us. 


So my purpose tonight is to assure you that a coalition government will do what's needed to restore the hope, reward and opportunity that should be your birthright.


Our Real Solutions Plan will build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. 


Margie and I know the pressure that every Australian—that each one of you—is under.


We are not crying poor but we run a household with power bills, rates, health and education costs to be paid all the time. 


Margie runs a community based childcare centre which has to live within its means just like every small business and every family.


Government's first job is not to make your life harder. 


But this government has—with its carbon tax, broken promises, and skyrocketing debt.


Australian families are paying for this government's mistakes yet all you ever hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are excuses and promises to do better next time.


Should the coalition win the election, there will be no nasty surprises and there will be no lame excuses. 


No surprises and no excuses.


The coalition's plan has two objectives: first, to take the budget pressure off Australian households; and second, to strengthen our economy so that, over time, there is more to go around for everyone. 


Only by delivering a strong economy can government deliver a sustainable National Disability Insurance Scheme as well as better schools.


You need certainty to plan your future and you need cost-of-living relief.


So tonight I announce a major initiative to ease the financial pressure on Australian families.


A coalition government will keep the current income tax thresholds and the current pension and benefit fortnightly rates while scrapping the carbon tax.


The carbon tax will go but no-one's personal tax will go up and no-one's fortnightly pension or benefit will go down.


So with a change of government, your weekly and fortnightly budgets will be under less pressure as electricity prices fall and gas prices fall and the carbon tax no longer cascades through our economy. 


This will strengthen our economy—because there will less tax hitting Australian businesses but not their overseas competitors.


And it will help families—because you will have tax cuts funded by smaller government, not by taking money out of one pocket just to put it in the other.


Our plan starts with recognition of economic reality. 


Government does not create wealth; people do.


Government does not spend its own money; it spends your money.


This year's spending is either this year's taxes or it is this year's borrowing—and that is next year's taxes. 


Government spending is not a free gift but something that everyone is paying for, now or in the future.


That is why good governments are at least as careful spending the money they hold on trust from the people as you are when making decisions that affect your family's budget.


Parents do not mortgage their children's future and neither should government.


Last year, the Treasurer began his budget speech with this declaration, and I quote:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the … success of our policies.


Well, surpluses would have been a vindication.


But there are no surpluses. 


Not this year. 


Not next year.


Not the year after. 


The Treasurer now says that there will be a surplus in four years time.


That is four years after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that the surplus had actually been delivered and spent tens of thousands of your dollars boasting about it in letters to their constituents.


If a public company made these sorts of claims, its directors would most likely face serious charges rather than asking to be re-elected.


If this had been the only dodgy promise, they might have got away with it. But this government never, never gets it right.


It got the mining tax numbers wrong.


It got the carbon tax numbers wrong.


And last year's budget commitments to boost family payments and to cut taxes did not even make it to this year's budget.


This year's supposed revenue shortfall went from $7 billion to $12 billion to $17 billion in just two weeks. So how can ministers possibly predict a decade ahead?


The Prime Minister guaranteed there would be no carbon tax, but there is.


She guaranteed there would be a surplus—165 times she guaranteed there would be a surplus—but there is not, and there never will be under this government.


After seven deficits totalling $220 billion, the Treasurer can hardly congratulate himself over an almost invisible surplus, if nothing goes awry, if he is still there in four years time in his ninth budget.


The government originally said that the deficit was temporary.


With seven in a row, the Second World War was more temporary than this government's deficits. 


The government promised a surplus over the cycle, but this is not a cycle; it is a spiral deeper and deeper into debt, which is now surging towards $400 billion even on the government's own figures.


The last time a Labor Treasurer stood in this parliament to actually deliver a surplus was way back in 1989, so it is hardly surprising that this year's Labor surplus promises are no more believable than last year's.


In the second line of this week's budget speech, the Treasurer said it was a budget for jobs and growth.


In fact, unemployment increases and growth decreases.


The Treasurer spent much of his speech complaining that he was the victim of a sudden collapse in government revenue.


In fact, revenue is up six per cent this year and will be up seven per cent next year.


Next year, revenue will be up $80 billion on six years ago.


That is right, this Treasurer has $80 billion more to balance his budget than Peter Costello ever had, yet Costello delivered surplus after surplus.


We have a $20 billion deficit now, rather than the $20 billion surplus then, not because revenue is down but because spending is up by $120 billion.


In 121 days there will be an election.


It will be a tipping point in the life of our country.


The choice could hardly be more stark: three more years of broken promises, nasty surprises and weak excuses.


Or change for the better with an experienced team that will not just rebuild the economy, but also the bonds of trust that should exist between you, the people and your parliament.


The last coalition government grew GDP per person by well over two per cent a year. Under this government, it has limped along at well under one per cent.


The former government grew jobs by 2¼ per cent a year, or enough to create over two million new jobs within a decade.


Since then, they have grown by just 1.6 per cent a year.


With the coalition, you could trust government to save.


With Labor you can be sure government will spend, which is why worried households are saving at the highest rate in a generation.


During the Howard years, real wealth per person more than doubled. Since then, it has actually declined thanks to weaker growth, subdued house prices and lower share prices.


Change will not come overnight, but a coalition government will do what is needed to strengthen economic growth and prosperity.


All of the coalition's main policies are designed to make it easier for you to get ahead and for businesses to be more productive.


We will abolish the carbon tax, because that is the quickest way to reduce power prices and take the pressure off cost of living and job security.


Let me repeat: we will abolish the carbon tax because it is a kind of reverse tariff that hurts local businesses but not our overseas competitors.


There is no mystery as to how this will happen.


What one parliament legislates, another parliament can repeal, and the carbon tax repeal bill, should we be elected, will be the first legislation that a new parliament considers.


We will reduce emissions. We will do it with targeted incentives, not clobbering business with the world's biggest carbon tax.


We will abolish the mining tax, because that is the quickest way to support investment and jobs.


We will cut red tape costs by at least $1 billion a year to give small business the much-needed break they deserve, and we will have parliamentary sitting days dedicated to repealing laws, not passing them.


By cutting tax and regulation we will boost productivity.


That will give Australian manufacturers the more level playing field they need to remain at the heart of a five pillar economy along with services, education, agriculture and resources. 


We will have a once-in-a-generation commission of audit so that government is only as big as it needs to be to do what people cannot do for themselves.


We will set up a root and branch review of competition policy to ensure that small business gets a fair go and small business will be a cabinet portfolio within the Treasury department. 


There will be an affordable and responsible paid parental leave scheme because women should get their full wage while on maternity leave just as men should get theirs while on annual leave. 


We will revitalise work for the dole because people who can work should work, preferably for a wage but, if not, for the dole.


Within three years, the coalition's NBN will deliver broadband speeds at least five times faster than the current average for $60 billion less than Labor's version. 


We will start work within 12 months on Melbourne's East-West Link, Sydney's WestConnex, Brisbane's Gateway Motorway upgrade, Adelaide's South Road, and Tasmania's Midland Highway, as well as key roads in Perth and parts of the Bruce Highway, because when you are stuck in traffic jams, you are not at work or at home with your family.


We will duplicate the Pacific Highway, finally, well within this decade.


We will establish a one-stop shop for faster environmental approvals so that new projects can get up and going far more quickly.


We will re-establish a tough cop on the beat, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, to deliver (as it previously did) $6 billion a year of productivity improvements in a troubled industry.


We will return the workplace relations pendulum to the sensible centre, under the existing Fair Work Act, with fairer rules for right of entry and for new projects.


And we will establish a new, two-way street version of the Colombo Plan taking our best and brightest to the region as well as bringing their best and brightest here.


It will be part of a foreign policy that is focused on Jakarta, not Geneva. 


All these commitments are affordable and deliverable. 


We will deliver them in our first term of government, if we win, and we will provide all the funding details after the pre-election fiscal statement is released. 


But tonight, I set out specific savings to cover keeping tax thresholds and pension rates without a carbon tax to fund them. 


The coalition has already announced that we will rescind the increase to the humanitarian migration intake because until the boats are stopped, and stop them we will, it is the people smugglers who are choosing who comes to Australia.


We have announced that we will reduce by at least 12,000, through natural attrition, the size of the Commonwealth public sector that is now 20,000 bureaucrats bigger than in 2007.


We have also announced that we would scrap Labor's green loans scheme for projects that the banks will not touch. 


Tonight, I confirm that we will not continue the twice a year supplementary allowance to people on benefits because it is supposed to be funded from the mining tax and the mining tax is not raising any revenue. 


As well, we will not continue the low income superannuation contribution because that is also funded from the tax that is not raising any revenue.


I announce that we will delay by two years the ramp up in compulsory superannuation because this money comes largely from business—not from government—and our economy needs encouragement as mining investment wanes and new sources of growth are needed. 


These measures alone will produce nearly $5 billion a year in savings which is more than enough for tax cuts without a carbon tax.


The coalition will not shirk the hard decisions needed to get our budget back into surplus.


Living within your means is not mindless austerity, it is simple prudence.


It is recognition of the reality that you cannot spend what you do not have.


Households know this and it is time government did too.


At least for a first term, until we are on an honest path not just to surplus but to repaying debt, an incoming coalition government will resist new spending commitments that are not fully funded, nearly always by offsetting expenditure reductions.


As far as the coalition is concerned, the next election will not be an auction, because talking to people all around the country, the last thing they want—the last thing you want—is more 'historic' announcements or so-called 'revolutions' that never justify the government's hype.


Let me be clear.


Many of the measures in this budget are objectionable: the attacks on Medicare; the abolition of the baby bonus which the government had promised never to touch; robbing Peter to pay Paul on education; and forcing more businesses to do the tax paperwork monthly, not just quarterly.


But thanks to Labor's poor management over five years, there is now a budget emergency. 


Hence the coalition may decide not to oppose any of them; does not commit to reverse any of them; and reserves the option to implement all of them, in government, as short-term emergency measures to deal with the budget crisis Labor has created.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (09:43):  On 15 April I attended the Barnardos Mother of the Year ceremony in WA. There were three finalists: three ladies with impressive stories and impressive characters. All have done great things for their families and embody in every way the very best of motherhood in our community. On this occasion I would like to speak of the runner-up, Tennille McConkey. Tennille is 37 years old, she is single and she has seven children. She is the mother of two and the foster parent of five. A couple of weeks ago I visited Tennille because I wanted to know more about her and why she is a foster parent. I learned a lot and she is without doubt an inspiration.


Tennille McConkey comes from a dysfunctional family. She has faced many problems since she left home at 16. She had her daughter around then, and she also left her church. She describes herself a bit of a wild child. At the age of 23 she decided that she wanted more children and decided that she would do foster parenting. In the last 14 years she has fostered more than 30 children. Often they have been Indigenous, and four of her five current children are Indigenous. She is now the legal guardian of almost all the children. 


When we spoke about the issue of adoption, Tennille made an interesting comment. She said that she would like to adopt the children; however, the trouble with the Australian past history of forced adoptions is that 'this country now hates adoption'. Given the clear failure of so many actual parents to raise their children safely and positively, it is a shame that adoption of Australian children is now practically impossible. Many children would have a far better future, I am sure of it. As Tennille often says, too many children live in limbo because even now case officers seem to be trying to get children back to their parents despite there being clearly better options.


It is true to say that financially Tennille struggles. One of Tennille's children has intellectual problems due to foetal alcohol syndrome. She has seven children aged between two and 16 and it is a big load. She is in a private rental as well. Yet the children are very polite and have been well cared for. It is a highly positive home and so therefore I pay tribute to Tennille McConkey for what she does. She has a great attitude and I would like to quote her again because this is something we should all do. She says, 'I do not allow my children to use their circumstances as an excuse for behaving badly.' Tennille does not just say that, she lives it as well.


In the recent past she has had breast cancer and has lost one brother to a traffic accident and another to a heart attack in the last couple of years. In amongst all that she has been studying to become a midwife. When I think about what Tennille has achieved with her seven children and what she has overcome, I can only say that she is amazing. If everyone had an attitude like hers, this country would be an even better place to live.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:15):  It was my honour to be asked by the previous Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, to be on the committee to draft the apology for forced adoption. It was a tough task. We were very ably led, but a number of people who had been the victims of forced adoption appeared before the committee. They were mainly the mothers forced to give up their babies for adoption, and even a father appeared before the committee. People like Paul Howes also appeared. It was quite an experience for me. 


I should stress that the reason I appeared on the committee drafting the national apology for forced adoptions is that my sister had had a child adopted when she was 14. She has never classed it as a forced adoption, although my mum was a single parent at the time. My dad had left and there were nine kids in the house. My sister gave as much content as a pregnant 14-year-old child can give. However, that has been a fantastic story as far as adoptions go. My nephew Andrew Garvey was adopted by a wonderful family. He has had a magnificent relationship with the family who adopted him and my sister now has a great relationship with him. I remember meeting him at my sister's 50th birthday, which was like finding a new family member. He fits in wonderfully, and it is great to have a new nephew. I think Andrew is a constituent of the member for Solomon, although I hope he does not support her! I will have to check with him next time I catch up with him.


However, not every person involved with forced adoptions has had such a wonderful experience. Being on the committee that drafted the national apology for forced adoption, we heard incredibly sad tales. In the consultations around Australia—not that I was involved in all of those as I went only to the ones in Brisbane—we heard horrific tale after horrific tale. I urge people to read the report of the Senate committee, chaired by the Greens Senator Rachel Siewert, that set up the process that led to the Prime Minister delivering the national apology for forced adoption on Thursday, 21 March this year.


Unfortunately, democracy being what it is, that day was not a great day. It was also the day of the faux coup, and that took a lot of the attention of the nation from the forced adoption apology. However, those people who were in the Great Hall and heard the Prime Minister's apology were moved significantly, including the Leader of the Opposition since this was a bipartisan event. The apology from the Prime Minister was significant although it will not make up for past wrongs and it could never make up for the heartache of those who never got to see their mum or their families and who have never found out who their parents are. Not everyone has a magnificent story like Andrew Garvey, my nephew, not that that story does not have a heartache attached to it as well. However, the nation saying sorry was a significant gesture. 


My first day in parliament was the day the member for Griffith, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, delivered an apology to the stolen generation. That was the very first thing I did as a member of parliament in Canberra. There was a welcome to country first and then we had the apology. It was an incredibly moving moment. It was an apology that has been heard around the world and that gesture lifted the standing of this nation. Again, it was a bipartisan gesture from both sides of parliament. I remember Brendan Nelson, then Leader of the Opposition, delivering the apology on behalf of the opposition. These as well as the other national apology are significant gestures.


As there is a Western Australian in the chamber, the deputy leader of the opposition, I particularly mention the contribution of the member for Swan, which was incredibly moving. He is surely one of the most significant gentlemen in this parliament. He is well liked on both sides of the chamber. The way he carried himself throughout his speech is a memory I will always have. I remember his first speech when he touched on some of these messages as well. It was incredibly moving.


The national apology for forced adoptions is something that we should be proud of as a parliament. These chambers can be quite adversarial sometimes, but I remind the Australian people that we can step up and do things in the national interest and be united. Thursday, 21 March, when the Prime Minister delivered the national apology for forced adoptions, is a day that should be remembered, and I am particularly proud of it. I commend the apology to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:22):  I rise on behalf of the coalition to lead some comments on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, which extends the interim measures applicable to the military justice system following the invalidation of the act establishing the Australian Military Court in 2009. This is the second time I will speak on an interim measures military justice bill—almost two years to the day that I spoke on the last interim justice bill. The interim measures are about the ability to actually pay the current judges who sit on the tribunals because we still do not have a military justice bill in the House to debate—staggering I know, unbelievable at best. 


A little history is always good. The Australian Military Court was established in 2007 in a bipartisan series of legislation following a number of Senate committees and other reports. On 26 August 2009, the High Court handed down a decision in Lane v Morrison that found the Australian Military Court unconstitutional. The High Court found unanimously that the provisions of the DFDA 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because it purported to exercise judicial power over the Commonwealth but did not meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution. Therefore, the interim measures bill was put into the parliament in 2009 to deal with the issues at hand and provide interim measures so that judges and other judicial officers could be paid.


We were told by Minister Faulkner at the time, in 2009, that this was about rectifying the military legal problems and that it would be afforded the government's highest priority. Yet by 22 June 2011 we still had no bill in the House to deal with Australian military justice. So the first interim measures came in, and here we are two years later—four years after the Minister for Defence said, 'this will be afforded the government's highest priority'—and we are still passing interim measures bills so that justices can be paid, because this government cannot get a bill together to put in place a military court that satisfies the constitutional requirements. It is simply and utterly staggering. But when you look at the litany of this government's highest priorities, even in Defence, it is staggering. I will read a paragraph from my speech on 22 June 2011:


Keeping military matters in mind, in 2007—I look at the member for Moreton—


and, surprise, surprise, here he is again—


who came in in 2007—the government said in the election campaign that one of its highest priorities was to address the fairness of the indexation of defence pensions.


Well, Member for Moreton, you came in on that platform, you came in spruiking the fairness of veterans' pensions. After six years, where are we? What have you done, sir, to ensure that military pensions for DFRDB are properly indexed? What has the member for Moreton done? The answer is: nothing. 





Mr ROBERT:
  No, I won't take a question, Member for Moreton, so sit yourself down and find a way to explain to your constituents why, in six years, you have done nothing for the veterans of our country. In 2009, it was 'the highest priority to address the issue of military justice.' It was the highest priority to index military pensions. Nothing was done in six years. Do you know what another highest priority was, Mr Deputy Speaker? Defence of the realm and national security were the highest priority. Prime Minister Rudd issued the first national security statement and promised that every single year he would update that. He never updated it, and the current Prime Minister has done one. We have had two in six years—and national security is the 'highest priority'. In fact, national security is of such a high priority that the current Prime Minister would not attend the National Security Committee of cabinet; she would send her bodyguard. That is how much 'high priority' the Prime Minister puts on national security.



An honourable member:  One of the members of the National Security Committee told us.




Mr ROBERT:
  Goodness! Would that have been Kevin? Who would have thought! If national security is so important, why has this government cumulatively cut $25 billion from defence—statement of fact? Why, if it was such a high priority? I am sick and tired of this government's 'highest priorities' when it comes to defence.


We had the budget handed down on Tuesday. Defence apparently did well: a 2.25 per cent increase in the budget. So it kept up with CPI. But when you read through it—their great announcement that there would be $2.9 billion for electronic attack warfare Growlers, how much extra money did the government give for Growler attack? Was it $200 million? $2.7 billion is absorbed.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I remind the member for Fadden: the bill before the Federation Chamber is the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013. I would just like to draw his attention to that and bring him back to the bill before the chamber.




Mr ROBERT:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am simply looking at what the last Minister for Defence said; we are onto our third in six years. He said it was the highest priority. To understand what the minister says when it comes to 'highest priority', a history lesson is also worthwhile.


Let me conclude with another paragraph out of the last speech I gave on this bill—which was to provide interim measures—two years ago. I said:


If it takes two years to move to reaffirm the interim measures bill, which was the highest priority, frankly I am not holding my breath on the government's capacity, capability, courage and conviction to actually get a proper bill before the House. 


That is what I said two years ago. I went on:


It is 12 months since fundamental injustice day, 12 months since the government lost its way. The Prime Minister's three priorities are still nowhere. All we have learnt is that the Prime Minister's highest priorities simply do not get any priority and the Minister for Defence's highest priorities get zero priority. That is a fabulous analogy for this wretched government—moribund, rotten and incapable of actually setting an agenda or a vision for the nation; setting priorities it does not keep and setting agendas it has no hope of ever reaching.




Mr Perrett:

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:30):  I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, a piece of legislation that I know a lot about. I would have thought that the shadow Defence spokesperson would have looked at the legislation and made some contribution. Obviously he is not that familiar with military justice. However, perhaps he will make the time to look into it. Justice in the military is obviously a complicated issue. It is that classic intersection between the personal rights of a member of the ADF and the national interest. Historically, the justice meted out in the military has been quite severe. If you are a member of the ADF, something as simple as falling asleep at work—which could happen in this parliament and might involve ridicule—could result in a significant loss of life among your colleagues, and therefore the penalty for falling asleep on your watch is quite significant. So there are different standards of justice in the military, and appropriately so. Obviously, they have evolved over the years. Hopefully, we are at the last and most logical iteration and, in light of the High Court's decision, this additional bill will bring resolution.


I should declare a slight interest in this because in my spare time—not that I have much—I am a legal officer, a flight lieutenant, in the RAAF. So it is an area of law that I am particularly interested in. And certainly the High Court challenge in the case of Lane and Morrison changed the approach to military justice. I would like to mention a couple of people from my electorate who are also legal officers in the RAAF—Uso Akari and Mike Nichols. They are two lawyers who give their time to go and work in the reserves. I mention them because they are from my electorate—I could mention many others. I should also mention our panel chair, David Montgomery, who does a great job. He has provided significant amounts of advice to me as to how this legislation should proceed—which I have done my best to pass on, I assure you, Monty. But getting it right does take a little bit of time.


The history of this legislation, as stated earlier by the member for Moncrieff, is that there has been a bipartisan approach. The Australian Military Court was established in 2006, comprising a chief military judge, two permanent military judges and a part-time reserve panel of judges—it is important to get that balance right. At the time, the Howard government hoped that the Australian Military Court would satisfy the principles of impartiality and judicial independence. I think there was advice about the implications under the Constitution and that it would actually have contravened chapter III of the Constitution, but people made the call at the time. I do not begrudge the Howard government, the defence minister of the time or the Attorney-General; it was a reasonable call to make. Obviously, in hindsight it was the wrong call. I do not fault the logic of the justices in the Lane and Morrison case. However, we do need to get it right and, despite all the bluff and bluster of the shadow spokesman for defence, we need to get it correct. Having a look at the type of people who will be able to step up is obviously one of the reasons there has been some delay in making sure that we get it right.


This interim measure, hopefully, will not have effect for long but will be a precursor to a system of justice that will support the individual member of the ADF but also apply the military discipline that is so important in peacetime in places such as Amberley. But it has to be the same military justice system that is operating on the front line in Afghanistan. As we heard from the Minister for Defence this morning when he addressed the parliament, there can be incredible stress placed on our ADF personnel, whether they be on ships, in the air or at the front line. They have to make incredibly quick calls about the rules of engagement and how they will operate in certain circumstances—this is especially so in places like Afghanistan, where the Taliban are working alongside you, in secret, with the intent of doing you harm. So it is important to get the right legal advice and the right rules of engagement and to know how they will operate.


The modern soldier is a very skilled operator. The standards that we see in the ADF are incredibly high. I first encountered the ADF through the parliamentary participation program, when I spent a week out at Amberley. I was blown away at how professional our ADF personnel were, particularly those in the RAAF—I say that because all of my cousins are in the RAAF. In fact, my cousin is in the media at the moment. I was speaking to her on Monday night. It is amazing because of the phone links. They are just going about their business in 51 degree heat with full body armour, but with modern communications they can just phone home as well. The modern world has particular challenges but the modern military justice still has to go back to the core basics of maintaining discipline while being fair, and of entitling people to the appropriate representation. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:38):  I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013. Today's bill will extend the interim regime established by the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 following the High Court's invalidation of the original legislation establishing the Australian Military Court in Lane v Morrison in 2009. The Labor government previously announced details of the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 as legislation to conclude the interim measures; however, as I understand it, the government has not yet adequately worked through the many unresolved legal issues in that bill. Therefore, the coalition supports these interim measures as drafted.


The interim regime provides for the appointment and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate and other statutory office holders on a fixed tenure of four years, which will expire in September 2013. The purpose of today's bill is to extend their tenure for an additional two years or such lesser period as the Minister for Defence specifies by legislative instrument.


From my many engagements with the ADF I know that all Australian Defence Force members take their roles and the responsibility that comes with being in the ADF very seriously and act accordingly. It is true, however, that we have a criminal law system set up with courts to deal with transgressions against the law, and in the same way we have encoded in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 the transgressions against the law by servicemen and servicewomen which, in their conduct through the ADF, are not civilian in nature and should be dealt with by a specific military court, not just a federal magistrate. The concept of the Military Court of Australia is therefore a recognition that the role of Australia's military justice system is to support command in reinforcing discipline and enhancing operational effectiveness. In terms of serious service offences, it takes the adjudicatory role function away from the ADF chain of command, which I will touch on later, and may comprise judicial officers who have a genuine understanding of the nature of service in the ADF by reason of their experience or training.


The establishment of an independent military court is not a new issue. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of the military justice system, and in that report it recommended that the Australian Military Court be established for serious service offences committed by ADF personnel. At the time, the committee recognised reforms that had been undertaken in other countries, including the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. It recognised that there is a lack of impartiality in courts martial and that there is a growing international trend towards independent military judicial officials in recognition of the fact that allowing service personnel access to independent and impartial tribunals makes for a more effective military justice system.


The Howard government implemented 32 of the 40 recommendations and established the Australian Military Court on 1 October 2007. However, in August 2009, as a result of the Lane v Morrison case, the High Court of Australia unanimously found that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and provisions which created the Military Court were constitutionally invalid, as Commonwealth judicial power could only be exercised under chapter III of the Constitution. The Australian Military Court was therefore suspended, and a bipartisan approach was taken with the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence to return serious service offences to the old approach—namely, the system of courts martial and Defence Force magistrate trials. During that process, given that all convictions recorded by the AMC between October 2007 and 26 August 2009 were consequentially invalid, legislation was passed to give effect to many of the punishments and orders made by the AMC, and punishment was reviewed for those convicted under the AMC practice. It has taken significant time to fully consider legislation that is in concordance with the use of Commonwealth judicial power under chapter III. The issue was sidelined, unfortunately, when the bill presented in June 2010 lapsed when parliament was dissolved on 19 July 2010, when the federal election was called.


I would like to take this opportunity to comment on those lingering legal issues around the establishment of the Military Court of Australia. In the submissions that have been made over the years about this issue, there are two main concerns about the structure and function of the court. First, the Military Court of Australia, by design, will not feature a jury process, normally afforded to all Australian citizens in section 80 of the Constitution, which states:


The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.


In particular, the Returned and Services League, or RSL, is concerned that a court with only one military judge acting alone would be in contravention of the rights normally afforded to all Australian citizens, and that includes our servicemen and servicewomen. The original explanatory memorandum to the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 claimed that a Military Court of Australia would be 'compatible with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011' by engaging the following rights: the right to a fair trial, which means 'a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal'; freedom from arbitrary detention; the right to humane treatment in detention; and the right to privacy.


In terms of establishing a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, the court was to be set up such that people serving presently in the ADF would not be eligible to be a judge or federal magistrate under the court, and furthermore that the Military Court would be independent from the military chain of command. Importantly, in line with the practices of the Federal Court of Australia, the court would involve procedures for making appeals from the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court for decisions in the General Division of the MCA. Of course, following that process, appeals can be made to the High Court of Australia.


There would be offences contained in schedule 1 which delimit the types of classes and the circumstances under which someone alleged to have committed an act is to be tried. Those are class 1 offences, including offences relating to operations against an enemy and desertion, as well as offences including murder, manslaughter and serious sexual offences, which must be heard and determined by the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court of Australia. This is in line with serious criminal offences at the civilian level, which are heard by judges of a superior court—that is, the Supreme Court, rather than a magistrate's court. Other offences, as the explanatory memorandum notes, relate to service offences that go to the very core of maintaining discipline and morale in the ADF: abandoning or surrendering a post, harbouring enemies, failing to carry out orders, mutiny, desertion and dangerous conduct.


I note that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in 2012 advised that it would not conduct a parallel inquiry into this issue given that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was also investigating the issue. I note that its report was published on 9 October 2012. During that process the coalition continued its deliberations and issued a dissenting report. The Liberal senators made three recommendations based on their concerns. They ultimately decided that all members of the ADF are entitled to the same rights and protections that other Australians receive in a chapter 3 court, and therefore recommended that the bill be amended to include the right to trial by jury for all offences which would customarily be listed on indictment in the civilian context. Therefore, the right to trial by jury should be afforded for service offences with a punishment of more than 12 months imprisonment.


Secondly, they acknowledged the concerns of groups like the Australian Defence Association that permanent or active reservists would be ineligible for appointment to the Military Court, and as such recommended that, to the extent that chapter 3 of the Constitution would allow for permanent reservists and standby reservists to be appointed as judicial officers of the Military Court, as a consequence the available pool would be expanded to include people who have an understanding of military service and as such can make a meaningful contribution to the Military Court itself. I strongly agree that it is all very well for judicial officers to have an understanding of military service, but real experience of service and of battle provide an insight into the challenges of military decision making that a mere 'suitable understanding' cannot possibly achieve. The coalition senators noted that an important consequence of this recommendation would be to increase confidence in the court from both within the ADF and in the general public.


I noted in my maiden speech my appreciation for the sacrifices that our troops make around the world. I also highlighted the fundamental importance of clear rules of engagement prior to entering any conflict. I said at the time:


… if this nation fails to cloak our soldiers with the full protection of the law when they go into battle, we fail them all. The rules of engagement must be crystal clear and our support strong. If we put Australian troops into the heat of battle and expect them to take enormous risks on our behalf, we cannot expect them to be split-second lawyers as well.


The ongoing consideration of the Military Court of Australia is an important part of that process of supporting and protecting our troops which, I have noted, is integral to the morale and wellbeing of ADF personnel. The coalition will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that all issues are resolved appropriately.


More generally, and ultimately, it is up to the federal government to support its troops. This Labor government has cut more than $25 billion from Defence, which has crippled the Defence industry sector. In the last three years the industry has lost more than 5,000 jobs and will continue to shed jobs in light of this government's mismanagement of Defence. In 2009 the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, predicted that the local workforce would be as high as 34,000 by 2013. Today, however, that figure stands between 24,000 and 25,000 local jobs according to the Defence Materiel Organisation. Clearly, the Labor government's savage cuts to Defence are translating into a struggling Australian industry.


This is unacceptable for what is a vital strategic sector of our economy. We should be supporting the growth of a home-grown Defence industry, not continuing to pull the rug out from underneath it. The Defence community has, since 2007, being represented by a Labor government that does not listen or support it, nor even action its own 2009 Defence white paper. More recently, the Minister for Defence released the 2013 Defence white paper, which was full of impressive photo opportunities but had no plan, no schedule and no money. In a document that talks boldly of new ships, new submarines and new aircraft there is no dollar figure listed for their construction.


At the next election Australians have a choice between the Labor Party, which offers empty rhetoric on defence issues and has no intention of even paying lip service to restoring more than $25 billion of cuts, and a new government with a proven track record, a coalition government that will restore hope, reward and opportunity for our defence forces.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Minister for Defence Materiel) (10:50):  I thank the member for Ryan for her comments and I congratulate her son for his service. Please pass on our regards and thanks to him for that service, particularly having returned from the difficult environment of Afghanistan. I have had the opportunity to observe and understand the nature of that service.


This obviously has been an issue that has been fraught for some time. There have been many attempts to navigate some of the vagaries of the issues thrown up by military justice. In reply to some of the comments that were made about our commitment to defence spending, as you have seen in this budget, that spending has actually increased. In my quarter of a century of involvement in security policy in this country and in the Defence Force, I have never seen a more significant delivery of capability to the Defence Force in that time. It is a very exciting time for the Defence Force. We have carefully balanced the challenges of defence capability planning and are delivering capability that is going to set this country up very well for its security needs and for its ability to respond to disasters both nationally and within the region as well. I congratulate our service personnel, our service chiefs and all of those within the Defence Materiel Organisation who have helped us manage that difficult challenge of juggling the delivery of that capability with our revenue needs.


In summing up the debate on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, I would like to thank all of those who have taken an interest in this issue and who have contributed to the debate. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the High Court on 26 August 2009 found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because they were not consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Commonwealth Constitution.


The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 was subsequently passed by this parliament to reinstate the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. This act ensured that military discipline arrangements, in particular the system of court martial and Defence Force magistrate trials, continued to operate effectively. The reinstatement of the pre-2007 military justice system was also required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Constitution.


The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 provided for a tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocate's panel. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011 previously extended the appointment arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for a two-year period. However, this tenure is due to expire in September.


The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013 will continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for an additional two years or until the Minister for Defence declares by legislative instrument a specified day to be a termination day, whichever is sooner. The purpose of Australia's military discipline system is to support command in maintaining and enforcing service discipline in order to enhance operational effectiveness. A military discipline system that supports the authority and effectiveness of commanders is of vital importance in the operation of the Australian Defence Force. This bill is one contribution in support of an effective military discipline system.


In closing, I would also like to say that both the coalition and the government have a bipartisan approach to the funding of the Defence Force. It is pleasing to see there is now certainty in that respect going forward. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:22):  I rise on behalf of the coalition to lead some comments on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, which extends the interim measures applicable to the military justice system following the invalidation of the act establishing the Australian Military Court in 2009. This is the second time I will speak on an interim measures military justice bill—almost two years to the day that I spoke on the last interim justice bill. The interim measures are about the ability to actually pay the current judges who sit on the tribunals because we still do not have a military justice bill in the House to debate—staggering I know, unbelievable at best. 


A little history is always good. The Australian Military Court was established in 2007 in a bipartisan series of legislation following a number of Senate committees and other reports. On 26 August 2009, the High Court handed down a decision in Lane v Morrison that found the Australian Military Court unconstitutional. The High Court found unanimously that the provisions of the DFDA 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because it purported to exercise judicial power over the Commonwealth but did not meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution. Therefore, the interim measures bill was put into the parliament in 2009 to deal with the issues at hand and provide interim measures so that judges and other judicial officers could be paid.


We were told by Minister Faulkner at the time, in 2009, that this was about rectifying the military legal problems and that it would be afforded the government's highest priority. Yet by 22 June 2011 we still had no bill in the House to deal with Australian military justice. So the first interim measures came in, and here we are two years later—four years after the Minister for Defence said, 'this will be afforded the government's highest priority'—and we are still passing interim measures bills so that justices can be paid, because this government cannot get a bill together to put in place a military court that satisfies the constitutional requirements. It is simply and utterly staggering. But when you look at the litany of this government's highest priorities, even in Defence, it is staggering.

They are two lawyers who give their time to go and work in the reserves. I mention them because they are from my electorate—I could mention many others. I should also mention our panel chair, David Montgomery, who does a great job. He has provided significant amounts of advice to me as to how this legislation should proceed—which I have done my best to pass on, I assure you, Monty. But getting it right does take a little bit of time.


The history of this legislation, as stated earlier by the member for Moncrieff, is that there has been a bipartisan approach. The Australian Military Court was established in 2006, comprising a chief military judge, two permanent military judges and a part-time reserve panel of judges—it is important to get that balance right. At the time, the Howard government hoped that the Australian Military Court would satisfy the principles of impartiality and judicial independence. I think there was advice about the implications under the Constitution and that it would actually have contravened chapter III of the Constitution, but people made the call at the time. I do not begrudge the Howard government, the defence minister of the time or the Attorney-General; it was a reasonable call to make. Obviously, in hindsight it was the wrong call. I do not fault the logic of the justices in the Lane and Morrison case. However, we do need to get it right and, despite all the bluff and bluster of the shadow spokesman for defence, we need to get it correct. Having a look at the type of people who will be able to step up is obviously one of the reasons there has been some delay in making sure that we get it right.


This interim measure, hopefully, will not have effect for long but will be a precursor to a system of justice that will support the individual member of the ADF but also apply the military discipline that is so important in peacetime in places such as Amberley. But it has to be the same military justice system that is operating on the front line in Afghanistan. As we heard from the Minister for Defence this morning when he addressed the parliament, there can be incredible stress placed on our ADF personnel, whether they be on ships, in the air or at the front line. They have to make incredibly quick calls about the rules of engagement and how they will operate in certain circumstances—this is especially so in places like Afghanistan, where the Taliban are working alongside you, in secret, with the intent of doing you harm. So it is important to get the right legal advice and the right rules of engagement and to know how they will operate.


The modern soldier is a very skilled operator. The standards that we see in the ADF are incredibly high. I first encountered the ADF through the parliamentary participation program, when I spent a week out at Amberley. I was blown away at how professional our ADF personnel were, particularly those in the RAAF—I say that because all of my cousins are in the RAAF. In fact, my cousin is in the media at the moment. I was speaking to her on Monday night. It is amazing because of the phone links. They are just going about their business in 51 degree heat with full body armour, but with modern communications they can just phone home as well. The modern world has particular challenges but the modern military justice still has to go back to the core basics of maintaining discipline while being fair, and of entitling people to the appropriate representation. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:38):  I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013. Today's bill will extend the interim regime established by the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 following the High Court's invalidation of the original legislation establishing the Australian Military Court in Lane v Morrison in 2009. The Labor government previously announced details of the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 as legislation to conclude the interim measures; however, as I understand it, the government has not yet adequately worked through the many unresolved legal issues in that bill. Therefore, the coalition supports these interim measures as drafted.


The interim regime provides for the appointment and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate and other statutory office holders on a fixed tenure of four years, which will expire in September 2013. The purpose of today's bill is to extend their tenure for an additional two years or such lesser period as the Minister for Defence specifies by legislative instrument.


From my many engagements with the ADF I know that all Australian Defence Force members take their roles and the responsibility that comes with being in the ADF very seriously and act accordingly. It is true, however, that we have a criminal law system set up with courts to deal with transgressions against the law, and in the same way we have encoded in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 the transgressions against the law by servicemen and servicewomen which, in their conduct through the ADF, are not civilian in nature and should be dealt with by a specific military court, not just a federal magistrate. The concept of the Military Court of Australia is therefore a recognition that the role of Australia's military justice system is to support command in reinforcing discipline and enhancing operational effectiveness. In terms of serious service offences, it takes the adjudicatory role function away from the ADF chain of command, which I will touch on later, and may comprise judicial officers who have a genuine understanding of the nature of service in the ADF by reason of their experience or training.


The establishment of an independent military court is not a new issue. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of the military justice system, and in that report it recommended that the Australian Military Court be established for serious service offences committed by ADF personnel. At the time, the committee recognised reforms that had been undertaken in other countries, including the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. It recognised that there is a lack of impartiality in courts martial and that there is a growing international trend towards independent military judicial officials in recognition of the fact that allowing service personnel access to independent and impartial tribunals makes for a more effective military justice system.


The Howard government implemented 32 of the 40 recommendations and established the Australian Military Court on 1 October 2007. However, in August 2009, as a result of the Lane v Morrison case, the High Court of Australia unanimously found that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and provisions which created the Military Court were constitutionally invalid, as Commonwealth judicial power could only be exercised under chapter III of the Constitution. The Australian Military Court was therefore suspended, and a bipartisan approach was taken with the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence to return serious service offences to the old approach—namely, the system of courts martial and Defence Force magistrate trials. During that process, given that all convictions recorded by the AMC between October 2007 and 26 August 2009 were consequentially invalid, legislation was passed to give effect to many of the punishments and orders made by the AMC, and punishment was reviewed for those convicted under the AMC practice. It has taken significant time to fully consider legislation that is in concordance with the use of Commonwealth judicial power under chapter III. The issue was sidelined, unfortunately, when the bill presented in June 2010 lapsed when parliament was dissolved on 19 July 2010, when the federal election was called.


I would like to take this opportunity to comment on those lingering legal issues around the establishment of the Military Court of Australia. In the submissions that have been made over the years about this issue, there are two main concerns about the structure and function of the court. First, the Military Court of Australia, by design, will not feature a jury process, normally afforded to all Australian citizens in section 80 of the Constitution, which states:


The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.


In particular, the Returned and Services League, or RSL, is concerned that a court with only one military judge acting alone would be in contravention of the rights normally afforded to all Australian citizens, and that includes our servicemen and servicewomen. The original explanatory memorandum to the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 claimed that a Military Court of Australia would be 'compatible with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011' by engaging the following rights: the right to a fair trial, which means 'a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal'; freedom from arbitrary detention; the right to humane treatment in detention; and the right to privacy.


In terms of establishing a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, the court was to be set up such that people serving presently in the ADF would not be eligible to be a judge or federal magistrate under the court, and furthermore that the Military Court would be independent from the military chain of command. Importantly, in line with the practices of the Federal Court of Australia, the court would involve procedures for making appeals from the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court for decisions in the General Division of the MCA. Of course, following that process, appeals can be made to the High Court of Australia.


There would be offences contained in schedule 1 which delimit the types of classes and the circumstances under which someone alleged to have committed an act is to be tried. Those are class 1 offences, including offences relating to operations against an enemy and desertion, as well as offences including murder, manslaughter and serious sexual offences, which must be heard and determined by the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court of Australia. This is in line with serious criminal offences at the civilian level, which are heard by judges of a superior court—that is, the Supreme Court, rather than a magistrate's court. Other offences, as the explanatory memorandum notes, relate to service offences that go to the very core of maintaining discipline and morale in the ADF: abandoning or surrendering a post, harbouring enemies, failing to carry out orders, mutiny, desertion and dangerous conduct.


I note that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in 2012 advised that it would not conduct a parallel inquiry into this issue given that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was also investigating the issue. I note that its report was published on 9 October 2012. During that process the coalition continued its deliberations and issued a dissenting report. The Liberal senators made three recommendations based on their concerns. They ultimately decided that all members of the ADF are entitled to the same rights and protections that other Australians receive in a chapter 3 court, and therefore recommended that the bill be amended to include the right to trial by jury for all offences which would customarily be listed on indictment in the civilian context. Therefore, the right to trial by jury should be afforded for service offences with a punishment of more than 12 months imprisonment.


Secondly, they acknowledged the concerns of groups like the Australian Defence Association that permanent or active reservists would be ineligible for appointment to the Military Court, and as such recommended that, to the extent that chapter 3 of the Constitution would allow for permanent reservists and standby reservists to be appointed as judicial officers of the Military Court, as a consequence the available pool would be expanded to include people who have an understanding of military service and as such can make a meaningful contribution to the Military Court itself. I strongly agree that it is all very well for judicial officers to have an understanding of military service, but real experience of service and of battle provide an insight into the challenges of military decision making that a mere 'suitable understanding' cannot possibly achieve. The coalition senators noted that an important consequence of this recommendation would be to increase confidence in the court from both within the ADF and in the general public.


I noted in my maiden speech my appreciation for the sacrifices that our troops make around the world. I also highlighted the fundamental importance of clear rules of engagement prior to entering any conflict. I said at the time:


… if this nation fails to cloak our soldiers with the full protection of the law when they go into battle, we fail them all. The rules of engagement must be crystal clear and our support strong. If we put Australian troops into the heat of battle and expect them to take enormous risks on our behalf, we cannot expect them to be split-second lawyers as well.


The ongoing consideration of the Military Court of Australia is an important part of that process of supporting and protecting our troops which, I have noted, is integral to the morale and wellbeing of ADF personnel. The coalition will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that all issues are resolved appropriately.


More generally, and ultimately, it is up to the federal government to support its troops. This Labor government has cut more than $25 billion from Defence, which has crippled the Defence industry sector. In the last three years the industry has lost more than 5,000 jobs and will continue to shed jobs in light of this government's mismanagement of Defence. In 2009 the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, predicted that the local workforce would be as high as 34,000 by 2013. Today, however, that figure stands between 24,000 and 25,000 local jobs according to the Defence Materiel Organisation. Clearly, the Labor government's savage cuts to Defence are translating into a struggling Australian industry.


This is unacceptable for what is a vital strategic sector of our economy. We should be supporting the growth of a home-grown Defence industry, not continuing to pull the rug out from underneath it. The Defence community has, since 2007, being represented by a Labor government that does not listen or support it, nor even action its own 2009 Defence white paper. More recently, the Minister for Defence released the 2013 Defence white paper, which was full of impressive photo opportunities but had no plan, no schedule and no money. In a document that talks boldly of new ships, new submarines and new aircraft there is no dollar figure listed for their construction.


At the next election Australians have a choice between the Labor Party, which offers empty rhetoric on defence issues and has no intention of even paying lip service to restoring more than $25 billion of cuts, and a new government with a proven track record, a coalition government that will restore hope, reward and opportunity for our defence forces.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Minister for Defence Materiel) (10:50):  I thank the member for Ryan for her comments and I congratulate her son for his service. Please pass on our regards and thanks to him for that service, particularly having returned from the difficult environment of Afghanistan. I have had the opportunity to observe and understand the nature of that service.


This obviously has been an issue that has been fraught for some time. There have been many attempts to navigate some of the vagaries of the issues thrown up by military justice. In reply to some of the comments that were made about our commitment to defence spending, as you have seen in this budget, that spending has actually increased. In my quarter of a century of involvement in security policy in this country and in the Defence Force, I have never seen a more significant delivery of capability to the Defence Force in that time. It is a very exciting time for the Defence Force. We have carefully balanced the challenges of defence capability planning and are delivering capability that is going to set this country up very well for its security needs and for its ability to respond to disasters both nationally and within the region as well. I congratulate our service personnel, our service chiefs and all of those within the Defence Materiel Organisation who have helped us manage that difficult challenge of juggling the delivery of that capability with our revenue needs.


In summing up the debate on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, I would like to thank all of those who have taken an interest in this issue and who have contributed to the debate. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the High Court on 26 August 2009 found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because they were not consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Commonwealth Constitution.


The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 was subsequently passed by this parliament to reinstate the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. This act ensured that military discipline arrangements, in particular the system of court martial and Defence Force magistrate trials, continued to operate effectively. The reinstatement of the pre-2007 military justice system was also required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Constitution.


The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 provided for a tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocate's panel. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011 previously extended the appointment arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for a two-year period. However, this tenure is due to expire in September.


The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013 will continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for an additional two years or until the Minister for Defence declares by legislative instrument a specified day to be a termination day, whichever is sooner. The purpose of Australia's military discipline system is to support command in maintaining and enforcing service discipline in order to enhance operational effectiveness. A military discipline system that supports the authority and effectiveness of commanders is of vital importance in the operation of the Australian Defence Force. This bill is one contribution in support of an effective military discipline system.


In closing, I would also like to say that both the coalition and the government have a bipartisan approach to the funding of the Defence Force. It is pleasing to see there is now certainty in that respect going forward. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-05-16,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:17):  The south-west of Western Australia produces some of the best food and wine in the nation. Members already know of the iconic Margaret River and Geographe wine regions, but they should also be aware of the fruit and vegetables, dairy products and beef and lamb which mark the south-west of Western Australia as one of Australia's finest and most efficient food producing regions. If you are not aware, perhaps you should come along to my South-West Sensations Showcase, to be held here at Parliament House on 18 June, where you will receive a taste of what the region has to offer.


To produce many of these products requires a workforce, and in many cases the workforce cannot be found locally. Agricultural areas in regional Australia might be areas of high production but they are not areas of high population. They often struggle to find workers in sufficient numbers. An obvious answer might seem to be to move Australians from areas of unemployment in our cities to the regions where the jobs are. But usually they will not go. So producers have for a generation had to source their workforce from overseas. There was no other choice. Many have sponsored workers on 457 visas in order to get their harvest done. Otherwise, you do not have a harvest. 


Backpackers have also contributed. They have filled fruit bins in Donnybrook, Manjimup, Busselton, Harvey and Margaret River for decades on their travels around Australia. However, backpackers alone are not the answer. Many arrive on farms unskilled and have to be taught the basics of picking. And then, having upskilled, they sometimes work for only a week or so before moving on. That is why a combination of short- and long-term workers is essential, and that is why access to 457 visa workers is vital to the rural industries. You only have to go out into my south-west to find out how vital they are. Talk to the growers. Ask them how they are able to actually get their crops. They will say to you it is only through a combination of backpackers and 457 visa holders.


Recently there has been a surplus of backpacker workers in some areas, which, in conjunction with long-term staff, has assisted in taking some of the pressure off some producers. As soon as that happened, the Labor government jumped in—unfortunately—to make it harder again. Doubling the price of 457 visas from $450 to $900 is just another slap in the face for regional producers who feed the nation quality food. It is another example—as if we need it—of Labor's contempt, and I would say absolute contempt, for the farming, rural and regional communities. It is contempt. It is also another practical example—if we needed that—of budget mismanagement by the Gillard Labor government.


We already have the example of gross debt reaching $356 billion, requiring another blow-out in the nation's debt ceiling; and a net debt reaching $191 billion. We have a Labor Treasurer who promised a budget surplus this year but will deliver a $19 billion deficit. This Treasurer will never deliver a budget surplus. This was the Treasurer who promised that the budget last year would deliver a surplus this year on time, and surpluses the year after that, strengthening over time. The Treasurer also promised that the deficit years of the global recession were behind us and the surplus years were here. We are still waiting, Mr Treasurer.


I look at all this debt, deficit and broken promises and I think: was there some funding in all of that for the completion of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road? It is nearly two-thirds built. It is unfinished. The final stage was originally budgeted at $260 million. It is probably now over $300 million. That is an urgently needed piece of infrastructure that deserves state and federal funding support. This is a practical way the government could have assisted in my part of the world, right throughout this process; instead, we have seen nothing but waste and mismanagement, and debt and deficit, which will be the signature of this Labor government and its legacy to this nation.
