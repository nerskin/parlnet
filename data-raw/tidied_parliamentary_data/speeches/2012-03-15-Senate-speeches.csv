Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  The Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, which was initially foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, is an important acknowledgement of the debt that this country owes to people who have been injured in the course of terrorist incidents overseas. We should never forget the high price that Australia has paid due to the activity, in particular, of Islamist terrorists.


Since 11 September 2001, some 300 Australians have been killed or injured in terrorist incidents overseas. We lost Australians in the World Trade Centre. We lost many Australians in Bali—not once, but twice. We lost Australians in London and we lost Australians in Jakarta. Some 300 of our fellow citizens have been killed or injured. Let us never forget that those bombs went off because the perpetrators of those outrages believe that our way of life is a satanic excrescence. That is what in the perversion of their own minds they believe. The people who died or were injured in those terrorist incidents were targeted precisely because of the way of life, the values and the civilisation of which we are part. Australia has been targeted precisely because we are part of and proud to be part of Western civilisation: a nation which lives by the values and takes pride in its identity as a part of Western civilisation. That is why the terrorists hate us.


It should be remembered that after each of the terrorist incidents the Australian government has been there to help. Centrelink assistance has been rendered. Medical expenses have been paid. I want to congratulate governments of both persuasions for the effort they have made to help Australians and to continue to help Australians who have been injured and the families of those who have been killed in terrorist incidents overseas.


We have to acknowledge the fact that these people have suffered for their country in a way not entirely different from the sufferings that our soldiers have faced in the struggle against terrorism. They were not random victims. They were victims because of the way of life of this country and they were chosen as targets because of the way of life of the civilisation in which we participate. We should not underestimate the ongoing suffering of those who were injured and of the families of those who were injured and killed.


We cannot think that our duty to them as a nation ends simply because they were given Centrelink assistance to come back to this country and simply because their relatives were given Centrelink assistance to do what they could to help. We cannot think that our duty to them has ended just because their medical expenses for the immediate injuries that they suffered were paid. There is a lifetime of pain for those people, physical and psychological, and it needs to be acknowledged, recognized and in some way made up for by the wider Australian community.


What this bill proposes is that the national government establish a scheme to compensate the Australian victims of overseas terrorist attacks that is analogous with the victims-of-crimes schemes which have long operated in most of the Australian states and territories.


If an Australian is the victim of a criminal act in this country he or she will usually receive some form of compensation, some monetary benefit, from the state and territory governments. It is not lavish. It is not the sort of thing which is going to enable people to live in luxury for the rest of their lives—far from it. It is not full compensation in the sense that a lawyer would understand a damages award in a personal injuries case as compensation. Nevertheless, it is an important acknowledgement by our community of the unjustified and completely abhorrent pain and suffering that the victim of crime has been put through.


The bill proposes the establishment of a federal scheme, analogous to the state victims-of-crime schemes, purely for the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts. It is a modest, responsible, and necessary measure by this parliament for the benefit of those people.


I accept that there are some issues with oppositions proposing measures of this kind that might create a charge upon the revenue. I would be very happy for this bill to be taken over by the government. The coalition would welcome that. The government has proposed a way of helping the Australian victims of terrorist incidents overseas but for reasons that are not clear it has not proceeded. I would be grateful to see it advanced, whether here or in the other place. In the meantime, the opposition offers this private senator's bill in order to meet the need that I have identified.


We must stand by our fellow Australians in trouble and those who were targeted because they were Australians, because they were emblems of our way of life. They deserve this modest measure of recognition, help and acknowledgement. I commend the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbot, who initiated this proposal and has driven the proposal for several years now. And I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (09:37):  I rise to speak on the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, brought forth by Senator Brandis and the coalition. I want to take this opportunity to put on record my strongest condemnation of acts of terrorism and the form terrorism takes. More often than not terrorism takes the form of an indiscriminate attack on civilians and bystanders whose only crime has been to be a member of a particular polity or to be in a particular place.


Terrorists do not engage in conflict under the normal rules of engagement by which state armed forces are bound. That, of course, means that they do not abide by international humanitarian law. They have no concept of the distinction between legitimate targets of military activity as defined through the instruments of international humanitarian law, and civilian targets—civilian targets being, more often than not, the innocent bystanders in terrorist acts. Instead, the purpose of terrorist organisations, by definition, is to create such insecurity and such uncertainty and fear in a political culture as to effect some sort of radical change. While the aim of most terrorist organisations is to effect changes in the policies of states, their means are violence against private citizens, who, more often than not, are the victims of terrorist acts.


Australia has not been immune from terrorism in the past. While the most recent and bloody stain on the national consciousness was in Kuta, Bali, in October 2002, Australians have been affected by terrorism at an average of 30 victims per year over the last decade. In some cases, Australians have been bystanders caught up in events. In other cases, as in Bali, they have been specifically targeted for their nationality and what they represent: democracy, participation and freedom—values which, in this country, we have enshrined in instruments of law and in our Constitution.


It is my very strong belief that political violence can never be justified. Even under the most extreme circumstances there is no excuse for resorting to force, brutality and murder, as terrorists do, especially against the innocent victims terrorists target in their search for the most vulnerable and most dramatic display of force.


I want to make it clear that I and the Labor government deplore acts of terrorism, and we have the greatest of compassion for those Australians caught up in the tragic displays of political violence perpetrated by terrorists. There is simply no sense of justice or dignity attached to the actions of the extremists who are prepared to sacrifice innocent people for political ends.


And in this new age of asymmetric warfare, in which non-state actors pose an increased, more widely dispersed threat to the citizens of the world, especially those who respect the proper processes of democratic decision-making, it is important for us to have strong, consistent and comprehensive means of addressing terrorism related issues.


I want also to recognise the impact of criminal activity on victims of crime. It can be devastating for individuals and families who suffer the effects of violence, insecurity and shock brought about by criminal activity. In this case, the criminal activities are under the guise of paramilitary activity. Like any serious injury, the effects of crime are both physical and psychological and can endure long after the actual act has subsided. Associated with the immediate effect of crime can be prolonged periods of shock, depression, stress, loss of esteem and disorientation.


In every Australian state and territory, the disabling effect of the trauma inflicted upon victims of crime is recognised through victims-of-crime schemes, making victims eligible for lump-sum payments under criminal injuries schemes. While the state and territory schemes do include the effects of terrorism, jurisdiction for these schemes does not extend beyond state or territory borders. Victims of terrorism overseas do not currently have a scheme to recognise the effect of terrorism on their lives.


That said, over the last decade and longer, the Australian government has gone to some length to support its citizens who have been affected by terrorism overseas. Since September 11, a number of Australians have been injured and more than 100 have been killed in overseas terrorist incidents. Assistance has been directed to victims of these events, including under the disaster health care assistance schemes, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and short-term financial assistance. The September 11th victim compensation fund, for example, provided assistance to those injured in the terrible attacks upon the World Trade Centre in New York, and their families. Substantial payments were made to the next of kin of Australians killed in those attacks in recognition of the sudden, unpredictable and tragic loss of life in that event. In total, in the last decade, more than $12 million has been expended on assistance and support for victims of overseas terrorism. But it is clear that the Australian government does require a way to recognise victims of overseas terrorism that is both clear and consistent. And I want to commend the original motivation of the bill before the Senate, which arises from the advocacy of the member for Paterson and the Leader of the Opposition. The purpose of the opposition's bill is to provide additional financial support, I understand, of up to $75,000 for Australians who are affected by terrorism overseas, or their next of kin.


The bill before the Senate at the moment requires the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to administer payments to Australian families who have suffered as a result of an international terrorist act. But while one could support the original intention of this bill we are debating here today, the Australian government is already acting on this issue. Last year the then Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, introduced the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill to achieve a similar purpose to that of the bill we are currently debating. Unlike the bill brought on today by the coalition, that bill includes robust criteria for the eligibility of victims under the proposed scheme and a framework for administering payments. That framework includes the principles and guidelines by which any scheme would be administered, including the nature, duration and impact of the injury; the likelihood of future loss, injury or disease; the circumstance in which injury was incurred; the relationships between victims; the number of claimants relating to a particular incident; and other relevant factors.


The government bill currently before the parliament also seeks to clarify an ambiguity within the coalition's bill, relating to whether the scheme might apply retrospectively. As I have mentioned, over a long period of time the Australian government has attempted to recognise the impact on victims of overseas terrorism through ad hoc means. While it is not clear in the legislation we are debating, my understanding from public comments by the coalition on this bill is that their scheme is intended to apply retrospectively, duplicating some of the good work already done by the previous government programs of which I have already spoken and which are already in place.


With an issue of such traumatic impact and on a matter on which there is generally bipartisan support, I believe it is disappointing to have the opposition bring forward a private senator's bill to attempt to grandstand rather than actually seek to solve a problem. Despite the various technical and logistical issues with this bill that are clarified or resolved in the government's bill and despite a firm commitment from the Gillard Labor government to continue to pursue a compensation scheme that is essentially the same scale proposed by the coalition, the Liberal and National parties have found it necessary to showboat on this issue rather than get behind the serious and comprehensive efforts of this government. If they were genuine about wanting to do something in relation to the principle and the main objectives outlined in the government's bill to assist victims of overseas terrorism, they would have done so. They would have done so in supporting the government's bill. Instead, what we have here today is grandstanding, bringing forth their own private senator's bill for no other apparent means but to politicise and play a grandstanding game with this very important and significant issue. That is disappointing. But at the end of the day what is most important is that victims of overseas terrorism are supported by their nation. I sincerely hope that when the government's bill comes before this chamber the opposition will be as supportive about a bill that comprehensively addresses this issue as they are about the political and parliamentary tactics they have employed in bringing on this debate today.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-03-15,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:49):  I rise to speak on the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. Compensation for victims of terrorist attacks is an extremely important matter for Australians and there is clearly tripartisan or cross-party support for this principle. Because of its importance, however, the mechanism for administering and funding this compensation must be addressed both effectively and responsibly, and that is where the Australian Greens believe there is still a necessary area for further discussion.


This bill proposes financial assistance of up to $75,000 for Australians who are injured or hospitalised, or whose next of kin is killed, in an offshore terrorism incident. The details of the scheme are not included in the bill. They are left to be included in guidelines, which have not yet been developed. The bill indicates that these guidelines would be developed by the minister.


Since September 11, 2001 more than 200 Australians have been injured and more than 100 have been killed in overseas terrorist incidents. Significant targeted assistance was provided to victims of those events, including through disaster healthcare assistance schemes, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and immediate short-term financial assistance through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. The Australian government has expended more than $12 million on assistance and support for those individuals and their families. To date, payments to victims of terrorism have been made ex gratia, using the executive power of the Commonwealth under section 61 of the Constitution. The Prime Minister and/or the cabinet decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether an ex gratia payment is to be made and have done so in overseas terrorism cases such as Bali and Mumbai. Ex gratia payments can be made from either departmental or administered appropriations. However, an appropriation must have an outcome that covers the payment.


I understand that there has been considerable negotiation between the government and the opposition on this matter in the House. There has been delay on the part of the government in taking action on this matter—a matter of great importance to Australians. The Australian Greens share the opposition's frustration in this regard. However, we believe it is important to have an effective scheme in place which is properly established and responsibly funded.


The main point of disagreement between the coalition and the government appears to be that the government has made a policy decision to not make retrospective payments, but the coalition has not made such a commitment. Senator Brandis's bill does not specify that the proposed framework applies to particular events, and neither does it specifically state whether or not it applies retrospectively. It provides that the minister must make guidelines which include the eligibility criteria for providing assistance of up to $75,000. Payments are made only if the requirements in the guidelines have been met. However, Senator Brandis has not ruled out the possibility that previous events which have been the subject of government assistance to victims may be included, whereas I understand that the government does not intend to declare events pre-dating passage of the legislation as being eligible for financial assistance.


Retrospective application of the scheme would effectively duplicate assistance and support previously provided to those victims. As mentioned earlier, the Australian government has expended more than $12 million on assistance and support for individuals and families affected in terrorist acts since September 2001. In addition, the September 11th victim compensation fund provided generous financial assistance to those injured and the next of kin of those who were killed in the 9/11 attacks, including Australians. Payments of between $250,000 and $7.1 million were made to the next of kin of six Australians killed in those attacks.


The Australian Greens are concerned that retrospective application of the scheme would have significant impacts on the cost of the scheme. If applied prospectively, the estimated cost of Senator Brandis's bill is approximately $2.25 million per annum. This is based on the fact that approximately 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism overseas in the past 10 years, which works out to be an average of 30 victims per year. The figure of $2.25 million per annum assumes a payment of the full amount of $75,000 to each Australian harmed and to the next of kin of each Australian killed in an overseas terrorist incident, applied prospectively. However, if applied retrospectively the estimated cost of Senator Brandis's bill is approximately $24 million. This is an estimate by the government based on the number of Australians killed in terrorist events since 11 September 2001.


There are questions about how the bill will be funded. The bill proposes that payments would be funded from the contingency reserve, which is designed to reflect any unexpected events that cannot be assigned to individual programs. The Australian Greens do not believe that this is a satisfactory funding mechanism for such an important scheme and call on the opposition to indicate how they intend to pay for this scheme in a fiscally responsible manner into the future. Compensation for victims of terrorist attacks is an extremely important matter for Australians and there is clearly cross-party support for the principle. Because of its importance, the mechanism for administering and funding this compensation must be addressed both effectively and responsibly.


The Australian Greens do not believe Senator Brandis's bill provides a complete framework for the administration of these payments or an adequate funding mechanism for the scheme. We believe that these matters require, and would certainly benefit from, further examination by a Senate committee.


Accordingly, I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


      and the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2012.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:56):  I rise to support this legislation and to note with some regret that senators in other parts of the chamber have seen fit to express support for this principle, describing it, in the words of Senator Wright, as a tri-partisan commitment towards acknowledging the pain and suffering of those who are victims of international terrorism yet cannot bring themselves to actively support this legislation, which has been carefully thought through and presents the framework for provision of assistance to people who are victims of terrorism. It will contain details of operation, as determined by regulation, and therefore, appropriately, does not specify details of the way in which grants should be approved. That is appropriately left to an administrative process below the legislation itself. Despite the relatively easy decision that the Senate could make today to support the framework for provision of assistance to victims of international terrorism, it appears that is not going to happen.


The fact is that assistance to people who have been victims of terrorism is a fairly serious gap in our victim support arrangements in this country. For some time, states and territories have had victims-of-crime schemes which have assisted people in a whole range of settings, including, at least historically, for quite minor crimes, and yet people who have been unfortunate enough to be Australians overseas who have experienced the effect of one of the most heinous and scarring of crimes—that is, a deliberate terrorist act—have not, until now, had available to them some form of financial assistance. That clearly has to change. Despite the discussion on the government's part of the need to do this, it is the case that it is the coalition which has brought forward legislation to respond to that need. It is not unfair to describe the government's own legislation as a reaction to that move rather than a parallel exercise that happened to have been engaged in before the coalition took this issue on.


Clearly, in administering a framework for this legislation, there needs to be consultation about how it will work. The Attorney-General would be required to consult regularly with representatives of victims and their families, other professionals working in the field, international humanitarian agencies and relevant bodies to ensure that the scheme was effective and met the needs of victims. Individual payments are capped at $75,000, which is pretty much in line with the schemes operating in the states and territories.


The concept is hard to argue with and I do not think I heard any particular argument by other senators with the concept and the structure of this legislation. I did hear some other comments which I think can be fairly rebutted. Senator Singh described the coalition's position as 'grandstanding' and 'showboating', but the truth is that this is legislation which is timely, important and relevant. I suspect that, if the government brings forward its own legislation, it will not look very different to what the opposition has already put forward. So why one could be described as showboating and the other described as comprehensive and genuine is a little hard to understand.


Senator Wright suggested in her remarks that there was a problem with the question of retrospectivity. She accepted a government estimate of what extra costs would be associated with a scheme which was retrospective if it ensured that people could claim again for compensation under this scheme on top of what they had already been able to obtain by virtue of ex gratia payments made previously by the Australian government. With great respect, it is fairly obvious that the scheme as administered under the guidelines or framework that the Attorney-General needs to formulate would provide that a person not be able to double dip in those circumstances. It is not necessary for the legislation to say that. It is necessary for the regulations to say it—I accept that—but nobody on this side of the house would seriously suggest that people should be able to claim twice for the same injury under a similar act of generosity.


It takes me somewhat by surprise to hear the Australian Greens bring forward concerns relating to the cost of a scheme like this. Even if we were to pretend for a moment that the scheme would cost as much as has been suggested—and I think it clearly will not—when the Greens ask, 'How can this scheme be funded?' it is a somewhat strange question to hear on their lips. They are the party who have promised a high-speed rail system up and down the entire east coast of Australia, have promised to index Public Service pensions by the same indexation method used for old age pensioners and have promised a light rail system around the whole of Canberra. Those three promises alone would set the Australian taxpayer back at least $10 billion. So why we find the Greens quibbling over maybe $5 million to $10 million in the out years is very hard to understand. If the Greens were consistent about their concern about sourcing funds for important initiatives, I would be more prepared to take them seriously, but they appear only to be looking gift horses in the mouth when they come from other parts of the chamber.


It is important that, as a parliament, we indicate the greatest of solidarity with those people who are victims of international terrorism. They are not just any victim of crime. Although it is obviously odious to make comparisons between the effect of crimes on people, these are not, in a sense, ordinary victims of crime. They are victims of a crime which is a great scourge around the world and a form of crime which has, unfortunately, affected Australians. Although not particularly within Australia's borders it certainly has affected Australians. It is very important that the Australian community indicates that it will help and support those people who are victims of those crimes because these people, in a sense, are representative of a society which terrorists target because of the nature of that society. Terrorists, particularly the Islamist terrorists that have been the source of terrorist acts against Australians in Bali and elsewhere, target Westerners—Australians—because of the kind of society that we are. They regard our society as being decadent and godless and a society that needs to be punished for being the kind of society that it is. So those who are victims of that kind of criminal act are victims, in a sense, as representatives of Australian society generally. It is important that we ensure that people who find themselves in that unfortunate position have every support to rebuild their lives, particularly where they have suffered serious injury as a result of an international terrorist act.


It is not possible to be dogmatic about how much the scheme will cost in any given year, because the scheme obviously is activated by international terrorism and, sadly, such acts are not easy to predict. In some years there may be very few acts; hopefully, it will not be the case that in other years there will be more, but we cannot discount that possibility.


I commend this legislation to the Senate. I ask members to put aside their feelings that somehow this legislation steals a march on other things that others may have been planning to do. If the legislation is conceptually worthwhile, if it does something that we all agree needs to be done, which is to compensate innocent victims of outrageous acts perpetrated for ideological or sectarian reasons—if we agree that all of that needs to happen—then we ought not to hesitate to take the step presented to the Senate today to support legislation that will make that happen. If we are concerned about imperfections, we should bring forward amendments to deal with those imperfections. If we are concerned about the politics of it, I suggest that that is not a good reason not to proceed with the legislation at this time. I, for one, believe that it has been far too long since the first such terrorist acts affected the lives of Australians and that we need to move to do something about that. This legislation does something about that and it deserves the support of every member of this place.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (10:08):  I rise to contribute to this debate on Senator Brandis's private senator's bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. Until the last few minutes I had intended to continue in the same vein as Senator Humphries because much of what he was saying is the absolute imperative we have as a government and as a legislature: to ensure that Australians travelling overseas who are the victims of a terrorism act can be guaranteed that they are going to be cared for by their government, regardless of its political persuasion.


Senator Wright made a very important point when she said that this is an important policy issue that has the support of all members of parliament. It is not something we should be playing politics with. Therefore, it is pretty frustrating that we have had this bill brought forward today for debate when last year, on 24 March, Mr McClelland, the Attorney-General at the time, introduced a much more compre­hensive bill and no-one was playing politics about that at the time. That bill was developed in consultation and with lots of negotiation with the opposition, with Mr Abbott's office, with the shadow Attorney-General and with those people who were very concerned after the introduction of Mr Abbott's bill in 2009. It was tabled and nothing further was done with it and then it was tabled again in 2010, that time with an explanatory memorandum so people could understand the intent. From that point on there have been very significant negotiations to try to clarify issues and to seek important advice not just from the Attorney-General but from the people Senator Humphries mentioned today—the people who are part of this and are mentioned in Senator Brandis's bill. In the outline to the bill Senator Brandis says:


In administering the framework, the Attorney-General must regularly consult with representatives of victims and their families, community or welfare organisations, health professionals, international humanitarian agencies and any other relevant bodies.


And in his contribution this morning Senator Brandis pointed to the victims-of-crimes legislation in our state and territory jurisdictions as being the model on which his bill has been developed. But there is a problem here. The problem we have is that this Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012 is an isolated bill, standing within the framework of the Attorney-General and giving a lot of responsibility to the minister of the day in determining the framework, the eligibility criteria, the payment system, the administration and the development of guidelines, which are not here yet and no-one can guess what they are. So this bill sits outside other pieces of work that the government is involved in.


Senator Humphries was, I think, part of a recent Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the treatment of Australians kidnapped overseas and the way in which they can be supported. Out of the experiences we have had of Australians kidnapped overseas there have been very serious, comprehensive and wise processes and guidelines put in place through our consular agencies to strengthen the capacity of our consular assistance to help victims and their families. And the model that came out of the investigation of the Brennan case has actually brought forward for the government's consideration, with the support of the opposition, a range of strategies and assistance measures that are all being rolled out and put in place now. Those measures are also consistent with the social security bill which is currently in the House of Representatives.


At the time of the introduction of the bill by Mr Abbott in the House of Representatives, the government was beginning the discussion around the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Again, there are parallels with the complementary considerations to be brought into play in the way in which victims of overseas terrorist acts and their families will be treated when they are repatriated to Australia and the way in which their families are going to be supported through the trauma that is part of dealing with such awful incidents. So that is another part of the whole-of-government approach that we are trying to take to these issues. Again, Senator Brandis makes no mention of this. I have to say that his bill is disturbingly light on details and it does leave many crucial and critical questions unanswered.


We do not want to play politics with this issue; it is far too important. What we want to do is ensure that the way in which we provide support and the mechanism of support for Australian citizens who are victims of overseas terrorist acts are consistent with the ways the international community is trying to deal with them, because there has been an internationalis­ation of terrorism and we are part of the international community that is trying to deal with it. Through the lessons that we are learning and the way in which we are trying to craft a support package and a support network for people who are in this extraordinary situation, we are trying to be consistent with what is happening in other countries. 


I would like to go to that for a moment, if I may, because you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, how interested I am in the way in which victims of terrorist acts are supported in Northern Ireland. That is a very good model for the way in which we are trying to prepare our own support. There are international best practice models: Israel, the United States and Northern Ireland. Israel pays compensation to victims of terrorist acts and it is financed through a national insurance scheme. This may well be part of one of the considerations in the framework of our national disability insurance scheme. We have yet to come to that kind of conclusion, but it does go to the issue of policy coherence. 


Northern Ireland has a criminal injuries tariff compensation scheme, which was established in 2009, and that applies to all incidents occurring on or after 1 April 2009. That is dealing with the issue of retrospectivity and it is an issue that we too need to think about in Australia. To qualify for a payment in Northern Ireland, the person must be a victim of a crime of violence, and that can include arson or an act of poisoning. We do not even have a definition of a terrorist act in Senator Brandis's bill. We do not have that defined clearly enough, but in Northern Ireland they have actually said it goes beyond bombing and it goes beyond kidnapping. It can go to arson, and many fires have been set in Northern Ireland that have resulted in terrible tragedies. Poisoning is another interesting conversation we could be having about terrorism. Those people who are victims of some crime of violence are covered by the scheme. They need to be physically and/or mentally injured as a result and to have been in Northern Ireland at the time that the injury was sustained. That again is a very different model to the one we are discussing, because we are talking about Australian citizens in international circumstances where we do not have sovereignty. So we have to make sure that we are consistent with the international models and also that we are able to do the very best we can for Australian citizens in that situation. In Northern Ireland the compensation can include a prescribed lump sum payment for personal injury based on the scheme's schedule of mains amounts, and that aligns with workers compensation schemes here in Australia. Values are put on the level of physical injury that may have occurred. 


Such is the complexity of putting together a proposition so as to assist victims of overseas terrorist activities. That is why we as a government have not presented this argument and this package of support through an Attorney-General's bill but rather as an amendment to the Social Security Act. That is the way in which we want to consider supporting victims and their families through something that will be horrific, lifelong, terrifying and an enduring, debilitating experience for them. How long people can access assistance is a very significant issue for us to consider and it is being considered in the framework of the government's bill. I wondered whether Senator Humphries was aware that the bill had been introduced in the House of Representatives because he did seem to think that no matter who was putting this issue forward it was worthy of consideration. 


I do not want to play the politics of this because the situation is so important. The government's bill, introduced in March 2011, has been the subject of significant negotia­tion around the detail. It is quite specific and very comprehensive. The explanatory memorandum is very comprehensive. The Bills Digest, which is available from the Parliamentary Library, is quite detailed and raises some issues too. Concerns raised by the community and our colleagues in the parliament are being taken into account by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Human Services. It is very difficult to stand here and say, 'Well, we are not going to support this bill.' Some would like to present it to the Australian community as meaning that the government was not going to be supporting victims of overseas terrorism. That would be an awful message because it is simply untrue.


We are acutely aware that the system is a little ad hoc, discretionary and challenging. The system needs to take into account the higher level of alertness that we have to terrorist activities around the world, the ways in which they may happen and where they may happen. Australians are avid travellers with the opportunity and the incentive to get out and see the world. Australian citizens caught up in terrorist activity may well be in countries where we do not have strong international support or with which we do not have bilateral relations. We are not thinking only of people who are killed in overseas terrorist incidents. In Bali in 2002, for example, there were 182 Australians injured, as well as the 88 who lost their lives. So this is not just a scheme that requires consideration of repatriation of the bodies of loved ones; it is also a scheme that needs to take into account the maiming and injury of Australian citizens and the way in which we are going to care for them, sometimes lifelong.


In Bali, 182 were injured and 88 were killed. For September 11, we do not actually have a clear figure of how many Australians were injured, but of course we do know that we had 10 Australians killed. In 2003, we had someone injured in an incident in Riyadh. We also had someone injured in Istanbul. In Saudi Arabia, we had an Australian national killed. In Bali, in 2005, there were 17 Australians injured and four more killed. In London, we had 10 Australian nationals injured and one killed. In Egypt, two more were injured and in Mumbai, India, in 2008, we had four. So you can see that around the world, as we see an increase in terrorist activity, the way in which we have to deal with victims of these kinds of incidents is actually going to become more complex. That is why as a government we are saying, 'Let's take a more holistic approach. Let's find the way through.'


If you go to the detail of Senator Brandis's bill, it is quite clear. It looks at a compensation level of up to $75,000. That is consistent with the government's position. Senator Brandis's bill does not actually make the point about whether they are primary or secondary victims, which the government's bill does. The government's bill acknow­ledges that there are secondary victims. They may be the families that are having to deal with a family member who has been severely injured or, of course, who has lost their life. So the idea that we can simplistically think about what is a very complex, distressing tragedy of Australians killed or injured overseas as a result of terrorism really does not do justice to those people who are in that unfortunate situation and it certainly does not do justice to Australians in giving them confidence when they travelling overseas.


Let us think very clearly about what is going to happen. The bill does not specify the proposed framework that applies to particular events. Neither does it specifically state whether or not the issue of retrospect­ivity is being considered. Previously, former minister Ellison, commenting on that 2009 bill, said that no, retrospectivity was not being considered because there had been significant compensation to the Bail bombing victims at the time. He made a general statement—not in the parliament but in commentary—about that. That is not clear in what Senator Brandis is proposing today. Senator Humphries also said that we would not expect that people would be duplicating the financial assistance already paid to Australian victims. Senator Brandis's bill does not go to the issue of travel insurance or where that might fit in the scheme of things. It certainly does not go to workers compensation, income insurance or those kinds of arrangements that people put in place now when they are travelling. So it is pretty short-sighted and pretty thin on the detail.


We know that terrorism is a type of war in which the enemy—the terrorist organis­ation—selects random victims as its target, and we, as global travellers, are significant targets. As Senator Brandis said in his introductory comments today, we are the enemy. People abhor our lifestyle. They believe that we are really undermining civilisation as they know it and they want to target us. So we need to be sure that what we put in place for Australians travelling overseas is consistent and that there is policy coherence across all of the government's work. That is critically important. We want to make sure that whoever is caught as a victim of terrorism in the future is provided support in the long term.


We are going to be working very closely to bring on the social security amendment bill; the Attorney-General is working to do that very soon. Can I say in closing that Senator Wright is right: there are issues that still need to be considered, and we would certainly be supporting the Greens amendment to refer this bill to a Senate committee for inquiry.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I rise to address the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, and I want to acknowledge the contribution of senators from both sides of the Senate and the crossbenches who recognise the importance of this issue and the responsibility we as legislators have to the people of Australia. The bill proposes the establishment of a framework to facilitate financial assistance for Australians killed or injured—or their next of kin—as a result of international terrorist acts. The explanatory memorandum goes through a number of the details of the bill in terms of the quantum of the funds, the $75,000 which is in line with state and territory victims-of-crime regimes as well as the sorts of people who are stakeholders that would be engaged in both the establishment and ongoing management of the scheme.


The question, though, that the public may well ask is: why? Why should the government put in place a scheme to financially support Australians who have been targeted by terrorism overseas? As mentioned about the state and territory victims-of-crime legislation, there is a strong precedent in this nation of caring for individuals who have been affected by incidents that are no fault of their own. Victims-of-crime legislation is one example. Compulsory third-party insurance is another example whereby we put in place mechanisms to make sure that people who are injured have the opportunity to have care provided for them. A parallel process, which is in discussion at the moment, is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, where we recognise the ongoing burden and crises that many family face due to circumstances imposed upon them that are beyond their control. It is also worth recognising that opportunities for individuals to take measures to protect themselves against such things as terrorism have been reduced since 9-11. The insurance industry, for example, now routinely places exclusions for terrorist acts on all kinds of insurance, whether it be home and contents insurance, commercial insurance or, particularly, travel insurance. That means that, even if people wish to insure against such things to make sure they can provide for themselves, insurance companies include exclusions which prevent that. The government has taken some steps in terms of commercial insurance onshore to give business some confidence, but that does not extend to what we are talking about here with people overseas. There are precedents in countries such as Israel, the UK—Northern Ireland in particular—and the United States. Those jurisdictions have well-established systems of compensating people who have been the victims of terrorism, so there is strong precedent. It is interesting to note that all of those precedents are in countries that place a high value on the individual. That is one of the reasons we need to look at this issue, because it is a matter of principle that we support people.


Why are Australians being targeted overseas? I use the word 'targeted' quite deliberately, because terrorist acts are not purely random. The incidents are occurring, by and large, in locations which suggest targeting of liberal Western democracies, whether it be in the UK, the United States or places where people such as Australians go. We are all very familiar with the Bali bombings, where Australians were targeted, the London bombings and 9-11. DFAT has quite clearly identified in their paper Transnational terrorism: the threat to Australia that Australia is a terrorist target both as a Western nation and also in its own right. The paper explains that the transnational extreme Muslim terrorists see that:


Weakening the influence of the West would advance their political goals by helping undermine those Muslims they view as corrupt and open to Western influence. We are seen as standing in the way of their goal to transform the Muslim world into a Taliban-style society. According to their simplistic worldview, we are part of the Christian West which, to them, is un-Islamic and therefore illegitimate.


The core values we hold and which are intrinsic to our success as a liberal democratic culture are anathema to these extremists. For them, our beliefs in democratic process, racial and gender equality, religious tolerance and equality of opportunity are mere human inventions at odds with God’s law. These values impede their political goals.


We have seen, recently, decisions taken, and endorsed by people like President Karzai, about the respective value of women compared to men and we have seen the oppression of minorities in countries such as Iran. This Senate has passed resolutions condemning the treatment of minorities in many countries. Different world views place different values on people. In Australia we value individuals, we value men and women equally and we uphold the principle of freedom. That makes us a target. That also means we should look out for those people who have been damaged or hurt in what various members in this place have described as a war against our world view and our way of life.


The coalition has long been a supporter of that principle. Going back to 2009, on 16 November, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, tabled the Assisting the Victims of International Terrorism Bill. In 2010 Senator Brandis tabled the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill. On 21 February 2011, Mr Abbott again tabled a bill in the other place. This current bill is the latest in a succession of attempts by the coalition to uphold this principle. 


The other reason we should be considering this bill is practice. At the moment, because our nation does value individuals, we have provided strong support to people who have been victims. As has been mentioned by various speakers in this debate, that support is somewhat fragmented, somewhat unpredictable and relies largely on a number of small grants and programs bringing together existing streams from departments such as Centrelink and on specific ex gratia payments, which can vary quite significantly. So for the interests of consistency it is appropriate that this Senate and this parliament look to provide a framework which provides some certainty as to the payments that would be made.


I support the comments made that this is not just a one-off for a short-term issue. Whether we are talking about Australians who are injured as uniformed soldiers in a war or whether we are talking about Australians who are injured through acts of terrorism, the actual act and the immediate aftermath, which so often creates a lot of public goodwill and interest, can be a life-changing, long-term devastating incident for those families. So, as a nation, we need to consider not only how we respond to the short term and the immediate but how we respond to those people and support them through a very long journey of recovery. I believe that is an area we will need to continue to discuss and debate in this place so that we can have a viable, affordable method of supporting those fellow Australians who, through no fault of their own, now face a very difficult life because of injuries that have been received, whether in the service of this nation or through being innocent Australians abroad who have been caught up, whether in London, the United States or wherever. We had artists in New York looking to exhibit their works, we had tourists and people working in London and we had people holidaying in Bali. These are all things that we would expect any person to have the right to go and do. When not only are there people killed—with that impact on their family—but there are a large number of people injured, that is an ongoing issue. We, as a nation, need to have a system in place to care for them.


Whether because of the precedent, because of the principal or because of the problems with current practice, we do need a better framework. It has been a long-held principle of the coalition—from November 2009 to 2010 to 2011 to now—to try and bring before this parliament legislation to get a better framework, and for that reason I support the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (10:38):  Let me begin my contribution to this debate by joining all those other senators in this second reading debate who have acknowledged the threat of terrorism to Australian citizens at home and abroad.


This is, in my view, a most worthy matter for the consideration of this Senate because we do face the very stark reality that Australians have been deliberately targeted by terrorist groups overseas. The global reach, ambition and unpredictable nature of international terrorist groups have made Australians travelling overseas vulnerable in all corners of the globe. We know that Australians are not immune from terrorist attacks overseas.


I am going to do something that is very unusual, Madam Acting Deputy President, but there appears to be a problem with the clock here. I think it would be a terrible thing for the Senate if my speech were stuck on nine minutes and 52 seconds for the remainder of this sitting day! I do not know how Hansard is going to record that, but nevertheless we move on.


I was making the critically important point that experience does show us that Australians are not immune from terrorist attacks overseas. Since 11 September 2001 more than 200 Australians have been injured and more than 100 killed in overseas terrorist incidents. This includes the 88 Australians who lost their lives in Bali in 2002. Terrorism knows no boundaries. Australians have been affected by terrorist attacks in New York, London, Jakarta, Mumbai and Istanbul.


The Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003 defines a terrorist act as an action or threat of action where the action causes certain defined forms of harm or interference, and:


… the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; …


Past Australian governments, both Labor and coalition, have assisted Australian victims of terrorist incidents overseas on a case-by-case basis, providing them with medical and evacuation support, consular assistance and assistance with funeral costs and other expenses on an ex gratia payment basis. The Australian government has also provided assistance to Australians affected by terrorist attacks overseas through a range of other mechanisms, such as healthcare assistance schemes and the Australian government disaster recovery payments. These schemes have provided healthcare assistance not only to Australians adversely affected by offshore terrorist attacks but also to those who have been affected by other events, such as natural disasters.


I think that in a debate like this it is important to recognise that to date there has been no comprehensive scheme that covers Australian victims of terrorism occurring overseas. I also recognise the importance of ensuring that assistance and support provided to Australians affected by terrorism overseas is appropriate and is adequate.


The parliament faces a choice now between, effectively, two approaches to deal with the victims of overseas terrorism. In my view, both are well motivated, both are well intentioned and both address inadequacies in the way we have assisted Australians affected by overseas acts of terrorism in the past. So I know that on all sides of the Australian parliament there is recognition that more comprehensive, more specific and better measures are required to ensure that the vital assistance that is required is extended to Australians that fall victim to terrorist attack outside our borders.


In the government's case, it has introduced the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. In the case of the opposition, Senator Brandis on behalf of the opposition has introduced this bill, a private senator's bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. The government bill, currently in the House of Representatives, provides for financial assistance of up to $75,000 for those injured or harmed or the next of kin of those killed by an act of terrorism overseas. The new scheme proposed by the government does not apply to victims of past incidents because, obviously, previous governments have already made determinations about the assistance and support offered for those victims of earlier terrorist incidents overseas and there is, of course, the issue that might arise of retrospective payments effectively duplicating what might already have done.




Senator Xenophon:
  The regulations are to fix that.




Senator FAULKNER:
  A very good interjection, as sometimes there is from Senator Xenophon. He talks about the possibility that subordinate legislation might deal with this matter, and of course that is true. I hope that Senator Xenophon would agree with me that the best way forward here is for the government, the opposition, minor parties and Independents in the parliament to work collaboratively on this issue. I hope Senator Xenophon would agree with this.


Of course the government will support its own bill, but I would argue that there should be collaboration across the chamber, where I believe there is a high degree of unanimity—total unanimity—about the importance of dealing with this matter and members and senators are of one mind about the high priority this is. There is every opportunity that a collaborative approach will ensure that the parliament and, of course, more importantly the victims of terrorism will achieve the best outcome. I note that Senator Wright, on behalf of the Australian Greens, has proposed that this bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2012. I do think that such an approach might be a very useful step in achieving that best outcome that I have spoken about.


So I do acknowledge the support and concern around the chamber, across all parties, for our fellow Australians who have fallen victim to terrorist attacks overseas and the importance of us ensuring that we have in place the best possible legislative framework to support victims of terrorist attacks overseas into the future. It is not surprising that the government considers that the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 is the best way of ensuring that victims of terrorism and their families are provided with the support that they need from the federal government, but I acknowledge again the fact that all parliamentarians are well motivated in this regard.


The threat to Australian citizens from terrorism overseas is real. The need for this parliament and the Australian government to deal with this issue is also real. I have welcomed the opportunity of speaking in this important second reading debate, and I commend to the Senate the approach that I have outlined as a sensible way of moving forward to achieving the shared outcomes that have been spoken about by all senators participating in this debate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:53):  It is often a pleasure to follow Senator Faulkner in debates in this place and it is no less so on this occasion. As Senator Faulkner said in his concluding remarks, the threat of terrorism against Australians is real and the need to deal appropriately with all aspects of that threat is equally real. The legislation before us, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, seeks to deal with one aspect of the issues related to terrorism against Australians—just one aspect, but one very important aspect, and that is the support, assistance and recognition that is provided to Australian victims of terrorism in an international context.


As many of the contributors to this debate have highlighted, over the last decade in particular we have seen, and been reminded all too often of, how real that threat to Australians actually is. We have seen some 300 Australians suffer, as we know, as a result of terrorist incidents. We have lost the lives of Australians in incidents such as, of course, in the terrible attacks of 11 September 2001 on the World Trade Centre; in Bali, on two separate occasions; in London and in Jakarta. Senator Stephens in her contribution listed many other parts of the world in which Australians have been injured and have suffered because of acts of international terrorism. Where Australians have died, overwhelmingly those attacks have been because of and targeted at the way of life that we in Australia have. Those Australians and others of Western nations have been targeted because fundamentalists want to wage a war against our way of life—the democratic freedoms that Australians and our allies in Western countries and others around the world espouse; those democratic principles and principles of freedom that we believe are so very important.


I am pleased that, in general, there is agreement throughout the chamber on the importance of what this bill seeks to do. This bill seeks essentially to provide assistance and support to Australian victims of terrorism analogous to the type of support provided to victims of crime in the Australian community. To put it in simple terms, if an Australian suffers hurt, injury or death as a result of a criminally related incident within Australia, there are schemes at the state level that provide a modest sum to the victim or the family of the victim in recognition of the pain they have gone through. In a sense it is a sign that the community wants to recognise the pain that they have gone through and to help them through those difficult circumstances. This legislation simply seeks to ensure that a similar scheme is in place for Australians who face and suffer similar pain offshore as a result of the types of terrorist incidents that I have mentioned. So I think this is a very important step forward.


The legislation puts in place provisions that ensure it is comparable to the state schemes I have highlighted. Payments are capped at $75,000, a modest sum—because this is not about compensation in a legal sense as it may be applied through the courts; this is about recognition and assistance—but a sum that, nonetheless, will be very helpful to people as they recover from injuries or from the loss of a loved one.


Senator Faulkner, Senator Stephens and others have highlighted that there is a not-dissimilar government proposal before the parliament: the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. I welcome that piece of legislation. I look forward to seeing the parliament deal with this issue, whether through Senator Brandis's legislation or the government's legislation, in a sensible way that actually gets an outcome. I think that is an important thing for us to aspire to. It is for that reason that the coalition is happy to cooperate with and accept the Greens' amendment that there be a Senate inquiry into this bill, because we accept that there is an appropriate place for looking at the operation of the bill, to make sure that all the issues are considered. But, hopefully, as a result of that, we will then see the swift passage of at least one of these bills. For a long period of time now, people have been talking about and seeking to achieve the type of action, the type of assistance, that this legislation will deliver. I do hope that, as a result of that inquiry, we will see either the relevant amendments to satisfy the concerns of all contributors to this debate that will see this bill pass or the swift passage of the government's bill. But let us see some action. Let us see an outcome on this. Let us not see any more delays on this matter.


Responding to terrorism is not just related to the types of support and assistance that governments provide to victims. The support provided to victims has been well canvassed in this debate, including the types of support this bill seeks to apply and the practical assistance that governments of both persuasions have provided and, I have no doubt, will continue to provide to Australians who find themselves in trouble overseas. But the response to terrorism also involves trying to prevent it in the future and trying to hunt down, where necessary, the sources of the terrorism. 


I compliment the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, for the way in which he addressed some of those issues in question time yesterday. Senator Bob Carr was asked about our role in Afghanistan. Australia entered Afghanistan under United Nations mandate to try to respond in particular to the attacks of September 11, to respond to the Taliban's involvement in and support of al-Qaeda and to try to ensure that we do not again see a state sanctioning, assisting or supporting the type of terrorist incident that occurred on September 11, 2001.


I can understand why, in the decade that has passed, many people now ask what we are still doing in Afghanistan and why we are there. Of course, 32 fine, young Australian servicemen have paid the ultimate price for our engagement in Afghanistan, and we have honoured and recognised each of those sacrifices in this place, as we should, and we should never forget what they have given. However, as Senator Bob Carr indicated yesterday, we are there for good reason. We are there because we sought to—and we seek to—deny the likes of al-Qaeda safe haven, a place from which to base their operations. In a country like Afghanistan, we also seek to leave the country in a better place, to ensure that, hopefully, the people of Afghanistan enjoy a better lifestyle under the government in the circumstances in which we leave the country than they did before the forces of Australia and other countries took the action that has been taken.


I compliment Senator Carr because I thought the fact that he highlighted at least one of the positive achievements that have occurred in Afghanistan, in response to questions on the matter yesterday, was very important. We do not hear those positive indicators often enough in this debate. For those who may have missed it, I again highlight the educational outcomes that he indicated are occurring. In 2001, there were just one million young Afghanis enrolled in their school system, virtually none of them young women. Today, there are over seven million young Afghanis receiving an education, with around 2.5 million young women. That is a fine accomplishment. It is through a sound education system for those millions of additional young Afghanis that we will see an Afghanistan that in the future is better able to have a successful economy, to engage sensibly in world affairs and to enjoy the types of advancements and opportunities that we hope to see in place for all Australians around the world.


In this place, and particularly throughout the Australian community, we need to do more and to say more to highlight the accomplishments that have occurred in Afghanistan. It is all too often too easy to dwell on the negatives and on the tragedies. Yes, there have been tragedies—there was a terrible tragedy this week—and we should acknowledge those and should mourn those deaths and those occasions where things have gone wrong; but, equally, we should highlight the accomplishments and the fact that the 32 young Australian troops, and the many more from other countries, who have fought and died in Afghanistan have not done so in vain and have done so to protect Australians and others from international acts of terrorism and, in doing so, have provided a better life for millions of Afghanis.


Because I may not have a chance to do so elsewhere in this debate, I highlight another instance of inhumane activity that is occurring in the world at present and some action that will take place today. Today, during question time, senators will be asked to sign a letter to the ambassadors of Russia and China that will circulate around the chamber. This letter relates to what is happening in Syria—another instance of oppression happening in the world at present and another instance about which many have grave concerns for the human rights violations occurring and for the acts occurring that replicate, in some ways, the types of terrorist incidents that we have talked about on occasions in this debate. Today is the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the uprising against the Syrian government. It is estimated that in this past year between 6,500 and 7,500 innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict in Syria. Tens of thousands have been injured or arrested, and around 18,000 people are thought to be facing arbitrary detention without the right to a fair trial. The letter that will be circulated in this chamber by Senator Moore and me and in the other place by Mr Ruddock and Mr Laurie Ferguson highlights:


The grim catalogue of torture and other ill treatment that has emerged from Syria's detention centres in a year of unrest against President Bashar al-Assad's government.


The letter calls on the United Nations Security Council to refer President al-Assad to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, to freeze the assets of the president and others involved in the regime in Syria and to impose an arms embargo. These are actions that the UN Security Council should have undertaken but sadly has not because member states, particularly Russia and China—to whom this letter is directed—have resisted this type of action through the UN Security Council. It calls on the ambassadors of Russia and China to urge their countries to use their influence over Syria and their influence at the UN Security Council to end this type of abuse. I hope that in some small way today's gesture by parliamentarians of all stripes will apply a little extra pressure for some outcome in that regard and, in doing so, will ultimately lead to a better outcome for those who are victims of terrible acts in Syria.


I return to the legislation before us, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. This legislation has a great capacity, and is an opportunity, to provide some assistance to Australian victims of terrorism. In closing, I urge the Senate to ensure that, after the inquiry into this legislation is complete, this matter is dealt with and dealt with swiftly. Whether through this bill or the government's bill, we should at least see put in place by the federal government a positive outcome and the support that is deserved and warranted by Australian victims of terrorism. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-03-15,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:10):  I will not take much of the Senate's time because much of what I wanted to say has been said by my colleagues on both sides of the debate. It is clear that there is an unambiguous need to give greater support to victims of terrorism. It is clear that the current mechanisms in force are inadequate. It is clear that having ex gratia payments is not an adequate way of dealing with such matters. Current mechanisms are too ad hoc and not part of an overall scheme which provides consistency and reliability.


The issue is how we best advance this. I agree with Senator Faulkner that we need to have a collaborative approach. However, I believe that this bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, does have merit. It is not fair to characterise this bill as a piece of grandstanding, as some have. It is important that this bill be debated. It is an issue that needs to be sorted out. This bill has a number of features that are superior to the government's bill, particularly in relation to retrospectivity. Senator Faulkner made a very good point about that, suggesting, as I believe he did, that it could lead to an anomalous outcome in the event that a victim of terrorism has already received a measure of compensation. That could easily be fixed by the regulatory framework, the subordinate legislation proposed and anticipated in this legislation.


It is important that we consider the cost of this scheme. My South Australian colleague Senator Wright indicated some concern about the costs involved and the cost implications. This is not a criticism of Senator Wright, but an upside estimate of the cost of paying former victims of terrorism—to ensure that this bill is retrospective—is of the order of $20 million. If as a nation we can find $16 billion for 100 Joint Strike Fighters and $10 billion for a clean energy fund then I think we can find $20-odd million to compensate victims of terrorist acts. Senator Humphries was correct when he said we do not know how much this scheme will cost because of the very nature of the scheme. I hope that this scheme does not cost anything in the sense that I hope Australians are not subjected to acts of terrorism and people are not injured or killed by such acts, with the devastation and the heartache they cause. We do not know how much this scheme will cost, and I hope it is not much at all—if so, the world is a safer place.


We need to get on with this. Senator Faulkner's comments about a collaborative approach are very worthwhile. We should get the interested parties together in a room and thrash this out, because if we are seen by the Australian people to be bickering about the fundamental issue of some measure of justice for victims of terrorism then that reflects badly on all of us. I think there is enough goodwill in this place and in the other place to sort this out.


I finish by referring to a person I have enormous regard for and with whom I have discussed this issue on previous occasions. I hope to be in a position to catch up with him in the not-too-distant future. The person is Brian Deegan, a former South Australian magistrate. I regard him as a friend and I believe he is an incredibly decent human being with enormous integrity. Brian lost his beloved son Joshua in the Bali bombings, on 12 October 2002. Joshua was on a postseason Indonesian holiday with his teammates from the Sturt Football Club, which had just won the South Australian National Football League premiership. Brian has written a book titled Remembering Josh: Bali, a father's story. It is a very powerful testimony to his experiences and the trauma that he and so many others went through. It took an enormous act of courage for him to do that and to take the stance he took subsequent to that.


But that is not the issue. The issue is that Brian Deegan, as a former magistrate and a practising lawyer, raised the importance of there being a scheme in place to assist victims of terrorist attacks. This bill is a significant step forward in relation to that, as is the government's bill. But for goodness sake, let us all get together, sort this out in a collaborative approach and fix this up once and for all—sooner rather than later. I think Australians demand that of us.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:15):  It is good to participate in a debate where everybody agrees with the sentiments of the bill before the parliament. I am certainly one who will be supporting this bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, and I encourage all other senators to do the same. As I have listened to the debate this morning, I have heard many people relate particularly moving experiences. I thank Senator Xenophon for the brief but very important contribution he just made and I have to say I agree with most of what Senator Xenophon said.


It is clear that the coalition, the Labor Party, the Greens and the crossbenchers think that there is an important point in proceeding with legislation that provides for compensation. As I listened to the debate, I kept asking myself: if everybody agrees, why is it that the bill is not going to be passed because the Labor Party and the Greens will not be supporting it? I say to the Labor Party and the Greens: please, if you have a better bill, bring it forward, let us debate it, let us look at it and, as appropriate, let us move amendments. But let us get on and do something about it. If this bill is passed today, as I hope it will be, then we will be starting the process.


From what other speakers have said—and I was unaware of this until I heard the debate today—this process has been going on for in excess of two years now. It seems to me that in that time we have passed a series of 18 bills that will impose the world's biggest carbon tax on Australians. That very complex series of 18 pieces of legislation was guillotined through this parliament. We are all absolutely confident that there will be elements of those 18 pieces of legislation that will be challenged in the court—in fact we hear on the news today that the whole carbon tax parcel of legislation is going to be challenged because of the alleged unconstitutionality of it. 


The point I am making is that the government was able to draft, prepare and ram through both chambers of parliament 18 pieces of complex legislation in next to no time. I say 'next to no time' because we know Ms Gillard promised at the last election that there would be no carbon tax, so the Public Service, the draughtsmen, would have put that out of their mind. As is the wont of this government in relation to taxation matters, promises mean nothing. But the point I am making is that those 18 pieces of legislation were able to be prepared, drafted and rammed through parliament in a matter of months. Yet in respect of this piece of relatively simple legislation—everyone here has said it is not terribly complex and does not involve a great deal of money—for some reason which I do not understand the government seems to be procrastinating in bringing forward what Labor speakers have said is an excellent piece of legislation that will fix everything. 


If that is the case, why isn't it before the chamber today? Why aren't we dealing with it? It is a very simple question and I hope that someone might be able to answer it. If someone were able to indicate to me that the Labor government is bringing forward a piece of legislation that has been properly consulted upon and has been discussed with the opposition and the crossbenchers in a nonpartisan way, even without seeing it I would feel fairly confident that I would be supporting that piece of legislation as well. But despite, or perhaps because of, the procrastination of this government on that front, we now have a bill to assist victims of overseas terrorism before the parliament today which can be voted upon and, hopefully, adopted. I am very pleased to support this bill so we actually do move forward.


As Senator Xenophon indicated, there seems to be concern on the government benches that retrospectivity may cost $20 million and we do not know what this is going to cost in the future. I agree absolutely with Senator Xenophon when he says that all of us would hope that this will cost absolutely nothing. That would mean that in the future there will be no victims of overseas terrorism. But, if there are, we as a compassionate nation and a wealthy nation should be making provision for those who are victims of that terrorism.


Senator Xenophon mentioned a figure of $20 million. When you consider that this government is borrowing $100 million each and every day, $20 million to spend retrospectively on victims of terrorism seems to be a mere drop in the ocean. To oppose or not vote for this bill on the basis that it might cost $20 million seems to me to be foolish and disingenuous in the extreme.


This bill proposes, as other speakers have said, to establish a scheme to compensate Australian victims of overseas terrorist attacks. It is proposed that the scheme be similar to those that have long operated in Australian states and territories. State victim of crime legislation was rightly implemented decades ago. There is nothing new, there are no surprises, in how this legislation operates in the states and how it is funded. It seems to me disingenuous that, if the states could do this in years gone by, this federal government cannot bring forward a bill that is universally accepted to deal with an issue which everybody in this chamber agrees upon. So I urge senators to support the bill.


If for some reason the Labor Party thinks that it has a better bill, bring it on. Let us have it before the chamber. Let us see if it does need amendment. Let us move and debate amendments. Let us look at costings that the Public Service may have been able to bring forward. But, please, let us get on with it. Do not wait another two years before this issue can be addressed by this federal parliament. If nothing else, hopefully this bill will have said to the government: 'Look, get on it; don't procrastinate. You have been able to do it with taxing bills. When you want to raise taxes, you get those things very quickly through the parliament.' We are dealing with some of the most complex pieces of legislation in the Senate this afternoon with the mining tax bills—more taxing bills that the Labor Party is very able to prepare, to draft, to fund and to get before this parliament in a relatively short period of time; yet this bill, which by comparison is simple and not complex, seems to have the Labor government stalling. 


While I am speaking on this bill relating to victims of terrorism, can I just digress ever so slightly with the concurrence of the Senate to acknowledge the men and women of the Australian defence forces who do such a lot in the fight against terrorism. All Australians know that we are in the war in Afghanistan because it is a war against terrorism that we must win. We know it has the universal support of all Australians. The sorts of things that happened in New York on September 11, in Bali and elsewhere are abhorrent to any decent human being in this world. That is why in the case of Afghanistan we have gone to war to try and address terrorism and the root causes of terrorism and those people who would conduct terrorist activities and create death and mayhem and the victims which this bill is all about. It is the men and women of our defence forces who are the frontline in this war on terrorism in Afghanistan.


Speaking as a Queenslander and an Australian as well—I do not want to be partisan about the states—I come from a place up in the north of Queensland at Townsville where we have Australia's largest Army base. Daily we see the very fine individuals who constitute Australia's Army and Air Force and irregularly the Navy as it calls into Townsville to pick up troops and to deliver goods to the Lavarack Army base in Townsville. Our troops—our soldiers—our sailors and our airmen are the best in the world. Their training is impeccable. It is rigorous. They know how to conduct their warlike operations but at the same time be careful, as you have to be these days, of civilians who are in the area of conflict. That is no easy task. Our men and women do a fantastic job. I think all Australians recognise that. The increasing numbers that turn out at military parades on Anzac Day, Kapyong Day and Armistice Day are a testament to the fact that all Australians are attending not only to commemorate the event but also to give support to the troops of today who always participate in those commemoration services. The troops do a mighty job.


You will excuse me for being a little parochial as a Queenslander, but we do have Australia's largest Army base at Lavarack. We have two of Australia's finest training areas in Shoalwater Bay near Rockhampton and at High Range behind Townsville and also the jungle training up near Innisfail and the old Canungra training ground. I do not think it exists any more, but they do train around that area. We have Enoggera in Queensland, another very substantial Army base. We have one of the most significant Air Force bases in Amberley and again in Townsville at Garbutt, air bases with very long history. I am always proud to mention a fact not many people understand and that is that Australia's second largest east coast naval base is situated in Cairns in Far North Queensland. I would certainly hope that in the not-too-distant future, as Sydney Harbour gets more crowded and other activities intervene which make it less appropriate to have Australia's biggest naval base in the centre of Sydney, the naval base at Cairns will be expanded to accommodate more of the vessels that of necessity must leave Garden Island.


In this debate on victims of terrorism I acknowledge the great work that our defence forces do in defending us against terrorism by their activities overseas. I note an incident quite recently where, thanks to the good work of the security services and the police, a proposed terrorist attack on an Army base was thwarted. It shows, as other speakers have mentioned in this debate, how targeted Australians are and, I have to say, how targeted our Australian servicepeople are because of their excellence in combating terrorism wherever it occurs. I know, in those words of commendation and congratulations I offer to the men and women of our defence forces, there would not be a senator in this parliament who would disagree. I would like those troops to know that we as legislators and as parliamentarians acknowledge, respect and understand the great work that they do.


To get back to this bill: I think it is important that, if people are the victims of overseas terrorism, they should be compensated. If Australians are victims of criminal acts in Australia, they will invariably receive some compensation, some monetary benefit, from the state or territory government. It is not a lavish amount; it is not a sum of money that will enable people to live in luxury for the rest of their lives. But it is an important acknowledgement from our community of the abhorrent and completely unjustified pain and suffering of the victims.


This bill proposes a federal scheme that will be similar to the ones in place currently in the states and territories of Australia. The amount involved, as I was just saying, is not a huge amount—$75,000 is proposed. Nothing will overcome the loss, hurt or damage to body and soul that terrorism can cause to people, but it is a token that will help people get on with their lives and help the families of victims to get on with their lives. I think it is a bill that is long overdue and urge the Senate to support it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (11:33):  I agree with the sentiments just expressed by Senator Macdonald. I think this, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, is a very important bill. It is very timely and it does address a very real problem in terms of compensating and helping to look after people who are the innocent victims of terrorism overseas. I commend the authors of this bill, who have recognised the importance of this issue and proposed to assist victims of overseas terrorism. Regrettably, in this day and age terrorism is much more prevalent around the world than it ever has been. We now live in the world of the urban terrorist who can plant bombs in parked cars and in rubbish bins, as we saw in Sydney many years ago when a bomb was placed in a garbage bin outside a hotel. In London there were the bombings on the buses and on the underground trains. There have been bombings in Spain and, of course, bombings closer to home in South-East Asia—in Bali, where we all recall the devastation which occurred following the bombings in 2003.


As it happens, that is the closest I have ever been to a terrorist incident. I was in Indonesia with a parliamentary delegation a week before the Bali bombings and visited Surabaya and East Java, nearby where, we later heard, the Bali bombings were in fact put together. So bombing from terrorism is not an issue that is unlikely to occur. There are terrorists in all parts of the world and, sadly, bombings and indiscriminate terrorist actions are now a factor which has to be considered when travelling.


This bill proposes the establishment of a framework to facilitate financial assistance for Australians—or their next of kin—killed or injured as a result of international terrorist acts. These may occur in hotels, in bars, in shopping centres, in trains, in buses and even in aircraft, as we know from the Lockerbie bombings, from the sad crash of that 747 and from the gentleman who was apprehended at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport with a bomb strapped to his underpants on Christmas Day a few years ago. That would have brought down an aircraft full of people. Acts of terrorism are now very common, very widespread and we all have to factor in the possibility of being a victim of terrorism when we travel overseas.


It is proposed that the framework of this bill will be administered by the Attorney-General's Department and that it will provide eligibility criteria for claimants of financial assistance. The financial assistance provided must be available to those who suffer or have suffered injury requiring hospitalisation as a result of an international terrorist act. In the event that such an act causes the death of a person, the assistance will be available to the person's next of kin. The proposal is that Australian victims of overseas acts of terrorism would each receive up to $75,000. The scheme is modelled on state and territory laws and schemes which provide compensation to victims of serious crime. It is proposed that the payment would be on a sliding scale, with more serious injuries receiving a higher payout—which is only right and proper. I heard some mention earlier in this debate that $75,000 as a maximum was not a great deal of money for somebody who has suffered a severe head injury, but it is at least a start and it would be very helpful, for example, to the widow of a victim who died from terrorist bombing in that it would enable a family to meet its financial commitments during the period of the immediate aftermath of such an incident.


I understand that over the past decade about 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism around the world, which is about 30 people a year. That is quite a significant number in the sense that it is indicative of the fact that overseas travel is no longer without risk. I think that 20 or 30 years ago we would not have taken into consideration the risk of terrorist action, but it is something we certainly need to do now. Using the average of 30 victims a year, the maximum payment of $75,000 would cost an estimated $2.25 million per annum, which is not a lot of money in terms of the federal government's budget. Of course, these payments would be only intermittent.


I think this is a very important and timely piece of legislation which does address a real need, and the people who have put this legislation together should be congratulated on seeing this need and addressing it. Having said that, however, I think it is very important that when people travel overseas they take as much trouble as they can to protect themselves and to provide cover for themselves should they be the victims of a terrorist act. Many people would know that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade these days has a Smartraveller scheme which enables a person who is travelling overseas to go to the DFAT website and enter their name and their itinerary so that if some incident occurs the department is at least aware that there may be Australians within the general area. That is a very important scheme and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be congratulated for establishing that scheme. I think that the existence of the Smartraveller website should be more widely known.


Another very important thing that people travelling overseas should do is to take out comprehensive travel insurance, because, whether it is a terrorist attack or an injury from other causes, medical treatment in other countries is often very expensive, and that often comes as a great shock to Australians, especially to those who need more sophisticated treatment, such as a period of time in an intensive care unit. In Australia that would be free of charge under Medicare in a public hospital, if you chose to be treated in a public hospital. In other countries, however, the cost of intensive care treatment can be horrendously expensive. I think that the risk, however small it may seem, of requiring that kind of treatment should be reason enough for everybody to take out comprehensive travel insurance. When you do so, it is very important to read the small print on the policy to make sure that the policy does provide for air evacuation to Australia if needed after an accident, injury or terrorist act. The cost of air evacuation can be very expensive. If it is done by scheduled airline, the companies that provide medivacs—medical air evacuations—have to occupy six or eight seats in the plane, which inevitably costs a fair bit of money. There are doctors and nurses who have to travel with the victim and often they have several teams of such people if the distance back to Australia is long. Coming from Europe, for example, at some point along the route there would be a second team of doctors and nurses put on the plane to look after the individual. It is very important for people travelling overseas to always have comprehensive travel insurance and to always read the finer details of the policy to ensure that they are getting the coverage they imagine they are getting when they buy the policy. It is very important to buy a policy from a reputable service provider. You can buy one online from some of the big international travel agencies and companies or from a local travel agent whom you trust and respect. 


I come back to the issue of international terrorism and particularly the assistance provided to the victims of overseas terrorism. As I said, terrorism is sadly now a fact of life in the modern world. We must always be aware of the danger of terrorism, particularly when going to Third World countries where there are political issues, to the Middle East, to Africa or to some parts of Asia. Some countries are much more risky to visit than others. Before travelling to such countries, it is important people go to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website and have a look at the travel warnings, which the department puts out on every country in the world to advise of the risk to individuals in travelling to those countries. There has been a need for this kind of compensation to be paid or to be available to the victims of overseas terrorism for some time. I am very pleased that this bill has been proposed. It fills an important gap and I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (11:46):  I too rise to speak in support of the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. Travellers, like soldiers, these days need to accept the risks. Neither soldiers nor travellers go overseas to be injured or to die, but these are risks that both soldiers and travellers must now accept as a potential reality. It is now on the notice paper, as it were, for our civilian population to think about preparation and to think about self-help in the event of a tragedy when travelling overseas. Initiatives of the sort that Senator Eggleston has just spoken about such as Smartraveller, travel insurance, self-help and good old commonsense when we are travelling overseas must be the very first steps.


This bill seeks to make appropriate and modest provision to Australians travelling overseas who are injured in a terrorist attack or, if they are killed, to their next of kin. It is very clear that the bill seeks to model itself upon the various states victim of crime legislation. Proposed section12(c) of the bill states:


In administering the framework, the Secretary is to ensure that:


…   …   …


(c)   procedures and practices established under … this Act and for the operation of the framework … are broadly commensurate with the procedures and practices established under State and Territory victims of crime compensation schemes.


After all, that is a very important part of the point. Were this domestic terrorism about which we are speaking, then people would be broadly compensated by states and territories victim of crime legislation. The only difference, and the tragic difference, is that we are talking in this bill about Australians travelling overseas who are targeted by ruthless terrorists because they are Australians, because of who they are and where they live. Terrorists do not necessarily care who else they get as collateral on the way through and they do not specifically care whether they get you or me, but they know that they will get some of us. In that respect, Australians travelling overseas have diminished control, if you like, as to whether they will suffer tragedy.


This bill seeks to be a modest and appropriate help in those cases. Senator Singh attempted to suggest, in referring to the introduction of a bill last year by former Attorney-General McClelland, that that bill was broadly consistent with this bill.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  The Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, which was initially foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, is an important acknowledgement of the debt that this country owes to people who have been injured in the course of terrorist incidents overseas. We should never forget the high price that Australia has paid due to the activity, in particular, of Islamist terrorists.


Since 11 September 2001, some 300 Australians have been killed or injured in terrorist incidents overseas. We lost Australians in the World Trade Centre. We lost many Australians in Bali—not once, but twice. We lost Australians in London and we lost Australians in Jakarta. Some 300 of our fellow citizens have been killed or injured. Let us never forget that those bombs went off because the perpetrators of those outrages believe that our way of life is a satanic excrescence. That is what in the perversion of their own minds they believe. The people who died or were injured in those terrorist incidents were targeted precisely because of the way of life, the values and the civilisation of which we are part. Australia has been targeted precisely because we are part of and proud to be part of Western civilisation: a nation which lives by the values and takes pride in its identity as a part of Western civilisation. That is why the terrorists hate us.


It should be remembered that after each of the terrorist incidents the Australian government has been there to help. Centrelink assistance has been rendered. Medical expenses have been paid. I want to congratulate governments of both persuasions for the effort they have made to help Australians and to continue to help Australians who have been injured and the families of those who have been killed in terrorist incidents overseas.


We have to acknowledge the fact that these people have suffered for their country in a way not entirely different from the sufferings that our soldiers have faced in the struggle against terrorism. They were not random victims. They were victims because of the way of life of this country and they were chosen as targets because of the way of life of the civilisation in which we participate. We should not underestimate the ongoing suffering of those who were injured and of the families of those who were injured and killed.


We cannot think that our duty to them as a nation ends simply because they were given Centrelink assistance to come back to this country and simply because their relatives were given Centrelink assistance to do what they could to help. We cannot think that our duty to them has ended just because their medical expenses for the immediate injuries that they suffered were paid. There is a lifetime of pain for those people, physical and psychological, and it needs to be acknowledged, recognized and in some way made up for by the wider Australian community.


What this bill proposes is that the national government establish a scheme to compensate the Australian victims of overseas terrorist attacks that is analogous with the victims-of-crimes schemes which have long operated in most of the Australian states and territories.


If an Australian is the victim of a criminal act in this country he or she will usually receive some form of compensation, some monetary benefit, from the state and territory governments. It is not lavish. It is not the sort of thing which is going to enable people to live in luxury for the rest of their lives—far from it. It is not full compensation in the sense that a lawyer would understand a damages award in a personal injuries case as compensation. Nevertheless, it is an important acknowledgement by our community of the unjustified and completely abhorrent pain and suffering that the victim of crime has been put through.


The bill proposes the establishment of a federal scheme, analogous to the state victims-of-crime schemes, purely for the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts. It is a modest, responsible, and necessary measure by this parliament for the benefit of those people.


I accept that there are some issues with oppositions proposing measures of this kind that might create a charge upon the revenue. I would be very happy for this bill to be taken over by the government. The coalition would welcome that. The government has proposed a way of helping the Australian victims of terrorist incidents overseas but for reasons that are not clear it has not proceeded. I would be grateful to see it advanced, whether here or in the other place. In the meantime, the opposition offers this private senator's bill in order to meet the need that I have identified.


We must stand by our fellow Australians in trouble and those who were targeted because they were Australians, because they were emblems of our way of life. They deserve this modest measure of recognition, help and acknowledgement. I commend the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbot, who initiated this proposal and has driven the proposal for several years now. And I commend the bill to the Senate. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (09:37):  I rise to speak on the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, brought forth by Senator Brandis and the coalition. I want to take this opportunity to put on record my strongest condemnation of acts of terrorism and the form terrorism takes. More often than not terrorism takes the form of an indiscriminate attack on civilians and bystanders whose only crime has been to be a member of a particular polity or to be in a particular place.


Terrorists do not engage in conflict under the normal rules of engagement by which state armed forces are bound. That, of course, means that they do not abide by international humanitarian law. They have no concept of the distinction between legitimate targets of military activity as defined through the instruments of international humanitarian law, and civilian targets—civilian targets being, more often than not, the innocent bystanders in terrorist acts. Instead, the purpose of terrorist organisations, by definition, is to create such insecurity and such uncertainty and fear in a political culture as to effect some sort of radical change. While the aim of most terrorist organisations is to effect changes in the policies of states, their means are violence against private citizens, who, more often than not, are the victims of terrorist acts.


Australia has not been immune from terrorism in the past. While the most recent and bloody stain on the national consciousness was in Kuta, Bali, in October 2002, Australians have been affected by terrorism at an average of 30 victims per year over the last decade. In some cases, Australians have been bystanders caught up in events. In other cases, as in Bali, they have been specifically targeted for their nationality and what they represent: democracy, participation and freedom—values which, in this country, we have enshrined in instruments of law and in our Constitution.


It is my very strong belief that political violence can never be justified. Even under the most extreme circumstances there is no excuse for resorting to force, brutality and murder, as terrorists do, especially against the innocent victims terrorists target in their search for the most vulnerable and most dramatic display of force.


I want to make it clear that I and the Labor government deplore acts of terrorism, and we have the greatest of compassion for those Australians caught up in the tragic displays of political violence perpetrated by terrorists. There is simply no sense of justice or dignity attached to the actions of the extremists who are prepared to sacrifice innocent people for political ends.


And in this new age of asymmetric warfare, in which non-state actors pose an increased, more widely dispersed threat to the citizens of the world, especially those who respect the proper processes of democratic decision-making, it is important for us to have strong, consistent and comprehensive means of addressing terrorism related issues.


I want also to recognise the impact of criminal activity on victims of crime. It can be devastating for individuals and families who suffer the effects of violence, insecurity and shock brought about by criminal activity. In this case, the criminal activities are under the guise of paramilitary activity. Like any serious injury, the effects of crime are both physical and psychological and can endure long after the actual act has subsided. Associated with the immediate effect of crime can be prolonged periods of shock, depression, stress, loss of esteem and disorientation.


In every Australian state and territory, the disabling effect of the trauma inflicted upon victims of crime is recognised through victims-of-crime schemes, making victims eligible for lump-sum payments under criminal injuries schemes. While the state and territory schemes do include the effects of terrorism, jurisdiction for these schemes does not extend beyond state or territory borders. Victims of terrorism overseas do not currently have a scheme to recognise the effect of terrorism on their lives.


That said, over the last decade and longer, the Australian government has gone to some length to support its citizens who have been affected by terrorism overseas. Since September 11, a number of Australians have been injured and more than 100 have been killed in overseas terrorist incidents. Assistance has been directed to victims of these events, including under the disaster health care assistance schemes, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and short-term financial assistance. The September 11th victim compensation fund, for example, provided assistance to those injured in the terrible attacks upon the World Trade Centre in New York, and their families. Substantial payments were made to the next of kin of Australians killed in those attacks in recognition of the sudden, unpredictable and tragic loss of life in that event. In total, in the last decade, more than $12 million has been expended on assistance and support for victims of overseas terrorism. But it is clear that the Australian government does require a way to recognise victims of overseas terrorism that is both clear and consistent. And I want to commend the original motivation of the bill before the Senate, which arises from the advocacy of the member for Paterson and the Leader of the Opposition. The purpose of the opposition's bill is to provide additional financial support, I understand, of up to $75,000 for Australians who are affected by terrorism overseas, or their next of kin.


The bill before the Senate at the moment requires the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to administer payments to Australian families who have suffered as a result of an international terrorist act. But while one could support the original intention of this bill we are debating here today, the Australian government is already acting on this issue. Last year the then Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, introduced the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill to achieve a similar purpose to that of the bill we are currently debating. Unlike the bill brought on today by the coalition, that bill includes robust criteria for the eligibility of victims under the proposed scheme and a framework for administering payments. That framework includes the principles and guidelines by which any scheme would be administered, including the nature, duration and impact of the injury; the likelihood of future loss, injury or disease; the circumstance in which injury was incurred; the relationships between victims; the number of claimants relating to a particular incident; and other relevant factors.


The government bill currently before the parliament also seeks to clarify an ambiguity within the coalition's bill, relating to whether the scheme might apply retrospectively. As I have mentioned, over a long period of time the Australian government has attempted to recognise the impact on victims of overseas terrorism through ad hoc means. While it is not clear in the legislation we are debating, my understanding from public comments by the coalition on this bill is that their scheme is intended to apply retrospectively, duplicating some of the good work already done by the previous government programs of which I have already spoken and which are already in place.


With an issue of such traumatic impact and on a matter on which there is generally bipartisan support, I believe it is disappointing to have the opposition bring forward a private senator's bill to attempt to grandstand rather than actually seek to solve a problem. Despite the various technical and logistical issues with this bill that are clarified or resolved in the government's bill and despite a firm commitment from the Gillard Labor government to continue to pursue a compensation scheme that is essentially the same scale proposed by the coalition, the Liberal and National parties have found it necessary to showboat on this issue rather than get behind the serious and comprehensive efforts of this government. If they were genuine about wanting to do something in relation to the principle and the main objectives outlined in the government's bill to assist victims of overseas terrorism, they would have done so. They would have done so in supporting the government's bill. Instead, what we have here today is grandstanding, bringing forth their own private senator's bill for no other apparent means but to politicise and play a grandstanding game with this very important and significant issue. That is disappointing. But at the end of the day what is most important is that victims of overseas terrorism are supported by their nation. I sincerely hope that when the government's bill comes before this chamber the opposition will be as supportive about a bill that comprehensively addresses this issue as they are about the political and parliamentary tactics they have employed in bringing on this debate today.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-03-15,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:49):  I rise to speak on the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. Compensation for victims of terrorist attacks is an extremely important matter for Australians and there is clearly tripartisan or cross-party support for this principle. Because of its importance, however, the mechanism for administering and funding this compensation must be addressed both effectively and responsibly, and that is where the Australian Greens believe there is still a necessary area for further discussion.


This bill proposes financial assistance of up to $75,000 for Australians who are injured or hospitalised, or whose next of kin is killed, in an offshore terrorism incident. The details of the scheme are not included in the bill. They are left to be included in guidelines, which have not yet been developed. The bill indicates that these guidelines would be developed by the minister.


Since September 11, 2001 more than 200 Australians have been injured and more than 100 have been killed in overseas terrorist incidents. Significant targeted assistance was provided to victims of those events, including through disaster healthcare assistance schemes, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and immediate short-term financial assistance through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. The Australian government has expended more than $12 million on assistance and support for those individuals and their families. To date, payments to victims of terrorism have been made ex gratia, using the executive power of the Commonwealth under section 61 of the Constitution. The Prime Minister and/or the cabinet decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether an ex gratia payment is to be made and have done so in overseas terrorism cases such as Bali and Mumbai. Ex gratia payments can be made from either departmental or administered appropriations. However, an appropriation must have an outcome that covers the payment.


I understand that there has been considerable negotiation between the government and the opposition on this matter in the House. There has been delay on the part of the government in taking action on this matter—a matter of great importance to Australians. The Australian Greens share the opposition's frustration in this regard. However, we believe it is important to have an effective scheme in place which is properly established and responsibly funded.


The main point of disagreement between the coalition and the government appears to be that the government has made a policy decision to not make retrospective payments, but the coalition has not made such a commitment. Senator Brandis's bill does not specify that the proposed framework applies to particular events, and neither does it specifically state whether or not it applies retrospectively. It provides that the minister must make guidelines which include the eligibility criteria for providing assistance of up to $75,000. Payments are made only if the requirements in the guidelines have been met. However, Senator Brandis has not ruled out the possibility that previous events which have been the subject of government assistance to victims may be included, whereas I understand that the government does not intend to declare events pre-dating passage of the legislation as being eligible for financial assistance.


Retrospective application of the scheme would effectively duplicate assistance and support previously provided to those victims. As mentioned earlier, the Australian government has expended more than $12 million on assistance and support for individuals and families affected in terrorist acts since September 2001. In addition, the September 11th victim compensation fund provided generous financial assistance to those injured and the next of kin of those who were killed in the 9/11 attacks, including Australians. Payments of between $250,000 and $7.1 million were made to the next of kin of six Australians killed in those attacks.


The Australian Greens are concerned that retrospective application of the scheme would have significant impacts on the cost of the scheme. If applied prospectively, the estimated cost of Senator Brandis's bill is approximately $2.25 million per annum. This is based on the fact that approximately 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism overseas in the past 10 years, which works out to be an average of 30 victims per year. The figure of $2.25 million per annum assumes a payment of the full amount of $75,000 to each Australian harmed and to the next of kin of each Australian killed in an overseas terrorist incident, applied prospectively. However, if applied retrospectively the estimated cost of Senator Brandis's bill is approximately $24 million. This is an estimate by the government based on the number of Australians killed in terrorist events since 11 September 2001.


There are questions about how the bill will be funded. The bill proposes that payments would be funded from the contingency reserve, which is designed to reflect any unexpected events that cannot be assigned to individual programs. The Australian Greens do not believe that this is a satisfactory funding mechanism for such an important scheme and call on the opposition to indicate how they intend to pay for this scheme in a fiscally responsible manner into the future. Compensation for victims of terrorist attacks is an extremely important matter for Australians and there is clearly cross-party support for the principle. Because of its importance, the mechanism for administering and funding this compensation must be addressed both effectively and responsibly.


The Australian Greens do not believe Senator Brandis's bill provides a complete framework for the administration of these payments or an adequate funding mechanism for the scheme. We believe that these matters require, and would certainly benefit from, further examination by a Senate committee.


Accordingly, I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


      and the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2012.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:56):  I rise to support this legislation and to note with some regret that senators in other parts of the chamber have seen fit to express support for this principle, describing it, in the words of Senator Wright, as a tri-partisan commitment towards acknowledging the pain and suffering of those who are victims of international terrorism yet cannot bring themselves to actively support this legislation, which has been carefully thought through and presents the framework for provision of assistance to people who are victims of terrorism. It will contain details of operation, as determined by regulation, and therefore, appropriately, does not specify details of the way in which grants should be approved. That is appropriately left to an administrative process below the legislation itself. Despite the relatively easy decision that the Senate could make today to support the framework for provision of assistance to victims of international terrorism, it appears that is not going to happen.


The fact is that assistance to people who have been victims of terrorism is a fairly serious gap in our victim support arrangements in this country. For some time, states and territories have had victims-of-crime schemes which have assisted people in a whole range of settings, including, at least historically, for quite minor crimes, and yet people who have been unfortunate enough to be Australians overseas who have experienced the effect of one of the most heinous and scarring of crimes—that is, a deliberate terrorist act—have not, until now, had available to them some form of financial assistance. That clearly has to change. Despite the discussion on the government's part of the need to do this, it is the case that it is the coalition which has brought forward legislation to respond to that need. It is not unfair to describe the government's own legislation as a reaction to that move rather than a parallel exercise that happened to have been engaged in before the coalition took this issue on.


Clearly, in administering a framework for this legislation, there needs to be consultation about how it will work. The Attorney-General would be required to consult regularly with representatives of victims and their families, other professionals working in the field, international humanitarian agencies and relevant bodies to ensure that the scheme was effective and met the needs of victims. Individual payments are capped at $75,000, which is pretty much in line with the schemes operating in the states and territories.


The concept is hard to argue with and I do not think I heard any particular argument by other senators with the concept and the structure of this legislation. I did hear some other comments which I think can be fairly rebutted. Senator Singh described the coalition's position as 'grandstanding' and 'showboating', but the truth is that this is legislation which is timely, important and relevant. I suspect that, if the government brings forward its own legislation, it will not look very different to what the opposition has already put forward. So why one could be described as showboating and the other described as comprehensive and genuine is a little hard to understand.


Senator Wright suggested in her remarks that there was a problem with the question of retrospectivity. She accepted a government estimate of what extra costs would be associated with a scheme which was retrospective if it ensured that people could claim again for compensation under this scheme on top of what they had already been able to obtain by virtue of ex gratia payments made previously by the Australian government. With great respect, it is fairly obvious that the scheme as administered under the guidelines or framework that the Attorney-General needs to formulate would provide that a person not be able to double dip in those circumstances. It is not necessary for the legislation to say that. It is necessary for the regulations to say it—I accept that—but nobody on this side of the house would seriously suggest that people should be able to claim twice for the same injury under a similar act of generosity.


It takes me somewhat by surprise to hear the Australian Greens bring forward concerns relating to the cost of a scheme like this. Even if we were to pretend for a moment that the scheme would cost as much as has been suggested—and I think it clearly will not—when the Greens ask, 'How can this scheme be funded?' it is a somewhat strange question to hear on their lips. They are the party who have promised a high-speed rail system up and down the entire east coast of Australia, have promised to index Public Service pensions by the same indexation method used for old age pensioners and have promised a light rail system around the whole of Canberra. Those three promises alone would set the Australian taxpayer back at least $10 billion. So why we find the Greens quibbling over maybe $5 million to $10 million in the out years is very hard to understand. If the Greens were consistent about their concern about sourcing funds for important initiatives, I would be more prepared to take them seriously, but they appear only to be looking gift horses in the mouth when they come from other parts of the chamber.


It is important that, as a parliament, we indicate the greatest of solidarity with those people who are victims of international terrorism. They are not just any victim of crime. Although it is obviously odious to make comparisons between the effect of crimes on people, these are not, in a sense, ordinary victims of crime. They are victims of a crime which is a great scourge around the world and a form of crime which has, unfortunately, affected Australians. Although not particularly within Australia's borders it certainly has affected Australians. It is very important that the Australian community indicates that it will help and support those people who are victims of those crimes because these people, in a sense, are representative of a society which terrorists target because of the nature of that society. Terrorists, particularly the Islamist terrorists that have been the source of terrorist acts against Australians in Bali and elsewhere, target Westerners—Australians—because of the kind of society that we are. They regard our society as being decadent and godless and a society that needs to be punished for being the kind of society that it is. So those who are victims of that kind of criminal act are victims, in a sense, as representatives of Australian society generally. It is important that we ensure that people who find themselves in that unfortunate position have every support to rebuild their lives, particularly where they have suffered serious injury as a result of an international terrorist act.


It is not possible to be dogmatic about how much the scheme will cost in any given year, because the scheme obviously is activated by international terrorism and, sadly, such acts are not easy to predict. In some years there may be very few acts; hopefully, it will not be the case that in other years there will be more, but we cannot discount that possibility.


I commend this legislation to the Senate. I ask members to put aside their feelings that somehow this legislation steals a march on other things that others may have been planning to do. If the legislation is conceptually worthwhile, if it does something that we all agree needs to be done, which is to compensate innocent victims of outrageous acts perpetrated for ideological or sectarian reasons—if we agree that all of that needs to happen—then we ought not to hesitate to take the step presented to the Senate today to support legislation that will make that happen. If we are concerned about imperfections, we should bring forward amendments to deal with those imperfections. If we are concerned about the politics of it, I suggest that that is not a good reason not to proceed with the legislation at this time. I, for one, believe that it has been far too long since the first such terrorist acts affected the lives of Australians and that we need to move to do something about that. This legislation does something about that and it deserves the support of every member of this place.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (10:08):  I rise to contribute to this debate on Senator Brandis's private senator's bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. Until the last few minutes I had intended to continue in the same vein as Senator Humphries because much of what he was saying is the absolute imperative we have as a government and as a legislature: to ensure that Australians travelling overseas who are the victims of a terrorism act can be guaranteed that they are going to be cared for by their government, regardless of its political persuasion.


Senator Wright made a very important point when she said that this is an important policy issue that has the support of all members of parliament. It is not something we should be playing politics with. Therefore, it is pretty frustrating that we have had this bill brought forward today for debate when last year, on 24 March, Mr McClelland, the Attorney-General at the time, introduced a much more compre­hensive bill and no-one was playing politics about that at the time. That bill was developed in consultation and with lots of negotiation with the opposition, with Mr Abbott's office, with the shadow Attorney-General and with those people who were very concerned after the introduction of Mr Abbott's bill in 2009. It was tabled and nothing further was done with it and then it was tabled again in 2010, that time with an explanatory memorandum so people could understand the intent. From that point on there have been very significant negotiations to try to clarify issues and to seek important advice not just from the Attorney-General but from the people Senator Humphries mentioned today—the people who are part of this and are mentioned in Senator Brandis's bill. In the outline to the bill Senator Brandis says:


In administering the framework, the Attorney-General must regularly consult with representatives of victims and their families, community or welfare organisations, health professionals, international humanitarian agencies and any other relevant bodies.


And in his contribution this morning Senator Brandis pointed to the victims-of-crimes legislation in our state and territory jurisdictions as being the model on which his bill has been developed. But there is a problem here. The problem we have is that this Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012 is an isolated bill, standing within the framework of the Attorney-General and giving a lot of responsibility to the minister of the day in determining the framework, the eligibility criteria, the payment system, the administration and the development of guidelines, which are not here yet and no-one can guess what they are. So this bill sits outside other pieces of work that the government is involved in.


Senator Humphries was, I think, part of a recent Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the treatment of Australians kidnapped overseas and the way in which they can be supported. Out of the experiences we have had of Australians kidnapped overseas there have been very serious, comprehensive and wise processes and guidelines put in place through our consular agencies to strengthen the capacity of our consular assistance to help victims and their families. And the model that came out of the investigation of the Brennan case has actually brought forward for the government's consideration, with the support of the opposition, a range of strategies and assistance measures that are all being rolled out and put in place now. Those measures are also consistent with the social security bill which is currently in the House of Representatives.


At the time of the introduction of the bill by Mr Abbott in the House of Representatives, the government was beginning the discussion around the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Again, there are parallels with the complementary considerations to be brought into play in the way in which victims of overseas terrorist acts and their families will be treated when they are repatriated to Australia and the way in which their families are going to be supported through the trauma that is part of dealing with such awful incidents. So that is another part of the whole-of-government approach that we are trying to take to these issues. Again, Senator Brandis makes no mention of this. I have to say that his bill is disturbingly light on details and it does leave many crucial and critical questions unanswered.


We do not want to play politics with this issue; it is far too important. What we want to do is ensure that the way in which we provide support and the mechanism of support for Australian citizens who are victims of overseas terrorist acts are consistent with the ways the international community is trying to deal with them, because there has been an internationalis­ation of terrorism and we are part of the international community that is trying to deal with it. Through the lessons that we are learning and the way in which we are trying to craft a support package and a support network for people who are in this extraordinary situation, we are trying to be consistent with what is happening in other countries. 


I would like to go to that for a moment, if I may, because you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, how interested I am in the way in which victims of terrorist acts are supported in Northern Ireland. That is a very good model for the way in which we are trying to prepare our own support. There are international best practice models: Israel, the United States and Northern Ireland. Israel pays compensation to victims of terrorist acts and it is financed through a national insurance scheme. This may well be part of one of the considerations in the framework of our national disability insurance scheme. We have yet to come to that kind of conclusion, but it does go to the issue of policy coherence. 


Northern Ireland has a criminal injuries tariff compensation scheme, which was established in 2009, and that applies to all incidents occurring on or after 1 April 2009. That is dealing with the issue of retrospectivity and it is an issue that we too need to think about in Australia. To qualify for a payment in Northern Ireland, the person must be a victim of a crime of violence, and that can include arson or an act of poisoning. We do not even have a definition of a terrorist act in Senator Brandis's bill. We do not have that defined clearly enough, but in Northern Ireland they have actually said it goes beyond bombing and it goes beyond kidnapping. It can go to arson, and many fires have been set in Northern Ireland that have resulted in terrible tragedies. Poisoning is another interesting conversation we could be having about terrorism. Those people who are victims of some crime of violence are covered by the scheme. They need to be physically and/or mentally injured as a result and to have been in Northern Ireland at the time that the injury was sustained. That again is a very different model to the one we are discussing, because we are talking about Australian citizens in international circumstances where we do not have sovereignty. So we have to make sure that we are consistent with the international models and also that we are able to do the very best we can for Australian citizens in that situation. In Northern Ireland the compensation can include a prescribed lump sum payment for personal injury based on the scheme's schedule of mains amounts, and that aligns with workers compensation schemes here in Australia. Values are put on the level of physical injury that may have occurred. 


Such is the complexity of putting together a proposition so as to assist victims of overseas terrorist activities. That is why we as a government have not presented this argument and this package of support through an Attorney-General's bill but rather as an amendment to the Social Security Act. That is the way in which we want to consider supporting victims and their families through something that will be horrific, lifelong, terrifying and an enduring, debilitating experience for them. How long people can access assistance is a very significant issue for us to consider and it is being considered in the framework of the government's bill. I wondered whether Senator Humphries was aware that the bill had been introduced in the House of Representatives because he did seem to think that no matter who was putting this issue forward it was worthy of consideration. 


I do not want to play the politics of this because the situation is so important. The government's bill, introduced in March 2011, has been the subject of significant negotia­tion around the detail. It is quite specific and very comprehensive. The explanatory memorandum is very comprehensive. The Bills Digest, which is available from the Parliamentary Library, is quite detailed and raises some issues too. Concerns raised by the community and our colleagues in the parliament are being taken into account by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Human Services. It is very difficult to stand here and say, 'Well, we are not going to support this bill.' Some would like to present it to the Australian community as meaning that the government was not going to be supporting victims of overseas terrorism. That would be an awful message because it is simply untrue.


We are acutely aware that the system is a little ad hoc, discretionary and challenging. The system needs to take into account the higher level of alertness that we have to terrorist activities around the world, the ways in which they may happen and where they may happen. Australians are avid travellers with the opportunity and the incentive to get out and see the world. Australian citizens caught up in terrorist activity may well be in countries where we do not have strong international support or with which we do not have bilateral relations. We are not thinking only of people who are killed in overseas terrorist incidents. In Bali in 2002, for example, there were 182 Australians injured, as well as the 88 who lost their lives. So this is not just a scheme that requires consideration of repatriation of the bodies of loved ones; it is also a scheme that needs to take into account the maiming and injury of Australian citizens and the way in which we are going to care for them, sometimes lifelong.


In Bali, 182 were injured and 88 were killed. For September 11, we do not actually have a clear figure of how many Australians were injured, but of course we do know that we had 10 Australians killed. In 2003, we had someone injured in an incident in Riyadh. We also had someone injured in Istanbul. In Saudi Arabia, we had an Australian national killed. In Bali, in 2005, there were 17 Australians injured and four more killed. In London, we had 10 Australian nationals injured and one killed. In Egypt, two more were injured and in Mumbai, India, in 2008, we had four. So you can see that around the world, as we see an increase in terrorist activity, the way in which we have to deal with victims of these kinds of incidents is actually going to become more complex. That is why as a government we are saying, 'Let's take a more holistic approach. Let's find the way through.'


If you go to the detail of Senator Brandis's bill, it is quite clear. It looks at a compensation level of up to $75,000. That is consistent with the government's position. Senator Brandis's bill does not actually make the point about whether they are primary or secondary victims, which the government's bill does. The government's bill acknow­ledges that there are secondary victims. They may be the families that are having to deal with a family member who has been severely injured or, of course, who has lost their life. So the idea that we can simplistically think about what is a very complex, distressing tragedy of Australians killed or injured overseas as a result of terrorism really does not do justice to those people who are in that unfortunate situation and it certainly does not do justice to Australians in giving them confidence when they travelling overseas.


Let us think very clearly about what is going to happen. The bill does not specify the proposed framework that applies to particular events. Neither does it specifically state whether or not the issue of retrospect­ivity is being considered. Previously, former minister Ellison, commenting on that 2009 bill, said that no, retrospectivity was not being considered because there had been significant compensation to the Bail bombing victims at the time. He made a general statement—not in the parliament but in commentary—about that. That is not clear in what Senator Brandis is proposing today. Senator Humphries also said that we would not expect that people would be duplicating the financial assistance already paid to Australian victims. Senator Brandis's bill does not go to the issue of travel insurance or where that might fit in the scheme of things. It certainly does not go to workers compensation, income insurance or those kinds of arrangements that people put in place now when they are travelling. So it is pretty short-sighted and pretty thin on the detail.


We know that terrorism is a type of war in which the enemy—the terrorist organis­ation—selects random victims as its target, and we, as global travellers, are significant targets. As Senator Brandis said in his introductory comments today, we are the enemy. People abhor our lifestyle. They believe that we are really undermining civilisation as they know it and they want to target us. So we need to be sure that what we put in place for Australians travelling overseas is consistent and that there is policy coherence across all of the government's work. That is critically important. We want to make sure that whoever is caught as a victim of terrorism in the future is provided support in the long term.


We are going to be working very closely to bring on the social security amendment bill; the Attorney-General is working to do that very soon. Can I say in closing that Senator Wright is right: there are issues that still need to be considered, and we would certainly be supporting the Greens amendment to refer this bill to a Senate committee for inquiry.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I rise to address the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, and I want to acknowledge the contribution of senators from both sides of the Senate and the crossbenches who recognise the importance of this issue and the responsibility we as legislators have to the people of Australia. The bill proposes the establishment of a framework to facilitate financial assistance for Australians killed or injured—or their next of kin—as a result of international terrorist acts. The explanatory memorandum goes through a number of the details of the bill in terms of the quantum of the funds, the $75,000 which is in line with state and territory victims-of-crime regimes as well as the sorts of people who are stakeholders that would be engaged in both the establishment and ongoing management of the scheme.


The question, though, that the public may well ask is: why? Why should the government put in place a scheme to financially support Australians who have been targeted by terrorism overseas? As mentioned about the state and territory victims-of-crime legislation, there is a strong precedent in this nation of caring for individuals who have been affected by incidents that are no fault of their own. Victims-of-crime legislation is one example. Compulsory third-party insurance is another example whereby we put in place mechanisms to make sure that people who are injured have the opportunity to have care provided for them. A parallel process, which is in discussion at the moment, is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, where we recognise the ongoing burden and crises that many family face due to circumstances imposed upon them that are beyond their control. It is also worth recognising that opportunities for individuals to take measures to protect themselves against such things as terrorism have been reduced since 9-11. The insurance industry, for example, now routinely places exclusions for terrorist acts on all kinds of insurance, whether it be home and contents insurance, commercial insurance or, particularly, travel insurance. That means that, even if people wish to insure against such things to make sure they can provide for themselves, insurance companies include exclusions which prevent that. The government has taken some steps in terms of commercial insurance onshore to give business some confidence, but that does not extend to what we are talking about here with people overseas. There are precedents in countries such as Israel, the UK—Northern Ireland in particular—and the United States. Those jurisdictions have well-established systems of compensating people who have been the victims of terrorism, so there is strong precedent. It is interesting to note that all of those precedents are in countries that place a high value on the individual. That is one of the reasons we need to look at this issue, because it is a matter of principle that we support people.


Why are Australians being targeted overseas? I use the word 'targeted' quite deliberately, because terrorist acts are not purely random. The incidents are occurring, by and large, in locations which suggest targeting of liberal Western democracies, whether it be in the UK, the United States or places where people such as Australians go. We are all very familiar with the Bali bombings, where Australians were targeted, the London bombings and 9-11. DFAT has quite clearly identified in their paper Transnational terrorism: the threat to Australia that Australia is a terrorist target both as a Western nation and also in its own right. The paper explains that the transnational extreme Muslim terrorists see that:


Weakening the influence of the West would advance their political goals by helping undermine those Muslims they view as corrupt and open to Western influence. We are seen as standing in the way of their goal to transform the Muslim world into a Taliban-style society. According to their simplistic worldview, we are part of the Christian West which, to them, is un-Islamic and therefore illegitimate.


The core values we hold and which are intrinsic to our success as a liberal democratic culture are anathema to these extremists. For them, our beliefs in democratic process, racial and gender equality, religious tolerance and equality of opportunity are mere human inventions at odds with God’s law. These values impede their political goals.


We have seen, recently, decisions taken, and endorsed by people like President Karzai, about the respective value of women compared to men and we have seen the oppression of minorities in countries such as Iran. This Senate has passed resolutions condemning the treatment of minorities in many countries. Different world views place different values on people. In Australia we value individuals, we value men and women equally and we uphold the principle of freedom. That makes us a target. That also means we should look out for those people who have been damaged or hurt in what various members in this place have described as a war against our world view and our way of life.


The coalition has long been a supporter of that principle. Going back to 2009, on 16 November, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, tabled the Assisting the Victims of International Terrorism Bill. In 2010 Senator Brandis tabled the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill. On 21 February 2011, Mr Abbott again tabled a bill in the other place. This current bill is the latest in a succession of attempts by the coalition to uphold this principle. 


The other reason we should be considering this bill is practice. At the moment, because our nation does value individuals, we have provided strong support to people who have been victims. As has been mentioned by various speakers in this debate, that support is somewhat fragmented, somewhat unpredictable and relies largely on a number of small grants and programs bringing together existing streams from departments such as Centrelink and on specific ex gratia payments, which can vary quite significantly. So for the interests of consistency it is appropriate that this Senate and this parliament look to provide a framework which provides some certainty as to the payments that would be made.


I support the comments made that this is not just a one-off for a short-term issue. Whether we are talking about Australians who are injured as uniformed soldiers in a war or whether we are talking about Australians who are injured through acts of terrorism, the actual act and the immediate aftermath, which so often creates a lot of public goodwill and interest, can be a life-changing, long-term devastating incident for those families. So, as a nation, we need to consider not only how we respond to the short term and the immediate but how we respond to those people and support them through a very long journey of recovery. I believe that is an area we will need to continue to discuss and debate in this place so that we can have a viable, affordable method of supporting those fellow Australians who, through no fault of their own, now face a very difficult life because of injuries that have been received, whether in the service of this nation or through being innocent Australians abroad who have been caught up, whether in London, the United States or wherever. We had artists in New York looking to exhibit their works, we had tourists and people working in London and we had people holidaying in Bali. These are all things that we would expect any person to have the right to go and do. When not only are there people killed—with that impact on their family—but there are a large number of people injured, that is an ongoing issue. We, as a nation, need to have a system in place to care for them.


Whether because of the precedent, because of the principal or because of the problems with current practice, we do need a better framework. It has been a long-held principle of the coalition—from November 2009 to 2010 to 2011 to now—to try and bring before this parliament legislation to get a better framework, and for that reason I support the bill.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (10:38):  Let me begin my contribution to this debate by joining all those other senators in this second reading debate who have acknowledged the threat of terrorism to Australian citizens at home and abroad.


This is, in my view, a most worthy matter for the consideration of this Senate because we do face the very stark reality that Australians have been deliberately targeted by terrorist groups overseas. The global reach, ambition and unpredictable nature of international terrorist groups have made Australians travelling overseas vulnerable in all corners of the globe. We know that Australians are not immune from terrorist attacks overseas.


I am going to do something that is very unusual, Madam Acting Deputy President, but there appears to be a problem with the clock here. I think it would be a terrible thing for the Senate if my speech were stuck on nine minutes and 52 seconds for the remainder of this sitting day! I do not know how Hansard is going to record that, but nevertheless we move on.


I was making the critically important point that experience does show us that Australians are not immune from terrorist attacks overseas. Since 11 September 2001 more than 200 Australians have been injured and more than 100 killed in overseas terrorist incidents. This includes the 88 Australians who lost their lives in Bali in 2002. Terrorism knows no boundaries. Australians have been affected by terrorist attacks in New York, London, Jakarta, Mumbai and Istanbul.


The Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003 defines a terrorist act as an action or threat of action where the action causes certain defined forms of harm or interference, and:


… the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; …


Past Australian governments, both Labor and coalition, have assisted Australian victims of terrorist incidents overseas on a case-by-case basis, providing them with medical and evacuation support, consular assistance and assistance with funeral costs and other expenses on an ex gratia payment basis. The Australian government has also provided assistance to Australians affected by terrorist attacks overseas through a range of other mechanisms, such as healthcare assistance schemes and the Australian government disaster recovery payments. These schemes have provided healthcare assistance not only to Australians adversely affected by offshore terrorist attacks but also to those who have been affected by other events, such as natural disasters.


I think that in a debate like this it is important to recognise that to date there has been no comprehensive scheme that covers Australian victims of terrorism occurring overseas. I also recognise the importance of ensuring that assistance and support provided to Australians affected by terrorism overseas is appropriate and is adequate.


The parliament faces a choice now between, effectively, two approaches to deal with the victims of overseas terrorism. In my view, both are well motivated, both are well intentioned and both address inadequacies in the way we have assisted Australians affected by overseas acts of terrorism in the past. So I know that on all sides of the Australian parliament there is recognition that more comprehensive, more specific and better measures are required to ensure that the vital assistance that is required is extended to Australians that fall victim to terrorist attack outside our borders.


In the government's case, it has introduced the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. In the case of the opposition, Senator Brandis on behalf of the opposition has introduced this bill, a private senator's bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. The government bill, currently in the House of Representatives, provides for financial assistance of up to $75,000 for those injured or harmed or the next of kin of those killed by an act of terrorism overseas. The new scheme proposed by the government does not apply to victims of past incidents because, obviously, previous governments have already made determinations about the assistance and support offered for those victims of earlier terrorist incidents overseas and there is, of course, the issue that might arise of retrospective payments effectively duplicating what might already have done.




Senator Xenophon:
  The regulations are to fix that.




Senator FAULKNER:
  A very good interjection, as sometimes there is from Senator Xenophon. He talks about the possibility that subordinate legislation might deal with this matter, and of course that is true. I hope that Senator Xenophon would agree with me that the best way forward here is for the government, the opposition, minor parties and Independents in the parliament to work collaboratively on this issue. I hope Senator Xenophon would agree with this.


Of course the government will support its own bill, but I would argue that there should be collaboration across the chamber, where I believe there is a high degree of unanimity—total unanimity—about the importance of dealing with this matter and members and senators are of one mind about the high priority this is. There is every opportunity that a collaborative approach will ensure that the parliament and, of course, more importantly the victims of terrorism will achieve the best outcome. I note that Senator Wright, on behalf of the Australian Greens, has proposed that this bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2012. I do think that such an approach might be a very useful step in achieving that best outcome that I have spoken about.


So I do acknowledge the support and concern around the chamber, across all parties, for our fellow Australians who have fallen victim to terrorist attacks overseas and the importance of us ensuring that we have in place the best possible legislative framework to support victims of terrorist attacks overseas into the future. It is not surprising that the government considers that the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 is the best way of ensuring that victims of terrorism and their families are provided with the support that they need from the federal government, but I acknowledge again the fact that all parliamentarians are well motivated in this regard.


The threat to Australian citizens from terrorism overseas is real. The need for this parliament and the Australian government to deal with this issue is also real. I have welcomed the opportunity of speaking in this important second reading debate, and I commend to the Senate the approach that I have outlined as a sensible way of moving forward to achieving the shared outcomes that have been spoken about by all senators participating in this debate.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:53):  It is often a pleasure to follow Senator Faulkner in debates in this place and it is no less so on this occasion. As Senator Faulkner said in his concluding remarks, the threat of terrorism against Australians is real and the need to deal appropriately with all aspects of that threat is equally real. The legislation before us, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, seeks to deal with one aspect of the issues related to terrorism against Australians—just one aspect, but one very important aspect, and that is the support, assistance and recognition that is provided to Australian victims of terrorism in an international context.


As many of the contributors to this debate have highlighted, over the last decade in particular we have seen, and been reminded all too often of, how real that threat to Australians actually is. We have seen some 300 Australians suffer, as we know, as a result of terrorist incidents. We have lost the lives of Australians in incidents such as, of course, in the terrible attacks of 11 September 2001 on the World Trade Centre; in Bali, on two separate occasions; in London and in Jakarta. Senator Stephens in her contribution listed many other parts of the world in which Australians have been injured and have suffered because of acts of international terrorism. Where Australians have died, overwhelmingly those attacks have been because of and targeted at the way of life that we in Australia have. Those Australians and others of Western nations have been targeted because fundamentalists want to wage a war against our way of life—the democratic freedoms that Australians and our allies in Western countries and others around the world espouse; those democratic principles and principles of freedom that we believe are so very important.


I am pleased that, in general, there is agreement throughout the chamber on the importance of what this bill seeks to do. This bill seeks essentially to provide assistance and support to Australian victims of terrorism analogous to the type of support provided to victims of crime in the Australian community. To put it in simple terms, if an Australian suffers hurt, injury or death as a result of a criminally related incident within Australia, there are schemes at the state level that provide a modest sum to the victim or the family of the victim in recognition of the pain they have gone through. In a sense it is a sign that the community wants to recognise the pain that they have gone through and to help them through those difficult circumstances. This legislation simply seeks to ensure that a similar scheme is in place for Australians who face and suffer similar pain offshore as a result of the types of terrorist incidents that I have mentioned. So I think this is a very important step forward.


The legislation puts in place provisions that ensure it is comparable to the state schemes I have highlighted. Payments are capped at $75,000, a modest sum—because this is not about compensation in a legal sense as it may be applied through the courts; this is about recognition and assistance—but a sum that, nonetheless, will be very helpful to people as they recover from injuries or from the loss of a loved one.


Senator Faulkner, Senator Stephens and others have highlighted that there is a not-dissimilar government proposal before the parliament: the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. I welcome that piece of legislation. I look forward to seeing the parliament deal with this issue, whether through Senator Brandis's legislation or the government's legislation, in a sensible way that actually gets an outcome. I think that is an important thing for us to aspire to. It is for that reason that the coalition is happy to cooperate with and accept the Greens' amendment that there be a Senate inquiry into this bill, because we accept that there is an appropriate place for looking at the operation of the bill, to make sure that all the issues are considered. But, hopefully, as a result of that, we will then see the swift passage of at least one of these bills. For a long period of time now, people have been talking about and seeking to achieve the type of action, the type of assistance, that this legislation will deliver. I do hope that, as a result of that inquiry, we will see either the relevant amendments to satisfy the concerns of all contributors to this debate that will see this bill pass or the swift passage of the government's bill. But let us see some action. Let us see an outcome on this. Let us not see any more delays on this matter.


Responding to terrorism is not just related to the types of support and assistance that governments provide to victims. The support provided to victims has been well canvassed in this debate, including the types of support this bill seeks to apply and the practical assistance that governments of both persuasions have provided and, I have no doubt, will continue to provide to Australians who find themselves in trouble overseas. But the response to terrorism also involves trying to prevent it in the future and trying to hunt down, where necessary, the sources of the terrorism. 


I compliment the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, for the way in which he addressed some of those issues in question time yesterday. Senator Bob Carr was asked about our role in Afghanistan. Australia entered Afghanistan under United Nations mandate to try to respond in particular to the attacks of September 11, to respond to the Taliban's involvement in and support of al-Qaeda and to try to ensure that we do not again see a state sanctioning, assisting or supporting the type of terrorist incident that occurred on September 11, 2001.


I can understand why, in the decade that has passed, many people now ask what we are still doing in Afghanistan and why we are there. Of course, 32 fine, young Australian servicemen have paid the ultimate price for our engagement in Afghanistan, and we have honoured and recognised each of those sacrifices in this place, as we should, and we should never forget what they have given. However, as Senator Bob Carr indicated yesterday, we are there for good reason. We are there because we sought to—and we seek to—deny the likes of al-Qaeda safe haven, a place from which to base their operations. In a country like Afghanistan, we also seek to leave the country in a better place, to ensure that, hopefully, the people of Afghanistan enjoy a better lifestyle under the government in the circumstances in which we leave the country than they did before the forces of Australia and other countries took the action that has been taken.


I compliment Senator Carr because I thought the fact that he highlighted at least one of the positive achievements that have occurred in Afghanistan, in response to questions on the matter yesterday, was very important. We do not hear those positive indicators often enough in this debate. For those who may have missed it, I again highlight the educational outcomes that he indicated are occurring. In 2001, there were just one million young Afghanis enrolled in their school system, virtually none of them young women. Today, there are over seven million young Afghanis receiving an education, with around 2.5 million young women. That is a fine accomplishment. It is through a sound education system for those millions of additional young Afghanis that we will see an Afghanistan that in the future is better able to have a successful economy, to engage sensibly in world affairs and to enjoy the types of advancements and opportunities that we hope to see in place for all Australians around the world.


In this place, and particularly throughout the Australian community, we need to do more and to say more to highlight the accomplishments that have occurred in Afghanistan. It is all too often too easy to dwell on the negatives and on the tragedies. Yes, there have been tragedies—there was a terrible tragedy this week—and we should acknowledge those and should mourn those deaths and those occasions where things have gone wrong; but, equally, we should highlight the accomplishments and the fact that the 32 young Australian troops, and the many more from other countries, who have fought and died in Afghanistan have not done so in vain and have done so to protect Australians and others from international acts of terrorism and, in doing so, have provided a better life for millions of Afghanis.


Because I may not have a chance to do so elsewhere in this debate, I highlight another instance of inhumane activity that is occurring in the world at present and some action that will take place today. Today, during question time, senators will be asked to sign a letter to the ambassadors of Russia and China that will circulate around the chamber. This letter relates to what is happening in Syria—another instance of oppression happening in the world at present and another instance about which many have grave concerns for the human rights violations occurring and for the acts occurring that replicate, in some ways, the types of terrorist incidents that we have talked about on occasions in this debate. Today is the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the uprising against the Syrian government. It is estimated that in this past year between 6,500 and 7,500 innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict in Syria. Tens of thousands have been injured or arrested, and around 18,000 people are thought to be facing arbitrary detention without the right to a fair trial. The letter that will be circulated in this chamber by Senator Moore and me and in the other place by Mr Ruddock and Mr Laurie Ferguson highlights:


The grim catalogue of torture and other ill treatment that has emerged from Syria's detention centres in a year of unrest against President Bashar al-Assad's government.


The letter calls on the United Nations Security Council to refer President al-Assad to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, to freeze the assets of the president and others involved in the regime in Syria and to impose an arms embargo. These are actions that the UN Security Council should have undertaken but sadly has not because member states, particularly Russia and China—to whom this letter is directed—have resisted this type of action through the UN Security Council. It calls on the ambassadors of Russia and China to urge their countries to use their influence over Syria and their influence at the UN Security Council to end this type of abuse. I hope that in some small way today's gesture by parliamentarians of all stripes will apply a little extra pressure for some outcome in that regard and, in doing so, will ultimately lead to a better outcome for those who are victims of terrible acts in Syria.


I return to the legislation before us, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. This legislation has a great capacity, and is an opportunity, to provide some assistance to Australian victims of terrorism. In closing, I urge the Senate to ensure that, after the inquiry into this legislation is complete, this matter is dealt with and dealt with swiftly. Whether through this bill or the government's bill, we should at least see put in place by the federal government a positive outcome and the support that is deserved and warranted by Australian victims of terrorism. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-03-15,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:10):  I will not take much of the Senate's time because much of what I wanted to say has been said by my colleagues on both sides of the debate. It is clear that there is an unambiguous need to give greater support to victims of terrorism. It is clear that the current mechanisms in force are inadequate. It is clear that having ex gratia payments is not an adequate way of dealing with such matters. Current mechanisms are too ad hoc and not part of an overall scheme which provides consistency and reliability.


The issue is how we best advance this. I agree with Senator Faulkner that we need to have a collaborative approach. However, I believe that this bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, does have merit. It is not fair to characterise this bill as a piece of grandstanding, as some have. It is important that this bill be debated. It is an issue that needs to be sorted out. This bill has a number of features that are superior to the government's bill, particularly in relation to retrospectivity. Senator Faulkner made a very good point about that, suggesting, as I believe he did, that it could lead to an anomalous outcome in the event that a victim of terrorism has already received a measure of compensation. That could easily be fixed by the regulatory framework, the subordinate legislation proposed and anticipated in this legislation.


It is important that we consider the cost of this scheme. My South Australian colleague Senator Wright indicated some concern about the costs involved and the cost implications. This is not a criticism of Senator Wright, but an upside estimate of the cost of paying former victims of terrorism—to ensure that this bill is retrospective—is of the order of $20 million. If as a nation we can find $16 billion for 100 Joint Strike Fighters and $10 billion for a clean energy fund then I think we can find $20-odd million to compensate victims of terrorist acts. Senator Humphries was correct when he said we do not know how much this scheme will cost because of the very nature of the scheme. I hope that this scheme does not cost anything in the sense that I hope Australians are not subjected to acts of terrorism and people are not injured or killed by such acts, with the devastation and the heartache they cause. We do not know how much this scheme will cost, and I hope it is not much at all—if so, the world is a safer place.


We need to get on with this. Senator Faulkner's comments about a collaborative approach are very worthwhile. We should get the interested parties together in a room and thrash this out, because if we are seen by the Australian people to be bickering about the fundamental issue of some measure of justice for victims of terrorism then that reflects badly on all of us. I think there is enough goodwill in this place and in the other place to sort this out.


I finish by referring to a person I have enormous regard for and with whom I have discussed this issue on previous occasions. I hope to be in a position to catch up with him in the not-too-distant future. The person is Brian Deegan, a former South Australian magistrate. I regard him as a friend and I believe he is an incredibly decent human being with enormous integrity. Brian lost his beloved son Joshua in the Bali bombings, on 12 October 2002. Joshua was on a postseason Indonesian holiday with his teammates from the Sturt Football Club, which had just won the South Australian National Football League premiership. Brian has written a book titled Remembering Josh: Bali, a father's story. It is a very powerful testimony to his experiences and the trauma that he and so many others went through. It took an enormous act of courage for him to do that and to take the stance he took subsequent to that.


But that is not the issue. The issue is that Brian Deegan, as a former magistrate and a practising lawyer, raised the importance of there being a scheme in place to assist victims of terrorist attacks. This bill is a significant step forward in relation to that, as is the government's bill. But for goodness sake, let us all get together, sort this out in a collaborative approach and fix this up once and for all—sooner rather than later. I think Australians demand that of us.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:15):  It is good to participate in a debate where everybody agrees with the sentiments of the bill before the parliament. I am certainly one who will be supporting this bill, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, and I encourage all other senators to do the same. As I have listened to the debate this morning, I have heard many people relate particularly moving experiences. I thank Senator Xenophon for the brief but very important contribution he just made and I have to say I agree with most of what Senator Xenophon said.


It is clear that the coalition, the Labor Party, the Greens and the crossbenchers think that there is an important point in proceeding with legislation that provides for compensation. As I listened to the debate, I kept asking myself: if everybody agrees, why is it that the bill is not going to be passed because the Labor Party and the Greens will not be supporting it? I say to the Labor Party and the Greens: please, if you have a better bill, bring it forward, let us debate it, let us look at it and, as appropriate, let us move amendments. But let us get on and do something about it. If this bill is passed today, as I hope it will be, then we will be starting the process.


From what other speakers have said—and I was unaware of this until I heard the debate today—this process has been going on for in excess of two years now. It seems to me that in that time we have passed a series of 18 bills that will impose the world's biggest carbon tax on Australians. That very complex series of 18 pieces of legislation was guillotined through this parliament. We are all absolutely confident that there will be elements of those 18 pieces of legislation that will be challenged in the court—in fact we hear on the news today that the whole carbon tax parcel of legislation is going to be challenged because of the alleged unconstitutionality of it. 


The point I am making is that the government was able to draft, prepare and ram through both chambers of parliament 18 pieces of complex legislation in next to no time. I say 'next to no time' because we know Ms Gillard promised at the last election that there would be no carbon tax, so the Public Service, the draughtsmen, would have put that out of their mind. As is the wont of this government in relation to taxation matters, promises mean nothing. But the point I am making is that those 18 pieces of legislation were able to be prepared, drafted and rammed through parliament in a matter of months. Yet in respect of this piece of relatively simple legislation—everyone here has said it is not terribly complex and does not involve a great deal of money—for some reason which I do not understand the government seems to be procrastinating in bringing forward what Labor speakers have said is an excellent piece of legislation that will fix everything. 


If that is the case, why isn't it before the chamber today? Why aren't we dealing with it? It is a very simple question and I hope that someone might be able to answer it. If someone were able to indicate to me that the Labor government is bringing forward a piece of legislation that has been properly consulted upon and has been discussed with the opposition and the crossbenchers in a nonpartisan way, even without seeing it I would feel fairly confident that I would be supporting that piece of legislation as well. But despite, or perhaps because of, the procrastination of this government on that front, we now have a bill to assist victims of overseas terrorism before the parliament today which can be voted upon and, hopefully, adopted. I am very pleased to support this bill so we actually do move forward.


As Senator Xenophon indicated, there seems to be concern on the government benches that retrospectivity may cost $20 million and we do not know what this is going to cost in the future. I agree absolutely with Senator Xenophon when he says that all of us would hope that this will cost absolutely nothing. That would mean that in the future there will be no victims of overseas terrorism. But, if there are, we as a compassionate nation and a wealthy nation should be making provision for those who are victims of that terrorism.


Senator Xenophon mentioned a figure of $20 million. When you consider that this government is borrowing $100 million each and every day, $20 million to spend retrospectively on victims of terrorism seems to be a mere drop in the ocean. To oppose or not vote for this bill on the basis that it might cost $20 million seems to me to be foolish and disingenuous in the extreme.


This bill proposes, as other speakers have said, to establish a scheme to compensate Australian victims of overseas terrorist attacks. It is proposed that the scheme be similar to those that have long operated in Australian states and territories. State victim of crime legislation was rightly implemented decades ago. There is nothing new, there are no surprises, in how this legislation operates in the states and how it is funded. It seems to me disingenuous that, if the states could do this in years gone by, this federal government cannot bring forward a bill that is universally accepted to deal with an issue which everybody in this chamber agrees upon. So I urge senators to support the bill.


If for some reason the Labor Party thinks that it has a better bill, bring it on. Let us have it before the chamber. Let us see if it does need amendment. Let us move and debate amendments. Let us look at costings that the Public Service may have been able to bring forward. But, please, let us get on with it. Do not wait another two years before this issue can be addressed by this federal parliament. If nothing else, hopefully this bill will have said to the government: 'Look, get on it; don't procrastinate. You have been able to do it with taxing bills. When you want to raise taxes, you get those things very quickly through the parliament.' We are dealing with some of the most complex pieces of legislation in the Senate this afternoon with the mining tax bills—more taxing bills that the Labor Party is very able to prepare, to draft, to fund and to get before this parliament in a relatively short period of time; yet this bill, which by comparison is simple and not complex, seems to have the Labor government stalling. 


While I am speaking on this bill relating to victims of terrorism, can I just digress ever so slightly with the concurrence of the Senate to acknowledge the men and women of the Australian defence forces who do such a lot in the fight against terrorism. All Australians know that we are in the war in Afghanistan because it is a war against terrorism that we must win. We know it has the universal support of all Australians. The sorts of things that happened in New York on September 11, in Bali and elsewhere are abhorrent to any decent human being in this world. That is why in the case of Afghanistan we have gone to war to try and address terrorism and the root causes of terrorism and those people who would conduct terrorist activities and create death and mayhem and the victims which this bill is all about. It is the men and women of our defence forces who are the frontline in this war on terrorism in Afghanistan.


Speaking as a Queenslander and an Australian as well—I do not want to be partisan about the states—I come from a place up in the north of Queensland at Townsville where we have Australia's largest Army base. Daily we see the very fine individuals who constitute Australia's Army and Air Force and irregularly the Navy as it calls into Townsville to pick up troops and to deliver goods to the Lavarack Army base in Townsville. Our troops—our soldiers—our sailors and our airmen are the best in the world. Their training is impeccable. It is rigorous. They know how to conduct their warlike operations but at the same time be careful, as you have to be these days, of civilians who are in the area of conflict. That is no easy task. Our men and women do a fantastic job. I think all Australians recognise that. The increasing numbers that turn out at military parades on Anzac Day, Kapyong Day and Armistice Day are a testament to the fact that all Australians are attending not only to commemorate the event but also to give support to the troops of today who always participate in those commemoration services. The troops do a mighty job.


You will excuse me for being a little parochial as a Queenslander, but we do have Australia's largest Army base at Lavarack. We have two of Australia's finest training areas in Shoalwater Bay near Rockhampton and at High Range behind Townsville and also the jungle training up near Innisfail and the old Canungra training ground. I do not think it exists any more, but they do train around that area. We have Enoggera in Queensland, another very substantial Army base. We have one of the most significant Air Force bases in Amberley and again in Townsville at Garbutt, air bases with very long history. I am always proud to mention a fact not many people understand and that is that Australia's second largest east coast naval base is situated in Cairns in Far North Queensland. I would certainly hope that in the not-too-distant future, as Sydney Harbour gets more crowded and other activities intervene which make it less appropriate to have Australia's biggest naval base in the centre of Sydney, the naval base at Cairns will be expanded to accommodate more of the vessels that of necessity must leave Garden Island.


In this debate on victims of terrorism I acknowledge the great work that our defence forces do in defending us against terrorism by their activities overseas. I note an incident quite recently where, thanks to the good work of the security services and the police, a proposed terrorist attack on an Army base was thwarted. It shows, as other speakers have mentioned in this debate, how targeted Australians are and, I have to say, how targeted our Australian servicepeople are because of their excellence in combating terrorism wherever it occurs. I know, in those words of commendation and congratulations I offer to the men and women of our defence forces, there would not be a senator in this parliament who would disagree. I would like those troops to know that we as legislators and as parliamentarians acknowledge, respect and understand the great work that they do.


To get back to this bill: I think it is important that, if people are the victims of overseas terrorism, they should be compensated. If Australians are victims of criminal acts in Australia, they will invariably receive some compensation, some monetary benefit, from the state or territory government. It is not a lavish amount; it is not a sum of money that will enable people to live in luxury for the rest of their lives. But it is an important acknowledgement from our community of the abhorrent and completely unjustified pain and suffering of the victims.


This bill proposes a federal scheme that will be similar to the ones in place currently in the states and territories of Australia. The amount involved, as I was just saying, is not a huge amount—$75,000 is proposed. Nothing will overcome the loss, hurt or damage to body and soul that terrorism can cause to people, but it is a token that will help people get on with their lives and help the families of victims to get on with their lives. I think it is a bill that is long overdue and urge the Senate to support it.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (11:33):  I agree with the sentiments just expressed by Senator Macdonald. I think this, the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012, is a very important bill. It is very timely and it does address a very real problem in terms of compensating and helping to look after people who are the innocent victims of terrorism overseas. I commend the authors of this bill, who have recognised the importance of this issue and proposed to assist victims of overseas terrorism. Regrettably, in this day and age terrorism is much more prevalent around the world than it ever has been. We now live in the world of the urban terrorist who can plant bombs in parked cars and in rubbish bins, as we saw in Sydney many years ago when a bomb was placed in a garbage bin outside a hotel. In London there were the bombings on the buses and on the underground trains. There have been bombings in Spain and, of course, bombings closer to home in South-East Asia—in Bali, where we all recall the devastation which occurred following the bombings in 2003.


As it happens, that is the closest I have ever been to a terrorist incident. I was in Indonesia with a parliamentary delegation a week before the Bali bombings and visited Surabaya and East Java, nearby where, we later heard, the Bali bombings were in fact put together. So bombing from terrorism is not an issue that is unlikely to occur. There are terrorists in all parts of the world and, sadly, bombings and indiscriminate terrorist actions are now a factor which has to be considered when travelling.


This bill proposes the establishment of a framework to facilitate financial assistance for Australians—or their next of kin—killed or injured as a result of international terrorist acts. These may occur in hotels, in bars, in shopping centres, in trains, in buses and even in aircraft, as we know from the Lockerbie bombings, from the sad crash of that 747 and from the gentleman who was apprehended at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport with a bomb strapped to his underpants on Christmas Day a few years ago. That would have brought down an aircraft full of people. Acts of terrorism are now very common, very widespread and we all have to factor in the possibility of being a victim of terrorism when we travel overseas.


It is proposed that the framework of this bill will be administered by the Attorney-General's Department and that it will provide eligibility criteria for claimants of financial assistance. The financial assistance provided must be available to those who suffer or have suffered injury requiring hospitalisation as a result of an international terrorist act. In the event that such an act causes the death of a person, the assistance will be available to the person's next of kin. The proposal is that Australian victims of overseas acts of terrorism would each receive up to $75,000. The scheme is modelled on state and territory laws and schemes which provide compensation to victims of serious crime. It is proposed that the payment would be on a sliding scale, with more serious injuries receiving a higher payout—which is only right and proper. I heard some mention earlier in this debate that $75,000 as a maximum was not a great deal of money for somebody who has suffered a severe head injury, but it is at least a start and it would be very helpful, for example, to the widow of a victim who died from terrorist bombing in that it would enable a family to meet its financial commitments during the period of the immediate aftermath of such an incident.


I understand that over the past decade about 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism around the world, which is about 30 people a year. That is quite a significant number in the sense that it is indicative of the fact that overseas travel is no longer without risk. I think that 20 or 30 years ago we would not have taken into consideration the risk of terrorist action, but it is something we certainly need to do now. Using the average of 30 victims a year, the maximum payment of $75,000 would cost an estimated $2.25 million per annum, which is not a lot of money in terms of the federal government's budget. Of course, these payments would be only intermittent.


I think this is a very important and timely piece of legislation which does address a real need, and the people who have put this legislation together should be congratulated on seeing this need and addressing it. Having said that, however, I think it is very important that when people travel overseas they take as much trouble as they can to protect themselves and to provide cover for themselves should they be the victims of a terrorist act. Many people would know that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade these days has a Smartraveller scheme which enables a person who is travelling overseas to go to the DFAT website and enter their name and their itinerary so that if some incident occurs the department is at least aware that there may be Australians within the general area. That is a very important scheme and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be congratulated for establishing that scheme. I think that the existence of the Smartraveller website should be more widely known.


Another very important thing that people travelling overseas should do is to take out comprehensive travel insurance, because, whether it is a terrorist attack or an injury from other causes, medical treatment in other countries is often very expensive, and that often comes as a great shock to Australians, especially to those who need more sophisticated treatment, such as a period of time in an intensive care unit. In Australia that would be free of charge under Medicare in a public hospital, if you chose to be treated in a public hospital. In other countries, however, the cost of intensive care treatment can be horrendously expensive. I think that the risk, however small it may seem, of requiring that kind of treatment should be reason enough for everybody to take out comprehensive travel insurance. When you do so, it is very important to read the small print on the policy to make sure that the policy does provide for air evacuation to Australia if needed after an accident, injury or terrorist act. The cost of air evacuation can be very expensive. If it is done by scheduled airline, the companies that provide medivacs—medical air evacuations—have to occupy six or eight seats in the plane, which inevitably costs a fair bit of money. There are doctors and nurses who have to travel with the victim and often they have several teams of such people if the distance back to Australia is long. Coming from Europe, for example, at some point along the route there would be a second team of doctors and nurses put on the plane to look after the individual. It is very important for people travelling overseas to always have comprehensive travel insurance and to always read the finer details of the policy to ensure that they are getting the coverage they imagine they are getting when they buy the policy. It is very important to buy a policy from a reputable service provider. You can buy one online from some of the big international travel agencies and companies or from a local travel agent whom you trust and respect. 


I come back to the issue of international terrorism and particularly the assistance provided to the victims of overseas terrorism. As I said, terrorism is sadly now a fact of life in the modern world. We must always be aware of the danger of terrorism, particularly when going to Third World countries where there are political issues, to the Middle East, to Africa or to some parts of Asia. Some countries are much more risky to visit than others. Before travelling to such countries, it is important people go to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website and have a look at the travel warnings, which the department puts out on every country in the world to advise of the risk to individuals in travelling to those countries. There has been a need for this kind of compensation to be paid or to be available to the victims of overseas terrorism for some time. I am very pleased that this bill has been proposed. It fills an important gap and I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (11:46):  I too rise to speak in support of the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2012. Travellers, like soldiers, these days need to accept the risks. Neither soldiers nor travellers go overseas to be injured or to die, but these are risks that both soldiers and travellers must now accept as a potential reality. It is now on the notice paper, as it were, for our civilian population to think about preparation and to think about self-help in the event of a tragedy when travelling overseas. Initiatives of the sort that Senator Eggleston has just spoken about such as Smartraveller, travel insurance, self-help and good old commonsense when we are travelling overseas must be the very first steps.


This bill seeks to make appropriate and modest provision to Australians travelling overseas who are injured in a terrorist attack or, if they are killed, to their next of kin. It is very clear that the bill seeks to model itself upon the various states victim of crime legislation. Proposed section12(c) of the bill states:


In administering the framework, the Secretary is to ensure that:


…   …   …


(c)   procedures and practices established under … this Act and for the operation of the framework … are broadly commensurate with the procedures and practices established under State and Territory victims of crime compensation schemes.


After all, that is a very important part of the point. Were this domestic terrorism about which we are speaking, then people would be broadly compensated by states and territories victim of crime legislation. The only difference, and the tragic difference, is that we are talking in this bill about Australians travelling overseas who are targeted by ruthless terrorists because they are Australians, because of who they are and where they live. Terrorists do not necessarily care who else they get as collateral on the way through and they do not specifically care whether they get you or me, but they know that they will get some of us. In that respect, Australians travelling overseas have diminished control, if you like, as to whether they will suffer tragedy.


This bill seeks to be a modest and appropriate help in those cases. Senator Singh attempted to suggest, in referring to the introduction of a bill last year by former Attorney-General McClelland, that that bill was broadly consistent with this bill.

Senator JOYCE:
  Thank you, Mr President. There has already been an inquiry from the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, which has been reported. Recommendations from that inquiry on coal seam gas were hard fought for. By reasons that those recommendations were hard fought for and that the government reply to that inquiry has not yet occurred, to have another inquiry would diminish from the effort that we put in to get the recommendations that we sought. In those recommendations it was quite clear that we do not want coal seam gas on prime agricultural land, that aquifers must not be destroyed and must be protected and that the quiet enjoyment of residential areas must be respected. Additional comments were made by the National Party about getting a proper pecuniary return back to the landholder on whose place the coal seam gas is extracted.


What we see happening at this juncture is not so much an inquiry to assist with the process that is currently at foot but more of a political statement to create a wedge. The National Party will not be supporting this motion.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator WATERS:
  Thank you, Mr President. I would like to point out for the benefit of Senator Joyce and others in the chamber the differences between this proposed inquiry and the earlier inquiry; they are chalk and cheese. The first inquiry focused only on the Murray-Darling Basin; this inquiry is nationwide. It would look at all the impacts of coal seam gas, including shale gas in WA. It would also, importantly, look at the coastal impacts of coal seam gas export. We have seen the massive destruction in Gladstone Harbour and we have already had UNESCO, the world heritage body, here concerned about Gladstone and our reef. As well, we have seen 91 per cent of Australians not wanting the reef to be turned into a rubbish dump. There is clear community concern and clear need for the Senate to have better information about these issues.


This inquiry would also look in much closer detail at the climate impact of this industry, which is of course a fossil fuel, and therefore highly polluting. We would look at things like fugitive emissions and the overall life cycle greenhouse gas impacts of coal seam gas. This is new information that the Senate needs to inform itself with in order to tackle this massive fast-growing, hungry, dirty industry.


I find it incredibly disappointing that Senator Joyce is opposing looking at the impacts of coal seam gas. One wonders at the influences on Senator Joyce. I think it is a great shame when no-one in this parliament, except the Greens, is going to vote to examine the impacts of coal seam gas, which is an issue that the community is incredibly concerned about and will be very disappointed to learn about. I note that the Independents, of course, will sit with us, and I thank them for their support. The Australian public will not forget this and they certainly will not forget where Senator Joyce is when this vote comes.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:17):  I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech and statement of reasons incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech and statement read as follows—



The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 clarifies the application and operation of indexation arrangements in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. It updates the definitions for 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' and updates the Melbourne College of Divinity's name in light of its approval to operate under the title MCD University of Divinity. 


The Bill also allows for technical amendments to the calculation of the voluntary repayment bonus to resolve rounding issues.


There is ambiguity in the Act about the application of the indexation provisions to amounts in the Act on 1 January 2011. The Government is making it clear that indexation should have been applied to amounts in the Act on 1 January 2011, and that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts.


The terms 'Course of Study in Dentistry' and 'Course of study in Veterinary Science' are used to determine which students are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit of $112,132 in 2012.


The Bill would amend the definitions for 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' to clarify that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy the minimum academic requirements for registration as a dentist, veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner are eligible for the higher FEE HELP limit. 


The Melbourne College of Divinity has been approved by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority to operate under the name MCD University of Divinity until 31 December 2016.


Students can make a voluntary repayment towards their HELP debt to the Tax Office at any time. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more currently attract a 5 per cent bonus on the payment amount. 


When calculating the effect of a person making a voluntary repayment of his or her HELP debt, the Act provides for a person to obtain a 5 per cent bonus and includes rounding rules in calculating whether a person has repaid their debt and the amount of debt repaid if it is only a partial repayment.


Currently, the effect of the rounding rules is that: 


(a)   When making a full repayment, the person benefits from the rounding because the amount of payment required to pay off their debt in full is reduced because the cents are rounded down; and 


(b)   When making a partial repayment, the person is disadvantaged because the value of the reduction to the outstanding debt due to a payment is rounded down.


The Bill amends the Act to provide that when calculating the effect of a person making a partial repayment towards his or her HELP debt, the amount would be rounded up to nearest dollar. The cents would continue to be rounded down to determine the amount required for the full repayment of a person's HELP debt amount. Effectively, the rounding rules will now always benefit a person making a voluntary repayment.


The Bill reflects the Government's continued commitment to improving Australia's higher education sector and expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a high quality higher education.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:18):  We now have the third of the three Gs: we have had the GST under the Howard government, we have had the GFC and of course now we have the GBP, the government of broken promises. You will recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that this is the government that came in on the promise of honesty, transparency and, as Senator Collins knows, accountability. Do you remember Prime Minister Gillard saying, 'Let the sun shine in'? Well, it is the fact that it has been a very short summer here on the east coast and a very short summer of honesty, transparency and accountability. This is the government about whom the former Prime Minister, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and now backbencher, Kevin Rudd, said recently:


… Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people and …  if we don't change, the Labor Party is going to end up in Opposition.


This is also the government about whom the former Attorney-General Robert McClelland only recently said:


I don't think we have captured the attention or the support of the broader Australian community, and obviously if we want to win an election, they have to listen to us, they have to trust us, they have to have empathy with us …


This is not my side of the chamber saying this; this is the government side. Only last week I was at the Wagin Woolorama in the Great Southern region of WA. I overheard a mother scolding her daughter for telling porkies, and the little girl looked up and said, 'Why can't I? The Prime Minister can and the Prime Minister does.' She looked at me and I had no answer, of course.


But what day is it today? Is it carbon tax day? Of course, no; that was last week. But I will remind you of the words of this Prime Minister: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Her Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister said at the same time—amazingly enough, just before an election in 2010:


Well, certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation somehow that we are moving towards a carbon tax from the Liberals and their advertising. We certainly reject that.


So it is not carbon tax day. Is it audit compliance day? No, that was Wednesday. That was the day, if you remember, when we had the Australian National Audit Office undertaking an audit of none other than Ms Gillard as Minister for Education and reporting to the parliament that on more than three occasions Ms Gillard approved grants to schools in defiance of the recommendations of her department and also failed to undertake the requirement of the then Prime Minister to report her decision to the then Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What a great group of four it must have been. How wonderful to have sat around the table and listened to them agreeing with each other. But it does not stop with the Prime Minister, as is often the case, because most organisations learn from the top. News filters downhill more quickly than it does uphill. In that same audit report from the ANAO we learnt that there were no less than 33 cases where ministers failed to alert the finance minister to the fact that they had made grants in their own electorates—11 of those 33 instances against the advice of their own department.


But it is not carbon tax day; it is not audit compliance day; it is Thursday—it must be private health insurance broken promise day. Let me go back to then shadow minister Ms Julia Gillard writing in the Courier Mail:


YOUR correspondent Russell McGregor … should have no concern that Labor will ""erode"" or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed—


said Ms Gillard—


to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an ironclad guarantee of that on a number of occasions.


Is it any wonder that the little girl in Wagin, reflecting the rest of Australia, has lost all patience with this government and its credibility? Again, Ms Gillard, complaining in a newspaper, the Weekend Australian, in October 2005:


The truth is—


she wrote—


that I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate, and contrary … do not support such a claim.


We go from Ms Gillard to then shadow health minister Roxon—again, prior to an election—in 2007. This is what she said at the annual conference of the Australian Health Insurance Association: 'This is why we have committed to the current system of private health insurance incentives,' she said, 'including the package of rebates, the lifetime health cover, the surcharge. Labor understands that people with private health insurance, now around nine million Australians, have factored the rebate into their budgets, and we will not support taking it away.' She went further in September: 'We have committed to it. We have committed to the 30 per cent.' The journalist must have had some understanding of the future because she was asked again, 'So you will not wind back the 30 per cent private health rebate, despite the fact,' the journalist asked, 'that Labor has been ideologically opposed to it in the past?' And guess what her answer was? 'No we won't.' She went on to say: 'For many occasions for many months we have made it crystal clear we are committed to retaining all of the private existing health insurance rebates.' She went on to say: 'The Liberals continue to scare people'—doesn't this remind you of Mr Wayne Swan's comments about the carbon tax?—'into thinking that Labor will take away the rebates.' This, according to Ms Roxon, is absolutely untrue.


We then go to the leader of the then opposition, Mr Rudd, speaking to the same organisation, the Health Insurance Association, prior to the 2007 election. This is what he said: 'Both my shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year, that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.' And in February 2008, after becoming Prime Minister, he said: 


The Private Health Insurance Rebate policy remains unchanged and—


by way of emphasis—


will remain unchanged.


How much longer do we have to listen to these statements which we now know to have never been the intention of the government?


Just yesterday, we had the gross misfortune of listening to a tirade by Labor Senator Cameron, trying to vilify the then coalition government in terms of its expenditure and its commitment to health. Let me place these figures on record. It is an area, of course, in which you, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, have a particular and keen interest. Health and aged care spending: 1995-96, $19½ billion dollars spent by the Commonwealth government, increasing to $52 billion by 2007-08. Public hospital spending: 1995-96, $5.2 billion; 2007-08, more than double, to $12 billion. Funding to the states to support their health initiatives: 1993 to 1998, $23 billion; 1998 to 2003, a leap to $31 billion, and, in 2003 to 2008, $42 billion. And we continue to hear stupidity and nonsense from intelligent and otherwise honourable senators of the other side talking about the apparent billion dollars of Mr Tony Abbott when he was health minister. There never was $1 billion taken out of the health budget. It simply was a forward estimate in the forward papers of that era. There never was a $1 billion black hole by Mr Abbott.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  There never was, Senator Collins.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Well, he was planning—




Senator BACK:
  Let us go forward. Do not speak about—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—what people might have been planning to do; listen to the quotes I gave in the last few minutes from Ms Gillard, Ms Roxon and Mr Rudd. What were they planning to do? Heavens above!


We then learn that, under this government, in June 2010, the highly respected Professor John Mendoza resigned as chairman of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health. Why? Because of the lack of action of this government in the area of mental health. So it begs the question: why has Labor changed this policy?


There are several reasons. One is on the corner to my left: because it is driven by the Greens political party who want to see the destruction of private health. Another is: because of the massive budget blowouts of this government, because of the incredibly high levels of debt, because they know they are facing another deficit this year, as they will be next year. Let me just remind you: the last time Labor was in government in the Hawke-Keating era the coalition was left to repay a debt of $96 billion a year, then costing some $6 billion—thousand million—a year in interest alone. We know now that that figure is $230 billion, racing towards $250 billion. And this government continues to borrow $100 million a day, every day of the week—not the working week, the entire week. So if you want to start to try to ramp back, who do you attack? You attack hardworking, middle-class Australians.


But this is bad policy. Why is it bad policy? Let me give you the analogy of a pool—a pool of money—into which the government puts 30c of each dollar, that being the private health rebate. But on the other side of the coin, the person taking out that insurance puts in the other 70c. How smart is it to remove that 30c, or a proportion of it, only to have the private health insurer taking out either their 70c or a significant proportion of it by reducing their level of cover? Where is the validity of such a decision? We all know what happens to the pool of money—the pool dries up—and we know that it drives people back to an already overstretched public health system.


These are the facts. The private hospital system in this country currently treats 40 per cent of all patients, being more than three million a year, and, more importantly, performs over 60 per cent of surgeries. Six out of every 10 surgeries in this country are performed in the private hospital system. The Productivity Commission found that the private hospital network treats patients more cheaply and at least as safely as public hospitals, if not more safely. In 2007-08 the government spent $31 billion on the public health system and, in contrast, only $1.7 billion on private hospitals through the private health levies.


We are all acutely aware that we have a rapidly ageing population in this country. Why would we place at risk the medical and hospital care of an ageing population by removing the 30 per cent rebate? The very group that we will be driving out of private health are the young people of this community—the ones who draw least on the health system, be it private or public.


Let me give you some examples. We have heard from the current Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek, who has decided to demonise high-income earners and even middle-income earners who, she says, should not receive subsidies from the lower income areas of this community to support their private health insurance. The minister should be reminded that, as she well knows, there is already a 1.5 per cent Medicare levy on taxable income to support the public health system. Furthermore, if high-income earners fail to have public health cover they can add a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge to their payments to the community. There is the subsidy from higher income earners. Quick calculations: somebody earning $80,000 a year together with superannuation and fringe benefits who does not take out private health cover will be paying $2,000 per annum towards supporting Medicare. There is the support from higher income earners. Even if that person takes out private health, at 1½ per cent on their $80,000, they will be paying $1,200 in Medicare levy a year. As I was reminded recently, that taxable income includes overtime and zone allowances. What we are really doing is saying, 'The harder you work, the more overtime you work and the more you earn, the more you will be imposed with a levy.' This, apparently, is what this government wants to move towards.


Why is it so dangerous? Why is it such bad policy? As we know, older people in the community have the greatest demand and the greatest draw on the health system, and that is getting even greater. My understanding is that these figures are accurate: people under the age of 19 years would exercise about 15 per cent of the national health budget; from 20 up to 65 it is about a quarter, about 23 per cent; and from 65 onwards, 60 per cent of the nation's health budget is spent on that age demographic. The more we keep young people in private health, where they are not drawing on the need for health and hospital cover, the better it will be for older members of the community. The Labor government might say, 'Yes, but of course the reduction of the rebate is limited and therefore lower income people will be less disadvantaged.' The simple fact of the matter is that, as the pool of private health funding reduces, the inevitable outcome must be that premiums will go up and people will start to take a reduced level of cover, if they take out cover at all. These are the sorts of areas that we need to be addressing and that this legislation will strike right at the heart of.


We hear from Minister Plibersek that this is only a tax on wealthier people. It is an interesting statistic in Australia that one million-plus households earning less than $26,000 per annum take out private health cover. Private health is not something for wealthier Australians—it is across the board. It is something that young families, middle-aged families and families with younger children and teenagers engage in, and it is an area that older Australians value very deeply. Why does this government want to attack the very surcharge levy that it said it would never touch?


I come to the reaction from people in my own community of Western Australia regarding the feedback from the Hospital Benefit Fund, which is a not-for-profit fund. This is not a fund that is trying to extract vast sums of money from its members, it is one that pours its funds straight back into members' conditions. Already, HBF estimates that 25 per cent of its members will see a big hike in their premiums, and this will increase to 43 per cent. That is an increase in premiums for those who will be hardest hit. We know already that the funds are battling to keep their premium increases to a minimum. The Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek, has only recently approved an average increase of 5.06 per cent. Many members are already anxious about the implications of the removal of the rebate of up to 30 per cent.


Another point made to me by this organisation is the sheer complexity of the processes as they are now being presented to the parliament. The legislation, which applies a means test to the rebate and further complicates the Medicare levy surcharge, will only serve to compound this complexity. It will only serve to discourage those who are already planning to come into private health. It may also accelerate the move of those who now believe they cannot afford it or they must reduce their premium levels. These are great concerns. 


We have a wonderful health system in this country. We have a combination of public and private health care. There are all sorts of models. Models that would be best in this country have been put to me. These models suggest we move everybody into private health cover and then provide premium relief or payments for those unable to afford those premiums. We must continue to have competition to drive prices down, to keep quality up and, above all, we must do what we can to preserve and protect both the private health and the public health systems. This legislation is simply a grab for money. It is not about health policy. It should not be supported.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (12:38):  I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation. These bills will see the private health insurance rebate means tested and the Medicare levy surcharge increased for those who choose not to have private health insurance. The private health insurance rebate, a coalition initiative, saw private health insurance membership climb during the Howard years from 30 per cent in the 1990s to 47 per cent in 2008. On most recent industry figures, some 52.9 per cent of the Australian population have some form of private health insurance. The Howard government provided the incentive and increased the choice for individuals and families to take out private health insurance. I support a mixed public and private healthcare system where Australians have the choice to take out private health insurance. I also support the rebate for increasing the choices available to all of us.


Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. We should strive for improvement and for it to cost less. Our healthcare system is a delicately balanced mixture of public and private. In my home state of South Australia, with a population of just over 1.6 million people, there are some 1,008,334 holders of private health insurance, according to private health industry figures. However, the cost of providing health care continues to rise. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reveal that in the 10 years to 2009-10 health spending grew in real terms by an average of 5.3 per cent, compared with an average real growth in GDP of 3.1 per cent a year. Spending on health in Australia costs the Commonwealth, state and territory governments over $120 billion a year. Therefore, it makes sense to encourage wherever possible individual investment in our healthcare system through individuals' choices to co-invest in their own private health insurance. It simply makes no sense to remove the incentives for individuals and families to invest in their health provision.


Currently we have over 11 million private health insurance members who are contributing extra financial resources to the health sector, so that all Australians can benefit from a stronger health system. Both public and private must continue to co-invest. But rather than rewarding these members this legislation seeks to disincentivise this private investment in our healthcare system which could have some quite significant impacts over the next five years. Labor is pulling the rug from money that could be co-invested in our healthcare system.


We draw on research by Deloitte, which Senator Williams so succinctly drew on in this debate, that shows that up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their private hospital cover over five years, and up to 4.3 million will downgrade their hospital cover. A recent iSelect survey found 49 per cent of people would review their cover as a result of the rebate changes. Further, the Deloitte report found that by 2016 private health insurance premiums are expected to be 10 per cent higher than they otherwise would have been. The research also shows that between 2012 and 2016 an extra 845,000 Australians would be admitted to public hospitals as a consequence of these bills before us today. Deloitte estimates that the average waiting time in public hospitals would increase from 65 days to a staggering 259 days if no additional public capital investments were made in the next five years.


The impacts of this legislation are widespread. As one example, the Australian Physiotherapy Association claims that ancillary treatment cover, also known as general treatment or extras cover, pays rebates for visits to physiotherapists and other general providers such as dentists and podiatrists. A reduction in the number of Australians holding ancillary cover will reduce access to physiotherapy and other ancillary services which are, for the most part, not covered under the Medicare Benefits Scheme. According to the Physiotherapy Association, even if a small proportion of the current private health insurance members were to drop their ancillary cover, this could have a dramatic impact on the thousands of private physiotherapy practices around Australia, and that would be magnified in the regional and country areas.


In rural Australia we are already facing a number of serious problems in the health sector and country folk do not need the additional burden of having their private insurance health rebate ripped off them. Just as those living in the cities are facing cost-of-living pressures so are those in the bush, and the means testing of the rebate represents another increased cost to rural families. For example, there is already a chronic shortage of doctors. A rural doctors workforce agency report showed that 53 doctors needed to be recruited to fill vacancies in rural South Australia alone to meet the growing demand. With all this mining going on in regions, and we are all very proud of it and all very keen for it, we actually have to service it as well. Service means doctors, and we do not need doctors' incomes being undermined by the pulling of this rebate.


Add to this the growing trend of an ageing workforce. One hundred and five out of the 423 rural GPs are over 55 years old and expected to retire within the next 10 years. In my own home town of Clare there has been a position for an obstetrics trained GP vacant for the past four years. Some people are waiting more than five weeks to see their GPs! What these people do not need is to have more money removed from their pockets when they already have average access to health services. The government's co-investment in health is and should remain paramount. Governments cannot 'rat' the budget to achieve fickle surpluses over on the economic side of their problematic government.


While only a third of all hospital beds are private, 40 per cent of hospital admissions and 64 per cent of elective surgery admissions are private. Out of the hospital network, 86 per cent of all dental services are delivered in the private sector. Clearly, the private sector has an important role to play in delivering health services to Australians under our public-private health care system. In 2010 the Productivity Commission acknowledged that private hospitals were on average more efficient than public hospitals. It also found that smaller public hospitals, many of which are located in more remote communities, were found to be less efficient than similar-sized private hospitals. Therefore, any policy change that reduces funding to the private sector, which means-testing the private health insurance rebate will do, will mean underfunding the most efficient hospitals in our country.


Even the South Australian state Labor government acknowledged the role of the private sector in supporting the entire health system. Way back in 2004 a background paper, 'Challenges for health services in rural, regional and remote South Australia: achieving better health outcomes' said:


Private in-patients in public hospitals significantly contribute to the revenue of public hospitals, as private health insurers pay costs to the public hospital just as it would to a private hospital—


It is not complicated. This basic analysis does not change over the years! That whole proposition still remains in play in 2012.


While Labor preach that this is about a fairer health system and use divisive rhetoric that private health insurance is for rich people only, some 5.6 million of the 12 million private health insurance holders have a household income of less than $50,000 per year. Clearly, private health insurance is seen as an essential part of a household's expenditure and highly valued by a significant number of Australians. While all of these households will not have the rebate removed, they will feel the impact of the changes ripple through as a result of those people who have been slapped with a rise in their health cover drop their private health insurance and premiums begin to rise. It just makes sense. Insurance is always about the money pool. If you have more people contributing, the less they have to contribute. You take people out of the pool, then the cost of cover will always increase for the remaining participants. All this on top of the extra cost of living with the introduction of a ridiculous carbon tax! 


The Labor Party and Greens continue to peddle the concept that cleaners should not subsidise millionaires' private health insurance. In reality, however, low-income earners pay no tax, or very little tax, and are not subsidising high-income earners' private health insurance. The top quarter of income earners pay two-thirds of the total tax. It is just another shadowy attempt to vilify those who see in Australia the hope, reward and opportunity the coalition sees.


Now we see private health fees set to rise by another 5.06 per cent, which equates to an additional $150 a year extra for families. This means that some families will be slapped with a double-hit—higher premiums for private health insurance and less or zero government assistance via the rebate. And of course, health costs are also expected to rise because of the impact of higher energy costs associated with the carbon tax. The Treasury modelling claims health services will only rise by 0.3 per cent, but it seems inevitable that costs for patients will rise as energy, catering, key medical supplies and other input costs increase. Not only will there be pressure on the public hospital sector, but private hospital providers will also face a likely 16 per cent hike in their energy bills, all of which is likely to be passed on to consumers and patients. Where else can the pain be transferred?


Labor talk about their fairer health care, but their poor policy choices will only result in more expensive health care for all Australians and, unfortunately, it will be those on lower incomes, working Australians whom Labor claim to represent, who will be the hardest hit.


In my home state, the state where I live, where has the Labor member for Wakefield been on this issue? As a man who knows what it is like to be a working person—being a former salesman, cleaner and a trolley collector—he should understand.




Senator Boyce:
  What—not a union rep?




Senator EDWARDS:
  He did finish up there, but this is his earlier life. However, he has supported the Gillard government's continued assault on health care through means testing the rebate and the carbon tax. We have not heard a single utterance on private health insurance from the local member who is responsible for a seat where there are doctor shortages right throughout his rural communities. The Lyell McEwin Hospital, a very important hospital in Elizabeth Vale at the southern end of Wakefield, and the other hospitals in the electorate in Balaclava, Clare, Kapunda and Gawler are all facing substantial increases in electricity, catering and medical supply costs. The member for Wakefield, Mr Champion, certainly has not been a champion on health care for the 155,000 working men, women and children of Wakefield. The member of the House of Representatives who does not live up to his surname recently demonstrated how broken promises are the hallmark of the Labor government. The member for Wakefield last month was only too happy to stand on the same platform as his Prime Minister and welcome Ms Gillard to his electorate, nodding at every word she said when the television cameras were operating, yet within 48 hours this same individual abandoned the Prime Minister to support Kevin Rudd's leadership bid.




Senator Bernardi:
  I was appalled.




Senator EDWARDS:
  That was quite shocking, Senator Bernardi. He witnessed all this going on in his home state. 




Senator Bernardi:
  I was appalled.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Appalled. A man whom he wanted to support, Kevin Rudd—




Senator McLucas:
  Mr Rudd.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Rudd—in his effort for leadership bid was described by some of his parliamentary colleagues as a 'psychopath'. So much for what passes for judgment within the parliamentary Labor Party. This is the same mob that tried to foist Mark Latham onto the people of Australia, then Kevin Rudd, and now they want Australians to believe—




Senator McLucas:
  Mr Rudd.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Kevin Rudd—and now they want Australians to believe that they can improve the private health system with a means test on the rebate. They might also try to get pigs to fly. Sadly, as is so often the case with Labor, this legislation represents yet another broken promise. Labor failed to have similar legislation passed in the Senate in May 2009 and again tried and failed in November of the same year. This was despite a commitment to not change the private health insurance rebate.


Let us face it: these bills are more about the ideological obsessions of the Labor Party. Because of their socialist DNA, they have a hatred of private enterprise. What pushes their collective button is the redistribution of wealth, taking it away from those families who work hard and smart to get ahead so that Labor can reward its camp followers, those who expect everybody else to pay for them. The ALP's contempt and disdain for private health funds is obvious. Class warfare is alive and well and, whenever Labor gets the chance to target the private sector, it does so. It is a big target for the Labor Party.


The ALP in 2012 has two themes: tax and spend. The thrust of its revenue gathering is to make those who largely do not vote for Labor pay more, yet in its smug arrogance that it knows better than others it does not seem to have dawned on the Gillard-Greens alliance that any exodus from the private funds because of the higher fees will lead to the overwhelming of the public hospital system.


I do not support these three bills because they will ultimately lead to an erosion of our healthcare system for everyone—increased health insurance premiums, increased demand on our already strained public system, reduced accessibility to ancillary services, increased cost-of-living pressure on individuals and families, and decreased choice for all Australians. These bills are not about better health outcomes. This is a cash clawback to fund Labor's growing and increasingly fanciful budget surplus and to cover up for their financial mischief in other areas. I will not be supporting these bills. I urge all members of the Senate not to support these bills in the interests of keeping health care in this country growing and improving for all Australians.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (12:58):  It is interesting that the government seems to think that putting 'fair' in front of a bill title somehow makes it so. We have the Fair Work Act, which in the coalition was referred to as the so-called Fair Work Act because it is only fair in the term of this government.




Senator Carol Brown:
  Work Choices, no choices.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Order! I remind senators on my right that shouting across the chamber is not parliamentary.




Senator BOYCE:
  Nevertheless, no matter how much protesting goes on from the other side, putting 'fair' in front of the title of a bill does not make the bill fair. It has been interesting to watch the development of these so-called 'fairer private health insurance incentives' bills over the three attempts to have them passed, the third of which is now being made by this government. It has ratcheted up from being allegedly good policy in the first place, through a number of iterations, to now, where the situation is the government using the politics of envy as the only reason why this legislation would be a good thing. Of course, they cannot talk about the real reason they need this legislation: they are desperate for cash, having wasted and mismanaged a surplus and having now got themselves in a situation where they have an accumulated budget deficit of $167 billion. What on earth are they going to do about it other than play semantics around the word 'fairer' and rip money in an erratic way out of any cash cow they see lying around? We do not know and, unfortunately, the Australian people do not know, but the Australian people are getting very sick of it.


Both Ms Gillard and Ms Plibersek have used the example of the poor apprentice subsidising the frontbencher, the millionaire or the billionaire through the Medicare rebate. It is quite true that irrespective of your income you get the same rebate, set at 30 per cent by the Howard-Costello government. It was deliberately set at that so there was no unfair advantage for people on high incomes over those on lower incomes. Of course, what Ms Gillard and Ms Plibersek neglect to mention when they paint their little scenario of the poor apprentice subsidising the rich frontbencher or rich minister is that everyone pays a 1½ per cent Medicare levy which is based on income; so, the more money you have, the more you pay in the levy. If you want the real picture of how health is funded in this country, you need to include both figures. No-one has any objection whatsoever to the Medicare levy being set as a percentage of income, but to try to pretend that that is a completely separate and different issue from the private health insurance rebate in terms of funding health in Australia is ridiculous and arcane.


We then move on to the grand advocates of the politics of envy, Senator Cameron and Senator Thistlethwaite, who would have you believe that only people who are millionaires and billionaires have private health insurance. It would be lovely if there were 11 million-plus millionaires and billionaires in Australia, but there are not. There are 11 million people, however, who have private health insurance, and very few of those are millionaires and billionaires. I am sure that, if the government would like to rejig this legislation so that it only applied to millionaires and billionaires, they would have no disagreement on passing it. But they want to just pretend somehow that it is not everyday Australians who have private health insurance and have it for very good reasons. They often go without in other areas so that they can have private health insurance, and they are prepared to pay the costs involved in having private health insurance. As Senator Edwards pointed out so well, if the number of people with private health insurance drops substantially, the effects on public health and public hospitals are going to be extraordinary. It is going to cost vast amounts more money. It is going to put waiting lists out extraordinarily. It is going to affect all health professionals. It is going to affect the availability of health professionals and the number of people going into professions if there is not sufficient work to make a profit.


As I said, half of Australia's 11 million privately insured people have incomes of less than $50,000. Last time I looked, that did not constitute a millionaire or a billionaire. Of those people, 3½ million have an income of less than $35,000. But the costs will continue to rise for everyone who remains in private health insurance if the government persists with their so-called fairer system.


It seems quite illogical and a little difficult to understand how on earth taking 2½ million people out of the rebate system will assist the development of private health in Australia. I listened with interest to the figures that Senator Edwards gave us on the effects on the public health system that will follow. I do not think the government care about that. I think we have here an ideological issue. Concerns about how the public health system cope are not their problem. They do not want to know how successful or efficient the private health system is; they just want to work out ways to diminish it and get rid of it—and at the same time find themselves a little bit of money to try to fix up the deficit mess they have got themselves in. There was, of course, argument. I was part of the inquiry the first time these bills came before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which seems a long time ago now.


The modelling from the government says there will only be 27,000 people dropping their cover as a result of these changes. Some of the academics that the government lined up to follow on from this described private health insurance as 'sticky': people do not want to let go of it. No, people do not want to let go of it, but push them far enough and they will have to let go of it because the costs will rise. So the government say only 27,000 people will drop out, but Treasury, of course, did not do any modelling for them, because they did not want to know what the real answer was. But their own insurer, Medibank Private, has said that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. That is what the government's own private health insurance body says. If you look at the Deloitte figures, they say that in the first year you would expect 175,000 people to drop their private hospital cover and 583,000 to downgrade their cover. They say that, over five years, 1.6 million people will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. They say—and this is where, irrespective of whether you earn $35,000 or not—private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. We are looking already, right now, at increases in private health insurance premiums averaging about five per cent, so we are talking about 15 per cent. Deloitte's analysis says there will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs in the public hospital system as a result of these people dropping out of private hospital cover. They say that 2.8 million people with general treatment cover will withdraw and 5.7 million will downgrade over five years. And yet, of course, the grand experiment of this government continues in terms of ideological fixing. 


We have not even yet spoken about the broken promises aspect of this legislation. On a quick count, there are at least seven examples of Ms Roxon, as Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Gillard before that and then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promising absolutely that there would be no change to private health insurance rebates. Ms Gillard, as the shadow minister for health in September 2004, said, 'I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.' It is funny that she has somehow not quite managed to do that. In October 2005 she said: 'The truth is that I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate. For all Australians who wanted to have private health insurance, the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an ironclad guarantee.' It goes on, of course, right up until 2009—almost on the eve of the introduction of this legislation, when the then health minister, Ms Nicola Roxon, said, 'The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.'


Not long after the election of the Rudd government, I had a phone call from a woman who had been solemnly promised by the Labor policy secretariat that there would be no changes to the baby bonus. And yet, less than nine months—and the number is, of course, relevant—after that, the baby bonus was cut for couples over a certain income. Again we had the fallacy that somehow people with annual incomes over $50,000 are rich.


The other question that arose during the inquiry into this legislation was: if this legislation were to pass, how would health insurance companies know whether you were entitled to a rebate or not? How is that to be done? Is every Australian supposed to ring their insurer and say: 'My income for the year will be X amount. So tell me: do I get the rebate or do I not get the rebate?' Are we actually suggesting that, without any sort of coverage in the legislation—there certainly were not any answers available at the inquiry—I have to give my income to a health insurer? Is that what we are suggesting would happen? There was a vague suggestion during the inquiry that perhaps it could be done in blocks: 'Do you earn between $50,000 and $6,000' or whatever. I am sorry, but why should any Australian have to give that figure to a health insurer? It is a matter of privacy and there are no restrictions or regulations around how that would happen. Yet again we have this government getting yet more data collected up on people all over the country, for no good reason except to satisfy their own ideological whims.


I have mentioned already how the costs of private health insurance will rise because there will be fewer people, there will be fewer healthier people, in private health insurance. It would seem axiomatic, but apparently it is not, to this government. We have also recently had reports from Sinclair Knight Merz on the cost of the carbon tax for hospitals in Australia. They say that the carbon tax will add $100 million a year to health sector energy bills. In some areas the health sector is a very high user of energy. Other than that, it uses energy at similar rates to the commercial sector, with lights needing to run 24 hours a day in most parts of hospitals. You have the idea that key hospitals will have an extra $1 million-plus put onto their energy costs. So hospital costs will go up, and ambulance costs and cemetery costs are also going to rise as a result of the carbon tax, and this will come out across the board. The head of Ramsay Health Care, which is Australia's largest private hospital provider, said that they can see no way out of this except to pass on these cost increases. They expect that there will be a 16 per cent increase in their energy costs by 2013—and that is 66 private hospitals. There is no reason to think that this would not apply to the majority of hospitals, be they public or private, across Australia. Perhaps instead of stopping the poor apprentice from having to subsidise the wealthy frontbencher, this will end up being the poor apprentice subsidising the government's carbon tax, irrespective of whether they use public or private hospitals.


We are looking at a tsunami of cost increases. If public and private hospital costs are to rise and if people outside the mining industry are already suffering from a very depressed job market and depressed growth market, then, surely, what we need here is incentive for people to stay in private health, not sticks to drive them out and especially not sticks disguised as fairer ways of doing anything. There is absolutely nothing fair about this legislation except that it very fairly reflects this government's attempts to use the politics of envy to bludgeon their way through with ideology that is designed to stop incentive amongst individuals in Australia and designed to attack the private sector in every industry. I am happy to join the coalition in opposing these bills.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:16):  I again rise to speak on the policy behind the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation. Again I oppose it. Just a few minutes ago, I had a meeting with representatives of the Australian Physiotherapy Association. What they said to me was that they are very concerned about this bill because of the effect it will have on ancillary cover, such as physiotherapy. The concern is that many Australians, because of the ham-fisted way this bill has been structured, will end up dropping out of their ancillary cover. They will still stay within a private health scheme in order not to be penalised with this carrot and stick approach, but, because of the lack of the rebate, they will cut back on their cover. Where will they cut back on their cover? On ancillary cover: physiotherapy, optometry, occupational therapy and a whole range of associated services will be left behind. Australians will not get the additional help they need on a whole range of preventative health measures, such as seeing a dietician or getting psychological help for stress. These are the sorts of things that will suffer as a direct result of this bill.


I fear this bill will have all sorts of unintended consequences for all Australians and their access to health care. One of the challenges in health is getting the right funding mix between government, private health insurance, individual out-of-pocket payments and third-party payments, all of which are important parts of our health system. It is about equilibrium and achieving an equilibrium that gives all Australians access to affordable, high quality health care. I firmly believe that private health insurance plays an important part in the mix of health funding and the delivery of health services and that as many people as possible should have access to the highest quality and affordable health care. I believe this is best achieved by the right mix of private and public health care. 


I note that 45 per cent of Australians hold some form of private health insurance cover and in my own state of South Australia that number is in the order of 56 per cent. That makes a bill such as this very important as it has the potential to affect a lot of people and the decisions they make about their private health cover. The government has advocated means testing the current 30 per cent rebate on health cover on the basis of equity and sustainability. But let us analyse that. I strongly support a healthcare system in Australia that is equitable and accessible for all Australians and sustainable to the taxpayer. I do not believe that the government's proposal to means test the rebate and create a tiered health system will achieve this outcome. Rather it will create a lopsided system and damage the equilibrium between the public and private health systems. We must always be wary of unintended consequences.


As I have said before, what makes private health insurance accessible and affordable for many Australians is the 30 per cent rebate. There are many Australians below average weekly earnings who sign up to private health cover because they can see the important benefit for them. Most Australians on an average salary would struggle to afford private health insurance, especially during times when so many are struggling to balance the family budget and so many are worried about job security. Health is not something that can be taken for granted. You can see that in the almost 50 per cent of Australians who do what they can to budget for private health insurance for their wellbeing and that of their families. 


In December 2009 the Productivity Commission released its report examining comparative hospital and medical costs for similar procedures in public and private hospitals, the rates for fully informed financial consent, relative performance indicators and most appropriate form of indexation. That report arose from an agreement I reached with the government when I raised concerns about the lack of information about how our health system worked, about comparative funding and even basic information on health outcomes, particularly on comparisons between the public and private systems. That was in the context of the Medicare surcharge legislation at the end of 2008. That was at a time when the way I voted did make a difference on the outcome of some legislation and I am pleased to have been able to secure that concession from the government. I thought it was a very good and valuable exercise in informing public policy in this area.


We need to reflect on some of the aspects of the Productivity Commission report. That report made it clear that both the public and private systems work best side by side. The report says:


The strength of interaction between the two sectors—


that is, public and private—


has led some to describe them as ‘interdependent’ … reflecting the fact that the services and functions of each sector help to support the other. The interaction between the sectors may be demonstrated by, for example: the sharing of resources in co-located establishments; medical staff working across both sectors and the exchange of spillover benefits (the private sector benefiting from the public sector’s investment in medical training and research).


The AMA's submission to the commission's report summarises this well in saying:


… the plural nature of the public and private hospital system is one of the strengths of Australia's health system. It is readily apparent that taxpayer sourced funding cannot bear the whole load of financing health care … Australia gets its best result when the two sectors have a strong symbiotic relationship …


My concern is that that strong symbiotic relationship will be frayed and could well be damaged beyond repair as a result of these proposed changes.


At the time of the report there were 768 public hospitals and 556 private hospitals in Australia, providing 4.7 and 3.1 million episodes of care respectively for admitted patients in 2007-08. It is a delicate balance between the two, with their services often being complementary. For example, public hospitals handled around three-quarters of all medical separations—that is, episodes of care—while private hospitals performed around 60 per cent of all surgeries and nearly 70 per cent of other procedures in 2007-08. Around 95 per cent of outpatient occasions of services, including emergency department presentation, were handled by public hospitals, while nearly two-thirds of elective surgery separations were performed by private hospitals. I think these examples show just how much the public health system needs the private health system side by side and vice versa. If even some of that demand shifted to public hospitals then before long something would have to give.


Public hospitals do a great job in providing acute care and a whole range of other care but, the more pressure you put on them, the result will be longer and longer waiting times in areas such as elective surgery and for the ancillary cover, as the Australian Physiotherapy Association quite rightly pointed out. This is a clear example of how private and public health systems do complement each other to provide better health care for Australians, and it is an equilibrium that could be put at risk if the means-testing of the current 30 per cent rebate results in people pulling out of or downgrading their private health insurance. Back in 2009, when the government first announced means-testing the 30 per cent rebate, the Treasury projected that as a result of the policy change 225,000 high-income consumers would withdraw from private cover. My concern is that higher premiums mean less affordable cover for all people, resulting in fewer people having access to private cover and putting more pressure on the public system.


The government has argued that this 25,000 figure from Treasury is inconsequential, that it would have no significant impact on the numbers of people with private health insurance cover. But the modelling that this is based on has not been tested and is not transparent. The assumptions have not been spelt out. It does not consider just how price-sensitive people are when it comes to the cost of their private health insurance going up. Also, there is no modelling at all when it comes to the issue of ancillary cover. We can explore this, I hope, in the committee stage, but if the Australian Physiotherapy Association tells me—and I accept fully what they say to me—that there is no modelling on the impact on ancillary cover then how on earth is this going to be modelled in terms of the impact it will have on the public system? How many more people will be queuing up to get physiotherapy and occupational therapy and to get advice from dietitians and psychologists—a whole range of health professionals in the public system—because people will drop out of the private system, at least in terms of ancillary cover?


Getting the policy settings right on public health insurance is very important. Sadly, the government seems more interested in getting its budget in the black by, in effect, putting household budgets in the red. The government really needs to seriously consider the consequences of this bill. I note that a number of my colleagues have mentioned Deloitte's research. Deloitte produced its report for the Australian health insurance alliance—so it is a report for an industry group, and that needs to be taken into account. But I think it is fair to say that Deloitte as a consultancy service is well respected and has done some rigorous work in this field, and the onus is on the government to rebut it. I think that what Deloitte has put up is very compelling. It talks about the fact that in the last full financial year, 2010-11, private health funds have paid $12.4 in benefits towards the health care of 11.7 million Australians who hold some form of private health cover. That is no small amount of money or people. Just imagine if significant numbers of those people—even 10 per cent—withdrew from private health cover or downgraded their cover. 


Let us consider the picture that Deloitte has painted. Deloitte estimates that in the first year of a means-tested rebate, 175,000 people will withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 538,000 will downgrade. In addition, Deloitte estimates 554,000 people will withdraw from general treatment cover and another 803,000 will downgrade. Over five years, Deloitte estimates that 1.6 million people will withdraw from private health insurance and a further 4.3 million will downgrade their cover. Further, people who withdraw from their private health cover are less likely to have claimed healthcare benefits than those who choose to remain.


As people withdraw from their private cover, they become more reliant on the public healthcare system. Or, worse still, they just do not seek help, which can have catastrophic consequences for the health of those individuals. Between 2012 and 2016, Deloitte estimates 845,000 additional separations will need to occur in public hospitals as a consequence of the means-testing of the rebate. This translates to $3.8 billion in additional operating costs over five years to the public health system, with $1.4 billion in the fifth year alone. That is not a pretty picture for the future of Australia's health care system. As Deloitte says in its report:


As people withdraw from private health insurance, the burden on publically provided healthcare rises. The findings indicate that the cost of treating consumers in the public hospital system are expected to rise substantially above what is currently anticipated by Government.


These numbers I have just mentioned are staggering and highlight that, if people leave the private health system, the burden on public health care does not just rise; it escalates. We have a government that wants to get its budget in the black by in effect putting household budgets in the red.


I know the government disputes the findings of the ANOP/Newspoll survey that Deloitte's figures are based upon, but I think Rod Cameron and ANOP/Newspoll are well respected in terms of the work that they do. It is a prospect we need to seriously consider, especially when Deloitte is such a well-respected and reputable firm. A more pressured public health system with less affordable private health cover is a serious matter. It is a recipe for policy failure within a healthcare system that is neither equitable nor sustainable—the very opposite of what the government says it is trying to achieve. The government might mention that the predictions of people dropping out due to the Medicare surcharge legislation back in 2008 did not come to fruition. That is the case because the legislation was significantly amended. I think in a way that was tempered; it did not push those price sensitivity points, in a sense, with the Medicare surcharge legislation. I can foreshadow, in case we do not have time to properly debate this bill in the committee stage, that I will be moving an amendment, which I will now briefly outline. My idea for this amendment came to me after an ABC journalist at the Senate doors one morning was grilling me about whether or not I would support an independent body for collecting information on the composition of health funds, which I think I alluded to. George Roberts was the journalist, and I am not sure that the ABC wants to be pulled into policymaking, but I am grateful to Mr Roberts for his question because it has led to me having an amendment drafted, which I will name the 'Roberts amendment,' which probably horrifies Mr Roberts.


The amendment I propose is that the Productivity Commission, in its independ­ence, reports annually on the composition of private health funds. It is vital that we know from an independent source just how many people drop out of private health insurance or reduce their cover as a result of means-testing the 30 per cent rebate. I believe that the Productivity Commission is well placed to do this, particularly given its previous report that comprehensively looked at the mix between the public and the private health systems. By reviewing annually the composition of health fund membership we will be able to see precisely just how many people drop out or downgrade their membership. It is almost a rule of public policy that there will always be unintended consequences, and in this case it is important that these consequences be monitored, because I believe they could well be severe. That is why it is essential to have the Productivity Commission take on the role of monitoring the impact of these changes.


My question, respectfully, to the government will be: if the government does not support the amendment in its current form, what assurances can it give to this place, to the people of Australia, that there will be a mechanism to monitor the number of people dropping out or downgrading their cover? The downgrading of cover is where I think the sting is in the tail with this piece of legislation and the impact it will have. I would be grateful if the government could provide me with a comprehensive answer in relation to that. Surely there must be some responsibility mechanism, an independent and robust mechanism, to determine what the impact will be.


I believe we owe it to the Australian people to not take risks with their health but to give Australians the options they need to get the best possible health care and to give Australians a healthcare system where private and public work side by side in a symbiotic relationship, complementing each other to achieve the best health outcomes. This legislation does not do that.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-03-15,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:32):  I always think that the Australian people are very positive and are always looking for the bright light at the end of the tunnel. They have a positive outlook on the future of Australia, which is why they get so incredibly frustrated and disappointed that this Gillard-Rudd-Smith-Shorten-Carr-Greens-Independent Labor government keep giving the Australian people such bad policy. I had better correct that. I was referring to Senator Bob Carr and not Senator Kim Carr; Senator Bob Carr is clearly the smart one.


We have the Australian people in the situation where the government is continuing to foist upon them bad policy. It is happening time and time again. As I travel through mostly regional communities, there is a sense of a lack of confidence in this government that it can actually deliver anything properly for this nation. As somebody said to me the other day, 'This Labor government is choking this country,' and it is. It is doing it because there is so little good policy, substantive policy, that we see coming from the government. This private health insur­ance legislation is absolutely no different.


Isn't it interesting, colleagues, that on the other side of the chamber with the Labor government over there and in the other place, they are continuing to harangue the coalition and harangue the leader, Tony Abbott, about being negative and about saying no. If the government could at any stage give us some good policy for the Australian people, we would not have to keep saying no. The only reason we are saying no is because the government continue to give us such bad, ill-thought-through policy on the run. We only have to look at the private health insurance legislation before us to see yet another example of this.


It is just stupidity to take away the incentive and place an impost on the Australian people which is going to lead to them dropping their private health cover and is going to push them into the public system. That is just completely stupid. The public system is already completely overloaded. I take my hat off to the men and women, the doctors, the nurses and staff, in our public health system who work so hard in very, very difficult situations. But here we have a government that is planning on making it more difficult for those health workers, making it more difficult for the public system to cope because it is planning to put more pressure on that system through the people who are going to leave private health insurance. It is just completely illogical for the government to come up with a policy that says, 'We're going to make things even worse for the public health system.' The health system cannot bear any more; it is at stretched point. There is no doubt about that.


What else are we going to see? We see a deterioration of the risk pool. What is that going to do? That is going to increase premiums for those still remaining in private health insurance. The government come up with arguments that they think are appropriate for why this should be happening, but at the end of the day it is going to put costs up for those people who are going to remain in the private health system. It is interesting, isn't it? We often see the Labor government implying that private health insurance is for the rich. It is not. It is actually for people who are taking the opportunity to make sure that they have the financial support they need at times when their health is at risk. That makes sense, and that is why we brought it in in the first place. But this government is prepared to say that private health insurance is for the rich.


It is interesting: 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000, and 3.4 million have an annual household income of less than $35,000. I know that the government will argue that that does not apply under the changes. But it does. By association, by those risks that are put in place, the costs are going to go up for people remaining in private health insurance, because of the critical mass of people who will now shift out of private health insurance into the public system. Those people will be affected, and they will be affected quite badly. So for the government to say in any way shape or form that those people are not affected is simply untrue.


When we look at the Medicare system and how it is going to be impacted by this, it is just extraordinary that the government clearly does not realise what the impact of this is going to be. I take Senator Xenophon's point that he made earlier about unintended consequences. I think that there are going to be many. Coming back to my initial point, the government is simply not thinking through policy properly. And, as Minister Conroy has just joined us, the NBN is a classic example of policy that has not been thought through properly—but I will get to that a little bit later.


I also just want to touch on another point that Senator Xenophon raised, about ancillary cover. This is the importance of allied health and the fact that the work has not been done to see what the impact is going to be from the resultant changes on those who have ancillary cover now. This is a real problem. It is going to be a real issue, particularly for regional communities, where getting access to allied health is a real problem, as my good colleague Senator Macdonald would know very well. So what impact is this change going to have on the provision of those services, particularly to people in regional communities?


I doubt that the government has an answer. Perhaps, if we have time, during the committee stage we may be able to get some kind of response from the government—perhaps a few moments here or there, seeing that they are keen on guillotining just about everything at the moment. But what impact is that going to have? I suspect that the government have absolutely no idea what that impact is going to be. I suspect that the government have not even considered it, because it has become quite obvious over many months and years of Labor government now that the government simply do not understand regional Australia. They do not understand the impact that their bodgie, ill-thought-through policies are having, particularly on our regional communities.


When we look at the changes and the direct analysis of what this is going to do, there are going to be 2.4 million people directly affected with the immediate increases in the premiums at 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent in the respective income tiers for those under 65. Isn't that interesting? Reflecting on what I said before, I will just quote the shadow minister, Peter Dutton, because I think he put it very clearly: 'There are 12 million Australians who have private health insurance. It is not the playground of the rich, because, of that 12 million, almost six million people are on incomes of less than $50,000, and over time everybody's premiums will go up if you drive the healthy and the young out of private health insurance.' It says it all, really, and the government clearly do not understand that implication. They clearly have no understanding, even though the government owned insurer, Medibank Private, predicted 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and that 92½ thousand will downgrade.


I know that many of my colleagues have quoted the Deloitte analysis, but I think it is worth while doing it again. In the first year, 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 to downgrade it. Over five years, 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. Private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be, there will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system and there will be $4.6 billion in revenue removed from the private sector as a result of consumers withdrawing and downgrading their private health cover.


How can anybody look at those facts and think that this is any kind of sensible, balanced, well-thought-through policy whatsoever? You cannot. You simply cannot do that. Again, the government in its inability to properly think through policy has come up with yet another dog. Why should we be surprised, colleagues? We have had years and years of shambolic policy from this government, and this is just another example.


I think it is worth while, for the benefit of the Senate and those who may be listening, running through some of those shambolic policies to show the form that the government has in its absolute inability to govern this country properly. Firstly—and I know that my very good colleague Senator Cash will know all about this one—Labor's failed border protection policies, which have blown out the immigration budget by around $4 billion over the last three years and where more than $5 million has been spent on preparing the government's abandoned Malaysian people swap deal. I have to commend Senator Cash for the work she has done in this area. Very few people understand it better than she does. But what a mess! What an absolute mess! And it is all the fault of this government. It changed a policy that was working. There were no boats. And yet now we see from this government an absolutely shambolic piece of policy that has resulted in the chaos that we have when it comes to our border protection.


And who could forget the Home Insulation Program, the pink batts? There was $2.5 billion mismanaged, with at least $500 million to be spent fixing the mistakes. Computers in Schools: a $1.4 billion blowout and way behind schedule. Green Loans and Green Start: $175 million for the Green Loans Program mismanaged and then eventually dumped, then replaced with the $130 million Green Start program that never started! The solar homes program: $850 million blowout and the program cancelled. The program was originally meant to cost $150 million. There was the set-top box program at an average of $350 a home, but interestingly—




Senator Conroy:
  Why do you hate pensioners? You voted for it, you hypocrite! You voted for it!




Senator NASH:
  Ah—good to see you have woken up, Minister. Just let me finish and we will come back to that later.


Let us have a look at Harvey Norman. Gosh, they are offering the same deal for $168. Hm, let's see: government, $350 a home and Harvey Norman, $168. It does not seem to really stack up that well, does it, colleagues?



Senator Conroy interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  Order! Senator Conroy!




Senator NASH:
  Absolute mismanagement! And then we get to the Labor talkfests—



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy, please come to order!




Senator NASH:
  Speaking of talkfests, we can see why they do that. Senator Conroy is having a good go from the other side. Labor's talkfests include the 2020 Summit for $2 million, the Henry tax review for $10 million, the tax summit for $1 million and the jobs summit, but with hardly any outcomes. Here are two the people of Australia were absolutely enamoured of: Fuelwatch and GROCERYchoice! Weren't they great? Remember those, colleagues? Fuelwatch was going to fix the problem! GROCERYchoice was going to fix the problem! Nearly $30 million was spent setting them up, and then what happened? Any good outcomes? Let me see. No. Oh, gosh. What happened? They were dumped—$30 million and they were dumped. I am sure there are plenty of people in regional communities who think that $30 million could have been much better spent out in the regions, but no; we had it for Fuelwatch and GROCERYchoice.


Then, of course, there is Senator Conroy's NBN. What was that? Was it $4.7 billion to start with, blown out to more than $50 billion? The other thing is: was there ever a proper business case to justify the spending? Let me see, colleagues. Guess what the answer is: clearly no. This is yet another example of policy on the run from this government, which is simply inept. It cannot run the country. I have people saying to me they just wish we had a grown-up government that was able to run the country properly.


We saw the absolute debacle of the live cattle export trade. The fact that the government, panicked and on the run, shut down the live export trade was absolutely appalling and an indictment of this government, and it was yet another example of the government's complete lack of understanding of regional Australia. I say to those on the other side that if they had been travelling around during the inquiry, talking to the people on the ground and seeing how that stupid, stupid decision affected people in their homes and businesses then they would know that they are simply inept.


In all of this, we also see the government promise 64 GP superclinics. They have delivered 19 and scrapped two in the process. Here is my particular favourite—this one I love. We were talking about waste, mismanagement and government being inept. The government sold the parliament­ary billiard tables for $5,000 and then spent $102,500 finding out whether we got true value for money. If that does not encapsulate the absolutely inept nature of this government and its absolute inability to run the country properly, I do not know what does.


What really gets to people is being lied to. They really are starting to get hot under the collar, because every single time they turn around something else comes out from the government that is yet another backflip, another lie or another untruth, and they are sick of it. These are people out there in the communities—particularly, as I say, in regional communities—that I am talking to and that are trying to bring up their children, run their families, homes or businesses and instil in their children good ethics about how not to lie, how to be straight and how to tell the truth, and then they look at this government and every single time they turn around there seems to be another untruth.


I know some of my colleagues have raised these already, but as examples of the fact that you cannot trust this government these are absolute corkers. When it comes to the private health insurance legislation, we look at the then health minister, Nicola Roxon, saying on 24 February 2009:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


Mr Kevin Rudd said on 25 February:


The Private Health Insurance Rebate policy remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.


This is Mr Rudd again, in 2007:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


One perhaps thinks that if Mr Rudd had got a few more votes then maybe we would not be having this, but who would know? That is a story for another day that I suspect may well come back another day. Then we look at the now Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, saying back in 2005:


The truth is that I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate … For all Australians who wanted to have private health insurance, the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election.


The difference between Tony ""rock solid, iron-clad"" Abbott and me is that when I make an ""iron-clad commitment"", I actually intend on keeping it.


Absolutely extraordinary. They are the words out of the mouth of the woman who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, who has put the private health insurance legislation in front of us today.


So how on earth can anybody across this country believe anything this shambolic Labor government says? They heard those words coming from the Prime Minister in 2005. Obviously she was telling an untruth, because we now have changes to private health insurance in front of us. What does that do for people? That twigs another memory and another recognition from before the last election which goes something like, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This is the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard. What are we having in about 109 days from now? A carbon tax. What is that carbon tax going to do? It is going to hurt every Australian, and it is going to hurt regional Australians harder than anyone else. It is going to hurt our farmers harder than virtually anyone else, with fuel, electricity, fertiliser and transport costs right across the board, and those farmers have nowhere to pass those costs onto. That is only a little more than 100 days away. We sit on this side of the chamber looking at the other side, at the government, every day and saying: 'You are appalling. You have no ability to run the country. You are completely inept.'


We see again with this piece of legislation in front of us the inability of this Labor government to properly think things through, to properly look at the consequences of its actions and to properly provide decent, sound, well-thought-through policy for the people of this nation. Colleagues, I tell you what: Australians around this country are fast, fast coming to the conclusion that this government is unable to run this country and it is time for a change.

 (Queensland) (13:52):  I want to commence my contribution to this debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and the associated bills exactly where Senator Nash finished off, and that is by quoting our current Prime Minister, the leader of the Labor Party, who said this in a letter to the Hobart Mercury:


I grow tired of saying this—Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


That was said by our Prime Minister. How can any Australian trust anything this person says? Indeed, how can any Australian, or Queenslander, accept anything any Labor Party leader says? Ms Gillard again, writing to the Courier-Mail in Queensland, responding to another letter to the editor, said:


YOUR correspondent … should have no concern that Labor will ""erode"" or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee of that on a number of occasions.


That is our Prime Minister. What an embarrassment to Australia that person is. You simply cannot believe anything she says. We all know—it is part of the lexicon now—that Ms Gillard promised, just before the people went to the polls at the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And in a few short days that tax, which has already passed through this parliament, thanks to the Labor Party and the Greens political party, will be imposed upon all Australians—the greatest carbon tax in the world.


As my colleagues have clearly demonstrated, once you remove this rebate people will drop out of the private health insurance system and they will then rely more and more on public hospitals. I cannot talk about public hospitals elsewhere in Australia, but I can talk about the public health system in Queensland, which is an absolute shambles after practically 22 years of Labor rule in Queensland. Do not take my word for it; just go online and google 'Wikipedia Queensland Health', and you will see a litany of the way that Labor cannot run the public health system as it is. In my home town of Townsville, there is a great set of staff at the Townsville general hospital—very dedicated doctors and nurses—but there are never enough of them. And of course the nurses are not very happy because they do not get paid in Queensland because the Labor government in Queensland simply cannot even arrange the payroll for the nursing staff in Queensland Health. This is a typical Labor government administration of health, and it is a typical Labor government administration of the country's—or, in my case, the state of Queensland's—financial system.


In Queensland we had an announcement by Ms Bligh, the leader of the Labor Party there and the current—for another couple of weeks—Premier of that state, that she was going to abolish Queensland Health. She was going to get rid of it; she was going to cut it into two and restructure it. That followed the incident where a supposed Tahitian prince just cleared off with $16 million from Queensland Health. He had been rorting the system for years, but no-one in the Queensland Labor government had any idea of that. Their administration of health in Queensland is legend, and it is legendarily bad. Yet it is to this system which the current federal Labor government, which promised never to interfere with the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, is going to send Queenslanders. This federal government, by taking away the private health insurance rebate, will indeed send more people to the public health system, which, in Queensland, is almost like sending people to their greater detriment, and, in cases where you are dealing with matters of life and death, could be sending them to a more terminal future. That is what this legislation will do.


Time is not going to allow me to go through how the public health system in Queensland will become more overtaxed as a result of this legislation. But now that I see that a number of Labor members have come into the chamber to hear me make this speech, can I just repeat again, in case they did not quite hear me before, this quotation from the Labor Party leader, and our current embarrassment of a Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, who said:


I grow tired of saying this—Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


Can I also repeat what Ms Gillard said in responding to a letter to the editor of the Courier-Mail in my state of Queensland:


YOUR correspondent … should have no concern that Labor will ""erode"" or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate …


Can I repeat that, Mr President?


Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate …


And she goes on to say, in writing:


… I have given an iron-clad guarantee of that on a number of occasions.


Can you believe anything this Labor leader will say? Can you believe anything the Labor leader in Queensland will say when it comes to health ministers? Can you believe anything any Labor member will say? The evidence, the examples, of Labor leaders telling untruths in making commitments is legend. And I fear for my state of Queensland that the Labor leader there will be, as I speak, up in Queensland promising everything to everyone. She will be promising, probably, not to sell the railways—



Senator Furner interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And you, Senator Furner, should know. Did you agree with the sale of the railways when they promised not to do it? Of course you did. What a disgrace any Labor leader is. You simply cannot believe them.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:18):  We now have the third of the three Gs: we have had the GST under the Howard government, we have had the GFC and of course now we have the GBP, the government of broken promises. You will recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that this is the government that came in on the promise of honesty, transparency and, as Senator Collins knows, accountability. Do you remember Prime Minister Gillard saying, 'Let the sun shine in'? Well, it is the fact that it has been a very short summer here on the east coast and a very short summer of honesty, transparency and accountability. This is the government about whom the former Prime Minister, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and now backbencher, Kevin Rudd, said recently:


… Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people and …  if we don't change, the Labor Party is going to end up in Opposition.


This is also the government about whom the former Attorney-General Robert McClelland only recently said:


I don't think we have captured the attention or the support of the broader Australian community, and obviously if we want to win an election, they have to listen to us, they have to trust us, they have to have empathy with us …


This is not my side of the chamber saying this; this is the government side. Only last week I was at the Wagin Woolorama in the Great Southern region of WA. I overheard a mother scolding her daughter for telling porkies, and the little girl looked up and said, 'Why can't I? The Prime Minister can and the Prime Minister does.' She looked at me and I had no answer, of course.


But what day is it today? Is it carbon tax day? Of course, no; that was last week. But I will remind you of the words of this Prime Minister: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Her Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister said at the same time—amazingly enough, just before an election in 2010:


Well, certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation somehow that we are moving towards a carbon tax from the Liberals and their advertising. We certainly reject that.


So it is not carbon tax day. Is it audit compliance day? No, that was Wednesday. That was the day, if you remember, when we had the Australian National Audit Office undertaking an audit of none other than Ms Gillard as Minister for Education and reporting to the parliament that on more than three occasions Ms Gillard approved grants to schools in defiance of the recommendations of her department and also failed to undertake the requirement of the then Prime Minister to report her decision to the then Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What a great group of four it must have been. How wonderful to have sat around the table and listened to them agreeing with each other. But it does not stop with the Prime Minister, as is often the case, because most organisations learn from the top. News filters downhill more quickly than it does uphill. In that same audit report from the ANAO we learnt that there were no less than 33 cases where ministers failed to alert the finance minister to the fact that they had made grants in their own electorates—11 of those 33 instances against the advice of their own department.


But it is not carbon tax day; it is not audit compliance day; it is Thursday—it must be private health insurance broken promise day. Let me go back to then shadow minister Ms Julia Gillard writing in the Courier Mail:


YOUR correspondent Russell McGregor … should have no concern that Labor will ""erode"" or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed—


said Ms Gillard—


to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an ironclad guarantee of that on a number of occasions.


Is it any wonder that the little girl in Wagin, reflecting the rest of Australia, has lost all patience with this government and its credibility? Again, Ms Gillard, complaining in a newspaper, the Weekend Australian, in October 2005:


The truth is—


she wrote—


that I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate, and contrary … do not support such a claim.


We go from Ms Gillard to then shadow health minister Roxon—again, prior to an election—in 2007. This is what she said at the annual conference of the Australian Health Insurance Association: 'This is why we have committed to the current system of private health insurance incentives,' she said, 'including the package of rebates, the lifetime health cover, the surcharge. Labor understands that people with private health insurance, now around nine million Australians, have factored the rebate into their budgets, and we will not support taking it away.' She went further in September: 'We have committed to it. We have committed to the 30 per cent.' The journalist must have had some understanding of the future because she was asked again, 'So you will not wind back the 30 per cent private health rebate, despite the fact,' the journalist asked, 'that Labor has been ideologically opposed to it in the past?' And guess what her answer was? 'No we won't.' She went on to say: 'For many occasions for many months we have made it crystal clear we are committed to retaining all of the private existing health insurance rebates.' She went on to say: 'The Liberals continue to scare people'—doesn't this remind you of Mr Wayne Swan's comments about the carbon tax?—'into thinking that Labor will take away the rebates.' This, according to Ms Roxon, is absolutely untrue.


We then go to the leader of the then opposition, Mr Rudd, speaking to the same organisation, the Health Insurance Association, prior to the 2007 election. This is what he said: 'Both my shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year, that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.' And in February 2008, after becoming Prime Minister, he said: 


The Private Health Insurance Rebate policy remains unchanged and—


by way of emphasis—


will remain unchanged.


How much longer do we have to listen to these statements which we now know to have never been the intention of the government?


Just yesterday, we had the gross misfortune of listening to a tirade by Labor Senator Cameron, trying to vilify the then coalition government in terms of its expenditure and its commitment to health. Let me place these figures on record. It is an area, of course, in which you, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, have a particular and keen interest. Health and aged care spending: 1995-96, $19½ billion dollars spent by the Commonwealth government, increasing to $52 billion by 2007-08. Public hospital spending: 1995-96, $5.2 billion; 2007-08, more than double, to $12 billion. Funding to the states to support their health initiatives: 1993 to 1998, $23 billion; 1998 to 2003, a leap to $31 billion, and, in 2003 to 2008, $42 billion. And we continue to hear stupidity and nonsense from intelligent and otherwise honourable senators of the other side talking about the apparent billion dollars of Mr Tony Abbott when he was health minister. There never was $1 billion taken out of the health budget. It simply was a forward estimate in the forward papers of that era. There never was a $1 billion black hole by Mr Abbott.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  There never was, Senator Collins.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Well, he was planning—




Senator BACK:
  Let us go forward. Do not speak about—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—what people might have been planning to do; listen to the quotes I gave in the last few minutes from Ms Gillard, Ms Roxon and Mr Rudd. What were they planning to do? Heavens above!


We then learn that, under this government, in June 2010, the highly respected Professor John Mendoza resigned as chairman of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health. Why? Because of the lack of action of this government in the area of mental health. So it begs the question: why has Labor changed this policy?


There are several reasons. One is on the corner to my left: because it is driven by the Greens political party who want to see the destruction of private health. Another is: because of the massive budget blowouts of this government, because of the incredibly high levels of debt, because they know they are facing another deficit this year, as they will be next year. Let me just remind you: the last time Labor was in government in the Hawke-Keating era the coalition was left to repay a debt of $96 billion a year, then costing some $6 billion—thousand million—a year in interest alone. We know now that that figure is $230 billion, racing towards $250 billion. And this government continues to borrow $100 million a day, every day of the week—not the working week, the entire week. So if you want to start to try to ramp back, who do you attack? You attack hardworking, middle-class Australians.


But this is bad policy. Why is it bad policy? Let me give you the analogy of a pool—a pool of money—into which the government puts 30c of each dollar, that being the private health rebate. But on the other side of the coin, the person taking out that insurance puts in the other 70c. How smart is it to remove that 30c, or a proportion of it, only to have the private health insurer taking out either their 70c or a significant proportion of it by reducing their level of cover? Where is the validity of such a decision? We all know what happens to the pool of money—the pool dries up—and we know that it drives people back to an already overstretched public health system.


These are the facts. The private hospital system in this country currently treats 40 per cent of all patients, being more than three million a year, and, more importantly, performs over 60 per cent of surgeries. Six out of every 10 surgeries in this country are performed in the private hospital system. The Productivity Commission found that the private hospital network treats patients more cheaply and at least as safely as public hospitals, if not more safely. In 2007-08 the government spent $31 billion on the public health system and, in contrast, only $1.7 billion on private hospitals through the private health levies.


We are all acutely aware that we have a rapidly ageing population in this country. Why would we place at risk the medical and hospital care of an ageing population by removing the 30 per cent rebate? The very group that we will be driving out of private health are the young people of this community—the ones who draw least on the health system, be it private or public.


Let me give you some examples. We have heard from the current Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek, who has decided to demonise high-income earners and even middle-income earners who, she says, should not receive subsidies from the lower income areas of this community to support their private health insurance. The minister should be reminded that, as she well knows, there is already a 1.5 per cent Medicare levy on taxable income to support the public health system. Furthermore, if high-income earners fail to have public health cover they can add a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge to their payments to the community. There is the subsidy from higher income earners. Quick calculations: somebody earning $80,000 a year together with superannuation and fringe benefits who does not take out private health cover will be paying $2,000 per annum towards supporting Medicare. There is the support from higher income earners. Even if that person takes out private health, at 1½ per cent on their $80,000, they will be paying $1,200 in Medicare levy a year. As I was reminded recently, that taxable income includes overtime and zone allowances. What we are really doing is saying, 'The harder you work, the more overtime you work and the more you earn, the more you will be imposed with a levy.' This, apparently, is what this government wants to move towards.


Why is it so dangerous? Why is it such bad policy? As we know, older people in the community have the greatest demand and the greatest draw on the health system, and that is getting even greater. My understanding is that these figures are accurate: people under the age of 19 years would exercise about 15 per cent of the national health budget; from 20 up to 65 it is about a quarter, about 23 per cent; and from 65 onwards, 60 per cent of the nation's health budget is spent on that age demographic. The more we keep young people in private health, where they are not drawing on the need for health and hospital cover, the better it will be for older members of the community. The Labor government might say, 'Yes, but of course the reduction of the rebate is limited and therefore lower income people will be less disadvantaged.' The simple fact of the matter is that, as the pool of private health funding reduces, the inevitable outcome must be that premiums will go up and people will start to take a reduced level of cover, if they take out cover at all. These are the sorts of areas that we need to be addressing and that this legislation will strike right at the heart of.


We hear from Minister Plibersek that this is only a tax on wealthier people. It is an interesting statistic in Australia that one million-plus households earning less than $26,000 per annum take out private health cover. Private health is not something for wealthier Australians—it is across the board. It is something that young families, middle-aged families and families with younger children and teenagers engage in, and it is an area that older Australians value very deeply. Why does this government want to attack the very surcharge levy that it said it would never touch?


I come to the reaction from people in my own community of Western Australia regarding the feedback from the Hospital Benefit Fund, which is a not-for-profit fund. This is not a fund that is trying to extract vast sums of money from its members, it is one that pours its funds straight back into members' conditions. Already, HBF estimates that 25 per cent of its members will see a big hike in their premiums, and this will increase to 43 per cent. That is an increase in premiums for those who will be hardest hit. We know already that the funds are battling to keep their premium increases to a minimum. The Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek, has only recently approved an average increase of 5.06 per cent. Many members are already anxious about the implications of the removal of the rebate of up to 30 per cent.


Another point made to me by this organisation is the sheer complexity of the processes as they are now being presented to the parliament. The legislation, which applies a means test to the rebate and further complicates the Medicare levy surcharge, will only serve to compound this complexity. It will only serve to discourage those who are already planning to come into private health. It may also accelerate the move of those who now believe they cannot afford it or they must reduce their premium levels. These are great concerns. 


We have a wonderful health system in this country. We have a combination of public and private health care. There are all sorts of models. Models that would be best in this country have been put to me. These models suggest we move everybody into private health cover and then provide premium relief or payments for those unable to afford those premiums. We must continue to have competition to drive prices down, to keep quality up and, above all, we must do what we can to preserve and protect both the private health and the public health systems. This legislation is simply a grab for money. It is not about health policy. It should not be supported.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (12:38):  I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation. These bills will see the private health insurance rebate means tested and the Medicare levy surcharge increased for those who choose not to have private health insurance. The private health insurance rebate, a coalition initiative, saw private health insurance membership climb during the Howard years from 30 per cent in the 1990s to 47 per cent in 2008. On most recent industry figures, some 52.9 per cent of the Australian population have some form of private health insurance. The Howard government provided the incentive and increased the choice for individuals and families to take out private health insurance. I support a mixed public and private healthcare system where Australians have the choice to take out private health insurance. I also support the rebate for increasing the choices available to all of us.


Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. We should strive for improvement and for it to cost less. Our healthcare system is a delicately balanced mixture of public and private. In my home state of South Australia, with a population of just over 1.6 million people, there are some 1,008,334 holders of private health insurance, according to private health industry figures. However, the cost of providing health care continues to rise. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reveal that in the 10 years to 2009-10 health spending grew in real terms by an average of 5.3 per cent, compared with an average real growth in GDP of 3.1 per cent a year. Spending on health in Australia costs the Commonwealth, state and territory governments over $120 billion a year. Therefore, it makes sense to encourage wherever possible individual investment in our healthcare system through individuals' choices to co-invest in their own private health insurance. It simply makes no sense to remove the incentives for individuals and families to invest in their health provision.


Currently we have over 11 million private health insurance members who are contributing extra financial resources to the health sector, so that all Australians can benefit from a stronger health system. Both public and private must continue to co-invest. But rather than rewarding these members this legislation seeks to disincentivise this private investment in our healthcare system which could have some quite significant impacts over the next five years. Labor is pulling the rug from money that could be co-invested in our healthcare system.


We draw on research by Deloitte, which Senator Williams so succinctly drew on in this debate, that shows that up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their private hospital cover over five years, and up to 4.3 million will downgrade their hospital cover. A recent iSelect survey found 49 per cent of people would review their cover as a result of the rebate changes. Further, the Deloitte report found that by 2016 private health insurance premiums are expected to be 10 per cent higher than they otherwise would have been. The research also shows that between 2012 and 2016 an extra 845,000 Australians would be admitted to public hospitals as a consequence of these bills before us today. Deloitte estimates that the average waiting time in public hospitals would increase from 65 days to a staggering 259 days if no additional public capital investments were made in the next five years.


The impacts of this legislation are widespread. As one example, the Australian Physiotherapy Association claims that ancillary treatment cover, also known as general treatment or extras cover, pays rebates for visits to physiotherapists and other general providers such as dentists and podiatrists. A reduction in the number of Australians holding ancillary cover will reduce access to physiotherapy and other ancillary services which are, for the most part, not covered under the Medicare Benefits Scheme. According to the Physiotherapy Association, even if a small proportion of the current private health insurance members were to drop their ancillary cover, this could have a dramatic impact on the thousands of private physiotherapy practices around Australia, and that would be magnified in the regional and country areas.


In rural Australia we are already facing a number of serious problems in the health sector and country folk do not need the additional burden of having their private insurance health rebate ripped off them. Just as those living in the cities are facing cost-of-living pressures so are those in the bush, and the means testing of the rebate represents another increased cost to rural families. For example, there is already a chronic shortage of doctors. A rural doctors workforce agency report showed that 53 doctors needed to be recruited to fill vacancies in rural South Australia alone to meet the growing demand. With all this mining going on in regions, and we are all very proud of it and all very keen for it, we actually have to service it as well. Service means doctors, and we do not need doctors' incomes being undermined by the pulling of this rebate.


Add to this the growing trend of an ageing workforce. One hundred and five out of the 423 rural GPs are over 55 years old and expected to retire within the next 10 years. In my own home town of Clare there has been a position for an obstetrics trained GP vacant for the past four years. Some people are waiting more than five weeks to see their GPs! What these people do not need is to have more money removed from their pockets when they already have average access to health services. The government's co-investment in health is and should remain paramount. Governments cannot 'rat' the budget to achieve fickle surpluses over on the economic side of their problematic government.


While only a third of all hospital beds are private, 40 per cent of hospital admissions and 64 per cent of elective surgery admissions are private. Out of the hospital network, 86 per cent of all dental services are delivered in the private sector. Clearly, the private sector has an important role to play in delivering health services to Australians under our public-private health care system. In 2010 the Productivity Commission acknowledged that private hospitals were on average more efficient than public hospitals. It also found that smaller public hospitals, many of which are located in more remote communities, were found to be less efficient than similar-sized private hospitals. Therefore, any policy change that reduces funding to the private sector, which means-testing the private health insurance rebate will do, will mean underfunding the most efficient hospitals in our country.


Even the South Australian state Labor government acknowledged the role of the private sector in supporting the entire health system. Way back in 2004 a background paper, 'Challenges for health services in rural, regional and remote South Australia: achieving better health outcomes' said:


Private in-patients in public hospitals significantly contribute to the revenue of public hospitals, as private health insurers pay costs to the public hospital just as it would to a private hospital—


It is not complicated. This basic analysis does not change over the years! That whole proposition still remains in play in 2012.


While Labor preach that this is about a fairer health system and use divisive rhetoric that private health insurance is for rich people only, some 5.6 million of the 12 million private health insurance holders have a household income of less than $50,000 per year. Clearly, private health insurance is seen as an essential part of a household's expenditure and highly valued by a significant number of Australians. While all of these households will not have the rebate removed, they will feel the impact of the changes ripple through as a result of those people who have been slapped with a rise in their health cover drop their private health insurance and premiums begin to rise. It just makes sense. Insurance is always about the money pool. If you have more people contributing, the less they have to contribute. You take people out of the pool, then the cost of cover will always increase for the remaining participants. All this on top of the extra cost of living with the introduction of a ridiculous carbon tax! 


The Labor Party and Greens continue to peddle the concept that cleaners should not subsidise millionaires' private health insurance. In reality, however, low-income earners pay no tax, or very little tax, and are not subsidising high-income earners' private health insurance. The top quarter of income earners pay two-thirds of the total tax. It is just another shadowy attempt to vilify those who see in Australia the hope, reward and opportunity the coalition sees.


Now we see private health fees set to rise by another 5.06 per cent, which equates to an additional $150 a year extra for families. This means that some families will be slapped with a double-hit—higher premiums for private health insurance and less or zero government assistance via the rebate. And of course, health costs are also expected to rise because of the impact of higher energy costs associated with the carbon tax. The Treasury modelling claims health services will only rise by 0.3 per cent, but it seems inevitable that costs for patients will rise as energy, catering, key medical supplies and other input costs increase. Not only will there be pressure on the public hospital sector, but private hospital providers will also face a likely 16 per cent hike in their energy bills, all of which is likely to be passed on to consumers and patients. Where else can the pain be transferred?


Labor talk about their fairer health care, but their poor policy choices will only result in more expensive health care for all Australians and, unfortunately, it will be those on lower incomes, working Australians whom Labor claim to represent, who will be the hardest hit.


In my home state, the state where I live, where has the Labor member for Wakefield been on this issue? As a man who knows what it is like to be a working person—being a former salesman, cleaner and a trolley collector—he should understand.




Senator Boyce:
  What—not a union rep?




Senator EDWARDS:
  He did finish up there, but this is his earlier life. However, he has supported the Gillard government's continued assault on health care through means testing the rebate and the carbon tax. We have not heard a single utterance on private health insurance from the local member who is responsible for a seat where there are doctor shortages right throughout his rural communities. The Lyell McEwin Hospital, a very important hospital in Elizabeth Vale at the southern end of Wakefield, and the other hospitals in the electorate in Balaclava, Clare, Kapunda and Gawler are all facing substantial increases in electricity, catering and medical supply costs. The member for Wakefield, Mr Champion, certainly has not been a champion on health care for the 155,000 working men, women and children of Wakefield. The member of the House of Representatives who does not live up to his surname recently demonstrated how broken promises are the hallmark of the Labor government. The member for Wakefield last month was only too happy to stand on the same platform as his Prime Minister and welcome Ms Gillard to his electorate, nodding at every word she said when the television cameras were operating, yet within 48 hours this same individual abandoned the Prime Minister to support Kevin Rudd's leadership bid.




Senator Bernardi:
  I was appalled.




Senator EDWARDS:
  That was quite shocking, Senator Bernardi. He witnessed all this going on in his home state. 




Senator Bernardi:
  I was appalled.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Appalled. A man whom he wanted to support, Kevin Rudd—




Senator McLucas:
  Mr Rudd.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Rudd—in his effort for leadership bid was described by some of his parliamentary colleagues as a 'psychopath'. So much for what passes for judgment within the parliamentary Labor Party. This is the same mob that tried to foist Mark Latham onto the people of Australia, then Kevin Rudd, and now they want Australians to believe—




Senator McLucas:
  Mr Rudd.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Kevin Rudd—and now they want Australians to believe that they can improve the private health system with a means test on the rebate. They might also try to get pigs to fly. Sadly, as is so often the case with Labor, this legislation represents yet another broken promise. Labor failed to have similar legislation passed in the Senate in May 2009 and again tried and failed in November of the same year. This was despite a commitment to not change the private health insurance rebate.


Let us face it: these bills are more about the ideological obsessions of the Labor Party. Because of their socialist DNA, they have a hatred of private enterprise. What pushes their collective button is the redistribution of wealth, taking it away from those families who work hard and smart to get ahead so that Labor can reward its camp followers, those who expect everybody else to pay for them. The ALP's contempt and disdain for private health funds is obvious. Class warfare is alive and well and, whenever Labor gets the chance to target the private sector, it does so. It is a big target for the Labor Party.


The ALP in 2012 has two themes: tax and spend. The thrust of its revenue gathering is to make those who largely do not vote for Labor pay more, yet in its smug arrogance that it knows better than others it does not seem to have dawned on the Gillard-Greens alliance that any exodus from the private funds because of the higher fees will lead to the overwhelming of the public hospital system.


I do not support these three bills because they will ultimately lead to an erosion of our healthcare system for everyone—increased health insurance premiums, increased demand on our already strained public system, reduced accessibility to ancillary services, increased cost-of-living pressure on individuals and families, and decreased choice for all Australians. These bills are not about better health outcomes. This is a cash clawback to fund Labor's growing and increasingly fanciful budget surplus and to cover up for their financial mischief in other areas. I will not be supporting these bills. I urge all members of the Senate not to support these bills in the interests of keeping health care in this country growing and improving for all Australians.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (12:58):  It is interesting that the government seems to think that putting 'fair' in front of a bill title somehow makes it so. We have the Fair Work Act, which in the coalition was referred to as the so-called Fair Work Act because it is only fair in the term of this government.




Senator Carol Brown:
  Work Choices, no choices.




Senator McLucas:
  Work Choices, no choices.




Senator BOYCE:
  There was such a cacophony of comment there. That was a unity ticket, was it, Madam Acting Deputy President? 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Order! I remind senators on my right that shouting across the chamber is not parliamentary.




Senator BOYCE:
  Nevertheless, no matter how much protesting goes on from the other side, putting 'fair' in front of the title of a bill does not make the bill fair. It has been interesting to watch the development of these so-called 'fairer private health insurance incentives' bills over the three attempts to have them passed, the third of which is now being made by this government. It has ratcheted up from being allegedly good policy in the first place, through a number of iterations, to now, where the situation is the government using the politics of envy as the only reason why this legislation would be a good thing. Of course, they cannot talk about the real reason they need this legislation: they are desperate for cash, having wasted and mismanaged a surplus and having now got themselves in a situation where they have an accumulated budget deficit of $167 billion. What on earth are they going to do about it other than play semantics around the word 'fairer' and rip money in an erratic way out of any cash cow they see lying around? We do not know and, unfortunately, the Australian people do not know, but the Australian people are getting very sick of it.


Both Ms Gillard and Ms Plibersek have used the example of the poor apprentice subsidising the frontbencher, the millionaire or the billionaire through the Medicare rebate. It is quite true that irrespective of your income you get the same rebate, set at 30 per cent by the Howard-Costello government. It was deliberately set at that so there was no unfair advantage for people on high incomes over those on lower incomes. Of course, what Ms Gillard and Ms Plibersek neglect to mention when they paint their little scenario of the poor apprentice subsidising the rich frontbencher or rich minister is that everyone pays a 1½ per cent Medicare levy which is based on income; so, the more money you have, the more you pay in the levy. If you want the real picture of how health is funded in this country, you need to include both figures. No-one has any objection whatsoever to the Medicare levy being set as a percentage of income, but to try to pretend that that is a completely separate and different issue from the private health insurance rebate in terms of funding health in Australia is ridiculous and arcane.


We then move on to the grand advocates of the politics of envy, Senator Cameron and Senator Thistlethwaite, who would have you believe that only people who are millionaires and billionaires have private health insurance. It would be lovely if there were 11 million-plus millionaires and billionaires in Australia, but there are not. There are 11 million people, however, who have private health insurance, and very few of those are millionaires and billionaires. I am sure that, if the government would like to rejig this legislation so that it only applied to millionaires and billionaires, they would have no disagreement on passing it. But they want to just pretend somehow that it is not everyday Australians who have private health insurance and have it for very good reasons. They often go without in other areas so that they can have private health insurance, and they are prepared to pay the costs involved in having private health insurance. As Senator Edwards pointed out so well, if the number of people with private health insurance drops substantially, the effects on public health and public hospitals are going to be extraordinary. It is going to cost vast amounts more money. It is going to put waiting lists out extraordinarily. It is going to affect all health professionals. It is going to affect the availability of health professionals and the number of people going into professions if there is not sufficient work to make a profit.


As I said, half of Australia's 11 million privately insured people have incomes of less than $50,000. Last time I looked, that did not constitute a millionaire or a billionaire. Of those people, 3½ million have an income of less than $35,000. But the costs will continue to rise for everyone who remains in private health insurance if the government persists with their so-called fairer system.


It seems quite illogical and a little difficult to understand how on earth taking 2½ million people out of the rebate system will assist the development of private health in Australia. I listened with interest to the figures that Senator Edwards gave us on the effects on the public health system that will follow. I do not think the government care about that. I think we have here an ideological issue. Concerns about how the public health system cope are not their problem. They do not want to know how successful or efficient the private health system is; they just want to work out ways to diminish it and get rid of it—and at the same time find themselves a little bit of money to try to fix up the deficit mess they have got themselves in. There was, of course, argument. I was part of the inquiry the first time these bills came before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which seems a long time ago now.


The modelling from the government says there will only be 27,000 people dropping their cover as a result of these changes. Some of the academics that the government lined up to follow on from this described private health insurance as 'sticky': people do not want to let go of it. No, people do not want to let go of it, but push them far enough and they will have to let go of it because the costs will rise. So the government say only 27,000 people will drop out, but Treasury, of course, did not do any modelling for them, because they did not want to know what the real answer was. But their own insurer, Medibank Private, has said that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. That is what the government's own private health insurance body says. If you look at the Deloitte figures, they say that in the first year you would expect 175,000 people to drop their private hospital cover and 583,000 to downgrade their cover. They say that, over five years, 1.6 million people will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. They say—and this is where, irrespective of whether you earn $35,000 or not—private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. We are looking already, right now, at increases in private health insurance premiums averaging about five per cent, so we are talking about 15 per cent. Deloitte's analysis says there will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs in the public hospital system as a result of these people dropping out of private hospital cover. They say that 2.8 million people with general treatment cover will withdraw and 5.7 million will downgrade over five years. And yet, of course, the grand experiment of this government continues in terms of ideological fixing. 


We have not even yet spoken about the broken promises aspect of this legislation. On a quick count, there are at least seven examples of Ms Roxon, as Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Gillard before that and then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promising absolutely that there would be no change to private health insurance rebates. Ms Gillard, as the shadow minister for health in September 2004, said, 'I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.' It is funny that she has somehow not quite managed to do that. In October 2005 she said: 'The truth is that I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate. For all Australians who wanted to have private health insurance, the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an ironclad guarantee.' It goes on, of course, right up until 2009—almost on the eve of the introduction of this legislation, when the then health minister, Ms Nicola Roxon, said, 'The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.'


Not long after the election of the Rudd government, I had a phone call from a woman who had been solemnly promised by the Labor policy secretariat that there would be no changes to the baby bonus. And yet, less than nine months—and the number is, of course, relevant—after that, the baby bonus was cut for couples over a certain income. Again we had the fallacy that somehow people with annual incomes over $50,000 are rich.


The other question that arose during the inquiry into this legislation was: if this legislation were to pass, how would health insurance companies know whether you were entitled to a rebate or not? How is that to be done? Is every Australian supposed to ring their insurer and say: 'My income for the year will be X amount. So tell me: do I get the rebate or do I not get the rebate?' Are we actually suggesting that, without any sort of coverage in the legislation—there certainly were not any answers available at the inquiry—I have to give my income to a health insurer? Is that what we are suggesting would happen? There was a vague suggestion during the inquiry that perhaps it could be done in blocks: 'Do you earn between $50,000 and $6,000' or whatever. I am sorry, but why should any Australian have to give that figure to a health insurer? It is a matter of privacy and there are no restrictions or regulations around how that would happen. Yet again we have this government getting yet more data collected up on people all over the country, for no good reason except to satisfy their own ideological whims.


I have mentioned already how the costs of private health insurance will rise because there will be fewer people, there will be fewer healthier people, in private health insurance. It would seem axiomatic, but apparently it is not, to this government. We have also recently had reports from Sinclair Knight Merz on the cost of the carbon tax for hospitals in Australia. They say that the carbon tax will add $100 million a year to health sector energy bills. In some areas the health sector is a very high user of energy. Other than that, it uses energy at similar rates to the commercial sector, with lights needing to run 24 hours a day in most parts of hospitals. You have the idea that key hospitals will have an extra $1 million-plus put onto their energy costs. So hospital costs will go up, and ambulance costs and cemetery costs are also going to rise as a result of the carbon tax, and this will come out across the board. The head of Ramsay Health Care, which is Australia's largest private hospital provider, said that they can see no way out of this except to pass on these cost increases. They expect that there will be a 16 per cent increase in their energy costs by 2013—and that is 66 private hospitals. There is no reason to think that this would not apply to the majority of hospitals, be they public or private, across Australia. Perhaps instead of stopping the poor apprentice from having to subsidise the wealthy frontbencher, this will end up being the poor apprentice subsidising the government's carbon tax, irrespective of whether they use public or private hospitals.


We are looking at a tsunami of cost increases. If public and private hospital costs are to rise and if people outside the mining industry are already suffering from a very depressed job market and depressed growth market, then, surely, what we need here is incentive for people to stay in private health, not sticks to drive them out and especially not sticks disguised as fairer ways of doing anything. There is absolutely nothing fair about this legislation except that it very fairly reflects this government's attempts to use the politics of envy to bludgeon their way through with ideology that is designed to stop incentive amongst individuals in Australia and designed to attack the private sector in every industry. I am happy to join the coalition in opposing these bills.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-03-15,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:16):  I again rise to speak on the policy behind the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation. Again I oppose it. Just a few minutes ago, I had a meeting with representatives of the Australian Physiotherapy Association. What they said to me was that they are very concerned about this bill because of the effect it will have on ancillary cover, such as physiotherapy. The concern is that many Australians, because of the ham-fisted way this bill has been structured, will end up dropping out of their ancillary cover. They will still stay within a private health scheme in order not to be penalised with this carrot and stick approach, but, because of the lack of the rebate, they will cut back on their cover. Where will they cut back on their cover? On ancillary cover: physiotherapy, optometry, occupational therapy and a whole range of associated services will be left behind. Australians will not get the additional help they need on a whole range of preventative health measures, such as seeing a dietician or getting psychological help for stress. These are the sorts of things that will suffer as a direct result of this bill.


I fear this bill will have all sorts of unintended consequences for all Australians and their access to health care. One of the challenges in health is getting the right funding mix between government, private health insurance, individual out-of-pocket payments and third-party payments, all of which are important parts of our health system. It is about equilibrium and achieving an equilibrium that gives all Australians access to affordable, high quality health care. I firmly believe that private health insurance plays an important part in the mix of health funding and the delivery of health services and that as many people as possible should have access to the highest quality and affordable health care. I believe this is best achieved by the right mix of private and public health care. 


I note that 45 per cent of Australians hold some form of private health insurance cover and in my own state of South Australia that number is in the order of 56 per cent. That makes a bill such as this very important as it has the potential to affect a lot of people and the decisions they make about their private health cover. The government has advocated means testing the current 30 per cent rebate on health cover on the basis of equity and sustainability. But let us analyse that. I strongly support a healthcare system in Australia that is equitable and accessible for all Australians and sustainable to the taxpayer. I do not believe that the government's proposal to means test the rebate and create a tiered health system will achieve this outcome. Rather it will create a lopsided system and damage the equilibrium between the public and private health systems. We must always be wary of unintended consequences.


As I have said before, what makes private health insurance accessible and affordable for many Australians is the 30 per cent rebate. There are many Australians below average weekly earnings who sign up to private health cover because they can see the important benefit for them. Most Australians on an average salary would struggle to afford private health insurance, especially during times when so many are struggling to balance the family budget and so many are worried about job security. Health is not something that can be taken for granted. You can see that in the almost 50 per cent of Australians who do what they can to budget for private health insurance for their wellbeing and that of their families. 


In December 2009 the Productivity Commission released its report examining comparative hospital and medical costs for similar procedures in public and private hospitals, the rates for fully informed financial consent, relative performance indicators and most appropriate form of indexation. That report arose from an agreement I reached with the government when I raised concerns about the lack of information about how our health system worked, about comparative funding and even basic information on health outcomes, particularly on comparisons between the public and private systems. That was in the context of the Medicare surcharge legislation at the end of 2008. That was at a time when the way I voted did make a difference on the outcome of some legislation and I am pleased to have been able to secure that concession from the government. I thought it was a very good and valuable exercise in informing public policy in this area.


We need to reflect on some of the aspects of the Productivity Commission report. That report made it clear that both the public and private systems work best side by side. The report says:


The strength of interaction between the two sectors—


that is, public and private—


has led some to describe them as ‘interdependent’ … reflecting the fact that the services and functions of each sector help to support the other. The interaction between the sectors may be demonstrated by, for example: the sharing of resources in co-located establishments; medical staff working across both sectors and the exchange of spillover benefits (the private sector benefiting from the public sector’s investment in medical training and research).


The AMA's submission to the commission's report summarises this well in saying:


… the plural nature of the public and private hospital system is one of the strengths of Australia's health system. It is readily apparent that taxpayer sourced funding cannot bear the whole load of financing health care … Australia gets its best result when the two sectors have a strong symbiotic relationship …


My concern is that that strong symbiotic relationship will be frayed and could well be damaged beyond repair as a result of these proposed changes.


At the time of the report there were 768 public hospitals and 556 private hospitals in Australia, providing 4.7 and 3.1 million episodes of care respectively for admitted patients in 2007-08. It is a delicate balance between the two, with their services often being complementary. For example, public hospitals handled around three-quarters of all medical separations—that is, episodes of care—while private hospitals performed around 60 per cent of all surgeries and nearly 70 per cent of other procedures in 2007-08. Around 95 per cent of outpatient occasions of services, including emergency department presentation, were handled by public hospitals, while nearly two-thirds of elective surgery separations were performed by private hospitals. I think these examples show just how much the public health system needs the private health system side by side and vice versa. If even some of that demand shifted to public hospitals then before long something would have to give.


Public hospitals do a great job in providing acute care and a whole range of other care but, the more pressure you put on them, the result will be longer and longer waiting times in areas such as elective surgery and for the ancillary cover, as the Australian Physiotherapy Association quite rightly pointed out. This is a clear example of how private and public health systems do complement each other to provide better health care for Australians, and it is an equilibrium that could be put at risk if the means-testing of the current 30 per cent rebate results in people pulling out of or downgrading their private health insurance. Back in 2009, when the government first announced means-testing the 30 per cent rebate, the Treasury projected that as a result of the policy change 225,000 high-income consumers would withdraw from private cover. My concern is that higher premiums mean less affordable cover for all people, resulting in fewer people having access to private cover and putting more pressure on the public system.


The government has argued that this 25,000 figure from Treasury is inconsequential, that it would have no significant impact on the numbers of people with private health insurance cover. But the modelling that this is based on has not been tested and is not transparent. The assumptions have not been spelt out. It does not consider just how price-sensitive people are when it comes to the cost of their private health insurance going up. Also, there is no modelling at all when it comes to the issue of ancillary cover. We can explore this, I hope, in the committee stage, but if the Australian Physiotherapy Association tells me—and I accept fully what they say to me—that there is no modelling on the impact on ancillary cover then how on earth is this going to be modelled in terms of the impact it will have on the public system? How many more people will be queuing up to get physiotherapy and occupational therapy and to get advice from dietitians and psychologists—a whole range of health professionals in the public system—because people will drop out of the private system, at least in terms of ancillary cover?


Getting the policy settings right on public health insurance is very important. Sadly, the government seems more interested in getting its budget in the black by, in effect, putting household budgets in the red. The government really needs to seriously consider the consequences of this bill. I note that a number of my colleagues have mentioned Deloitte's research. Deloitte produced its report for the Australian health insurance alliance—so it is a report for an industry group, and that needs to be taken into account. But I think it is fair to say that Deloitte as a consultancy service is well respected and has done some rigorous work in this field, and the onus is on the government to rebut it. I think that what Deloitte has put up is very compelling. It talks about the fact that in the last full financial year, 2010-11, private health funds have paid $12.4 in benefits towards the health care of 11.7 million Australians who hold some form of private health cover. That is no small amount of money or people. Just imagine if significant numbers of those people—even 10 per cent—withdrew from private health cover or downgraded their cover. 


Let us consider the picture that Deloitte has painted. Deloitte estimates that in the first year of a means-tested rebate, 175,000 people will withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 538,000 will downgrade. In addition, Deloitte estimates 554,000 people will withdraw from general treatment cover and another 803,000 will downgrade. Over five years, Deloitte estimates that 1.6 million people will withdraw from private health insurance and a further 4.3 million will downgrade their cover. Further, people who withdraw from their private health cover are less likely to have claimed healthcare benefits than those who choose to remain.


As people withdraw from their private cover, they become more reliant on the public healthcare system. Or, worse still, they just do not seek help, which can have catastrophic consequences for the health of those individuals. Between 2012 and 2016, Deloitte estimates 845,000 additional separations will need to occur in public hospitals as a consequence of the means-testing of the rebate. This translates to $3.8 billion in additional operating costs over five years to the public health system, with $1.4 billion in the fifth year alone. That is not a pretty picture for the future of Australia's health care system. As Deloitte says in its report:


As people withdraw from private health insurance, the burden on publically provided healthcare rises. The findings indicate that the cost of treating consumers in the public hospital system are expected to rise substantially above what is currently anticipated by Government.


These numbers I have just mentioned are staggering and highlight that, if people leave the private health system, the burden on public health care does not just rise; it escalates. We have a government that wants to get its budget in the black by in effect putting household budgets in the red.


I know the government disputes the findings of the ANOP/Newspoll survey that Deloitte's figures are based upon, but I think Rod Cameron and ANOP/Newspoll are well respected in terms of the work that they do. It is a prospect we need to seriously consider, especially when Deloitte is such a well-respected and reputable firm. A more pressured public health system with less affordable private health cover is a serious matter. It is a recipe for policy failure within a healthcare system that is neither equitable nor sustainable—the very opposite of what the government says it is trying to achieve. The government might mention that the predictions of people dropping out due to the Medicare surcharge legislation back in 2008 did not come to fruition. That is the case because the legislation was significantly amended. I think in a way that was tempered; it did not push those price sensitivity points, in a sense, with the Medicare surcharge legislation. I can foreshadow, in case we do not have time to properly debate this bill in the committee stage, that I will be moving an amendment, which I will now briefly outline. My idea for this amendment came to me after an ABC journalist at the Senate doors one morning was grilling me about whether or not I would support an independent body for collecting information on the composition of health funds, which I think I alluded to. George Roberts was the journalist, and I am not sure that the ABC wants to be pulled into policymaking, but I am grateful to Mr Roberts for his question because it has led to me having an amendment drafted, which I will name the 'Roberts amendment,' which probably horrifies Mr Roberts.


The amendment I propose is that the Productivity Commission, in its independ­ence, reports annually on the composition of private health funds. It is vital that we know from an independent source just how many people drop out of private health insurance or reduce their cover as a result of means-testing the 30 per cent rebate. I believe that the Productivity Commission is well placed to do this, particularly given its previous report that comprehensively looked at the mix between the public and the private health systems. By reviewing annually the composition of health fund membership we will be able to see precisely just how many people drop out or downgrade their membership. It is almost a rule of public policy that there will always be unintended consequences, and in this case it is important that these consequences be monitored, because I believe they could well be severe. That is why it is essential to have the Productivity Commission take on the role of monitoring the impact of these changes.


My question, respectfully, to the government will be: if the government does not support the amendment in its current form, what assurances can it give to this place, to the people of Australia, that there will be a mechanism to monitor the number of people dropping out or downgrading their cover? The downgrading of cover is where I think the sting is in the tail with this piece of legislation and the impact it will have. I would be grateful if the government could provide me with a comprehensive answer in relation to that. Surely there must be some responsibility mechanism, an independent and robust mechanism, to determine what the impact will be.


I believe we owe it to the Australian people to not take risks with their health but to give Australians the options they need to get the best possible health care and to give Australians a healthcare system where private and public work side by side in a symbiotic relationship, complementing each other to achieve the best health outcomes. This legislation does not do that.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-03-15,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:32):  I always think that the Australian people are very positive and are always looking for the bright light at the end of the tunnel. They have a positive outlook on the future of Australia, which is why they get so incredibly frustrated and disappointed that this Gillard-Rudd-Smith-Shorten-Carr-Greens-Independent Labor government keep giving the Australian people such bad policy. I had better correct that. I was referring to Senator Bob Carr and not Senator Kim Carr; Senator Bob Carr is clearly the smart one.


We have the Australian people in the situation where the government is continuing to foist upon them bad policy. It is happening time and time again. As I travel through mostly regional communities, there is a sense of a lack of confidence in this government that it can actually deliver anything properly for this nation. As somebody said to me the other day, 'This Labor government is choking this country,' and it is. It is doing it because there is so little good policy, substantive policy, that we see coming from the government. This private health insur­ance legislation is absolutely no different.


Isn't it interesting, colleagues, that on the other side of the chamber with the Labor government over there and in the other place, they are continuing to harangue the coalition and harangue the leader, Tony Abbott, about being negative and about saying no. If the government could at any stage give us some good policy for the Australian people, we would not have to keep saying no. The only reason we are saying no is because the government continue to give us such bad, ill-thought-through policy on the run. We only have to look at the private health insurance legislation before us to see yet another example of this.


It is just stupidity to take away the incentive and place an impost on the Australian people which is going to lead to them dropping their private health cover and is going to push them into the public system. That is just completely stupid. The public system is already completely overloaded. I take my hat off to the men and women, the doctors, the nurses and staff, in our public health system who work so hard in very, very difficult situations. But here we have a government that is planning on making it more difficult for those health workers, making it more difficult for the public system to cope because it is planning to put more pressure on that system through the people who are going to leave private health insurance. It is just completely illogical for the government to come up with a policy that says, 'We're going to make things even worse for the public health system.' The health system cannot bear any more; it is at stretched point. There is no doubt about that.


What else are we going to see? We see a deterioration of the risk pool. What is that going to do? That is going to increase premiums for those still remaining in private health insurance. The government come up with arguments that they think are appropriate for why this should be happening, but at the end of the day it is going to put costs up for those people who are going to remain in the private health system. It is interesting, isn't it? We often see the Labor government implying that private health insurance is for the rich. It is not. It is actually for people who are taking the opportunity to make sure that they have the financial support they need at times when their health is at risk. That makes sense, and that is why we brought it in in the first place. But this government is prepared to say that private health insurance is for the rich.


It is interesting: 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000, and 3.4 million have an annual household income of less than $35,000. I know that the government will argue that that does not apply under the changes. But it does. By association, by those risks that are put in place, the costs are going to go up for people remaining in private health insurance, because of the critical mass of people who will now shift out of private health insurance into the public system. Those people will be affected, and they will be affected quite badly. So for the government to say in any way shape or form that those people are not affected is simply untrue.


When we look at the Medicare system and how it is going to be impacted by this, it is just extraordinary that the government clearly does not realise what the impact of this is going to be. I take Senator Xenophon's point that he made earlier about unintended consequences. I think that there are going to be many. Coming back to my initial point, the government is simply not thinking through policy properly. And, as Minister Conroy has just joined us, the NBN is a classic example of policy that has not been thought through properly—but I will get to that a little bit later.


I also just want to touch on another point that Senator Xenophon raised, about ancillary cover. This is the importance of allied health and the fact that the work has not been done to see what the impact is going to be from the resultant changes on those who have ancillary cover now. This is a real problem. It is going to be a real issue, particularly for regional communities, where getting access to allied health is a real problem, as my good colleague Senator Macdonald would know very well. So what impact is this change going to have on the provision of those services, particularly to people in regional communities?


I doubt that the government has an answer. Perhaps, if we have time, during the committee stage we may be able to get some kind of response from the government—perhaps a few moments here or there, seeing that they are keen on guillotining just about everything at the moment. But what impact is that going to have? I suspect that the government have absolutely no idea what that impact is going to be. I suspect that the government have not even considered it, because it has become quite obvious over many months and years of Labor government now that the government simply do not understand regional Australia. They do not understand the impact that their bodgie, ill-thought-through policies are having, particularly on our regional communities.


When we look at the changes and the direct analysis of what this is going to do, there are going to be 2.4 million people directly affected with the immediate increases in the premiums at 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent in the respective income tiers for those under 65. Isn't that interesting? Reflecting on what I said before, I will just quote the shadow minister, Peter Dutton, because I think he put it very clearly: 'There are 12 million Australians who have private health insurance. It is not the playground of the rich, because, of that 12 million, almost six million people are on incomes of less than $50,000, and over time everybody's premiums will go up if you drive the healthy and the young out of private health insurance.' It says it all, really, and the government clearly do not understand that implication. They clearly have no understanding, even though the government owned insurer, Medibank Private, predicted 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and that 92½ thousand will downgrade.


I know that many of my colleagues have quoted the Deloitte analysis, but I think it is worth while doing it again. In the first year, 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 to downgrade it. Over five years, 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. Private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be, there will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system and there will be $4.6 billion in revenue removed from the private sector as a result of consumers withdrawing and downgrading their private health cover.


How can anybody look at those facts and think that this is any kind of sensible, balanced, well-thought-through policy whatsoever? You cannot. You simply cannot do that. Again, the government in its inability to properly think through policy has come up with yet another dog. Why should we be surprised, colleagues? We have had years and years of shambolic policy from this government, and this is just another example.


I think it is worth while, for the benefit of the Senate and those who may be listening, running through some of those shambolic policies to show the form that the government has in its absolute inability to govern this country properly. Firstly—and I know that my very good colleague Senator Cash will know all about this one—Labor's failed border protection policies, which have blown out the immigration budget by around $4 billion over the last three years and where more than $5 million has been spent on preparing the government's abandoned Malaysian people swap deal. I have to commend Senator Cash for the work she has done in this area. Very few people understand it better than she does. But what a mess! What an absolute mess! And it is all the fault of this government. It changed a policy that was working. There were no boats. And yet now we see from this government an absolutely shambolic piece of policy that has resulted in the chaos that we have when it comes to our border protection.


And who could forget the Home Insulation Program, the pink batts? There was $2.5 billion mismanaged, with at least $500 million to be spent fixing the mistakes. Computers in Schools: a $1.4 billion blowout and way behind schedule. Green Loans and Green Start: $175 million for the Green Loans Program mismanaged and then eventually dumped, then replaced with the $130 million Green Start program that never started! The solar homes program: $850 million blowout and the program cancelled. The program was originally meant to cost $150 million. There was the set-top box program at an average of $350 a home, but interestingly—




Senator Conroy:
  Why do you hate pensioners? You voted for it, you hypocrite! You voted for it!




Senator NASH:
  Ah—good to see you have woken up, Minister. Just let me finish and we will come back to that later.


Let us have a look at Harvey Norman. Gosh, they are offering the same deal for $168. Hm, let's see: government, $350 a home and Harvey Norman, $168. It does not seem to really stack up that well, does it, colleagues?



Senator Conroy interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  Order! Senator Conroy!




Senator NASH:
  Absolute mismanagement! And then we get to the Labor talkfests—



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy, please come to order!




Senator NASH:
  Speaking of talkfests, we can see why they do that. Senator Conroy is having a good go from the other side. Labor's talkfests include the 2020 Summit for $2 million, the Henry tax review for $10 million, the tax summit for $1 million and the jobs summit, but with hardly any outcomes. Here are two the people of Australia were absolutely enamoured of: Fuelwatch and GROCERYchoice! Weren't they great? Remember those, colleagues? Fuelwatch was going to fix the problem! GROCERYchoice was going to fix the problem! Nearly $30 million was spent setting them up, and then what happened? Any good outcomes? Let me see. No. Oh, gosh. What happened? They were dumped—$30 million and they were dumped. I am sure there are plenty of people in regional communities who think that $30 million could have been much better spent out in the regions, but no; we had it for Fuelwatch and GROCERYchoice.


Then, of course, there is Senator Conroy's NBN. What was that? Was it $4.7 billion to start with, blown out to more than $50 billion? The other thing is: was there ever a proper business case to justify the spending? Let me see, colleagues. Guess what the answer is: clearly no. This is yet another example of policy on the run from this government, which is simply inept. It cannot run the country. I have people saying to me they just wish we had a grown-up government that was able to run the country properly.


We saw the absolute debacle of the live cattle export trade. The fact that the government, panicked and on the run, shut down the live export trade was absolutely appalling and an indictment of this government, and it was yet another example of the government's complete lack of understanding of regional Australia. I say to those on the other side that if they had been travelling around during the inquiry, talking to the people on the ground and seeing how that stupid, stupid decision affected people in their homes and businesses then they would know that they are simply inept.


In all of this, we also see the government promise 64 GP superclinics. They have delivered 19 and scrapped two in the process. Here is my particular favourite—this one I love. We were talking about waste, mismanagement and government being inept. The government sold the parliament­ary billiard tables for $5,000 and then spent $102,500 finding out whether we got true value for money. If that does not encapsulate the absolutely inept nature of this government and its absolute inability to run the country properly, I do not know what does.


What really gets to people is being lied to. They really are starting to get hot under the collar, because every single time they turn around something else comes out from the government that is yet another backflip, another lie or another untruth, and they are sick of it. These are people out there in the communities—particularly, as I say, in regional communities—that I am talking to and that are trying to bring up their children, run their families, homes or businesses and instil in their children good ethics about how not to lie, how to be straight and how to tell the truth, and then they look at this government and every single time they turn around there seems to be another untruth.


I know some of my colleagues have raised these already, but as examples of the fact that you cannot trust this government these are absolute corkers. When it comes to the private health insurance legislation, we look at the then health minister, Nicola Roxon, saying on 24 February 2009:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


Mr Kevin Rudd said on 25 February:


The Private Health Insurance Rebate policy remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.


This is Mr Rudd again, in 2007:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


One perhaps thinks that if Mr Rudd had got a few more votes then maybe we would not be having this, but who would know? That is a story for another day that I suspect may well come back another day. Then we look at the now Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, saying back in 2005:


The truth is that I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate … For all Australians who wanted to have private health insurance, the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election.


The difference between Tony ""rock solid, iron-clad"" Abbott and me is that when I make an ""iron-clad commitment"", I actually intend on keeping it.


Absolutely extraordinary. They are the words out of the mouth of the woman who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, who has put the private health insurance legislation in front of us today.


So how on earth can anybody across this country believe anything this shambolic Labor government says? They heard those words coming from the Prime Minister in 2005. Obviously she was telling an untruth, because we now have changes to private health insurance in front of us. What does that do for people? That twigs another memory and another recognition from before the last election which goes something like, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This is the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard. What are we having in about 109 days from now? A carbon tax. What is that carbon tax going to do? It is going to hurt every Australian, and it is going to hurt regional Australians harder than anyone else. It is going to hurt our farmers harder than virtually anyone else, with fuel, electricity, fertiliser and transport costs right across the board, and those farmers have nowhere to pass those costs onto. That is only a little more than 100 days away. We sit on this side of the chamber looking at the other side, at the government, every day and saying: 'You are appalling. You have no ability to run the country. You are completely inept.'


We see again with this piece of legislation in front of us the inability of this Labor government to properly think things through, to properly look at the consequences of its actions and to properly provide decent, sound, well-thought-through policy for the people of this nation. Colleagues, I tell you what: Australians around this country are fast, fast coming to the conclusion that this government is unable to run this country and it is time for a change.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,14,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:52):  I want to commence my contribution to this debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and the associated bills exactly where Senator Nash finished off, and that is by quoting our current Prime Minister, the leader of the Labor Party, who said this in a letter to the Hobart Mercury:


I grow tired of saying this—Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


That was said by our Prime Minister. How can any Australian trust anything this person says? Indeed, how can any Australian, or Queenslander, accept anything any Labor Party leader says? Ms Gillard again, writing to the Courier-Mail in Queensland, responding to another letter to the editor, said:


YOUR correspondent … should have no concern that Labor will ""erode"" or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee of that on a number of occasions.


That is our Prime Minister. What an embarrassment to Australia that person is. You simply cannot believe anything she says. We all know—it is part of the lexicon now—that Ms Gillard promised, just before the people went to the polls at the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And in a few short days that tax, which has already passed through this parliament, thanks to the Labor Party and the Greens political party, will be imposed upon all Australians—the greatest carbon tax in the world.


As my colleagues have clearly demonstrated, once you remove this rebate people will drop out of the private health insurance system and they will then rely more and more on public hospitals. I cannot talk about public hospitals elsewhere in Australia, but I can talk about the public health system in Queensland, which is an absolute shambles after practically 22 years of Labor rule in Queensland. Do not take my word for it; just go online and google 'Wikipedia Queensland Health', and you will see a litany of the way that Labor cannot run the public health system as it is. In my home town of Townsville, there is a great set of staff at the Townsville general hospital—very dedicated doctors and nurses—but there are never enough of them. And of course the nurses are not very happy because they do not get paid in Queensland because the Labor government in Queensland simply cannot even arrange the payroll for the nursing staff in Queensland Health. This is a typical Labor government administration of health, and it is a typical Labor government administration of the country's—or, in my case, the state of Queensland's—financial system.


In Queensland we had an announcement by Ms Bligh, the leader of the Labor Party there and the current—for another couple of weeks—Premier of that state, that she was going to abolish Queensland Health. She was going to get rid of it; she was going to cut it into two and restructure it. That followed the incident where a supposed Tahitian prince just cleared off with $16 million from Queensland Health. He had been rorting the system for years, but no-one in the Queensland Labor government had any idea of that. Their administration of health in Queensland is legend, and it is legendarily bad. Yet it is to this system which the current federal Labor government, which promised never to interfere with the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, is going to send Queenslanders. This federal government, by taking away the private health insurance rebate, will indeed send more people to the public health system, which, in Queensland, is almost like sending people to their greater detriment, and, in cases where you are dealing with matters of life and death, could be sending them to a more terminal future. That is what this legislation will do.


Time is not going to allow me to go through how the public health system in Queensland will become more overtaxed as a result of this legislation. But now that I see that a number of Labor members have come into the chamber to hear me make this speech, can I just repeat again, in case they did not quite hear me before, this quotation from the Labor Party leader, and our current embarrassment of a Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, who said:


I grow tired of saying this—Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


Can I also repeat what Ms Gillard said in responding to a letter to the editor of the Courier-Mail in my state of Queensland:


YOUR correspondent … should have no concern that Labor will ""erode"" or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate …


Can I repeat that, Mr President?


Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate …


And she goes on to say, in writing:


… I have given an iron-clad guarantee of that on a number of occasions.


Can you believe anything this Labor leader will say? Can you believe anything the Labor leader in Queensland will say when it comes to health ministers? Can you believe anything any Labor member will say? The evidence, the examples, of Labor leaders telling untruths in making commitments is legend. And I fear for my state of Queensland that the Labor leader there will be, as I speak, up in Queensland promising everything to everyone. She will be promising, probably, not to sell the railways—



Senator Furner interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And you, Senator Furner, should know. Did you agree with the sale of the railways when they promised not to do it? Of course you did. What a disgrace any Labor leader is. You simply cannot believe them.

And is it a fact that a minister who fails to report cash grants made to their own electorate to the minister for finance is in breach of the government's own guidelines? Has the minister exempted any ministers from abiding by these rules and, if not, what steps has the minister taken to ensure that ministers do abide by the rules?

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:00):  I think Senator Evans's interjection, if I may say, is quite apposite. But I welcome a question from Senator Sinodinos. I also congratulate him on his appointment to the shadow expenditure review committee to oversight the work of Mr Robb and Mr Hockey. Clearly they need the oversight. 




The PRESIDENT:
  Senator Wong, come to the question. 




Senator WONG:
  I am happy to. I am asked about grants in ministers' own electorates. Can I make it very clear that this government has made significant reforms to improve whole-of-government transparency and accountability in grants programs. We established the guidelines in 2009 and the reason we did so is that we knew about the Howard government's inappropriate allocation of grants that occurred during their period in government, when the allocation of grants was clearly skewed towards Liberal and Nationals seats. I do not think anyone who was an observer of politics or was involved in politics could forget the 'regional rorts' program—a program where grants funding was blatantly skewed— 




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. As you are well aware, the minister is required to be directly relevant to the question. The question asked whether there were any ministers who had failed to report cash grants in the past two years. That can only be a request for the names of ministers and, if so, who were they? There is nothing the minister has said in response that is directly relevant or even vaguely relevant to the question asked of her. 




The PRESIDENT:
  There is no point of order at this stage. The minister has 57 seconds remaining to answer the question. 




Senator WONG:
  Thank you, Mr President. The guidelines are what is relevant to the answer here and what is relevant to the question, and Senator Sinodinos would know that. As I said, we implemented the first ever comprehensive guidelines established at the Commonwealth level to ensure transparency— 




Senator Abetz:
  Can we talk about ministers? 




Senator WONG:
  It is the guidelines which are relevant to the answer. The ANAO has assessed—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Will you settle down? The ANAO has assessed the implementation of these guidelines. Senator Abetz does not seem to understand this. 




Senator Abetz:
  I understand it very well.




Senator WONG:
  Senator Abetz does not understand. The Audit Office has noted positively for the first time that the government's expectation for ministers, agencies and officials when performing duties in relation to grants administration was clearly articulated. In the latest report, the ANAO examined some 800 ministerial briefs and identified out of the 800 only 33 cases of underreporting of grants in a minister's own electorate. 




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, you have given this minister enormous latitude. She has two seconds to go. She was asked to name the ministers. That is all she was asked. You have given her latitude for a minute and 58 seconds. 



Honourable senators interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:
  Order! On both sides! Senator Brandis is entitled to be heard and I am entitled to hear him. 




Senator Brandis:
  The minister has taken a minute and 58 seconds to criticise the Howard government and to speak in general terms about the guidelines. She has two seconds to go. It cannot possibly be right to say that she is entitled at this late stage in the question to avoid coming to the question—that is, name the ministers. 




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. If Senator Brandis refrained from such spurious points of order and listened to the answer that the minister was providing, she gave some general background as to the guidelines and their history and then went to the number of cases. If he had listened he would probably have heard his full answer. 




The PRESIDENT:
  The minister has two seconds remaining to address the question that has been asked by Senator Sinodinos. 




Senator WONG:
  The Audit Office has identified 33 cases out of 800 of underreporting. (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:05):  In relation to the last aspect of that multifaceted question, my department, at my request, has already commenced action in response to the audit report. The secretary of the department wrote to all portfolio secretaries in January, reminding them of their obligations under the guidelines and drawing their attention to any shortcomings in agency practices that the Audit Office had identified. 


I also would just indicate to the senator that the information was audited in confidence and was provided to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The classification of this information is a matter for the Auditor-General. The information was provided to the JCPAA and I understand that the JCPAA will be considering how the information is dealt with. I think I have very thoroughly, if I may say, responded to Senator Sinodinos's question. But what is interesting, of course, is the reason they asked Senator Sinodinos to ask this question is that none of the former ministers over there could have asked it.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:12):  As I said in answer to the first supplementary question, the information is ordered in confidence. It was provided to the JCPAA. The classification of this information is a matter for the Auditor-General. I am advised that the JCPAA will consider how the information is dealt with. I also make this point clear: my department has examined all instances identified by the Audit Office and is of the view that no further action is required with regard to those grants. My department has examined all instances identified by the Audit Office and is of the view that no further action is required with regard to those grants. What we have is a government that is being far more transparent than those opposite ever were. We all remember regional rorts.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order.




Senator WONG:
  You are so sensitive, Senator Brandis.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, resume your seat.




Senator Brandis:
  In the primary question the minister was asked one thing: to name the ministers. You gave her all the latitude in the world, and after the expiry of two minutes she had not approached the question. In the second supplementary she was asked again to name the ministers. She has still not done so. Given that she defied the standing orders by refusing to deal with the primary question and by refusing to abide by your ruling in relation to the primary question, you should bring her to the question now and direct that she name the ministers.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, on the point of order, perhaps you could remind Senator Brandis that you ruled he had no point of order—



The PRESIDENT:  This is not debating time. If you wish to speak on the point of order you may.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I do wish to speak on the point of order because Senator Wong has been directly relevant. The opposition may not like the answer they have received. Senator Brandis should receive an education in the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. It was cruel that Senator Sinodinos was asked to ask this question, given his record of lost ministers during his period assisting the Prime Minister. 



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I believe the minister has been addressing the question. The minister has 10 seconds remaining. Minister, if you have anything further to add you have 10 seconds.




Senator WONG:
  I have now, on a number of occasions, explained that the information is ordered in confidence. That classification is a matter for the Auditor-General and the JCPAA is considering it. The fact that the opposition do not like that answer does not make it not relevant. (Time expired)

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sinodinos and Cormann today relating to the ministerial code of conduct and to the appointment of the next chair of the Future Fund.


There is a Yiddish proverb that says, 'a half truth is a whole lie,' and when people are evasive, misleading and nefarious we find that what they are doing is covering up the issue. The premise of Minister Wong's response was that no recommendation was given as to who should be the head of the Future Fund. Quite obviously, and apparently, this is not correct. This is not so much a question about the capabilities of the former Treasurer of Australia, the person who actually took us out of recession, the person who was appointed by the Labor Party—the Hon. Peter Costello. This is not a question about Mr David Gonski, a very respected businessperson. It is absolutely a question about the honesty in the answer delivered by Minister Penny Wong.


Sometimes you do not have to see the truth to know the truth. Quite obviously there was a recommendation and, quite clearly, Minister Wong has said on a number of occasions in both the printed media and in this chamber that no recommendation was given. But we have found out conclusively that there was an oral recommendation given. If she believes that is not the case, then she is calling David Gonski a liar. If she believes that Peter Costello does not have the 'requisite capabilities', then why did the Labor Party appoint him to the Future Fund? 


We have a litany of inconsistencies. A minister who has been held up in the past as being of more honourable character than maybe some others has now sullied her own name and created questions about whether she has misled this place or the general public. It is quite evident that the statements of Mr Gonski are completely incongruous with the statements of Minister Wong. If Mr Gonski did not give a recommendation, as she states, then that clearly indicates that Mr Gonski did not give a recommendation that Mr Gonski should be the leader of the Future Fund. So he did not recommend himself and I would suggest that he knows himself better than anybody else. So he obviously did not believe that he had the requisite capabilities to be the leader of the Future Fund and we have clearly found that he recommended, in an oral form, that Mr Costello be the head of the Future Fund. Yet this is not the story that Minister Wong is telling us. So this is yet another sign of the complete lack of capacity for the truth that is so self-evident in the Labor Party.


On the requirement of the presentation of documents, they have hidden and slithered and sleazed away from delivering the truth so we can all see it. When Minister Wong was asked about the presentation of documents, we got yet another statement. She said the chamber voted against the presentation of documents. You can see even in her words that she is avoiding the facts, that she is hiding the truth. The chamber? No, the Greens and the Labor Party voted against the presentation of documents. In a later little dissertation of her own, she referred to the great Peter Costello. Well, if it is the great Peter Costello, then surely this is the same great Peter Costello that she says does not have the 'requisite capabilities to be head of the Future Fund'.


The Australian people now have a situation where Minister Wong has become, in a funny way, very similar to a former President of the United States, George W Bush. They had a selection criteria as to who was going to be the Vice-President of the United States. They made a person who was head of a giant oil field service company in Dallas the selector. That person's name was Dick Cheney. Later on President Bush rang up Dick Cheney and told Dick Cheney to select himself. It is strange, isn't it, how after a period of time there is this almost Orwellian place where we find it very hard to tell the men from the pigs and the pigs from the men. But we have arrived at this spot now. To be honest, it is not about Mr Gonski and it is not about Mr Costello; it is about the Labor Party, it is about Minister Wong and it is all about lies.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania) (15:11):  It is a pleasure to participate in this debate. The contribution that we just heard from Senator Joyce—and members of the Liberal opposition in their questioning of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong—frankly highlights both hypocrisy and distraction. That is what the Liberal Party is about in raising this issue. Let me go to the issue of hypocrisy on the appointment of Mr Gonski to the Future Fund. The process has been clear, the appointment has been made. It has been made before the current chair's, Mr Murray, position was to lapse, I understand, by some four weeks.


The Liberal opposition have criticised my colleague, Senator Wong, a fine finance minister, on a number of grounds. Firstly, they talked about transparency in the process. Nothing could have been more thorough and comprehensive and transparent than the process that Minister Wong went through. Compare the process and the comprehensiveness over the last year with that of the past. Where was the open and transparent process when Mr Costello, as Treasurer, appointed the original members to the Future Fund? Why is the Liberal Party criticising the comprehensive and thorough and transparent approach of my colleague, Senator Wong, when they did not apply the same set of criteria and standards when Mr Costello was establishing the Future Fund? Why didn't they apply the same standards? It is hypocrisy.


Mr Costello was a Labor appointee to the Future fund. We did not see many Labor appointments to anything by the former Liberal government when they were in power. I just remind the chamber that Mr Costello is amongst a number of appointments of former Liberals by a Labor government recognising the qualifications that they have to make an ongoing contribution to the public policy debate in a range of positions. This is hypocrisy from them yet again. The Liberal Party come in here and criticise a Labor government for not appointing a former Liberal Treasurer when a Labor government in fact appointed him to the Future Fund. And it appointed a number of other former Liberal and National Party people I could mention. We did not see any of that from a Liberal government when they were in power—again, hypocrisy. But I think the ultimate hypocrisy is that the Liberal Party come in here and criticise us for not making Mr Costello leader of the Future Fund when they never had the confidence to make him leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister. That is rank hypocrisy. The Liberal Party come in here and plead with the Labor Party, 'Please make Mr Costello leader of the Future Fund when we didn't make him Prime Minister.' That is the ultimate hypocrisy and, frankly, the ultimate insult to poor Mr Costello. I am sympathetic to him on at least that score. But it is yet more hypocrisy from those opposite.


If you look at the process that Minister Wong has gone through as the finance minister compared to the previous process of Mr Costello as Treasurer with the original appointments, it is an outstanding example of transparency and thoroughness. A few people got their noses out of joint—and I am not here referring to Mr Costello particularly. I looked at some of the commentary and briefing from some members of the Future Fund last year suggesting in a range of ways that they should be chair of the Future Fund. They got their noses out of joint. They were not appointed. That is part and parcel of what this is all about in terms of the public debate. I notice a couple of people saying: 'Shock horror! The government's actually made an appointment!' Shock horror: governments have been doing that at a federal level for the last hundred years. Governments of the day—Labor and Liberal—have been making appointments to chairs and a whole range of other authorities, so to criticise the minister on that ground is, again, rank hypocrisy.


I could speak for the next five minutes about the number of Liberal and National Party political appointments that have been made. It is hypocrisy— (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  Senator Wong is not telling us the truth about her involvement in the selection of the new chair of the Future Fund. Very clearly again in question time today Minister Wong was hiding behind tricky semantics. What is now clear for all to see is that Mr Gonski told the government that, in his considered opinion, Mr Costello was the most qualified person on the Future Fund board to be its next chair. Minister Wong today was unable to reconcile Mr Gonski's public statements today that the government was told that a majority on the Future Fund board wanted Mr Costello to be the next chair with her own claim that Mr Gonski did not make any recommendation about who to appoint.


There are some important points to be made in relation to the Future Fund. It was the coalition government that established the Future Fund. We established the Future Fund in government to invest the budget surpluses Peter Costello delivered year after year. Ten out of 12 coalition budgets, of course, were surplus budgets. The first one was not, because we inherited a $10 billion black hole and $96 billion worth of government net debt left behind by the then Labor government. The Future Fund would not exist if it were not for Peter Costello. After the last coalition government had paid off $96 billion worth of Labor debt, we set up the Future Fund to put money aside to fund the future Public Service superannuation liability. Every single dollar of capital in the Future Fund has come from Peter Costello's budget surpluses. Labor has not put a single dollar of capital into the Future Fund. Having inherited a strong $22 billion surplus, having inherited $70 billion worth of Commonwealth net assets, Wayne Swan and Penny Wong have turned that around to deliver $167 billion worth of accumulated deficits and taken us to $133 billion worth of government net debt. In the 12 months from December 2010 to December 2011 the budget deficit for this financial year has blown out by a staggering $25 billion. No wonder Wayne Swan and Penny Wong did not want to appoint Peter Costello chair of the Future Fund; clearly Wayne Swan and Penny Wong did not want to be shown up by somebody who actually knows what he is doing.


David Gonski was asked by the government to sound out the Future Fund board to identify who should be the next chair. The verdict was clear: the most qualified person on the board to become its next chair is Peter Costello. But this incompetent, dysfunctional and divided Labor government could not rise to the occasion. They did not have it in them. You do not have to look any further than the Treasurer's press releases about former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to see what a churlish, politically vindictive character our Treasurer is. They could not get this decision right.


The only thing that disqualified Peter Costello from being appointed as the next chair of the Future Fund is that he is a Liberal. This is churlish and politically vindictive in the extreme. Most Australians would not agree with the judgment of this government that being a Liberal should automatically disqualify you from being appointed as the chair of a board like the board of the Future Fund. Most Australians understand that it was Peter Costello who set the Future Fund up and that it was Peter Costello who through sound financial management and surplus budgets put all of its capital in place. People across Australia know that Peter Costello would have provided fine service. Indeed, Mr Gonski, who has now been appointed by the government and whose appointment we have welcomed, actually had the same perspective on the issue.


Then, of course, there is the issue of the Gonski memo. Mr Gonski provided a two-page memo to the Department of Finance and Deregulation summarising the views of Future Fund board members about who should be the next chair of the Future Fund. What does Minister Wong's office do? Minister Wong's office walks up to the press gallery and hands a copy of that memo to Laura Tingle from the Australian Financial Review. She is allowed to read it. She is allowed to know what Future Fund board members think about this, but we, the Senate, are not. I advise the Senate that today I have lodged an FOI application asking for the release of that particular memo, because I think it is in the public interest for it to be released. (Time expired)

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:22):  Well, here we go again, with those opposite once again avoiding the main game in this motion to take note of answers debate. We did have questions from Liberal senators today about some serious policy issues. Senator Ryan asked a question about small business. Senator Williams asked a series of questions about rural and regional health care and rural and regional roads. But, again, they avoid the issues that matter to the people of Australia. They are not interested in talking about tax reform in this country. They are not interested in actually talking about providing benefits for small businesses. And why is that? There is one simple reason: it is because those on that side are opposing a tax cut for small businesses in this country. 


It is almost like we are living in a parallel universe—because it is us on this side, the Labor Party, that are supporting a tax cut for small businesses in this country. We are the ones out there advocating for small business at the moment, saying that they need some tax relief, saying that some of the benefits of the mining boom need to be shared equally amongst other areas in our economy that we recognise are struggling under the weight of the resources boom in this country. But those opposite come into this place and again want to avoid the main game and instead want to discuss procedural issues—and, when you look at the position that they have got themselves into on policy and costings of policy, it is no wonder.


We all know that they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to services when they fund their election promises as we get closer to the election. Australians who are worried about their health care, who are worried about the future of Medicare, who are worried about their reliance on the childcare rebate to make ends meet, who are worried about their tax cuts and who are worried about the increases in their pension want to know from those opposite what their policy is on these important issues that affect the lives of everyday Australians. But, once again, those opposite are not willing to discuss those issues. The reason is simple: it is because they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to services that affect the lives of ordinary Australians. It is no wonder they do not want to talk about those issues. I would not want to talk about those issues either if I were them. How can you sell $70 billion worth of cuts to services for working Australians?


Those opposite come in here because they have their knickers in a knot about the fact that their scorned former Treasurer has not been appointed as the chair of Australia's Future Fund. We need to ask the question: why is Peter Costello scorned? Why is he feeling this scorn? There is one simple reason. It is because those opposite did not appoint him as their leader and Prime Minister of this country. When they had the chance to tap John Howard on the shoulder, they avoided the opportunity because they did not believe that Peter Costello was up to it. They did not have the confidence. Despite John Howard being Prime Minister for 11 years—11 years as leader of their party—and despite him being on the nose when it came to the polls and the views of the Australian public, those opposite did not have the confidence to tap John Howard on the shoulder and give the job to Peter Costello. They did not have the confidence, they did not have the trust, they did not have the faith in Peter Costello to lead their party or to lead their country. Now they want the Labor Party to clean up the mess that they created.


I have asked myself why that is. Why is it that they are now asking us to clean it up? I have got to say that I think it has a lot to do with guilt. I think their Christian guilt has got the better of them. Look at you: you are all laughing but that is the real reason, isn't it? Your Christian guilt has got the better of you. You know that you missed the opportunity of a lifetime to appoint Peter Costello as leader. You know you all feel bad about it. You know you cannot sleep at night when you think about the fact that you dudded him, and now you want us to fix up your mess. Unfortunately, we do not govern like that. For those opposite it is unfortunate, but we do not govern like that. We are not into righting the wrongs of the Liberal Party and making sure that their guilt over the past disappears. We believe that David Gonski is the best person to chair the Future Fund and that is why he has been appointed. (Time expired)

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (15:27):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions asked by me and by my esteemed colleague Senator Cormann. May I begin by saying that I am surprised that we on this side are being accused of having a conscience. This is new for the Labor Party: they accuse us of having a conscience! I will approach this debate in that spirit. 


I think the answers in question time today displayed that yet again Labor is failing to stand up for the principles which they laid down from 2007 onwards in terms of the standards they would apply on various issues. We were told in 2007 that there would be a new regime of accountability around a whole slew of important issues: grants—which I will come to in a moment—government-funded advertising, FOI, election funding, governance of public organisations and statutory authorities. On all of these issues we were told it was a new dawn. The tawdry Howard regime was gone—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Interesting to hear you describe it that way!




Senator SINODINOS:
  and we were all going to be held to a much higher level of accountability. I will come to you in a minute, Senator Collins, if you like. The fact of the matter is that, in that time, Labor did implement those new standards and then proceeded to either ignore them or water them down on the way through. If I look at government advertising, for example, we were promised a new regime—a regime which included a much more active role for the Auditor-General. But when push came to shove around important items, like the much-lamented carbon tax, for example, the government watered down the guidelines about the extent to which outside bodies and outside experts would be allowed to scrutinise these major pieces of government expenditure.


So advertising failed. We come to the grants process we were talking about today in question time. Again, a fail. Senator Wong was unable or unwilling to name the ministers who, in 33 cases, had failed to disclose that they made grants in their own electorates. This was a requirement that this government had put in. It is not something that we required of them. In our time we had robust internal processes for this sort of thing. Labor made a big song and dance about the fact that it was a new dawn in this area, yet the minister has failed to hold those ministers to account—House of Representatives ministers in all those cases. In particular she has failed to hold to account those ministers who may have made grants against the recommendation of their own department. Again, it is a failure of transparency. Fail on that one. Going further, I note that if Penny Wong's department had reviewed the 33 cases and determined there was no concern why could she not name the ministers? What have they got to hide? If a department has the information, as opposed to the Audit Office, how can it be audit in confidence? The fact of the matter is that the information is out there. We know there are 33 cases and the minister should have named them. 


I could go on to a slew of issues around FOI and electorate funding, where promises were made by the government and have not been kept. But we come to the governance of the Future Fund, and again we have a seriously corrupted selection process. Why? First of all, we had a search firm given the job of identifying candidates and its job was cut short. We are then told that David Gonski, a respected figure in corporate Australia, was brought into the equation. He seems to have been given the job of talking to the guardians of the Future Fund to ask them what they wanted. You do not ask someone what they want unless you are seriously going to take their views into account. It seems that Gonski was sent off to do that. He came back with the answer. They did not like the answer, so there had to be a further process. It shows the lack of imagination and the lack of contacts and networks of this government, and this Treasurer in particular, in corporate Australia. They could not think of anybody else but the person who happened to be in front of them. As good a person as he may be and as well connected as he may be, they had no alternative—and they were up against the clock: they had to do something; they had to appoint someone. They looked around the room and they said: 'Well, Gonski's here and he doesn't seem to be demurring. Maybe we should get him to do the job. Maybe he'll be okay.' 


Then we have the farce that Senator Cormann has highlighted so well around the leak to the Financial Review. How absurd is it that the Financial Review has more access to the workings of this government than this parliament? What an insult to this parliament. We have to do much better than that.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:38):  By leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 12 March 2012, of the Honourable Douglas Barr Scott, former Senator for New South Wales in 1970 and from 1974 to 1985, former Deputy President of the Senate from 1978 to 1979 and former Federal Minister for Special Trade Representations from 1979 to 1980, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Throughout his 15-year career in politics, Senator Douglas Barr Scott contributed in a wide variety of roles. I am sure those who knew him, and I believe that Senator Nash did know Senator Scott, will be best placed to make a more in-depth and personal contribution than I can. I can, however, acknowledge his significant contribution to the Senate and to public life in Australia through his involvement in the federal parliament. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Pamela, and his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:40):  I rise to make a contribution today to the condolence motion for the Hon. Doug Barr Scott. I did have the good fortune on a couple of occasions to meet Doug, and when I did it really struck me that, even though it was many years after he had left the Senate, he still carried with him a very strong sense of character. He was very imposing, he was a man that you certainly knew was in the room, and he carried that gravitas with him all his life.


In the interests of time—and I am aware that we do not have very much time—I will not spend a lot of time going through the chronological information in relation to Mr Scott, because we can do that through other channels. I really just want to touch on a few things about him. He was born in 1920, he was a farmer and grazier at Grenfell, and he had a real passion for regional communities and looking to the future to plan, to try and make things better and to fully utilise his opportunity to make a contribution in this place on behalf of regional communities. To his wife, Pamela, children, Dianne and Andrew, and all of his family, I extend on behalf of all of the coalition our very sincere condolences to them at this time.


Mr Scott was a Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1945 and had many roles here in the parliament. He was Deputy Leader of the National Country Party in the Senate—



An honourable senator:  Was he?




Senator NASH:
  He was indeed. I, as deputy leader of the now National Party in the Senate, do feel a sense of kinship there. He was also Leader of the National Party in the Senate from 21 February 1980 to 1985. The party of course changed its name in that time, and he was appointed to many ministerial and parliamentary positions.


Somebody who did know Mr Scott very well was the Hon. Ian Armstrong OBE, AM, the former leader of the Nationals in New South Wales and former deputy premier. Ian had some observations to make about the Hon. Doug Scott which, importantly, come from him as someone who knew Mr Scott very well. Mr Armstrong said Mr Scott was kindly referred to as 'Senator Doug', which is really quite lovely, and that he was a man of great integrity. Ian said, 'Whatever he said, he researched well and articulated to the highest degree,' and that he had several passions. 


Mr Scott's first passion was his family, and I note that in his maiden speech he referred to the family often. His second passion was his duties as a farmer. His third passion was for his district and his community, and his fourth passion was to map out a vision for the future short-, medium- and long-term plans for the nation. Mr Scott was apparently a tremendous sportsman. He was one of the best tennis players in the district and considered playing it at a state level. He was a very imposing figure in any crowd.


When I read through his maiden speech, it struck me how sometimes time does not move on and so many of those things that relate to regional communities that Doug was so passionate about still remain today. Indeed, in his maiden speech on 2 September 1970 he said:


I am concerned that the Federal Government should enter still more vigorously in cooperation with the States upon an attempt at real decentralisation, at real population balance in this magnificent country, so that we may in fact stem the tide of population drift which threatens rural Australia today. The drift is from the towns and the villages and the farms to the metropolitan colossi of our coastline.


I hope that Doug would have known that there are many of us on this side of the chamber who are certainly continuing to push that case that he started, that he was so involved with, regarding decentralisation.


Doug also made another very interesting suggestion in his maiden speech which I thought he put very well:


… and a suggestion that we should temper our concern for pure theory with social and political considerations lest we become slaves to ivory towered conceptions.


In closing, in his final speech I thought he really showed his consideration of others. He began his final speech by saying:


Mr President and honourable senators, I really ought to apologise for being part of the cause of keeping you away from your lunch on this Friday afternoon.


He went on in his final speech, 15 years later, to refer back to what he had said in his maiden speech:


… I think I said that we should not regard ivory tower concepts as being the total answer. Unless things work among people in the community it does not matter how magnificent the theory is on a piece of paper; you had better alter it.


I think that speaks very clearly and very loudly for many in regional communities today.


Mr Scott concluded his final speech by saying:


Mr President and honourable senators, thank you for the past 15 years.


On behalf of the National Party and the Liberal Party, I today place on record our very sincere appreciation for the enormous contribution to the Senate, regional communities and the nation that was made by the Hon. Doug Scott.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:46):  When question time interrupted my contribution on this, many Labor senators had come in to hear what I had to say about this particular bill. I see they have all left now and, for the record, there are two Labor people in the chamber. Clearly, they did not like what I was saying. I was reminding the people of Australia that our Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, the leader of the Labor Party, had said some time ago:


I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


She may have been committed to it before an election, as she was committed to not introducing a carbon tax. Clearly, with Ms Gillard you cannot trust or take at face value anything at all that she promises. This bill that we are dealing with today is removing the private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent that Ms Gillard promised Labor was committed to. In a letter to a newspaper about a correspondent who had written about Labor and private health insurance Ms Gillard said:


Your correspondent … should have no concerns that Labor will erode or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee on that on a number of occasions.


We have learnt that with Ms Gillard her iron-clad guarantees and her solemn promises to the Australian public before an election mean absolutely nothing. I say to the people of Australia: how can you ever believe anything Ms Gillard might say or promise at any time in the future? It does seem to be a Labor leader's disease.


In my own state of Queensland we had the Labor leader Ms Anna Bligh, the current Premier—or Premier for another week or so anyhow—promising before an election some time ago that the 8c subsidy which Queensland motorists enjoyed on their fuel would never be removed. Immediately she got into power, she did the Labor thing, completely rejected her promise and removed the 8c subsidy. She also promised time and time again that she would not sell public assets. For example, she would not sell Queensland Rail, but we all know the history of that now. Labor actually sold the state-run rail service in breach of a commitment.


The relevance of that to this debate on the removal of the health insurance rebate is this: everybody knows that, once you remove that incentive, people will not be able to afford, and therefore will leave, private health insurance. Where are they going to go to get their health services? They will go to the public hospitals. In Queensland the public hospitals are already grossly overextended. Whilst the nurses and doctors at the hospitals do a fantastic job, they are held back by understaffing, underpayment, underfunding, no beds and huge queues in the hallways and on the ramps because of state government mismanagement. The way public hospitals are run is a standing joke in Queensland. Ms Bligh said recently:


What is absolutely clear I think now beyond any doubt, … is that this organisation—


Queensland Health—


in its current form has a culture that is so entrenched it won't be changed while it's kept in that form.


She went on to say that Queensland Health was in diabolical trouble. She forgot to mention, of course, that it was that way because Labor has been in power for 22 years in Queensland, bar a few months in the mid-90s. Ms Bligh also said that the Queensland Health corporate office had failed in areas like staff accommodation, information technology, financial controls and human resources. So, the Labor Party's answer to address these problems is to split up Queensland Health. Somehow, that is going to solve all the problems that have been created.


In a recent newspaper report Ms Bligh is quoted as defending what are arguably—and I do not think that even anyone from the Labor Party in Queensland would argue with me on this—the worst health ministers Queensland has seen, that is, Stephen Robertson, Paul Lucas and currently Geoff Wilson. Ms Bligh says that it is not their fault it has all gone bad, it is somebody else's fault. What happens with Queensland Health is never the government's fault and never the Labor Party's fault.


This legislation that we are debating today appears because the Greens and the Labor Party are one and the same these days—they are both part of the same organisation—and they both want to remove private health insurance. This means that more and more people in my state of Queensland will have to rely on Queensland Health for their health servicing. That fills me with fear and trepidation because I know how badly run Queensland Health is now under the Labor government, and it will get even worse when more and more people actually come into the system.


The litany of mismanagement in Queensland Health is breathtaking, although when you compare it with pink batts, dodgy school hall contracts, Green Loans that are then not Green Loans and solar panel rebates and subsidies that are cancelled ahead of time, perhaps it is not so surprising that Queensland Health is so mismanaged. The reason is quite clear, of course: you simply cannot trust Labor with money. Some of Labor are quite nice people but their experience in running business is usually that they went to university, they sat around the latte shops, they joined a union or they worked for another Labor politician, they had their seat bequeathed to them by a relative within the Labor Party and they came into parliament. Very few of them have ever had any real experience in real life. Certainly, you could count on one hand the number in this chamber—and I suggest on two hands the number in both chambers of this parliament—of those Labor Party people who have had any experience whatsoever in running a business and in financial management.


I suppose someone will say to me, 'Well, Senator Doug Cameron has been involved in business. He has been a director of one of those industry super funds.' I was not aware of this until I saw recently that the unions were actually suing some of the directors for the big fees that they get. Apparently it is a union thing that if you get money because you are appointed to boards because you are a union member that the money does not go in your pocket, it has to come back to the union. Some of the directors have not been—




Senator Edwards:
  Outrageous!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is outrageous, Senator Edwards. Apparently, some of the directors have not been playing fair; they have been pocketing the very big money that they get and not giving it to the unions. So the unions have sued them. That is a court case that I really want to follow through. But I am still waiting for Senator Dougie Cameron, who I read has been a director of one of these industry super funds, to tell me what board fees he got from that position. It would be very interesting to hear that. No doubt, he might come and tell me in his contribution. But he might claim that running an industry super fund is his way of getting business experience. If it is—and I very much doubt it—I suspect that the business members on those boards are the ones that run them and the union members just go along for the ride.


However, I digress from my point in that the removal of this health insurance rebate will increase enormously the burden on hospitals right throughout Australia. But as a Queensland senator I am very concerned that they will impose heavily on the health system in Queensland, which is almost breaking under the strain and which creaks its way through. Because I do not want this to be misunderstood, I repeat that the men and women—the doctors and nurses, orderlies and support staff—who support those hospitals do a fantastic job in difficult circumstances. The Labor Party has administered health to the extent that for—what was it?—three or four weeks the nurses could not even get paid. This is the system. Some of them tell me that they still have not been paid their full entitlements from that time. But it is not the minister's fault; it is not the Premier's fault and it is not the Labor Party's fault. It is always someone else's fault.


So I am concerned with this bill before us. On that point alone—and there have been a lot of very good arguments raised in this debate so far on why this legislation should be defeated—I call on Queensland Labor senators to cross the floor and vote against this. They know that this legislation, when passed, will throw extra burden onto a health system in my state of Queensland which is already unable to deal with the tasks before it. It is essential, I think, that I do call upon Labor senators from Queensland in particular to join us in defeating this bill so that the already overworked system in Queensland will not be further burdened because of the removal of the health insurance rebate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:58):  I rise to make a contribution on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. It is, I have to say, with a sense of deja vu. In the previous government, as shadow parliamentary secretary for health, I found myself debating exactly this topic only a very short period of time after the government had made a promise to the private health insurance industry that they were not looking to make any changes to this particular matter. In fact, I have kept a letter for posterity. I thought that we might have dealt with this issue. It was defeated a number of times during that period, but of course we know that the Greens and the Labor Party have a fundamental dislike of the private sector, particularly in health, so they would not be able to help themselves. They would have to revisit this again and again and again until they progressively dismantled what is recognised as a quality private health insurance system.


On 20 November 2007, when the then federal Labor leader, the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, wrote to Dr Michael Armitage, the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Commission, he said to him:


Thankyou for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance.


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates—


you would think that that is a reasonable commitment that would allay the fears of the industry—


including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy … I trust this allays your concerns.


I think it might be safe to say that at that time it did, but it did not take long for the whole circumstance to change and for private health insurance to start to feel the heat of the Labor dislike for that part of the health system. If it were not for perhaps the greatest political lie, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' this one would have to be up there.


I note the continued attempts by the Labor Party to continue to diminish the private health insurance system in the country. The absurdity of this is that effectively what they are doing is continuing to take money out of the health system. For every dollar in health rebate that they save, they take $3 out of the health system, because for every dollar that is contributed by the government there is $2 contributed by the private insurer. So they are actually diminishing the pool of funding available to health by $3 for every dollar that they take out, and that just does not make sense.


My colleague Senator Macdonald was just talking about the state of the health system in Queensland. He should consider himself lucky that he is not in Tasmania, where the state government is taking $100 million out of the public health system. It is not taking people out of the back door. It is not taking out bureaucrats but closing down front-line public health services. It has carved back the elective surgery waiting list. In my region they were doing about 12 elective surgeries a week. They have cut that back to one or two. So here you have the federal government pouring money, so they tell us, into the public hospital waiting list process to reduce public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery, and you have the state government ripping it out at the other side.


But think of the impact of that on somebody who is waiting for that elective surgery. Think of an individual who is on the waiting list. When this process started, if they were, say, No. 36 on the list and there were 12 elective surgeries being done a week then they would be three weeks away from their surgery. That is something that you can foresee. That is something that you can understand: 'In three weeks time I might be having my knee surgery,' or something of that nature. 'I've got three weeks to wait before I go into my elective surgery.' But when it goes back to one a week they are suddenly 36 weeks away. The whole dimension changes—the proximity and the expectation. They then have to carry that for that 36 weeks if they retain their position on the list. They might be lucky—they might have an urgent case and they might get lifted a bit—but if the list runs the way that things are going then they are 36 weeks away instead of three weeks away. It changes the whole aspect of the way they are dealing with it. Yet this comes on the back of a promise by the Labor Party that they were not going to mess around with private health insurance rebates. People could feel comfortable! It is almost as though the Labor Party are trying to use the fear of the public hospital system to keep people in the private health system. 'Will I get that place in three weeks time, or 36 weeks time? Do I have to wait that long? Do I have to make that decision to protect the health of my family? So I'll have to stay in.' It just does not stack up.


We have seen a bloating of the public sector in Tasmania. We have gone from something like 16 public servants per 1,000 people to 20, a huge bloating of the public service. We have seen nearly a 20 per cent increase in public servants in the last five years in Tasmania as the Tasmanian government has filled up the back rooms, and that is all occurring at the expense of front-line services. So we are seeing a cutback in services not only in health but also in policing and all the other critical front-line services, including closing down schools. Yet it is on the back of continued promises and assurances that these things would be maintained at a federal level in relation to changes to the private health insurance system. There was a letter from the then aspiring Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, stating, 'Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance,' and saying that they were 'committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates'. Now we see them clawing it back and taking with it significant funding out of the health system. The one thing it does do is to continue to confirm that the Australian people cannot trust the Labor Party. I have mentioned one of the greatest political lies of all time—the Prime Minister's assurance that 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—but this is also a fundamental issue. We all talk to our electorates on a regular basis. We all communicate and source what the key issues are in our electorates, because that is part of our role; we want to maintain contact and we want to understand what the issues are that concern our constituents. And health is always in the top two or three—it is always there—and people should be able to believe the assurances they are given by a leader when they say they will maintain the settings that exist around an issue as important as private health insurance. We do not want to go back to the circumstance of enormous pressure being placed on the public system because of an exodus of people from private health insurance. There is no way known that we want to see that circumstance occur. But people are being forced to exit private health insurance because they cannot afford it, because the government has taken away that bit of support at a time when our state governments are under so much financial pressure that they are cutting back on services. But then you place even more and inordinate pressure on the public health system because you are removing resources from the private health system. It just does not stack up.


They talk about egalitarianism and we talk about the wealthy making a contribution but we know that the wealthy already do make a contribution. Over a certain wage level, we all pay a Medicare levy. The more you earn, the more you pay. So, if you are earning more and paying more tax, you are making a significantly higher contribution. Then of course there is the Medicare surcharge, the additional surcharge of 1.5 per cent. So, to suggest that this is all about egalitarianism—those who can afford to pay paying a bit more—does not stack up when you actually look at the sums, because, if you earn more and pay more tax, that one per cent that you pay as your Medicare levy is more if you earn $100,000 than it is if you earn $30,000. It is simple mathematics. You are making a contribution.


So this tripe that gets run out by the government to suggest that we need to get those who are earning a bit more to make a bigger contribution does not stack up, because they are already doing that. What they are doing by taking out private health insurance is looking after their own families. They are making an investment in the assured health of their own families, but they are also making an investment in assisting the public health system. We know this, because colleagues around the chamber are talking about the stress on their state public health systems. Why would the Tasmanian government be taking $100 million out of the Tasmanian health system if it were not for the budget pressures and having beds put in storage away from the hospitals so the hospitals cannot use them if it were not for these pressures? And here we are debating in this place removing money from the health system. The government wants to save its contribution, the 30 per cent rebate. It wants to save that contribution but does not think about the other $2 it takes out of the health system for every dollar it saves. So they are taking out $3, in effect, for the $1 that gets saved by the removal of their contribution. It just does not stack up, and it penalises people who want to make a contribution themselves to look after their families and make sure they have prompt access to the health insurance system when they need it. They are already making a contribution to the public system through the Medicare levy. They are spared the surcharge if they are taking out private health insurance but they are actually making a contribution, and it just does not stack up after years of building a sound and solid private health insurance system that complements the public system. This is not a position of competition; this is about having a broad based health system that serves our community well.


It is not just highly-paid people who have health insurance; there are a lot of low-paid people who make the investment. They make a value judgment to invest in private health insurance. At least they retain support under this process, but you really have to question how long that will last. We know that, all along, the Labor Party have had in the back of their minds, they have had in the bottom drawer all along, plans to start to chip away at the private health insurance system, despite the assurances of Kevin Rudd before the 2007 election. Kevin Rudd put it in writing to Dr Michael Armitage, chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, that 'Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates'. He made that commitment. Yet in 2008, not long after taking government, we saw the process commence: chip away, chip away, chip away, trying to diminish the availability of the services of private health insurance but forgetting that, as they do that, for every dollar they save they take another two out of the system—the ratio of removal of funding.


Now the Greens say, 'We'll just take it out and put it all into the public health system.' That just does not make sense but then the Greens were never very strong on, or really concerned about, economics. It does not surprise me that the Greens have teamed up with the Labor Party and effectively flipped on this, as they usually do. They will get their bit of publicity. They will go out there and get in front of the cameras and pretend they are holding out for something, but you can guarantee that, at the end of the day, on pretty much everything they will just flip across and go with the Labor Party. It is a real tragedy that we see such pressure placed on our public health system through the attempts to pull down the private health sector and the private health insurance system. Again, I come back to the circumstance at home where, as I said before, you are No. 36 on the list. That list goes from 12 a week to one, and you are more than six months away from your operation. That just throws someone's whole life out of balance if they are trying to access the public health system.


The security that private health insurance provides is something that we ought to be encouraging. We should be encouraging people to take out private health insurance, not putting in artificial barriers or saying, 'If you earn more than $150,000 as a family we're going to start to punish you as a family.' A policeman and a schoolteacher are effectively in that range. They are not considering themselves to be rich or wealthy people. They are probably doing it pretty tough at the moment. They are wondering whether the power bill that the government promised would only go up by 10 per cent due to the GST is going to go up by 10 per cent only—I am hearing figures of 18 per cent from industry as I go around the countryside. Yet here we are with the government prepared to give them another hit, to take more from them and to discourage them from looking after their family and their family's health. It does not stack up.


Why take away all this funding from private health insurance, and therefore the private health sector, at a time when, as Senator Macdonald has just said, the Queensland health industry is in strife? Senator Williams has indicated on a number of occasions how bad things are in New South Wales. They have a new government there that is trying to clean up the mess of years and years of Labor neglect. We have heard some terrible tales of things that have occurred in the New South Wales health system, and the state government is trying to pick it up and bring it back. In Tasmania, $100 million has been taken out of the front line of the health system in a small state. Putting beds in storage so that the hospitals cannot use them just does not stack up. At the same time their federal Labor counterparts are taking money out of the private health system, which has the capacity, if sensibly managed, to take the pressure off the public health system and to allow people to get ready access to the services that they need.


When Kevin Rudd came to power after the 2007 election, one of his mantras was 'Let's use evidence based policy.' That has gone out the window. We are not seeing anything about that. We have gone back to the old Labor prejudices: 'Let's sting a bit from those who have worked hard to earn a bit more. Let's take a bit off those.' It is the old yarn: you can only take so much off the wealthy until they do not have any more, and then who are you going to get it from to give to the others? They talk about equity, they talk about all those values they say they have, but there is a whole heap of prejudice that sits behind that, one of which is their prejudice against the private health insurance system.


When you look at the fundamentals of what is being done here, as I have said a number of times, it really just does not stack up. They are taking away the capacity of people to look after their own families, to give them access to health services as they feel they need it, and they are thrusting them towards a state-level health system that is under real stress and having funding removed. As I have said, this does not make sense. It should not be supported. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:18):  This Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation is Labor's latest attack against millions of Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. Labor is anti private health, Labor has always been anti private health and chances are that Labor will always be anti private health in the future. Being anti private health—and I am sure you will agree with me on this, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron—is part of Labor's DNA. This Labor government is doing what other Labor governments have done in the past—that is, attack those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance.


Under Medicare, every single Australian is entitled to free access to universal public hospital care. There are more than 10 million Australians who are prepared to put more of their own resources into the health system, and by taking out private health insurance they help to take pressure off our public hospital system, making sure that those Australians who really cannot afford to take out private health insurance have a good opportunity to have timely access to high-quality public hospital care.


The truth is that we need a strong health system, with a strong and well-funded public system as well as a strong and well-supported private system. As we consider our health policy settings in Australia, it is important that we get that policy balance right. When it comes to getting the policy balance right in the health portfolio, Labor has a very bad track record. If you look at the track record of the Hawke and Keating governments, for example, you will see that private health insurance membership collapsed on Labor's last watch in government, and public hospital queues and public hospital waiting lists continued to increase as more and more people joined those queues and waiting lists. Even the then Labor Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, recognised that, after 10 years of Labor Party government policy, after the Hawke and Keating years, Labor had got it wrong and that things could not continue the way they had been. It was Senator Graham Richardson who commissioned a review into private health and came up with a series of recommendations on how the balance in our health system could be restored. But then Senator Richardson was not able to get his proposals past the Keating cabinet. When he put to the Keating cabinet proposals on how the balance in our health system could be restored and how we could make sure that all Australians would have timely and affordable access to high-quality health care by making sure that we had a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private health system, the cabinet told him where to go, and those proposals went into the Labor-ACTU bin. It is quite humorous if you think about it in retrospect. After Senator Richardson, who was health minister in the Keating government, took proposals to the cabinet on how the balance in our health system could be restored, the then Prime Minister told him to go and consult with the Labor caucus and the ACTU working party. Of course, they buried what were a number of sensible proposals to restore balance to our health system.


Private health insurance membership collapsed under Labor. It went from about 65 per cent to below 30 per cent before a coalition government was able to turn things around. It was the Howard coalition government that was able to restore the necessary and important balance to our health system. It was the Howard government that introduced a series of policy measures to stop the decline in private health insurance membership, to reverse the trend, and to make sure that more Australians who were in a position to afford it were prepared to put their hands in their pockets and put additional private resources into our health system so that all Australians had a better chance to have timely and affordable access to quality hospital care.


The measures that the Howard government put in place, the very successful policy framework that the Howard government put in place, was made up of three principal pillars. There was the Medicare levy surcharge, whereby those Australians who were judged to be able to afford private health insurance but did not have it would incur a tax penalty. That was the stick and then there was the carrot. The carrot was the tax incentive, the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, for those Australians who took out health insurance. The third pillar was Lifetime Health Cover, whereby any Australian who did not join private health insurance until after they had reached 30 years of age had to pay a higher premium for every year after the age of 30.


The Howard government's policy framework was highly successful. It restored balance to our health system, it ensured that the dramatic decline—or collapse—in private health insurance membership in Australia was arrested and it made sure that more Australians were prepared to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. Today more than 10 million Australians are covered by private health insurance. Every single Australian who takes out private health helps to take pressure off our public hospitals and helps to make sure that all Australians are able to get timely access to high-quality public hospital care.


Given Labor's track record, the coalition were always very suspicious about what an incoming Labor government would do in relation to private health insurance. We knew that Labor hates private health. We knew that Labor in government would be likely to try and dismantle the successful measures that had been introduced by the Howard government. We suggested that Labor in government would wind back the private health insurance rebate. Guess what? We were accused of lying to the Australian people. We were accused of misleading the Australian people. We were told, 'No, no, no, under no circumstances would Labor do any such thing.' Even after the election, as late as 24 February 2009, the hapless then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, said:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


It could not get any clearer than that. The day after that ,on 25 February 2009, the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said:


The private health insurance rebate policy remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.


This followed emphatic pre-election promises in the lead-up to the 2007 election, when then Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd said:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


That sounds pretty clear, but we wanted to make absolutely sure because it is known that the Labor Party is very good at tricky semantics, weasel words and trying to hide between the technical meanings of particular phraseology. We saw it from Senator Wong today in her answers about her involvement in the selection of the chair of the Future Fund. Labor is very good at trying to hide behind technical semantics and tricky language. It says things like, 'This isn't exactly what we meant,' or 'Saying we'd keep the rebate doesn't really mean we wouldn't means test it.' I go to another quote from then shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, when she was on Meet the Press on 23 September 2007. That was in the shadow of the 2007 election, about two months before the election. Steve Lewis said to Nicola Roxon:


Let's move to another integral part of the health system, the private health rebate, the 30% rebate. Labor has said ""Yes, we will keep it,"" but you have not said whether you will keep it in total. Can you say now that Labor, if elected, will maintain all of the ancillary measures that encompass the private health rebate?


Nicola Roxon answered:


Yes, I can. We've committed to it. We've committed to the 30%. We've committed to the 35% and 40% for older Australians. It's similar to this safety net. We know that many people rely heavily on the assistance that is now provided and would not be able to have private health insurance if that rebate wasn't paid.


I could not have put it better myself. And on she went:


And lifetime health cover and others that go with it, we are committed to those. We understand that Australia now has a mixed health system, both private and public, and we need them both to be strong in order for the community to be able to get the services.


Very clear, very emphatic. Steve Lewis asked a follow-up question:


So you will not wind back that 30% private health rebate, despite the fact that Labor has been ideologically opposed to it in the past?


Ms Roxon's answer was:


No, we won't. 


You cannot get a more emphatic promise than that. The only more emphatic promise that I can remember in recent times is the promise by the Prime Minister of Australia, five days before the last election, that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—and we know what happened to that. We know that that Prime Minister Gillard before the last election misled the Australian people, the same as Labor has misled the Australian people for years on end about their true intentions in relation to the private health insurance rebate.


The reason the coalition is opposed to this legislation is because we understand that this is bad public policy. Any policy that makes it harder for people to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance is bad policy. Any policy that will push up the cost of private health insurance for millions of Australians is bad policy. Any policy that will see more Australians leave private health and join the public hospital system is bad public policy. Any policy that will see Australia re-enter the spiral that we experienced under the last Labor government, when private health insurance membership across Australia collapsed, is bad public policy.


Senator Colbeck in his remarks earlier was quite right: we should be doing more to encourage more Australians to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. We should be doing more to encourage more Australians to take out private health insurance. We should not be making it harder for people to remain in private health. Let me just address here one of the myths being peddled by the Labor Party. The Labor Party wants us to believe that somehow private health is only for the rich. Nothing could be further from the truth. Hundreds of thousands of people earning less than $50,000 per annum have private health insurance. In fact I will just go to the figures: 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000 per annum and 3.4 million people have an annual household income of less than $35,000 per annum.


The government will say: 'We aren't targeting those people. Those people won't be punished by having their rebate taken away. They'll still have the rebate.' The problem is that, with millions of Australians having their rebates scrapped altogether or dramatically reduced, health insurance for those that lose the rebate will go up automatically, without anything else, by 43 per cent, and every single one of the lower-risk people who perceives that health insurance has become too expensive for them to continue will put upward pressure on premiums for everyone else including those low- and middle-income Australians who every year struggle with the decision to put their money together to pay for their annual private health insurance. 


This of course will hurt all Australians who are in desperate need of timely access to public hospital care, because they will have to now compete with the increasing number of Australians who in the past would have been covered by private health insurance. This is very bad public policy. It is policy that Labor has pursued in the past. The point I would make to the Labor Party is that, if you do not learn from history, you are forced to repeat it. Those are not my words—I have just borrowed them; I do not quite know who first said them—but it is something that the Labor Party should carefully reflect on.


The point is this: our policy objective in the health portfolio should be to come up with a policy framework that ensures all Australians can have timely access to high quality hospital care. In order to achieve that in a way that is affordable for the taxpayer, we have got to make sure that we have got a sensible balance between a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private health system. We need to have a policy framework where those Australians who can afford to take out additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs have both the incentive to take it out and the disincentive not to take it out. That is where the Howard government's policy framework on private health insurance was so successful. Clearly, the Labor Party knew in the lead-up to the 2007 election that not only had it been very successful, it was also very popular. Why else would the Labor Party have bent over backwards again and again, making the most emphatic promise possible that they would not touch the private health insurance rebate, that they would retain the existing private health insurance rebate in its current form? Labor well understood that it was a policy that had worked and a policy that was popular with the Australian people.


I say to the Labor Party: stop making Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs pay for your waste and mismanagement over the last four years. Australians know that the Labor Party in government always stuffs up our public finances. Australians know that after a period of Labor in government it is always incumbent on the coalition to come back and fix up the mess. But don't make Australians who are putting their own private money into our health system pay for your wasteful spending, for your waste and mismanagement. Just because Labor is not able to balance its books, just because Labor delivers deficit after deficit and has taken our debt position back up to $133 billion, do not pursue policy that will ultimately be counter-productive; do not pursue policy that will ultimately increase the costs of providing affordable health care to all Australians. This is a path that you have gone down before. It has ended in tears before. You should learn the lessons of the past. If I can give the new Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, some advice: she should sit down with former senator Graham Richardson, a former Minister for Health, who commissioned a comprehensive review into private health insurance back in 1993 at the end of 10 years of failed Labor Party health policy, and consult with him about the implications and consequences of Labor's failed approach to health policy so she can learn from Labor's mistakes of the past. She should reflect on how successful the Howard government's policy framework in support of those Australians taking out private health insurance has been and reconsider her approach.


My advice to the Senate is that this legislation should be rejected. We should vote against it. It is bad policy. It will see the cost of health insurance go up, it will see more people leave private health insurance and it will put more pressure on our public hospitals. It is not a good policy and the Senate should reject it. (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:38):  The legislation that the Senate is considering to abolish the private health insurance rebate is but the latest instalment in the Australian Labor Party's assault on the Australian middle class. For as long as I have been a senator, I have listened wearily to Labor politicians like Senator Kim Carr over there claim that the Labor Party's purpose is to look after struggling disadvantaged people and I have heard Labor politicians mock my side of politics and say we look after the interests of the well-to-do. But, if you look at this piece of legislation, nothing could be further from the truth because we in the coalition stand with ordinary Australians, everyday Australian families, middle-class Australians, working-class Australians, Australian working families who want to be able to have affordable private health insurance, and the Labor Party stands resolutely against the interests of those people.


Senator Cormann quoted some figures, and forgive me for repeating some of the observations that he made but they cannot be said often enough. The fact is that Australians want private health insurance: 53 per cent of Australians, 12 million people, have private health insurance. They are not the wealthy. I am sure most wealthy people have private health insurance, but the proportion of the private health insurance holders in Australia who could be regarded as wealthy or well-to-do is miniscule. The vast majority of Australians who have private health insurance are middle-class people, working people, working families who do not want to be reliant on the state, who do not want to be reliant on a state system, who want to look after themselves, who want to look after their children and who are prepared to make the extra sacrifices, work the extra few hours a week of overtime, to make that possible. They are aspirational Australians, not the well-to-do, not the toffs that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, occasionally mock, but everyday people. This is an attack on them. It is an attack on their wellbeing, it is an attack on their standard of living, and it is unconscionable.


Not only do 53 per cent of Australians currently have private health insurance but 46 per cent of Australians, almost as many, have hospital treatment cover and, of the people who hold private health insurance, 5.6 million—almost half of them—have annual household incomes of less than $50,000. When almost half of the people who make the sacrifice to pay for private health insurance are earning less than $50,000, what clown—what socialist dreamer—could possibly say private health insurance is the preserve of the wealthy? The whole point of having a private health insurance rebate is to make it affordable to as many people as possible down the income scale. That is why almost half of the people who hold private health insurance earn less than $50,000 a year. It is because coalition governments in years gone by have made it affordable for them.


This Labor government, which was elected in 2007 on the claim that it represented the interests of Australian working families, will make it harder for those poorer Australians—those less well off Australians—to be able to afford private health insurance. So much for the pieties and the crocodile tears of the Australian Labor Party about the interests of less well off Australians. Not only do 5.6 million of the 12 million Australians who hold private health insurance have incomes of less than $50,000 but 3.4 million of them—between a quarter and a third—have an annual household income of less than $35,000. I am sure we all know people—members of our families, people in our neighbourhood, people we know through the workplace—who struggle to keep private health insurance going because they do not want to be dependent on a state system. What an insult to those people, particularly coming from a party that falsely claims to represent the less well-to-do. What an insult to those people to say: 'We will make it less affordable for you. We will force you to be dependent on the state system when you would wish to look after yourself by paying that extra little bit of money for private health insurance.' What an insult to the poor, Senator Kim Carr. What an insult to the strugglers. What an insult to working families of Australia. And yet you sit there complacently, pleased with yourself, thinking that somehow, in some perverse way, this will advance social justice. It does not advance social justice, Senator Carr, to make life harder for poorer people, and that is what this will do. It will make life harder for poorer people. What a disgrace.


Not only is this measure profoundly inequitable—the reverse of social justice—it is also, as Senator Cormann pointed out, bad policy. What it will do is not merely make private health insurance less affordable to poorer people by driving up the cost of premiums; it will force more people into the public system and drive up the cost burdens on the public system. How foolish can that be at a time when there are enormous cost burdens on the health and hospital systems of Australia? And those burdens are escalating with every passing year. We have a measure which will make self-sufficiency harder by making it more difficult for people to insure themselves and, therefore, drive them into the public system, therefore increasing the costs of the public system. So whatever budget savings it might be imagined would be clawed back by this meretricious, dishonest and foolish policy are going to be but a fraction of the additional cost burdens imposed upon the public system and imposed upon public hospitals. What a foolish piece of public policy that is. It is a lose-lose proposition. You make less-well-to-do and poorer people poorer still, you make them dependants upon the state when they wish to be self-sufficient and you impose greater cost burdens on the state system so the state system into which these people have been thrown against their own wishes can less easily cope with that additional burden. So the overall quality of health care in Australia deteriorates. What an extraordinarily inept piece of public policy.


Not only does this measure suffer from the vice of being unjust because it punishes the least well-off people in our country; not only does it suffer from the vice of being foolish public policy because the outcome that will result is the opposite of the objective the policy seeks to serve, which is making the health system more efficient; it is, of course—and this is such a familiar refrain from the Rudd and the Gillard governments—built on a lie. Let us remember who it was who said: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and then introduced the world's greatest carbon tax and congratulated herself on doing do, celebrating her blatant deception of the Australian people by high-fiving her ministers on the floor of the House of Representatives, in one of the most shameful episodes in the history of Australian democracy.




Senator Sinodinos:
  Shame!




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you, Senator Sinodinos. That was the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. Who was it who deceived Mr Andrew Wilkie over poker machine reform and the undertakings that she made to him about poker machine reform the moment she felt she did not need his vote on the floor of the House of Representatives because she had bought the vote of Mr Peter Slipper? The current Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  I think you should withdraw that. You are reflecting on a member of the other house. You should not do that.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I withdraw. Let me rephrase that: had by means about which we can only speculate secured the vote of Mr Peter Slipper. It was the current Prime Minister. And Mr Andrew Wilkie said that he realised that he had been deceived.


This Prime Minister, who lied to the public about the carbon tax, who deceived Mr Andrew Wilkie about poker machine reform, is at it again, because this measure is a flagrant violation of the most emphatic and unambiguous commitments given to the electorate. Senator Cormann read some of those commitments onto the record. Let me read them myself. This is what Ms Gillard wrote to the Australian newspaper in the last term of the coalition government. Referring to a letter by the then health minister, Mr Tony Abbott, which claimed that a Labor government had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate, she said:


The truth is that I never had a plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate … For all Australians who want to have private health insurance, the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election. … when I make ironclad commitment I intend on keeping it.


That is what this Prime Minister's word is worth. She attacked Mr Abbott, then the health minister, for suggesting that she planned to do the very thing that she is now doing and, with mock outrage, she claimed that she was being misrepresented. We now know the truth.


This is what the then health minister, Ms Roxon, said in more recent times. On 24 February 2009, in the Age newspaper, she said: 'The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.' In a media release issued by her office on 26 September 2007—just before the election of 2007, when the Labor Party came to power—she said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates …


During the 2007 election campaign, when interviewed on Meet the Press, Ms Roxon was asked by journalist Steve Lewis whether she committed to retaining, on behalf of the Labor Party, the private health insurance rebate. She said: 


Yes, I can. We've committed to it. We've committed to the 30 per cent, we've committed to the 35% and 40% for older Australians. It's similar to the safety net. We know that many people rely heavily on the assistance that is now provided and would not be able to have private health insurance if that rebate wasn't paid. And lifetime health cover and others that go with it, we are committed to those. We understand that Australia now has a mixed health system, both private and public, and we need them both to be strong in order for our community to be able to get the services.


This is what the then leader of the Labor Party, Mr Kevin Rudd, said a week before the 2007 election:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates—


There are no weasel words here. There is no room for ambiguity or confusion. It was, as Ms Roxon said, 'crystal clear'. It was, as Ms Gillard said, 'iron-clad'. It was, as Mr Rudd said, a 'clear' commitment that the Labor Party would leave the private health insurance rebate alone.


And what are we doing this afternoon? We are debating legislation that was introduced by a government that is now presided over by Ms Julia Gillard, and in which Ms Nicola Roxon continues to sit at the cabinet table, to do the very thing they gave a crystal clear, ironclad commitment never to do. It does not get much more shameless than that. It is no wonder that, as measured by empirical data, opinion polls, anecdotal evidence or whatever, so few people respect this Prime Minister. The reason is that the Australian people know she has not only misled them but also serially misleads them. They know that misleading the people is part of the political practice, part of the modus operandi, part of the playbook of this Labor government. It is disgusting, it is dishonest and it is deceitful, but it is the way this government does business.


We in the Liberal Party will oppose this legislation tooth and nail because it is dishonest, because it is bad policy and because it is socially regressive. Why should the least well-off people in this country lose one of the benefits for which they are prepared to work those extra hours and which means so much to them, to their sense of wellbeing and to the security of their families? Why should this government be allowed to reverse a policy commitment that it gave in evident good faith, in unambiguous words and with its hand on its heart, only for the people to discover that they have been deceived? Why should Australians settle for an inferior healthcare system? Why should Australians settle for overburdened public hospitals? Why should less well-to-do Australians be put in a situation where they can no longer afford their private health insurance cover—cover that they want and that they sacrifice for—because the government lied to them? Why should they put up with that? They should not put up with that. I am sorry to say that this is—like the carbon tax and so many other things—the most recent episode of shameless, callous, cold-eyed, cold-blooded duplicity and falsehood which has been the modus operandi of this Labor government.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  I rise to join the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation. I begin by taking up a point that was raised by my colleague Senator Cormann in his contribution. He referred to a report from 1993 commissioned by—I think he would have been the Minister for Health—Senator Graham Richardson that was about private health insurance. That report found that coverage in the community of private health insurance had fallen to very low levels. We are talking about participation rates in the low 30s from memory. At the time I thought it was remarkable that the Labor government had commissioned such a report, simply because there had been a history of Labor, with almost a malignant neglect, seeking to reduce the private health insurance sector in Australia to something of a rump. It was heartening that he did that because that encouraged a debate in the community about private health insurance and the coalition went to the 1996 election with promises around a private health insurance incentive. Over the next few years that became a private health insurance tax rebate, which essentially is the measure we are talking about today in this series of bills before the Senate.


The point to be made about that measure is that it was quite deliberate, quite calculated and had a policy rationale. It was not simply a handout to the big end of town, as some people are alleging. The whole purpose of the incentive was to encourage people to exercise greater choice and to facilitate that choice. Just as we sought to do that in the education system—that is, the split between public and private schools and the assistance governments give to independent schools—so it was in the case of health: we were seeking to provide an incentive which facilitated choice. This had a benefit to the health system as a whole—that is, to take pressure off the public hospital system. That was the rationale in part for the measure. It was to provide a form of tax relief in its own way, but it was also to provide a measure to encourage the greater use of the private hospital system and to reward people who put their own resources into private health insurance. It encouraged a greater pool of people into private health insurance and it restrained the growth in premia and the like. That was important because the bigger the insurance pool, the more you can restrain the growth in the costs of premia.


We have a situation today where the government has decided, allegedly on budgetary grounds, that it must do something about this particular measure. I dispute that the government is doing this simply on budgetary grounds. I believe there is a history of Labor wishing, if not to negate this measure entirely, then at least to substantially cripple it. If we go back to when Labor went into opposition in 1996, there was a history of them attacking our initiatives around private health insurance. I believe that was driven by ideological considerations around their concern or their support for the public hospital system. We all support a strong and viable public hospital system, but we need to have other strong pillars to the health system and having a viable and strong private health system is one of them. So Labor for a long time opposed what we had done in government on private health insurance, but, as my colleagues have read onto the record, Labor increasingly came to the view that it was not politically sustainable to keep attacking this private health insurance incentive. From the 2004 election onwards, after the ill-fated experiment with one Mark Latham, Labor realised that having a hit list of independent schools was not a good way to show that it was for the community as a whole rather than sections of the community. It is important to put some ideological context around this: that there has for a long time been a view within Labor that the private health insurance system should be gutted or crippled.


Finally, there is a mechanism here in these bills which seeks in part to achieve Labor's objective. I do not believe it will end private health insurance as a whole, but it will significantly dent it and it will dent it by making cover ultimately more expensive and reducing the pool of people who are covered or who downgrade their cover. That will be to the cost of not only those people who, as Senator Brandis said, have been saving their money in order to afford such health insurance, but it will also be at a cost to the public hospital system, which will be under greater pressure. This is an important point because the health reforms that the Labor government introduced under the rubric of the Council of Australian Governments in recent years do not in any way have a structural reform component to them. I do not believe they will lead to better health outcomes. We have a situation where the pressure on the public hospital system as a result of Labor's health reforms will not abate and we are adding to that pressure by taking this incentive away.


This is one of a series of measures which this government has taken to means test various benefits. There is a rationale for means testing. We cannot offer everything to everybody and means testing has its place within the social security system and the like. The fact of the matter is we do not want millionaires to get pensions and the rest. However, this increasing trend toward means testing is starting to butt up against another objective of all governments which is: how do we reduce effective marginal tax rates? What is happening with more and more means testing as we go up the income scale is that we are adding more and more of these poverty traps into the system. There was a very good article written recently by Judith Sloan in the Australian, which went through the impact this sort of means testing on effective marginal tax rates. In brief, it means that, when we are means testing on family income as a whole, there is often then a disincentive if we increase the means testing for the secondary income earner—often the woman in the household—to cut back their hours of work because the family as a whole find that they lose income if they undertake more work. They start to lose income that comes through government benefits and the like, including incentives of this sort.


We have to look at this issue of private health insurance not only in the context of the merits of the debate around the contribution that governments make to the health system, but also in the context of the macro implications for the tax and transfer system. I believe that the Treasurer, Wayne Swan—someone who in the past has professed great support for tackling these sorts of poverty traps and high effective marginal tax rates—is undermining one of his own objectives by measures of this kind. My view has always been that if you want to tackle what you broadly describe as allegedly middle-class welfare by taking benefits away, means testing and all the rest of it, you should be compensating those people by at least reducing tax rates so that you improve incentives to work and save. That would be a much more balanced system, but that is not what we are doing here. This is essentially an ideological measure dressed up as a budgetary measure. Part of the sleight of hand in this process has been to prevent the cost of the private health insurance incentive, if it were allowed to keep on going over the next 30, 40 or 50 years. Of course, I could sit here and go through every element of the budget and do a similar analysis of the cumulative cost, whether it is the age pension, assistance to the automotive industry, assistance to other sections of the community—




Senator Mason:
  Higher education.




Senator SINODINOS:
  Higher education. You could come up with a humungous number. On the other side of the ledger, I could go through tax revenue and accumulate that over a period and come up with a humongous number.


Yes, there are budgetary pressures that come over time from growth in all sorts of budgetary outlays, but that of itself is not an argument for choosing to cut back one outlay rather than another. There has to be a policy rationale for what you do, and what I am arguing here is that the rationale is more ideological than it is essentially budgetary. Why ideological? I mentioned earlier the longstanding antipathy to these sorts of measures which promote greater choice between public and private sectors, but there is another element to this, and that element has been added by none other than your distinguished colleague, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, the Treasurer—it is his Monthly essay, his vituperative attack on three Australians who are risk takers and entrepreneurs out there earning their keep and providing jobs for their fellow Australians.


What I found remarkable about that contribution is that it was a deliberate attempt to set one Australian against another. It was a deliberate attempt to set allegedly working-class Australians and middle-class Australians against other Australians. I thought it was deplorable for that reason, because what unites most Australians today is a set of aspirations. We all want to do better. We do not want to be penalised for having a go. Having a go is as important to us as a fair go, and I thought that essay highlighted that the Treasurer was interested merely in seeking to stoke the politics of envy for reasons perhaps related to trying to get the public debate off the leadership crisis in the Labor Party and onto more fertile territory.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Sinodinos, can I draw your attention to standing order 193. You are getting very close to an imputation of improper motives against the Treasurer, so I just draw your attention to that.




Senator SINODINOS:
  I appreciate that, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would never want to impute impure motives to such a pure individual as the Treasurer. But may I say that this particular measure does smack, in part, of the politics of envy. The point I was making is that it seemed to be part of a suite of measures and seemed to be in part authored by a Treasurer who seems to be very keen on the politics of envy.


The coalition has always believed that choice is important, in both health and education, and I believe this measure is one that appeals across the various income groups in the community. My colleague Senator Brandis spoke about the number of low-income Australians who use the private health insurance incentive or have private health insurance cover. Indeed, to go through some electorates close to my own heart, let me start with the electorate of Dobell. In Dobell, 46.1 per cent of voters have private health insurance—not 20 per cent, not 25 per cent, but 46.1. The number of persons covered by private health insurance in that electorate is almost 60,000 people. In Robertson, another fine upstanding electorate, 55.5 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered with private health insurance in the electorate is 73,869. That is a lot of Australians in Robertson who are covered by this measure.


If I go to a safer Labor seat, Blaxland, once occupied by the Hon. Paul Keating, 42.7 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate is 60,516. In the seat of Grayndler, the cradle of Anthony Albanese, 60.1 per cent of voters have private health insurance. It is even higher than those seats on the Central Coast. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate of Grayndler is 77,898. They are the people who the Hon. Anthony Albanese is going to be harming through this particular measure. If we go to Hunter, a safe seat in the Hunter Valley, 51 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate is 66,346. In the seat of Newcastle—a good working-class seat; I was born in Newcastle—55.2 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate is 69,726. In the seat of Shortland, next door, just to round it off, 50.8 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered with private health insurance in the electorate is 65,971.


People scrimp and save to have the peace of mind of private health insurance. And what we are talking about here is not some select group people in Vaucluse, Toorak or the relevant parts of Adelaide or Perth—Peppermint Grove or wherever. We are talking about a swathe of people in a swathe of electorates who would be disadvantaged by this particular measure going through. So I stand up here disillusioned with the promises Labor made that it would retain the private health insurance incentive. I am very disillusioned and concerned about the deterioration of the risk pool and the impact that that will have on upward pressure on premiums for all 12 million Australians with private health insurance, with more people forced to utilise overstretched public hospitals.


After years of waste and mismanagement Labor is hiking prices for working Australians to pay for their own budgetary and other shortcomings. My concern here is that, at a time when the cost of living is without a doubt the No. 1 issue in federal and state politics across the country, here we have a government adding to the cost of living. We have already had initiatives around the carbon tax, which will add to the cost of living—and may I say that the evidence mounts every day that those costs are going to be higher than the government has estimated. Already we have received information around increases in landlord leases and the like, reflecting an increase in the carbon tax going through their books. What we have is a tax that will cascade through the stages of production. It is not a GST, where there is only a price effect on the final consumer; it will cascade through the various stages of production. The cost of living is being exacerbated and then we have other measures like the private health insurance incentive means testing that we are talking about here today, which will add to that as well.


I come back to a point I made earlier: the government is in danger of creating even further poverty traps and even further entrenching effective marginal tax rates up the system. The main impact of that would be on secondary income earners in families. I do not believe this was a tough decision for Labor to take. We get a lot of breast-beating and braggadocio about tough reforms and tough fiscal decisions. This was not a tough decision for Labor to make, given its history of promises to remove the private health insurance incentive in the past. It backflipped on that promise and then said, hand on heart, that it would keep it. Sadly, that promise as well has not been kept. It is one of a number of promises that have not been kept.


They can say that they were mugged by reality on the first day of coming to government. We are not talking about that; we are talking about attempts to do this some years after coming to government. The only other explanation I can think of is that, apart from the ideological intent behind this measure, budgetary pressures forced the government into taking these measures. All I can say is: if only the government had listened to the coalition at the time of the global financial crisis! We supported the first round of stimulus but we were prudent, we wanted to wait, because it was clear Australia was not going to be affected in the same way as other countries. We were prudent then and we have been proven right by history in that regard. Unfortunately, Labor put into the system a whole series of programs. For example, with Building the Education Revolution, there are still schools around the country receiving grants. Once the program was implemented it was very hard to stop. We all acknowledge that, but the point is that it can no longer be presented as a fiscal stimulus program, continuing as it does at a time when the economy has been in more than recovery mode.


Sadly, we were saddled with a much bigger debt and deficits coming out of the global financial crisis than were necessary, and that has necessitated the government taking all sorts of measures. Yet, disappointingly, last year when there was a window of opportunity for the government to take more stringent budgetary measures, they squibbed the opportunity to do so. There were $22 billion worth of savings in last year's budget but $19 billion worth of new spending, so the net bottom line contribution over the forward estimates was $3 billion.


People say, 'Okay, what's the coalition committed to doing?' The coalition is committed to restoring this sort of measure as soon as it is affordable. We see it as having a policy rationale that is robust. We want to maintain a strong private pillar in the health system and we believe that is going to benefit the health system as a whole. We believe that, if we can come to power within 18 months, there is sufficient time to reverse this measure and some of the damage that will be done in the meantime to the health system as a whole.


I call on the government, if they are serious about health reform, to also review the COAG health reforms that they have put into the system. I do not believe, as I said earlier, that these reforms will necessarily lead to structural change in the system in the way that we want. They will not restrain the growth in health costs or improve health outcomes. I call on the government to take a more comprehensive approach. It is a pity that the government did not respond to our calls for a committee to further review this legislation and perhaps have a broader overview of what can be done to promote a better, more affordable and sustainable health policy going forward.


Finally, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, I did not have the opportunity to check out what the private health insurance statistics may be around places like Springwood in the seat of Macquarie. I am certainly going to make it my business to do so and to remind people in that electorate that it is very important for them to maintain their private health insurance and the impact that this measure will have on their capacity to do so.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-03-15,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:19):  I too rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. I note and share Senator Sinodinis's disillusionment, and I am sure all coalition senators have shared it as we have debated these bills in the Senate over the last couple of days. The minister, when introducing these bills in the House of Representatives, said that this was going to lead to a fairer and more sustainable health system. That is just a misnomer. There is nothing fair, or equitable or sustainable for the health system and for those using it in this nation. Our health system is the envy of the world. Everything that we need to be doing in this place and in our states is to focus on ensuring that that stays the case.


The government is planning to means test the private health insurance rebates and, at the same time, approve a premium rise. Families are already doing it tough in these hard economic times. These are families who, in a few short months, will be facing the effects of a carbon tax which will be, as Senator Sinodinos said, cascading right through our economy—from our primary producers producing our milk, to the tankers picking it up and delivering it to the milk processors in the regions, right the way through to the refrigerators that are refrigerating it on its way to the nearest supermarket in our capital cities. All the way through, that supply chain will be bearing an extra cost.


It is not fair at all that hardworking families in regional areas and right across our nation who have taken the tough decision to take out healthcare cover are now going to be slugged for the privilege. In 2009 the then health minister, Minister Roxon, said that the government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. We are not at all surprised that there has been another backflip by a minister from this government, another betrayal of the Australian people by Labor. People who have sat down around the kitchen table and worked out their family budget—'Will we go overseas on that holiday, will we go to Queensland or will we go camping down the coast and keep our private health insurance?'—have had the conversation and kept the insurance only to find that they are not going to be supported in that decision. It is yet another example of the Labor government doing something in haste without considering the impact and without thorough investigation. The government is obviously having a bet both ways.


The means testing of rebates will be effective on 1 July, and as a result the average middle-class family will see a reduction in the taxpayer refund against the cost of their private health cover. The more they earn, obviously, the more they will pay. Fifty-two percent of Australians hold private health insurance, including about 40 per cent of Australians in regional areas. Sixty-five per cent of those living in the electorate of Mallee in Victoria hold private health insurance. It might seem counterintuitive—there are not a lot of private hospitals out there in the regions. Why would the vast majority of regional Australians, particularly those in Mallee, hold private health insurance? It is because it supports the public system, and regional Australians understand that. They understand that to keep their specialists heading out our way they need to be able to charge private rates. They are only going to be able to charge those if people out there in the regions hold private health insurance. Describing these hard-working Australians as 'millionaires'—like it is a dirty word—shows how out of touch this government is with the day-to-day struggles of working Australians. Penalising people for taking responsibility for their own health care makes no sense. This is in addition to taxation they are already paying with the Medicare levy. Once again, as they earn more, they pay more.


The health system is multilayered, and funding it is a complex issue. But there is a simple logic to the statement that, if you drive people out of private health insurance and they end up in the public system, it simply puts more pressure on that system and on our already overstretched public hospitals. If you drive healthy young people out of private health insurance—if those under 30 are making decisions about whether they are going to take it up or not—everyone's premiums will go up.


Why do regional Australians bother taking out private hospital cover if there are fewer hospitals? They are insuring against catastrophe, like anyone else who takes out insurance. They want to ensure that they can access a variety of health services—obviously, at their own public hospital in their own regional centre but, if something goes wrong, they want to be able to ensure that they and their loved ones can access the specialist care that they need. That may be 200 kilometres down the road or it might be 1,000 kilometres down the road. Regional people understand that it means going to either a regional centre or a capital city for treatment. They still want the peace of mind of their choice of doctor and no waiting list.


Many people also have a sense of obligation. Many believe that if they can afford private health insurance that they should, wherever possible, leave those beds for public patients. It is well known out in the regions that private health insurance is what keeps our public hospitals going. Typically, private hospitals in regional centres have lower occupancy rates—meaning that they operate on wafer-thin margins. Any erosion in those rates will be magnified in regional hospitals and will be likely to force cuts to services or potentially cause some private hospitals to close their doors entirely. Those people using the private services in regional areas are relying on them for repeat admissions over a course of treatment and for ongoing health conditions. Those families can ill afford to lose the benefits they have accessed for over a decade, and will be devastated to see them pared back.


Another issue is that of the visiting specialists who visit regional private hospitals. Any tinkering with the rebate that causes a cutback in demand in regional private hospitals will flow directly to the specialists, who will retreat to the cities, denying regional patients local access to the expertise and services they need and forcing those patients to travel further and at greater cost for consultations and treatment.


Another issue that I would like to briefly touch on is something that people have mentioned consistently, and that is just what a poor public policy response this government has. We on the coalition side are not surprised that this government is just pursuing middle-class Australia and whacking those who can least afford it, because they see it as a cheap and easy way to make up for Swannie's surplus misadventures. I just think it is—

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:28):  When I was young, I recall playing a game that my parents bought me one Christmas. I forget what the game was called, but there was a vertical column and there were marbles in the top of this column. There were sticks that went horizontally into this column and the idea was that each player in turn withdrew a stick from the column and hoped that they were not the one that released all the marbles into the bottom of the column. The name will come to me at some point—probably later in the speech, so I will leave members in suspense until I can think of it. Obviously, nobody else in the Senate at the moment played that game and they cannot refresh my memory.





The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Humphries, I have been advised that it was called Ker Plunk!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Thank you very much Mr Acting Deputy President. You obviously were not playing it yourself—it was not a popular game in Scotland, no doubt. Or you were too young—or possibly too old? I would not venture which that might be—but thank you. The game springs to mind in the course of this debate because it rather seems to me that the federal Labor government is playing a game of pulling out a stick from this structure of public and private hospital and health infrastructure in Australia—a stick worth $2.8 billion over the forward estimates. It is hoping—it is not necessarily very sure, but it is hoping—as it pulls this stick out that somehow the marbles do not fall and that the people in the private health system who have private health insurance and who are taking a load off the public hospital system at the bottom of the column do not cascade down into the bottom of that column. That gamble is—




Senator Polley:
  What about the effect of the $1 billion Tony Abbott ripped out of health?




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  I am happy to defend against that fallacious argument. There was no $1 billion ever taken out of the public hospital system or the public health system of Australia by Mr Abbott or anybody else in the coalition government. But, to stay with my point, we have a situation where the federal government have determined that they can withdraw that amount of money and they are hoping that it will not have serious consequences for the quality of the public hospital system in our country.


They have conceded, I suppose, that at least one marble will fall. The government say as a result of their own modelling that 27,000 people will drop their cover as a result of this measure. Let us call that one marble dropping to the bottom of the column. If that were the case, the gamble might have paid off at least partly. But we have among the range of estimates of what will happen if the federal government withdraw that $2.8 billion other much less rosy scenarios or predictions of what will happen. I note that the government's own medical insurer, Medibank Private, estimates that 37,000 of its members alone are likely to drop their cover and a further 92,500 will downgrade their health coverage, most likely by dropping out of hospital cover. Deloitte have done their own work. Their estimate is very sobering. They estimate that in the first year alone of this new scheme 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade their cover. Over five years, Deloitte estimate that 1.6 million people will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. As a result, they estimate that private health insurance premiums will rise by 10 per cent above what they would otherwise have risen by. If that turns out to be the case, a lot of marbles are dropping and a lot of serious consequences are flowing down to the public hospital system and the public health system of Australia.




Senator Mason:
  Labor's lost their marbles!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You could say they have lost their marbles, Senator Mason. I think that it is clear, however, that the government just do not know what is going to happen with this measure. We have a national economy which is good in parts, like the curate's egg, but which leaves a large number of Australians who are struggling and where living standards generally across Australia are falling. Yet the government believe that when people face these sorts of cost pressures—higher cost of government charges, higher taxes, higher cost of local services, higher cost of petrol and these other cost of living pressures—somehow in the midst of all of that pressure they will not drop their private health insurance. It is a big gamble.


We have a situation where clearly our public hospital systems are struggling to cope with the level of demand on them, and that level of demand is likely to increase significantly as a result of people dropping their private health insurance, particularly with respect to hospital coverage, as people decide that they simply cannot afford to sustain that coverage and they can go to a public hospital system. They probably factor in a certain loss of quality as a result of that, but nonetheless in tough economic times they may well decide that that is a rational decision to make to help sustain their family's standard of living.


Twelve million Australians—over half of the population—have private health insurance, and 10.4 million of them have hospital treatment cover. It is very hard to imagine that Australians will sustain that level of investment in their own health when they have such enormous pressures on them overall and when the government is signalling that it no longer wishes to support them in the choice to sustain a proportion of the cost of their health care—because that is what this step is doing. It is saying to people, 'Don't worry about providing for your own coverage and covering the cost of your health care by taking out private measures; our government system will cover you.' Indeed, it might, but at what cost to the public purse and at what cost in loss of quality in the process?


This measure, I think, will lead to a very large number of Australian families deciding not to continue with coverage, at least to the same extent that they have today. I imagine that would be a decision made by a large number of people in my own community, the Australian Capital Territory, where at this stage we have, and have had for some time, the highest level of private health insurance in the country—56.4 per cent of people in the ACT are insured. That is over 200,000 people. Clearly it is citizens of the ACT who will lose very significantly out of these arrangements, because the government has classed people earning more than $83,000 as—to use a phrase employed in debate earlier today—'super-rich' or 'super-wealthy'. I think that greatly mischaracterises the sorts of people who are noticing a loss of living standards and who are struggling to make ends meet. The fact is that this change will affect many people at many levels, because if people who can afford at the moment to take out private health insurance withdraw in significant numbers it must have implications in a number of areas. It must lead to higher premiums, not just for people on higher incomes but across the board. So those millions of Australians on low incomes, those 3.4 million people with a household income of less than $35,000 per year, who presently have private health insurance will have to consider their position as their insurance premiums rise. It will also affect the suppliers of private health services. I am thinking particularly of smaller private hospitals in regional Australia which may not be a vastly profitable proposition at the present time but who will find that as a significant proportion of their communities withdraws from private health insurance the viability of their enterprises will diminish. When we see a few of those sorts of hospitals or health centres close—and bear in mind that most elective surgery in Australia today is done in private hospital settings or private clinical settings—in many communities the withdrawal of that kind of service will drive more people into already very pressured public hospital systems.


All of that adds up to a loss of quality and capacity in Australia's healthcare system. Where does the $2.8 billion come from? It comes directly from the pockets of Australians that the government chooses to characterise as super-wealthy or super-rich. I do not think that that characterisation is fair. I think that, in recent years, we have seen tremendous pressure on Australians at all levels. Some of the safety net for those people has been enhanced in some ways with compensation arrangements, particularly for lower incomes, but it is very much middle Australia that this measure is targeted at. I make no apologies for advocating for middle Australia in this place, because I do not think we need to be picking off sections of the community and saying that they can afford a hit here, that they can afford to have their standard of living sliced on the edge because they are wealthy enough to sustain that sort of decision.


We are still a wealthy country, and if it were not for the profligate decisions made by this government with respect to the way it has spent the taxpayer's dollar in recent years we would not need to make these sorts of decisions. We have to take $2.8 billion out of the pockets of Australians in order to sustain the government's vision of a surplus budget into the future. We need not be in this position and we on this side of the chamber reject the idea that we have to create this kind of paradigm: to cut the living standards of Australians in order to meet the government's budgetary requirements.


I fear for the effectiveness of Australia's public hospital system. As a former health minister in the ACT, I know that, as people come through the reception areas of in-patient departments, the system is incredibly sensitive to the number of decisions about where people will go. Will they go to a private bed or to a public bed? When more people take the turn on the left side to go to the public beds, it puts huge pressure on the rest of the system. We can expect more of that because of this government's somewhat perverse vision of how to improve health care in Australia.


I remind members of this chamber, as others have done, that the decision to remove that stick worth $2.8 billion was a broken promise. I recall very well the words used by the then shadow minister for health before the 2007 election that this was Liberal hysteria—that the Liberals were being hysterical in suggesting that there would be any tampering with the private health insurance rebate. It is interesting because the other time in Australian politics that I recall the phrase 'Liberal hysteria' being used was with respect to claims made by the opposition in 2010 that the Gillard government was going to impose a carbon tax. According to Treasurer Swan that was Liberal hysteria as well. I suspect that we should be very sensitive to the words 'Liberal hysteria' in the future and assume that, when we hear that phrase, it means that they are on to us, that we have been caught out, that they know what we are up to.


I simply indicate that I think Australians will be poorer and the health system will be weaker as a result of the measures which the Senate is being asked to approve today. The Greens have long advocated for pulling out of this particular measure. In fact, they say the whole of the private health insurance rebate should go. They have no compunction about imagining that they can find the extra dollars necessary to sustain a hospital system where nobody uses private health insurance or private hospitals. But that is the bizarre world of the Greens. I for one will not stand by and support a situation where—



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  A lot fewer people were using private hospitals and private health before the rebate, and today we have a strong private health and hospital system in this country because the Howard government had the vision to sustain people's decisions to take out private health insurance and invest in their own health care. That is the way the system was improved. Enormous pressure was taken off the shoulders of public hospitals in this country by virtue of that decision, and you guys are going to put that pressure right back there when you support this measure today. I urge the Senate to reject this legislation. It amounts to a cut in the quality of health care in this country and a reduction in the living standards of millions of Australians.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (17:44):  I rise to address briefly the issue of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. Because of the guillotine the government is going to apply the opposition does not have time to address it in the detail we would like, but I have a few key points to make.


It is important as we look at this issue of means testing the private health rebate that we look at the big picture of our health system, and that we take a longer term view. Our health system delivers some of the best health outcomes in the world and Australians are enjoying an increasingly excellent life expectancy. That is partly because of the fact that we have this dual health system, where public hospitals treating the insured can bill insurance companies but can also purchase high-volume private surgery when the waiting lists blow out. The Productivity Commission report of last year indicates that the private system is very competitive, if not far more efficient than the public system. The sustainability of that system in the long term is really important.


It is clear that taxpayers alone cannot carry the load of the future financing of health care in Australia. The budget pressures will increase substantially. Population projections point to a doubling in the proportion of the population aged 65 and over by 2050, and a quadrupling in the proportion of the population aged 85 and over in the same period. What we are seeing there is a huge increase in costs. The second Intergenerational report forecast that expenditures on health will grow from 3.8 per cent of GDP back in 2006-07 to 7.3 per cent of GDP by 2046-47. That means that, more and more, we are going to need to balance the health system between a reliance on the public purse and on individuals playing their part in financing it. That means that the private insurance system must be sustainable, and it will not be sustainable if this government takes measures that mean we reduce the size of the pool of people who are paying into that across their lifetimes.


I turn to touch quickly on the politics of this. The government's approach to this has been divisive at best, and its accusations, for example, that it does not want to see the cleaners in this place pay for the health care of the rich, are crass at worst. The government does not take into account the fact that people on low incomes are not paying for anyone's rebates, because people on low incomes do not pay net tax. Anyone earning less than $820 weekly, or below $900 for families, get more from the government than they pay in tax. The Treasury calls that the net tax threshold. It is also important to realise that this is not the domain of the wealthy. One-third of people who have private health insurance earn less than $32,000, and the median income of people who have private health insurance is only $47,000—hardly the domain of the rich.


There are consequences of the decision that the government is making. Many of my colleagues have talked about the decline that modelling shows will occur. Government figures show that currently some 5.6 million Australians are privately insured. The Deloitte report indicates that some 1.6 million will withdraw from their private hospital cover over a five-year period and 4.3 million will downgrade to lower levels of cover. The most important thing to look at, though, is what is going to happen in the area of allied health, or the extras cover. The Australian Physiotherapy Association said in one of their submissions that they were alarmed at the lack of consideration of ancillary cover in the Treasurer's analysis. They are alarmed for very good reason. For those with extras cover the impact is expected to be greater—nearly one in five, or 18 per cent, will drop their extras altogether, with a further one in three, or 34 per cent, likely to downgrade. Putting the two groups together—those who drop the cover altogether and those who downgrade the extras—shows some 52 per cent will potentially cut back on extras cover, things like dental, optical, physiotherapy, podiatry et cetera.


There are two real impacts from this that this place should be aware of, and that the government should be ashamed that they have not taken into account. I have recently run a number of rural health forums around regional South Australia, and one of the consistent bits of feedback was that the delivery of health services into regional areas, both from GPs and allied health professionals, relies heavily on people being privately insured. Allied health professionals told us that the viability of their businesses depends on people who come to them with private health insurance, and once the businesses cut back—whether that be allied health professionals or private hospitals or the ability to encourage surgeons and other specialists to visit regional areas—we will see a collapse of services in parts of that market. Many people who are there in a private capacity also lend their services to the public system. If the floor on which they base their private practice is removed then we will see those services become unavailable to the public system because the state governments are not funding those services adequately through their hospitals.


There is another area in which this is particularly important. Allied health, which is what extras cover provides, is an important part of preventative health strategy. I met recently with the Podiatry Association, which indicated that Australia has the worst diabetes amputation rate in the industrialised world with 85 Australians losing a foot every week because of diabetes—about one every two hours. Countries that have mainstreamed podiatry and multidisciplinary foot teams have amputation rates 40 to 65 per cent less than Australia's. Guidelines indicate that the 206,000 Australians with diabetes should have an average of four to eight consultations with a podiatrist each year as a preventative measure. Currently, Medicare only funds a total of five allied health consults, which means that many people will only get a Medicare funded podiatry consultation once or twice a year. At the moment, the gap for many people is made up with private health insurance.


The Podiatry Association had a proposal to see the number of Medicare places increased. Given that each amputation costs the health system $100,000 over the life of a patient, they highlighted that by increasing the number of Medicare funded places they would save 167,000 hospital bed days, 3,500 amputations and $400 million each year. If people drop their extras cover, it will reduce their access to podiatrists—and you could probably extend this across other allied health areas,. That means we will not be seeing the same level of preventive health care. The unintended consequence will be that more high cost health care is required in hospitals.


For purely ideological reasons this government is seeking to wind back private health insurance. This will have a flow-on effect not just through pressures on the public hospital system but particularly on regional communities because it undermines the viability of private practice. Perversely, it will increase costs for the government by decreasing people's access to preventive health care. There is much more I could say but, in deference to my colleague who wishes to speak before the government applies the guillotine, I will end by saying I do not support this bill.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:52):  I am deeply indebted to my colleague for giving me the chance to speak on this legislation. What we are seeing today is the Australian Labor Party dropping Australian families for a grubby deal with their fellow class-warfare combatants the Australian Greens. The losers from this will be the Australian people.


I know colleagues have referred to the Deloitte report, as I do to put my comments in context. Deloitte says 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover in the first year and a further 580,000 would be expected to downgrade. Over five years 1.6 million would drop cover and 4.3 million would downgrade. Also private health insurance premiums would rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. Deloitte says there would be an additional $3.8 billion in recurrent costs for the public hospital system, 2.8 million people with general treatment cover would withdraw and 5.7 million would downgrade. The government says Deloitte is wrong, but the government has not had Treasury do its own modelling in relation to this matter. We have Deloitte saying one thing, while the government and the Australian Greens refuse to do anything about it. I will go with Deloitte. I also refer to a company called GMHBA, proudly based in Geelong and Colac. GMHBA are actively involved in the Colac community. Last year they had a healthy breakfast program where they got together with a whole lot of other bodies to assist the kids in Colac.


Some members in the other place—the members for Bendigo, Ballarat, Corio and Corangamite—who have been remarkably quiet in relation to this debate. Remarkably, between them they represent a quarter of a million Australians who are covered by health insurance, yet there was hardly a peep from these people. In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and member for Ballarat, Catherine King, has said nothing, which is remarkable. I will go through the figures: in the member for Corangamite's case, 84,442 people in his electorate are covered by private health insurance. The member for Corio represents 69,946 people with private health insurance. The members of Ballarat and Bendigo represent 64,203 and 56,375 people respectively with private health insurance. More than 100,000 people with private health insurance are not being properly represented.


The member for Corangamite has been remarkably quiet since his very foolish intervention in the leadership battle. He claimed:


In my community in Geelong people do not believe that it is appropriate for people earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to get middle class welfare from the Commonwealth to help support them in having private health insurance.


We are not talking about people earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are potentially talking about mums and dads, a schoolteacher and a police officer raising three kids in Ocean Grove, in Mount Helen, in Golden Point or in Belmont—that is who we are talking about. Mr Cheeseman, the member for Corangamite, had clearly just picked up some notes and had not bothered to look at the Deloitte report when he said:


They are reforms that will make our healthcare system more sustainable, recognising that as we live longer our health needs become greater and we need additional money in the system to support people.


Deloitte says it is the exact opposite of that. He also told the House of Representatives:


… these bills are fair. They are appropriate. It has been a consistent position that we have held for a long time.


Let us talk about the consistent position of the Labor Party as told to us by the man who was supported by the member for Corangamite—the failed member for Corangamite—in relation to the leadership battle and everything else he touches. Before the 2007 election, what did former Labor leader Kevin Rudd tell the Australian Health Insurance Association? The shadow health minister, who is sitting beside me, knows that he said:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Nicola Roxon is now Attorney-General. I wonder why she was moved out as this was coming up. We will never know, will we? She said on 24 February:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


Mr Cheeseman was clearly wrong with when he said, 'It's been a consistent position that we've held for a long time.' That is simply not right. That is simply incorrect. That is another example of a broken promise. We have the Prime Minister's great political lie that 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'. We now have broken promises in relation to private health insurance. We have the members for Bendigo, Ballarat, Corio and Corangamite refusing to say anything about this matter. The only one who did say anything got it absolutely wrong when he said that the Labor Party's position in relation to this matter has been consistent. It has not been consistent with the ironclad guarantees given by Mr Rudd before the 2007 election.


A lot of Australians have voted on the back of their understanding of the Australian Labor Party's policy in relation to this matter. A lot of people have gone to ballot boxes on the basis that the Labor Party would never ever interfere with these private health insurance rebates. They have been absolutely let down by a government which refuses to keep its promises, and we will come in here day after day after day and demand that the Australian Labor Party keeps its election promises. They have failed to do so at the moment, they have failed to do so in the past and we will make absolutely sure that they do so in the future.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:46):  When question time interrupted my contribution on this, many Labor senators had come in to hear what I had to say about this particular bill. I see they have all left now and, for the record, there are two Labor people in the chamber. Clearly, they did not like what I was saying. I was reminding the people of Australia that our Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, the leader of the Labor Party, had said some time ago:


I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


She may have been committed to it before an election, as she was committed to not introducing a carbon tax. Clearly, with Ms Gillard you cannot trust or take at face value anything at all that she promises. This bill that we are dealing with today is removing the private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent that Ms Gillard promised Labor was committed to. In a letter to a newspaper about a correspondent who had written about Labor and private health insurance Ms Gillard said:


Your correspondent … should have no concerns that Labor will erode or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee on that on a number of occasions.


We have learnt that with Ms Gillard her iron-clad guarantees and her solemn promises to the Australian public before an election mean absolutely nothing. I say to the people of Australia: how can you ever believe anything Ms Gillard might say or promise at any time in the future? It does seem to be a Labor leader's disease.


In my own state of Queensland we had the Labor leader Ms Anna Bligh, the current Premier—or Premier for another week or so anyhow—promising before an election some time ago that the 8c subsidy which Queensland motorists enjoyed on their fuel would never be removed. Immediately she got into power, she did the Labor thing, completely rejected her promise and removed the 8c subsidy. She also promised time and time again that she would not sell public assets. For example, she would not sell Queensland Rail, but we all know the history of that now. Labor actually sold the state-run rail service in breach of a commitment.


The relevance of that to this debate on the removal of the health insurance rebate is this: everybody knows that, once you remove that incentive, people will not be able to afford, and therefore will leave, private health insurance. Where are they going to go to get their health services? They will go to the public hospitals. In Queensland the public hospitals are already grossly overextended. Whilst the nurses and doctors at the hospitals do a fantastic job, they are held back by understaffing, underpayment, underfunding, no beds and huge queues in the hallways and on the ramps because of state government mismanagement. The way public hospitals are run is a standing joke in Queensland. Ms Bligh said recently:


What is absolutely clear I think now beyond any doubt, … is that this organisation—


Queensland Health—


in its current form has a culture that is so entrenched it won't be changed while it's kept in that form.


She went on to say that Queensland Health was in diabolical trouble. She forgot to mention, of course, that it was that way because Labor has been in power for 22 years in Queensland, bar a few months in the mid-90s. Ms Bligh also said that the Queensland Health corporate office had failed in areas like staff accommodation, information technology, financial controls and human resources. So, the Labor Party's answer to address these problems is to split up Queensland Health. Somehow, that is going to solve all the problems that have been created.


In a recent newspaper report Ms Bligh is quoted as defending what are arguably—and I do not think that even anyone from the Labor Party in Queensland would argue with me on this—the worst health ministers Queensland has seen, that is, Stephen Robertson, Paul Lucas and currently Geoff Wilson. Ms Bligh says that it is not their fault it has all gone bad, it is somebody else's fault. What happens with Queensland Health is never the government's fault and never the Labor Party's fault.


This legislation that we are debating today appears because the Greens and the Labor Party are one and the same these days—they are both part of the same organisation—and they both want to remove private health insurance. This means that more and more people in my state of Queensland will have to rely on Queensland Health for their health servicing. That fills me with fear and trepidation because I know how badly run Queensland Health is now under the Labor government, and it will get even worse when more and more people actually come into the system.


The litany of mismanagement in Queensland Health is breathtaking, although when you compare it with pink batts, dodgy school hall contracts, Green Loans that are then not Green Loans and solar panel rebates and subsidies that are cancelled ahead of time, perhaps it is not so surprising that Queensland Health is so mismanaged. The reason is quite clear, of course: you simply cannot trust Labor with money. Some of Labor are quite nice people but their experience in running business is usually that they went to university, they sat around the latte shops, they joined a union or they worked for another Labor politician, they had their seat bequeathed to them by a relative within the Labor Party and they came into parliament. Very few of them have ever had any real experience in real life. Certainly, you could count on one hand the number in this chamber—and I suggest on two hands the number in both chambers of this parliament—of those Labor Party people who have had any experience whatsoever in running a business and in financial management.


I suppose someone will say to me, 'Well, Senator Doug Cameron has been involved in business. He has been a director of one of those industry super funds.' I was not aware of this until I saw recently that the unions were actually suing some of the directors for the big fees that they get. Apparently it is a union thing that if you get money because you are appointed to boards because you are a union member that the money does not go in your pocket, it has to come back to the union. Some of the directors have not been—




Senator Edwards:
  Outrageous!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is outrageous, Senator Edwards. Apparently, some of the directors have not been playing fair; they have been pocketing the very big money that they get and not giving it to the unions. So the unions have sued them. That is a court case that I really want to follow through. But I am still waiting for Senator Dougie Cameron, who I read has been a director of one of these industry super funds, to tell me what board fees he got from that position. It would be very interesting to hear that. No doubt, he might come and tell me in his contribution. But he might claim that running an industry super fund is his way of getting business experience. If it is—and I very much doubt it—I suspect that the business members on those boards are the ones that run them and the union members just go along for the ride.


However, I digress from my point in that the removal of this health insurance rebate will increase enormously the burden on hospitals right throughout Australia. But as a Queensland senator I am very concerned that they will impose heavily on the health system in Queensland, which is almost breaking under the strain and which creaks its way through. Because I do not want this to be misunderstood, I repeat that the men and women—the doctors and nurses, orderlies and support staff—who support those hospitals do a fantastic job in difficult circumstances. The Labor Party has administered health to the extent that for—what was it?—three or four weeks the nurses could not even get paid. This is the system. Some of them tell me that they still have not been paid their full entitlements from that time. But it is not the minister's fault; it is not the Premier's fault and it is not the Labor Party's fault. It is always someone else's fault.


So I am concerned with this bill before us. On that point alone—and there have been a lot of very good arguments raised in this debate so far on why this legislation should be defeated—I call on Queensland Labor senators to cross the floor and vote against this. They know that this legislation, when passed, will throw extra burden onto a health system in my state of Queensland which is already unable to deal with the tasks before it. It is essential, I think, that I do call upon Labor senators from Queensland in particular to join us in defeating this bill so that the already overworked system in Queensland will not be further burdened because of the removal of the health insurance rebate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:58):  I rise to make a contribution on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. It is, I have to say, with a sense of deja vu. In the previous government, as shadow parliamentary secretary for health, I found myself debating exactly this topic only a very short period of time after the government had made a promise to the private health insurance industry that they were not looking to make any changes to this particular matter. In fact, I have kept a letter for posterity. I thought that we might have dealt with this issue. It was defeated a number of times during that period, but of course we know that the Greens and the Labor Party have a fundamental dislike of the private sector, particularly in health, so they would not be able to help themselves. They would have to revisit this again and again and again until they progressively dismantled what is recognised as a quality private health insurance system.


On 20 November 2007, when the then federal Labor leader, the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, wrote to Dr Michael Armitage, the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Commission, he said to him:


Thankyou for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance.


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates—


you would think that that is a reasonable commitment that would allay the fears of the industry—


including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy … I trust this allays your concerns.


I think it might be safe to say that at that time it did, but it did not take long for the whole circumstance to change and for private health insurance to start to feel the heat of the Labor dislike for that part of the health system. If it were not for perhaps the greatest political lie, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' this one would have to be up there.


I note the continued attempts by the Labor Party to continue to diminish the private health insurance system in the country. The absurdity of this is that effectively what they are doing is continuing to take money out of the health system. For every dollar in health rebate that they save, they take $3 out of the health system, because for every dollar that is contributed by the government there is $2 contributed by the private insurer. So they are actually diminishing the pool of funding available to health by $3 for every dollar that they take out, and that just does not make sense.


My colleague Senator Macdonald was just talking about the state of the health system in Queensland. He should consider himself lucky that he is not in Tasmania, where the state government is taking $100 million out of the public health system. It is not taking people out of the back door. It is not taking out bureaucrats but closing down front-line public health services. It has carved back the elective surgery waiting list. In my region they were doing about 12 elective surgeries a week. They have cut that back to one or two. So here you have the federal government pouring money, so they tell us, into the public hospital waiting list process to reduce public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery, and you have the state government ripping it out at the other side.


But think of the impact of that on somebody who is waiting for that elective surgery. Think of an individual who is on the waiting list. When this process started, if they were, say, No. 36 on the list and there were 12 elective surgeries being done a week then they would be three weeks away from their surgery. That is something that you can foresee. That is something that you can understand: 'In three weeks time I might be having my knee surgery,' or something of that nature. 'I've got three weeks to wait before I go into my elective surgery.' But when it goes back to one a week they are suddenly 36 weeks away. The whole dimension changes—the proximity and the expectation. They then have to carry that for that 36 weeks if they retain their position on the list. They might be lucky—they might have an urgent case and they might get lifted a bit—but if the list runs the way that things are going then they are 36 weeks away instead of three weeks away. It changes the whole aspect of the way they are dealing with it. Yet this comes on the back of a promise by the Labor Party that they were not going to mess around with private health insurance rebates. People could feel comfortable! It is almost as though the Labor Party are trying to use the fear of the public hospital system to keep people in the private health system. 'Will I get that place in three weeks time, or 36 weeks time? Do I have to wait that long? Do I have to make that decision to protect the health of my family? So I'll have to stay in.' It just does not stack up.


We have seen a bloating of the public sector in Tasmania. We have gone from something like 16 public servants per 1,000 people to 20, a huge bloating of the public service. We have seen nearly a 20 per cent increase in public servants in the last five years in Tasmania as the Tasmanian government has filled up the back rooms, and that is all occurring at the expense of front-line services. So we are seeing a cutback in services not only in health but also in policing and all the other critical front-line services, including closing down schools. Yet it is on the back of continued promises and assurances that these things would be maintained at a federal level in relation to changes to the private health insurance system. There was a letter from the then aspiring Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, stating, 'Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance,' and saying that they were 'committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates'. Now we see them clawing it back and taking with it significant funding out of the health system. The one thing it does do is to continue to confirm that the Australian people cannot trust the Labor Party. I have mentioned one of the greatest political lies of all time—the Prime Minister's assurance that 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—but this is also a fundamental issue. We all talk to our electorates on a regular basis. We all communicate and source what the key issues are in our electorates, because that is part of our role; we want to maintain contact and we want to understand what the issues are that concern our constituents. And health is always in the top two or three—it is always there—and people should be able to believe the assurances they are given by a leader when they say they will maintain the settings that exist around an issue as important as private health insurance. We do not want to go back to the circumstance of enormous pressure being placed on the public system because of an exodus of people from private health insurance. There is no way known that we want to see that circumstance occur. But people are being forced to exit private health insurance because they cannot afford it, because the government has taken away that bit of support at a time when our state governments are under so much financial pressure that they are cutting back on services. But then you place even more and inordinate pressure on the public health system because you are removing resources from the private health system. It just does not stack up.


They talk about egalitarianism and we talk about the wealthy making a contribution but we know that the wealthy already do make a contribution. Over a certain wage level, we all pay a Medicare levy. The more you earn, the more you pay. So, if you are earning more and paying more tax, you are making a significantly higher contribution. Then of course there is the Medicare surcharge, the additional surcharge of 1.5 per cent. So, to suggest that this is all about egalitarianism—those who can afford to pay paying a bit more—does not stack up when you actually look at the sums, because, if you earn more and pay more tax, that one per cent that you pay as your Medicare levy is more if you earn $100,000 than it is if you earn $30,000. It is simple mathematics. You are making a contribution.


So this tripe that gets run out by the government to suggest that we need to get those who are earning a bit more to make a bigger contribution does not stack up, because they are already doing that. What they are doing by taking out private health insurance is looking after their own families. They are making an investment in the assured health of their own families, but they are also making an investment in assisting the public health system. We know this, because colleagues around the chamber are talking about the stress on their state public health systems. Why would the Tasmanian government be taking $100 million out of the Tasmanian health system if it were not for the budget pressures and having beds put in storage away from the hospitals so the hospitals cannot use them if it were not for these pressures? And here we are debating in this place removing money from the health system. The government wants to save its contribution, the 30 per cent rebate. It wants to save that contribution but does not think about the other $2 it takes out of the health system for every dollar it saves. So they are taking out $3, in effect, for the $1 that gets saved by the removal of their contribution. It just does not stack up, and it penalises people who want to make a contribution themselves to look after their families and make sure they have prompt access to the health insurance system when they need it. They are already making a contribution to the public system through the Medicare levy. They are spared the surcharge if they are taking out private health insurance but they are actually making a contribution, and it just does not stack up after years of building a sound and solid private health insurance system that complements the public system. This is not a position of competition; this is about having a broad based health system that serves our community well.


It is not just highly-paid people who have health insurance; there are a lot of low-paid people who make the investment. They make a value judgment to invest in private health insurance. At least they retain support under this process, but you really have to question how long that will last. We know that, all along, the Labor Party have had in the back of their minds, they have had in the bottom drawer all along, plans to start to chip away at the private health insurance system, despite the assurances of Kevin Rudd before the 2007 election. Kevin Rudd put it in writing to Dr Michael Armitage, chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, that 'Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates'. He made that commitment. Yet in 2008, not long after taking government, we saw the process commence: chip away, chip away, chip away, trying to diminish the availability of the services of private health insurance but forgetting that, as they do that, for every dollar they save they take another two out of the system—the ratio of removal of funding.


Now the Greens say, 'We'll just take it out and put it all into the public health system.' That just does not make sense but then the Greens were never very strong on, or really concerned about, economics. It does not surprise me that the Greens have teamed up with the Labor Party and effectively flipped on this, as they usually do. They will get their bit of publicity. They will go out there and get in front of the cameras and pretend they are holding out for something, but you can guarantee that, at the end of the day, on pretty much everything they will just flip across and go with the Labor Party. It is a real tragedy that we see such pressure placed on our public health system through the attempts to pull down the private health sector and the private health insurance system. Again, I come back to the circumstance at home where, as I said before, you are No. 36 on the list. That list goes from 12 a week to one, and you are more than six months away from your operation. That just throws someone's whole life out of balance if they are trying to access the public health system.


The security that private health insurance provides is something that we ought to be encouraging. We should be encouraging people to take out private health insurance, not putting in artificial barriers or saying, 'If you earn more than $150,000 as a family we're going to start to punish you as a family.' A policeman and a schoolteacher are effectively in that range. They are not considering themselves to be rich or wealthy people. They are probably doing it pretty tough at the moment. They are wondering whether the power bill that the government promised would only go up by 10 per cent due to the GST is going to go up by 10 per cent only—I am hearing figures of 18 per cent from industry as I go around the countryside. Yet here we are with the government prepared to give them another hit, to take more from them and to discourage them from looking after their family and their family's health. It does not stack up.


Why take away all this funding from private health insurance, and therefore the private health sector, at a time when, as Senator Macdonald has just said, the Queensland health industry is in strife? Senator Williams has indicated on a number of occasions how bad things are in New South Wales. They have a new government there that is trying to clean up the mess of years and years of Labor neglect. We have heard some terrible tales of things that have occurred in the New South Wales health system, and the state government is trying to pick it up and bring it back. In Tasmania, $100 million has been taken out of the front line of the health system in a small state. Putting beds in storage so that the hospitals cannot use them just does not stack up. At the same time their federal Labor counterparts are taking money out of the private health system, which has the capacity, if sensibly managed, to take the pressure off the public health system and to allow people to get ready access to the services that they need.


When Kevin Rudd came to power after the 2007 election, one of his mantras was 'Let's use evidence based policy.' That has gone out the window. We are not seeing anything about that. We have gone back to the old Labor prejudices: 'Let's sting a bit from those who have worked hard to earn a bit more. Let's take a bit off those.' It is the old yarn: you can only take so much off the wealthy until they do not have any more, and then who are you going to get it from to give to the others? They talk about equity, they talk about all those values they say they have, but there is a whole heap of prejudice that sits behind that, one of which is their prejudice against the private health insurance system.


When you look at the fundamentals of what is being done here, as I have said a number of times, it really just does not stack up. They are taking away the capacity of people to look after their own families, to give them access to health services as they feel they need it, and they are thrusting them towards a state-level health system that is under real stress and having funding removed. As I have said, this does not make sense. It should not be supported. (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:18):  This Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation is Labor's latest attack against millions of Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. Labor is anti private health, Labor has always been anti private health and chances are that Labor will always be anti private health in the future. Being anti private health—and I am sure you will agree with me on this, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron—is part of Labor's DNA. This Labor government is doing what other Labor governments have done in the past—that is, attack those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance.


Under Medicare, every single Australian is entitled to free access to universal public hospital care. There are more than 10 million Australians who are prepared to put more of their own resources into the health system, and by taking out private health insurance they help to take pressure off our public hospital system, making sure that those Australians who really cannot afford to take out private health insurance have a good opportunity to have timely access to high-quality public hospital care.


The truth is that we need a strong health system, with a strong and well-funded public system as well as a strong and well-supported private system. As we consider our health policy settings in Australia, it is important that we get that policy balance right. When it comes to getting the policy balance right in the health portfolio, Labor has a very bad track record. If you look at the track record of the Hawke and Keating governments, for example, you will see that private health insurance membership collapsed on Labor's last watch in government, and public hospital queues and public hospital waiting lists continued to increase as more and more people joined those queues and waiting lists. Even the then Labor Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, recognised that, after 10 years of Labor Party government policy, after the Hawke and Keating years, Labor had got it wrong and that things could not continue the way they had been. It was Senator Graham Richardson who commissioned a review into private health and came up with a series of recommendations on how the balance in our health system could be restored. But then Senator Richardson was not able to get his proposals past the Keating cabinet. When he put to the Keating cabinet proposals on how the balance in our health system could be restored and how we could make sure that all Australians would have timely and affordable access to high-quality health care by making sure that we had a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private health system, the cabinet told him where to go, and those proposals went into the Labor-ACTU bin. It is quite humorous if you think about it in retrospect. After Senator Richardson, who was health minister in the Keating government, took proposals to the cabinet on how the balance in our health system could be restored, the then Prime Minister told him to go and consult with the Labor caucus and the ACTU working party. Of course, they buried what were a number of sensible proposals to restore balance to our health system.


Private health insurance membership collapsed under Labor. It went from about 65 per cent to below 30 per cent before a coalition government was able to turn things around. It was the Howard coalition government that was able to restore the necessary and important balance to our health system. It was the Howard government that introduced a series of policy measures to stop the decline in private health insurance membership, to reverse the trend, and to make sure that more Australians who were in a position to afford it were prepared to put their hands in their pockets and put additional private resources into our health system so that all Australians had a better chance to have timely and affordable access to quality hospital care.


The measures that the Howard government put in place, the very successful policy framework that the Howard government put in place, was made up of three principal pillars. There was the Medicare levy surcharge, whereby those Australians who were judged to be able to afford private health insurance but did not have it would incur a tax penalty. That was the stick and then there was the carrot. The carrot was the tax incentive, the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, for those Australians who took out health insurance. The third pillar was Lifetime Health Cover, whereby any Australian who did not join private health insurance until after they had reached 30 years of age had to pay a higher premium for every year after the age of 30.


The Howard government's policy framework was highly successful. It restored balance to our health system, it ensured that the dramatic decline—or collapse—in private health insurance membership in Australia was arrested and it made sure that more Australians were prepared to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. Today more than 10 million Australians are covered by private health insurance. Every single Australian who takes out private health helps to take pressure off our public hospitals and helps to make sure that all Australians are able to get timely access to high-quality public hospital care.


Given Labor's track record, the coalition were always very suspicious about what an incoming Labor government would do in relation to private health insurance. We knew that Labor hates private health. We knew that Labor in government would be likely to try and dismantle the successful measures that had been introduced by the Howard government. We suggested that Labor in government would wind back the private health insurance rebate. Guess what? We were accused of lying to the Australian people. We were accused of misleading the Australian people. We were told, 'No, no, no, under no circumstances would Labor do any such thing.' Even after the election, as late as 24 February 2009, the hapless then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, said:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


It could not get any clearer than that. The day after that ,on 25 February 2009, the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said:


The private health insurance rebate policy remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.


This followed emphatic pre-election promises in the lead-up to the 2007 election, when then Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd said:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


That sounds pretty clear, but we wanted to make absolutely sure because it is known that the Labor Party is very good at tricky semantics, weasel words and trying to hide between the technical meanings of particular phraseology. We saw it from Senator Wong today in her answers about her involvement in the selection of the chair of the Future Fund. Labor is very good at trying to hide behind technical semantics and tricky language. It says things like, 'This isn't exactly what we meant,' or 'Saying we'd keep the rebate doesn't really mean we wouldn't means test it.' I go to another quote from then shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, when she was on Meet the Press on 23 September 2007. That was in the shadow of the 2007 election, about two months before the election. Steve Lewis said to Nicola Roxon:


Let's move to another integral part of the health system, the private health rebate, the 30% rebate. Labor has said ""Yes, we will keep it,"" but you have not said whether you will keep it in total. Can you say now that Labor, if elected, will maintain all of the ancillary measures that encompass the private health rebate?


Nicola Roxon answered:


Yes, I can. We've committed to it. We've committed to the 30%. We've committed to the 35% and 40% for older Australians. It's similar to this safety net. We know that many people rely heavily on the assistance that is now provided and would not be able to have private health insurance if that rebate wasn't paid.


I could not have put it better myself. And on she went:


And lifetime health cover and others that go with it, we are committed to those. We understand that Australia now has a mixed health system, both private and public, and we need them both to be strong in order for the community to be able to get the services.


Very clear, very emphatic. Steve Lewis asked a follow-up question:


So you will not wind back that 30% private health rebate, despite the fact that Labor has been ideologically opposed to it in the past?


Ms Roxon's answer was:


No, we won't. 


You cannot get a more emphatic promise than that. The only more emphatic promise that I can remember in recent times is the promise by the Prime Minister of Australia, five days before the last election, that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—and we know what happened to that. We know that that Prime Minister Gillard before the last election misled the Australian people, the same as Labor has misled the Australian people for years on end about their true intentions in relation to the private health insurance rebate.


The reason the coalition is opposed to this legislation is because we understand that this is bad public policy. Any policy that makes it harder for people to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance is bad policy. Any policy that will push up the cost of private health insurance for millions of Australians is bad policy. Any policy that will see more Australians leave private health and join the public hospital system is bad public policy. Any policy that will see Australia re-enter the spiral that we experienced under the last Labor government, when private health insurance membership across Australia collapsed, is bad public policy.


Senator Colbeck in his remarks earlier was quite right: we should be doing more to encourage more Australians to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. We should be doing more to encourage more Australians to take out private health insurance. We should not be making it harder for people to remain in private health. Let me just address here one of the myths being peddled by the Labor Party. The Labor Party wants us to believe that somehow private health is only for the rich. Nothing could be further from the truth. Hundreds of thousands of people earning less than $50,000 per annum have private health insurance. In fact I will just go to the figures: 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000 per annum and 3.4 million people have an annual household income of less than $35,000 per annum.


The government will say: 'We aren't targeting those people. Those people won't be punished by having their rebate taken away. They'll still have the rebate.' The problem is that, with millions of Australians having their rebates scrapped altogether or dramatically reduced, health insurance for those that lose the rebate will go up automatically, without anything else, by 43 per cent, and every single one of the lower-risk people who perceives that health insurance has become too expensive for them to continue will put upward pressure on premiums for everyone else including those low- and middle-income Australians who every year struggle with the decision to put their money together to pay for their annual private health insurance. 


This of course will hurt all Australians who are in desperate need of timely access to public hospital care, because they will have to now compete with the increasing number of Australians who in the past would have been covered by private health insurance. This is very bad public policy. It is policy that Labor has pursued in the past. The point I would make to the Labor Party is that, if you do not learn from history, you are forced to repeat it. Those are not my words—I have just borrowed them; I do not quite know who first said them—but it is something that the Labor Party should carefully reflect on.


The point is this: our policy objective in the health portfolio should be to come up with a policy framework that ensures all Australians can have timely access to high quality hospital care. In order to achieve that in a way that is affordable for the taxpayer, we have got to make sure that we have got a sensible balance between a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private health system. We need to have a policy framework where those Australians who can afford to take out additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs have both the incentive to take it out and the disincentive not to take it out. That is where the Howard government's policy framework on private health insurance was so successful. Clearly, the Labor Party knew in the lead-up to the 2007 election that not only had it been very successful, it was also very popular. Why else would the Labor Party have bent over backwards again and again, making the most emphatic promise possible that they would not touch the private health insurance rebate, that they would retain the existing private health insurance rebate in its current form? Labor well understood that it was a policy that had worked and a policy that was popular with the Australian people.


I say to the Labor Party: stop making Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs pay for your waste and mismanagement over the last four years. Australians know that the Labor Party in government always stuffs up our public finances. Australians know that after a period of Labor in government it is always incumbent on the coalition to come back and fix up the mess. But don't make Australians who are putting their own private money into our health system pay for your wasteful spending, for your waste and mismanagement. Just because Labor is not able to balance its books, just because Labor delivers deficit after deficit and has taken our debt position back up to $133 billion, do not pursue policy that will ultimately be counter-productive; do not pursue policy that will ultimately increase the costs of providing affordable health care to all Australians. This is a path that you have gone down before. It has ended in tears before. You should learn the lessons of the past. If I can give the new Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, some advice: she should sit down with former senator Graham Richardson, a former Minister for Health, who commissioned a comprehensive review into private health insurance back in 1993 at the end of 10 years of failed Labor Party health policy, and consult with him about the implications and consequences of Labor's failed approach to health policy so she can learn from Labor's mistakes of the past. She should reflect on how successful the Howard government's policy framework in support of those Australians taking out private health insurance has been and reconsider her approach.


My advice to the Senate is that this legislation should be rejected. We should vote against it. It is bad policy. It will see the cost of health insurance go up, it will see more people leave private health insurance and it will put more pressure on our public hospitals. It is not a good policy and the Senate should reject it. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:38):  The legislation that the Senate is considering to abolish the private health insurance rebate is but the latest instalment in the Australian Labor Party's assault on the Australian middle class. For as long as I have been a senator, I have listened wearily to Labor politicians like Senator Kim Carr over there claim that the Labor Party's purpose is to look after struggling disadvantaged people and I have heard Labor politicians mock my side of politics and say we look after the interests of the well-to-do. But, if you look at this piece of legislation, nothing could be further from the truth because we in the coalition stand with ordinary Australians, everyday Australian families, middle-class Australians, working-class Australians, Australian working families who want to be able to have affordable private health insurance, and the Labor Party stands resolutely against the interests of those people.


Senator Cormann quoted some figures, and forgive me for repeating some of the observations that he made but they cannot be said often enough. The fact is that Australians want private health insurance: 53 per cent of Australians, 12 million people, have private health insurance. They are not the wealthy. I am sure most wealthy people have private health insurance, but the proportion of the private health insurance holders in Australia who could be regarded as wealthy or well-to-do is miniscule. The vast majority of Australians who have private health insurance are middle-class people, working people, working families who do not want to be reliant on the state, who do not want to be reliant on a state system, who want to look after themselves, who want to look after their children and who are prepared to make the extra sacrifices, work the extra few hours a week of overtime, to make that possible. They are aspirational Australians, not the well-to-do, not the toffs that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, occasionally mock, but everyday people. This is an attack on them. It is an attack on their wellbeing, it is an attack on their standard of living, and it is unconscionable.


Not only do 53 per cent of Australians currently have private health insurance but 46 per cent of Australians, almost as many, have hospital treatment cover and, of the people who hold private health insurance, 5.6 million—almost half of them—have annual household incomes of less than $50,000. When almost half of the people who make the sacrifice to pay for private health insurance are earning less than $50,000, what clown—what socialist dreamer—could possibly say private health insurance is the preserve of the wealthy? The whole point of having a private health insurance rebate is to make it affordable to as many people as possible down the income scale. That is why almost half of the people who hold private health insurance earn less than $50,000 a year. It is because coalition governments in years gone by have made it affordable for them.


This Labor government, which was elected in 2007 on the claim that it represented the interests of Australian working families, will make it harder for those poorer Australians—those less well off Australians—to be able to afford private health insurance. So much for the pieties and the crocodile tears of the Australian Labor Party about the interests of less well off Australians. Not only do 5.6 million of the 12 million Australians who hold private health insurance have incomes of less than $50,000 but 3.4 million of them—between a quarter and a third—have an annual household income of less than $35,000. I am sure we all know people—members of our families, people in our neighbourhood, people we know through the workplace—who struggle to keep private health insurance going because they do not want to be dependent on a state system. What an insult to those people, particularly coming from a party that falsely claims to represent the less well-to-do. What an insult to those people to say: 'We will make it less affordable for you. We will force you to be dependent on the state system when you would wish to look after yourself by paying that extra little bit of money for private health insurance.' What an insult to the poor, Senator Kim Carr. What an insult to the strugglers. What an insult to working families of Australia. And yet you sit there complacently, pleased with yourself, thinking that somehow, in some perverse way, this will advance social justice. It does not advance social justice, Senator Carr, to make life harder for poorer people, and that is what this will do. It will make life harder for poorer people. What a disgrace.


Not only is this measure profoundly inequitable—the reverse of social justice—it is also, as Senator Cormann pointed out, bad policy. What it will do is not merely make private health insurance less affordable to poorer people by driving up the cost of premiums; it will force more people into the public system and drive up the cost burdens on the public system. How foolish can that be at a time when there are enormous cost burdens on the health and hospital systems of Australia? And those burdens are escalating with every passing year. We have a measure which will make self-sufficiency harder by making it more difficult for people to insure themselves and, therefore, drive them into the public system, therefore increasing the costs of the public system. So whatever budget savings it might be imagined would be clawed back by this meretricious, dishonest and foolish policy are going to be but a fraction of the additional cost burdens imposed upon the public system and imposed upon public hospitals. What a foolish piece of public policy that is. It is a lose-lose proposition. You make less-well-to-do and poorer people poorer still, you make them dependants upon the state when they wish to be self-sufficient and you impose greater cost burdens on the state system so the state system into which these people have been thrown against their own wishes can less easily cope with that additional burden. So the overall quality of health care in Australia deteriorates. What an extraordinarily inept piece of public policy.


Not only does this measure suffer from the vice of being unjust because it punishes the least well-off people in our country; not only does it suffer from the vice of being foolish public policy because the outcome that will result is the opposite of the objective the policy seeks to serve, which is making the health system more efficient; it is, of course—and this is such a familiar refrain from the Rudd and the Gillard governments—built on a lie. Let us remember who it was who said: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and then introduced the world's greatest carbon tax and congratulated herself on doing do, celebrating her blatant deception of the Australian people by high-fiving her ministers on the floor of the House of Representatives, in one of the most shameful episodes in the history of Australian democracy.




Senator Sinodinos:
  Shame!




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you, Senator Sinodinos. That was the current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. Who was it who deceived Mr Andrew Wilkie over poker machine reform and the undertakings that she made to him about poker machine reform the moment she felt she did not need his vote on the floor of the House of Representatives because she had bought the vote of Mr Peter Slipper? The current Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  I think you should withdraw that. You are reflecting on a member of the other house. You should not do that.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I withdraw. Let me rephrase that: had by means about which we can only speculate secured the vote of Mr Peter Slipper. It was the current Prime Minister. And Mr Andrew Wilkie said that he realised that he had been deceived.


This Prime Minister, who lied to the public about the carbon tax, who deceived Mr Andrew Wilkie about poker machine reform, is at it again, because this measure is a flagrant violation of the most emphatic and unambiguous commitments given to the electorate. Senator Cormann read some of those commitments onto the record. Let me read them myself. This is what Ms Gillard wrote to the Australian newspaper in the last term of the coalition government. Referring to a letter by the then health minister, Mr Tony Abbott, which claimed that a Labor government had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate, she said:


The truth is that I never had a plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate … For all Australians who want to have private health insurance, the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election. … when I make ironclad commitment I intend on keeping it.


That is what this Prime Minister's word is worth. She attacked Mr Abbott, then the health minister, for suggesting that she planned to do the very thing that she is now doing and, with mock outrage, she claimed that she was being misrepresented. We now know the truth.


This is what the then health minister, Ms Roxon, said in more recent times. On 24 February 2009, in the Age newspaper, she said: 'The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.' In a media release issued by her office on 26 September 2007—just before the election of 2007, when the Labor Party came to power—she said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates …


During the 2007 election campaign, when interviewed on Meet the Press, Ms Roxon was asked by journalist Steve Lewis whether she committed to retaining, on behalf of the Labor Party, the private health insurance rebate. She said: 


Yes, I can. We've committed to it. We've committed to the 30 per cent, we've committed to the 35% and 40% for older Australians. It's similar to the safety net. We know that many people rely heavily on the assistance that is now provided and would not be able to have private health insurance if that rebate wasn't paid. And lifetime health cover and others that go with it, we are committed to those. We understand that Australia now has a mixed health system, both private and public, and we need them both to be strong in order for our community to be able to get the services.


This is what the then leader of the Labor Party, Mr Kevin Rudd, said a week before the 2007 election:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates—


There are no weasel words here. There is no room for ambiguity or confusion. It was, as Ms Roxon said, 'crystal clear'. It was, as Ms Gillard said, 'iron-clad'. It was, as Mr Rudd said, a 'clear' commitment that the Labor Party would leave the private health insurance rebate alone.


And what are we doing this afternoon? We are debating legislation that was introduced by a government that is now presided over by Ms Julia Gillard, and in which Ms Nicola Roxon continues to sit at the cabinet table, to do the very thing they gave a crystal clear, ironclad commitment never to do. It does not get much more shameless than that. It is no wonder that, as measured by empirical data, opinion polls, anecdotal evidence or whatever, so few people respect this Prime Minister. The reason is that the Australian people know she has not only misled them but also serially misleads them. They know that misleading the people is part of the political practice, part of the modus operandi, part of the playbook of this Labor government. It is disgusting, it is dishonest and it is deceitful, but it is the way this government does business.


We in the Liberal Party will oppose this legislation tooth and nail because it is dishonest, because it is bad policy and because it is socially regressive. Why should the least well-off people in this country lose one of the benefits for which they are prepared to work those extra hours and which means so much to them, to their sense of wellbeing and to the security of their families? Why should this government be allowed to reverse a policy commitment that it gave in evident good faith, in unambiguous words and with its hand on its heart, only for the people to discover that they have been deceived? Why should Australians settle for an inferior healthcare system? Why should Australians settle for overburdened public hospitals? Why should less well-to-do Australians be put in a situation where they can no longer afford their private health insurance cover—cover that they want and that they sacrifice for—because the government lied to them? Why should they put up with that? They should not put up with that. I am sorry to say that this is—like the carbon tax and so many other things—the most recent episode of shameless, callous, cold-eyed, cold-blooded duplicity and falsehood which has been the modus operandi of this Labor government.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  I rise to join the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related legislation. I begin by taking up a point that was raised by my colleague Senator Cormann in his contribution. He referred to a report from 1993 commissioned by—I think he would have been the Minister for Health—Senator Graham Richardson that was about private health insurance. That report found that coverage in the community of private health insurance had fallen to very low levels. We are talking about participation rates in the low 30s from memory. At the time I thought it was remarkable that the Labor government had commissioned such a report, simply because there had been a history of Labor, with almost a malignant neglect, seeking to reduce the private health insurance sector in Australia to something of a rump. It was heartening that he did that because that encouraged a debate in the community about private health insurance and the coalition went to the 1996 election with promises around a private health insurance incentive. Over the next few years that became a private health insurance tax rebate, which essentially is the measure we are talking about today in this series of bills before the Senate.


The point to be made about that measure is that it was quite deliberate, quite calculated and had a policy rationale. It was not simply a handout to the big end of town, as some people are alleging. The whole purpose of the incentive was to encourage people to exercise greater choice and to facilitate that choice. Just as we sought to do that in the education system—that is, the split between public and private schools and the assistance governments give to independent schools—so it was in the case of health: we were seeking to provide an incentive which facilitated choice. This had a benefit to the health system as a whole—that is, to take pressure off the public hospital system. That was the rationale in part for the measure. It was to provide a form of tax relief in its own way, but it was also to provide a measure to encourage the greater use of the private hospital system and to reward people who put their own resources into private health insurance. It encouraged a greater pool of people into private health insurance and it restrained the growth in premia and the like. That was important because the bigger the insurance pool, the more you can restrain the growth in the costs of premia.


We have a situation today where the government has decided, allegedly on budgetary grounds, that it must do something about this particular measure. I dispute that the government is doing this simply on budgetary grounds. I believe there is a history of Labor wishing, if not to negate this measure entirely, then at least to substantially cripple it. If we go back to when Labor went into opposition in 1996, there was a history of them attacking our initiatives around private health insurance. I believe that was driven by ideological considerations around their concern or their support for the public hospital system. We all support a strong and viable public hospital system, but we need to have other strong pillars to the health system and having a viable and strong private health system is one of them. So Labor for a long time opposed what we had done in government on private health insurance, but, as my colleagues have read onto the record, Labor increasingly came to the view that it was not politically sustainable to keep attacking this private health insurance incentive. From the 2004 election onwards, after the ill-fated experiment with one Mark Latham, Labor realised that having a hit list of independent schools was not a good way to show that it was for the community as a whole rather than sections of the community. It is important to put some ideological context around this: that there has for a long time been a view within Labor that the private health insurance system should be gutted or crippled.


Finally, there is a mechanism here in these bills which seeks in part to achieve Labor's objective. I do not believe it will end private health insurance as a whole, but it will significantly dent it and it will dent it by making cover ultimately more expensive and reducing the pool of people who are covered or who downgrade their cover. That will be to the cost of not only those people who, as Senator Brandis said, have been saving their money in order to afford such health insurance, but it will also be at a cost to the public hospital system, which will be under greater pressure. This is an important point because the health reforms that the Labor government introduced under the rubric of the Council of Australian Governments in recent years do not in any way have a structural reform component to them. I do not believe they will lead to better health outcomes. We have a situation where the pressure on the public hospital system as a result of Labor's health reforms will not abate and we are adding to that pressure by taking this incentive away.


This is one of a series of measures which this government has taken to means test various benefits. There is a rationale for means testing. We cannot offer everything to everybody and means testing has its place within the social security system and the like. The fact of the matter is we do not want millionaires to get pensions and the rest. However, this increasing trend toward means testing is starting to butt up against another objective of all governments which is: how do we reduce effective marginal tax rates? What is happening with more and more means testing as we go up the income scale is that we are adding more and more of these poverty traps into the system. There was a very good article written recently by Judith Sloan in the Australian, which went through the impact this sort of means testing on effective marginal tax rates. In brief, it means that, when we are means testing on family income as a whole, there is often then a disincentive if we increase the means testing for the secondary income earner—often the woman in the household—to cut back their hours of work because the family as a whole find that they lose income if they undertake more work. They start to lose income that comes through government benefits and the like, including incentives of this sort.


We have to look at this issue of private health insurance not only in the context of the merits of the debate around the contribution that governments make to the health system, but also in the context of the macro implications for the tax and transfer system. I believe that the Treasurer, Wayne Swan—someone who in the past has professed great support for tackling these sorts of poverty traps and high effective marginal tax rates—is undermining one of his own objectives by measures of this kind. My view has always been that if you want to tackle what you broadly describe as allegedly middle-class welfare by taking benefits away, means testing and all the rest of it, you should be compensating those people by at least reducing tax rates so that you improve incentives to work and save. That would be a much more balanced system, but that is not what we are doing here. This is essentially an ideological measure dressed up as a budgetary measure. Part of the sleight of hand in this process has been to prevent the cost of the private health insurance incentive, if it were allowed to keep on going over the next 30, 40 or 50 years. Of course, I could sit here and go through every element of the budget and do a similar analysis of the cumulative cost, whether it is the age pension, assistance to the automotive industry, assistance to other sections of the community—




Senator Mason:
  Higher education.




Senator SINODINOS:
  Higher education. You could come up with a humungous number. On the other side of the ledger, I could go through tax revenue and accumulate that over a period and come up with a humongous number.


Yes, there are budgetary pressures that come over time from growth in all sorts of budgetary outlays, but that of itself is not an argument for choosing to cut back one outlay rather than another. There has to be a policy rationale for what you do, and what I am arguing here is that the rationale is more ideological than it is essentially budgetary. Why ideological? I mentioned earlier the longstanding antipathy to these sorts of measures which promote greater choice between public and private sectors, but there is another element to this, and that element has been added by none other than your distinguished colleague, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, the Treasurer—it is his Monthly essay, his vituperative attack on three Australians who are risk takers and entrepreneurs out there earning their keep and providing jobs for their fellow Australians.


What I found remarkable about that contribution is that it was a deliberate attempt to set one Australian against another. It was a deliberate attempt to set allegedly working-class Australians and middle-class Australians against other Australians. I thought it was deplorable for that reason, because what unites most Australians today is a set of aspirations. We all want to do better. We do not want to be penalised for having a go. Having a go is as important to us as a fair go, and I thought that essay highlighted that the Treasurer was interested merely in seeking to stoke the politics of envy for reasons perhaps related to trying to get the public debate off the leadership crisis in the Labor Party and onto more fertile territory.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Sinodinos, can I draw your attention to standing order 193. You are getting very close to an imputation of improper motives against the Treasurer, so I just draw your attention to that.




Senator SINODINOS:
  I appreciate that, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would never want to impute impure motives to such a pure individual as the Treasurer. But may I say that this particular measure does smack, in part, of the politics of envy. The point I was making is that it seemed to be part of a suite of measures and seemed to be in part authored by a Treasurer who seems to be very keen on the politics of envy.


The coalition has always believed that choice is important, in both health and education, and I believe this measure is one that appeals across the various income groups in the community. My colleague Senator Brandis spoke about the number of low-income Australians who use the private health insurance incentive or have private health insurance cover. Indeed, to go through some electorates close to my own heart, let me start with the electorate of Dobell. In Dobell, 46.1 per cent of voters have private health insurance—not 20 per cent, not 25 per cent, but 46.1. The number of persons covered by private health insurance in that electorate is almost 60,000 people. In Robertson, another fine upstanding electorate, 55.5 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered with private health insurance in the electorate is 73,869. That is a lot of Australians in Robertson who are covered by this measure.


If I go to a safer Labor seat, Blaxland, once occupied by the Hon. Paul Keating, 42.7 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate is 60,516. In the seat of Grayndler, the cradle of Anthony Albanese, 60.1 per cent of voters have private health insurance. It is even higher than those seats on the Central Coast. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate of Grayndler is 77,898. They are the people who the Hon. Anthony Albanese is going to be harming through this particular measure. If we go to Hunter, a safe seat in the Hunter Valley, 51 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate is 66,346. In the seat of Newcastle—a good working-class seat; I was born in Newcastle—55.2 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered by private health insurance in the electorate is 69,726. In the seat of Shortland, next door, just to round it off, 50.8 per cent of voters have private health insurance. The total of persons covered with private health insurance in the electorate is 65,971.


People scrimp and save to have the peace of mind of private health insurance. And what we are talking about here is not some select group people in Vaucluse, Toorak or the relevant parts of Adelaide or Perth—Peppermint Grove or wherever. We are talking about a swathe of people in a swathe of electorates who would be disadvantaged by this particular measure going through. So I stand up here disillusioned with the promises Labor made that it would retain the private health insurance incentive. I am very disillusioned and concerned about the deterioration of the risk pool and the impact that that will have on upward pressure on premiums for all 12 million Australians with private health insurance, with more people forced to utilise overstretched public hospitals.


After years of waste and mismanagement Labor is hiking prices for working Australians to pay for their own budgetary and other shortcomings. My concern here is that, at a time when the cost of living is without a doubt the No. 1 issue in federal and state politics across the country, here we have a government adding to the cost of living. We have already had initiatives around the carbon tax, which will add to the cost of living—and may I say that the evidence mounts every day that those costs are going to be higher than the government has estimated. Already we have received information around increases in landlord leases and the like, reflecting an increase in the carbon tax going through their books. What we have is a tax that will cascade through the stages of production. It is not a GST, where there is only a price effect on the final consumer; it will cascade through the various stages of production. The cost of living is being exacerbated and then we have other measures like the private health insurance incentive means testing that we are talking about here today, which will add to that as well.


I come back to a point I made earlier: the government is in danger of creating even further poverty traps and even further entrenching effective marginal tax rates up the system. The main impact of that would be on secondary income earners in families. I do not believe this was a tough decision for Labor to take. We get a lot of breast-beating and braggadocio about tough reforms and tough fiscal decisions. This was not a tough decision for Labor to make, given its history of promises to remove the private health insurance incentive in the past. It backflipped on that promise and then said, hand on heart, that it would keep it. Sadly, that promise as well has not been kept. It is one of a number of promises that have not been kept.


They can say that they were mugged by reality on the first day of coming to government. We are not talking about that; we are talking about attempts to do this some years after coming to government. The only other explanation I can think of is that, apart from the ideological intent behind this measure, budgetary pressures forced the government into taking these measures. All I can say is: if only the government had listened to the coalition at the time of the global financial crisis! We supported the first round of stimulus but we were prudent, we wanted to wait, because it was clear Australia was not going to be affected in the same way as other countries. We were prudent then and we have been proven right by history in that regard. Unfortunately, Labor put into the system a whole series of programs. For example, with Building the Education Revolution, there are still schools around the country receiving grants. Once the program was implemented it was very hard to stop. We all acknowledge that, but the point is that it can no longer be presented as a fiscal stimulus program, continuing as it does at a time when the economy has been in more than recovery mode.


Sadly, we were saddled with a much bigger debt and deficits coming out of the global financial crisis than were necessary, and that has necessitated the government taking all sorts of measures. Yet, disappointingly, last year when there was a window of opportunity for the government to take more stringent budgetary measures, they squibbed the opportunity to do so. There were $22 billion worth of savings in last year's budget but $19 billion worth of new spending, so the net bottom line contribution over the forward estimates was $3 billion.


People say, 'Okay, what's the coalition committed to doing?' The coalition is committed to restoring this sort of measure as soon as it is affordable. We see it as having a policy rationale that is robust. We want to maintain a strong private pillar in the health system and we believe that is going to benefit the health system as a whole. We believe that, if we can come to power within 18 months, there is sufficient time to reverse this measure and some of the damage that will be done in the meantime to the health system as a whole.


I call on the government, if they are serious about health reform, to also review the COAG health reforms that they have put into the system. I do not believe, as I said earlier, that these reforms will necessarily lead to structural change in the system in the way that we want. They will not restrain the growth in health costs or improve health outcomes. I call on the government to take a more comprehensive approach. It is a pity that the government did not respond to our calls for a committee to further review this legislation and perhaps have a broader overview of what can be done to promote a better, more affordable and sustainable health policy going forward.


Finally, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, I did not have the opportunity to check out what the private health insurance statistics may be around places like Springwood in the seat of Macquarie. I am certainly going to make it my business to do so and to remind people in that electorate that it is very important for them to maintain their private health insurance and the impact that this measure will have on their capacity to do so.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-03-15,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:19):  I too rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. I note and share Senator Sinodinis's disillusionment, and I am sure all coalition senators have shared it as we have debated these bills in the Senate over the last couple of days. The minister, when introducing these bills in the House of Representatives, said that this was going to lead to a fairer and more sustainable health system. That is just a misnomer. There is nothing fair, or equitable or sustainable for the health system and for those using it in this nation. Our health system is the envy of the world. Everything that we need to be doing in this place and in our states is to focus on ensuring that that stays the case.


The government is planning to means test the private health insurance rebates and, at the same time, approve a premium rise. Families are already doing it tough in these hard economic times. These are families who, in a few short months, will be facing the effects of a carbon tax which will be, as Senator Sinodinos said, cascading right through our economy—from our primary producers producing our milk, to the tankers picking it up and delivering it to the milk processors in the regions, right the way through to the refrigerators that are refrigerating it on its way to the nearest supermarket in our capital cities. All the way through, that supply chain will be bearing an extra cost.


It is not fair at all that hardworking families in regional areas and right across our nation who have taken the tough decision to take out healthcare cover are now going to be slugged for the privilege. In 2009 the then health minister, Minister Roxon, said that the government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. We are not at all surprised that there has been another backflip by a minister from this government, another betrayal of the Australian people by Labor. People who have sat down around the kitchen table and worked out their family budget—'Will we go overseas on that holiday, will we go to Queensland or will we go camping down the coast and keep our private health insurance?'—have had the conversation and kept the insurance only to find that they are not going to be supported in that decision. It is yet another example of the Labor government doing something in haste without considering the impact and without thorough investigation. The government is obviously having a bet both ways.


The means testing of rebates will be effective on 1 July, and as a result the average middle-class family will see a reduction in the taxpayer refund against the cost of their private health cover. The more they earn, obviously, the more they will pay. Fifty-two percent of Australians hold private health insurance, including about 40 per cent of Australians in regional areas. Sixty-five per cent of those living in the electorate of Mallee in Victoria hold private health insurance. It might seem counterintuitive—there are not a lot of private hospitals out there in the regions. Why would the vast majority of regional Australians, particularly those in Mallee, hold private health insurance? It is because it supports the public system, and regional Australians understand that. They understand that to keep their specialists heading out our way they need to be able to charge private rates. They are only going to be able to charge those if people out there in the regions hold private health insurance. Describing these hard-working Australians as 'millionaires'—like it is a dirty word—shows how out of touch this government is with the day-to-day struggles of working Australians. Penalising people for taking responsibility for their own health care makes no sense. This is in addition to taxation they are already paying with the Medicare levy. Once again, as they earn more, they pay more.


The health system is multilayered, and funding it is a complex issue. But there is a simple logic to the statement that, if you drive people out of private health insurance and they end up in the public system, it simply puts more pressure on that system and on our already overstretched public hospitals. If you drive healthy young people out of private health insurance—if those under 30 are making decisions about whether they are going to take it up or not—everyone's premiums will go up.


Why do regional Australians bother taking out private hospital cover if there are fewer hospitals? They are insuring against catastrophe, like anyone else who takes out insurance. They want to ensure that they can access a variety of health services—obviously, at their own public hospital in their own regional centre but, if something goes wrong, they want to be able to ensure that they and their loved ones can access the specialist care that they need. That may be 200 kilometres down the road or it might be 1,000 kilometres down the road. Regional people understand that it means going to either a regional centre or a capital city for treatment. They still want the peace of mind of their choice of doctor and no waiting list.


Many people also have a sense of obligation. Many believe that if they can afford private health insurance that they should, wherever possible, leave those beds for public patients. It is well known out in the regions that private health insurance is what keeps our public hospitals going. Typically, private hospitals in regional centres have lower occupancy rates—meaning that they operate on wafer-thin margins. Any erosion in those rates will be magnified in regional hospitals and will be likely to force cuts to services or potentially cause some private hospitals to close their doors entirely. Those people using the private services in regional areas are relying on them for repeat admissions over a course of treatment and for ongoing health conditions. Those families can ill afford to lose the benefits they have accessed for over a decade, and will be devastated to see them pared back.


Another issue is that of the visiting specialists who visit regional private hospitals. Any tinkering with the rebate that causes a cutback in demand in regional private hospitals will flow directly to the specialists, who will retreat to the cities, denying regional patients local access to the expertise and services they need and forcing those patients to travel further and at greater cost for consultations and treatment.


Another issue that I would like to briefly touch on is something that people have mentioned consistently, and that is just what a poor public policy response this government has. We on the coalition side are not surprised that this government is just pursuing middle-class Australia and whacking those who can least afford it, because they see it as a cheap and easy way to make up for Swannie's surplus misadventures. I just think it is—

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:28):  When I was young, I recall playing a game that my parents bought me one Christmas. I forget what the game was called, but there was a vertical column and there were marbles in the top of this column. There were sticks that went horizontally into this column and the idea was that each player in turn withdrew a stick from the column and hoped that they were not the one that released all the marbles into the bottom of the column. The name will come to me at some point—probably later in the speech, so I will leave members in suspense until I can think of it. Obviously, nobody else in the Senate at the moment played that game and they cannot refresh my memory.





The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Humphries, I have been advised that it was called Ker Plunk!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Thank you very much Mr Acting Deputy President. You obviously were not playing it yourself—it was not a popular game in Scotland, no doubt. Or you were too young—or possibly too old? I would not venture which that might be—but thank you. The game springs to mind in the course of this debate because it rather seems to me that the federal Labor government is playing a game of pulling out a stick from this structure of public and private hospital and health infrastructure in Australia—a stick worth $2.8 billion over the forward estimates. It is hoping—it is not necessarily very sure, but it is hoping—as it pulls this stick out that somehow the marbles do not fall and that the people in the private health system who have private health insurance and who are taking a load off the public hospital system at the bottom of the column do not cascade down into the bottom of that column. That gamble is—




Senator Polley:
  What about the effect of the $1 billion Tony Abbott ripped out of health?




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  I am happy to defend against that fallacious argument. There was no $1 billion ever taken out of the public hospital system or the public health system of Australia by Mr Abbott or anybody else in the coalition government. But, to stay with my point, we have a situation where the federal government have determined that they can withdraw that amount of money and they are hoping that it will not have serious consequences for the quality of the public hospital system in our country.


They have conceded, I suppose, that at least one marble will fall. The government say as a result of their own modelling that 27,000 people will drop their cover as a result of this measure. Let us call that one marble dropping to the bottom of the column. If that were the case, the gamble might have paid off at least partly. But we have among the range of estimates of what will happen if the federal government withdraw that $2.8 billion other much less rosy scenarios or predictions of what will happen. I note that the government's own medical insurer, Medibank Private, estimates that 37,000 of its members alone are likely to drop their cover and a further 92,500 will downgrade their health coverage, most likely by dropping out of hospital cover. Deloitte have done their own work. Their estimate is very sobering. They estimate that in the first year alone of this new scheme 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade their cover. Over five years, Deloitte estimate that 1.6 million people will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. As a result, they estimate that private health insurance premiums will rise by 10 per cent above what they would otherwise have risen by. If that turns out to be the case, a lot of marbles are dropping and a lot of serious consequences are flowing down to the public hospital system and the public health system of Australia.




Senator Mason:
  Labor's lost their marbles!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You could say they have lost their marbles, Senator Mason. I think that it is clear, however, that the government just do not know what is going to happen with this measure. We have a national economy which is good in parts, like the curate's egg, but which leaves a large number of Australians who are struggling and where living standards generally across Australia are falling. Yet the government believe that when people face these sorts of cost pressures—higher cost of government charges, higher taxes, higher cost of local services, higher cost of petrol and these other cost of living pressures—somehow in the midst of all of that pressure they will not drop their private health insurance. It is a big gamble.


We have a situation where clearly our public hospital systems are struggling to cope with the level of demand on them, and that level of demand is likely to increase significantly as a result of people dropping their private health insurance, particularly with respect to hospital coverage, as people decide that they simply cannot afford to sustain that coverage and they can go to a public hospital system. They probably factor in a certain loss of quality as a result of that, but nonetheless in tough economic times they may well decide that that is a rational decision to make to help sustain their family's standard of living.


Twelve million Australians—over half of the population—have private health insurance, and 10.4 million of them have hospital treatment cover. It is very hard to imagine that Australians will sustain that level of investment in their own health when they have such enormous pressures on them overall and when the government is signalling that it no longer wishes to support them in the choice to sustain a proportion of the cost of their health care—because that is what this step is doing. It is saying to people, 'Don't worry about providing for your own coverage and covering the cost of your health care by taking out private measures; our government system will cover you.' Indeed, it might, but at what cost to the public purse and at what cost in loss of quality in the process?


This measure, I think, will lead to a very large number of Australian families deciding not to continue with coverage, at least to the same extent that they have today. I imagine that would be a decision made by a large number of people in my own community, the Australian Capital Territory, where at this stage we have, and have had for some time, the highest level of private health insurance in the country—56.4 per cent of people in the ACT are insured. That is over 200,000 people. Clearly it is citizens of the ACT who will lose very significantly out of these arrangements, because the government has classed people earning more than $83,000 as—to use a phrase employed in debate earlier today—'super-rich' or 'super-wealthy'. I think that greatly mischaracterises the sorts of people who are noticing a loss of living standards and who are struggling to make ends meet. The fact is that this change will affect many people at many levels, because if people who can afford at the moment to take out private health insurance withdraw in significant numbers it must have implications in a number of areas. It must lead to higher premiums, not just for people on higher incomes but across the board. So those millions of Australians on low incomes, those 3.4 million people with a household income of less than $35,000 per year, who presently have private health insurance will have to consider their position as their insurance premiums rise. It will also affect the suppliers of private health services. I am thinking particularly of smaller private hospitals in regional Australia which may not be a vastly profitable proposition at the present time but who will find that as a significant proportion of their communities withdraws from private health insurance the viability of their enterprises will diminish. When we see a few of those sorts of hospitals or health centres close—and bear in mind that most elective surgery in Australia today is done in private hospital settings or private clinical settings—in many communities the withdrawal of that kind of service will drive more people into already very pressured public hospital systems.


All of that adds up to a loss of quality and capacity in Australia's healthcare system. Where does the $2.8 billion come from? It comes directly from the pockets of Australians that the government chooses to characterise as super-wealthy or super-rich. I do not think that that characterisation is fair. I think that, in recent years, we have seen tremendous pressure on Australians at all levels. Some of the safety net for those people has been enhanced in some ways with compensation arrangements, particularly for lower incomes, but it is very much middle Australia that this measure is targeted at. I make no apologies for advocating for middle Australia in this place, because I do not think we need to be picking off sections of the community and saying that they can afford a hit here, that they can afford to have their standard of living sliced on the edge because they are wealthy enough to sustain that sort of decision.


We are still a wealthy country, and if it were not for the profligate decisions made by this government with respect to the way it has spent the taxpayer's dollar in recent years we would not need to make these sorts of decisions. We have to take $2.8 billion out of the pockets of Australians in order to sustain the government's vision of a surplus budget into the future. We need not be in this position and we on this side of the chamber reject the idea that we have to create this kind of paradigm: to cut the living standards of Australians in order to meet the government's budgetary requirements.


I fear for the effectiveness of Australia's public hospital system. As a former health minister in the ACT, I know that, as people come through the reception areas of in-patient departments, the system is incredibly sensitive to the number of decisions about where people will go. Will they go to a private bed or to a public bed? When more people take the turn on the left side to go to the public beds, it puts huge pressure on the rest of the system. We can expect more of that because of this government's somewhat perverse vision of how to improve health care in Australia.


I remind members of this chamber, as others have done, that the decision to remove that stick worth $2.8 billion was a broken promise. I recall very well the words used by the then shadow minister for health before the 2007 election that this was Liberal hysteria—that the Liberals were being hysterical in suggesting that there would be any tampering with the private health insurance rebate. It is interesting because the other time in Australian politics that I recall the phrase 'Liberal hysteria' being used was with respect to claims made by the opposition in 2010 that the Gillard government was going to impose a carbon tax. According to Treasurer Swan that was Liberal hysteria as well. I suspect that we should be very sensitive to the words 'Liberal hysteria' in the future and assume that, when we hear that phrase, it means that they are on to us, that we have been caught out, that they know what we are up to.


I simply indicate that I think Australians will be poorer and the health system will be weaker as a result of the measures which the Senate is being asked to approve today. The Greens have long advocated for pulling out of this particular measure. In fact, they say the whole of the private health insurance rebate should go. They have no compunction about imagining that they can find the extra dollars necessary to sustain a hospital system where nobody uses private health insurance or private hospitals. But that is the bizarre world of the Greens. I for one will not stand by and support a situation where—



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  A lot fewer people were using private hospitals and private health before the rebate, and today we have a strong private health and hospital system in this country because the Howard government had the vision to sustain people's decisions to take out private health insurance and invest in their own health care. That is the way the system was improved. Enormous pressure was taken off the shoulders of public hospitals in this country by virtue of that decision, and you guys are going to put that pressure right back there when you support this measure today. I urge the Senate to reject this legislation. It amounts to a cut in the quality of health care in this country and a reduction in the living standards of millions of Australians.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (17:44):  I rise to address briefly the issue of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. Because of the guillotine the government is going to apply the opposition does not have time to address it in the detail we would like, but I have a few key points to make.


It is important as we look at this issue of means testing the private health rebate that we look at the big picture of our health system, and that we take a longer term view. Our health system delivers some of the best health outcomes in the world and Australians are enjoying an increasingly excellent life expectancy. That is partly because of the fact that we have this dual health system, where public hospitals treating the insured can bill insurance companies but can also purchase high-volume private surgery when the waiting lists blow out. The Productivity Commission report of last year indicates that the private system is very competitive, if not far more efficient than the public system. The sustainability of that system in the long term is really important.


It is clear that taxpayers alone cannot carry the load of the future financing of health care in Australia. The budget pressures will increase substantially. Population projections point to a doubling in the proportion of the population aged 65 and over by 2050, and a quadrupling in the proportion of the population aged 85 and over in the same period. What we are seeing there is a huge increase in costs. The second Intergenerational report forecast that expenditures on health will grow from 3.8 per cent of GDP back in 2006-07 to 7.3 per cent of GDP by 2046-47. That means that, more and more, we are going to need to balance the health system between a reliance on the public purse and on individuals playing their part in financing it. That means that the private insurance system must be sustainable, and it will not be sustainable if this government takes measures that mean we reduce the size of the pool of people who are paying into that across their lifetimes.


I turn to touch quickly on the politics of this. The government's approach to this has been divisive at best, and its accusations, for example, that it does not want to see the cleaners in this place pay for the health care of the rich, are crass at worst. The government does not take into account the fact that people on low incomes are not paying for anyone's rebates, because people on low incomes do not pay net tax. Anyone earning less than $820 weekly, or below $900 for families, get more from the government than they pay in tax. The Treasury calls that the net tax threshold. It is also important to realise that this is not the domain of the wealthy. One-third of people who have private health insurance earn less than $32,000, and the median income of people who have private health insurance is only $47,000—hardly the domain of the rich.


There are consequences of the decision that the government is making. Many of my colleagues have talked about the decline that modelling shows will occur. Government figures show that currently some 5.6 million Australians are privately insured. The Deloitte report indicates that some 1.6 million will withdraw from their private hospital cover over a five-year period and 4.3 million will downgrade to lower levels of cover. The most important thing to look at, though, is what is going to happen in the area of allied health, or the extras cover. The Australian Physiotherapy Association said in one of their submissions that they were alarmed at the lack of consideration of ancillary cover in the Treasurer's analysis. They are alarmed for very good reason. For those with extras cover the impact is expected to be greater—nearly one in five, or 18 per cent, will drop their extras altogether, with a further one in three, or 34 per cent, likely to downgrade. Putting the two groups together—those who drop the cover altogether and those who downgrade the extras—shows some 52 per cent will potentially cut back on extras cover, things like dental, optical, physiotherapy, podiatry et cetera.


There are two real impacts from this that this place should be aware of, and that the government should be ashamed that they have not taken into account. I have recently run a number of rural health forums around regional South Australia, and one of the consistent bits of feedback was that the delivery of health services into regional areas, both from GPs and allied health professionals, relies heavily on people being privately insured. Allied health professionals told us that the viability of their businesses depends on people who come to them with private health insurance, and once the businesses cut back—whether that be allied health professionals or private hospitals or the ability to encourage surgeons and other specialists to visit regional areas—we will see a collapse of services in parts of that market. Many people who are there in a private capacity also lend their services to the public system. If the floor on which they base their private practice is removed then we will see those services become unavailable to the public system because the state governments are not funding those services adequately through their hospitals.


There is another area in which this is particularly important. Allied health, which is what extras cover provides, is an important part of preventative health strategy. I met recently with the Podiatry Association, which indicated that Australia has the worst diabetes amputation rate in the industrialised world with 85 Australians losing a foot every week because of diabetes—about one every two hours. Countries that have mainstreamed podiatry and multidisciplinary foot teams have amputation rates 40 to 65 per cent less than Australia's. Guidelines indicate that the 206,000 Australians with diabetes should have an average of four to eight consultations with a podiatrist each year as a preventative measure. Currently, Medicare only funds a total of five allied health consults, which means that many people will only get a Medicare funded podiatry consultation once or twice a year. At the moment, the gap for many people is made up with private health insurance.


The Podiatry Association had a proposal to see the number of Medicare places increased. Given that each amputation costs the health system $100,000 over the life of a patient, they highlighted that by increasing the number of Medicare funded places they would save 167,000 hospital bed days, 3,500 amputations and $400 million each year. If people drop their extras cover, it will reduce their access to podiatrists—and you could probably extend this across other allied health areas,. That means we will not be seeing the same level of preventive health care. The unintended consequence will be that more high cost health care is required in hospitals.


For purely ideological reasons this government is seeking to wind back private health insurance. This will have a flow-on effect not just through pressures on the public hospital system but particularly on regional communities because it undermines the viability of private practice. Perversely, it will increase costs for the government by decreasing people's access to preventive health care. There is much more I could say but, in deference to my colleague who wishes to speak before the government applies the guillotine, I will end by saying I do not support this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,2,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-03-15,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:52):  I am deeply indebted to my colleague for giving me the chance to speak on this legislation. What we are seeing today is the Australian Labor Party dropping Australian families for a grubby deal with their fellow class-warfare combatants the Australian Greens. The losers from this will be the Australian people.


I know colleagues have referred to the Deloitte report, as I do to put my comments in context. Deloitte says 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover in the first year and a further 580,000 would be expected to downgrade. Over five years 1.6 million would drop cover and 4.3 million would downgrade. Also private health insurance premiums would rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. Deloitte says there would be an additional $3.8 billion in recurrent costs for the public hospital system, 2.8 million people with general treatment cover would withdraw and 5.7 million would downgrade. The government says Deloitte is wrong, but the government has not had Treasury do its own modelling in relation to this matter. We have Deloitte saying one thing, while the government and the Australian Greens refuse to do anything about it. I will go with Deloitte. I also refer to a company called GMHBA, proudly based in Geelong and Colac. GMHBA are actively involved in the Colac community. Last year they had a healthy breakfast program where they got together with a whole lot of other bodies to assist the kids in Colac.


Some members in the other place—the members for Bendigo, Ballarat, Corio and Corangamite—who have been remarkably quiet in relation to this debate. Remarkably, between them they represent a quarter of a million Australians who are covered by health insurance, yet there was hardly a peep from these people. In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and member for Ballarat, Catherine King, has said nothing, which is remarkable. I will go through the figures: in the member for Corangamite's case, 84,442 people in his electorate are covered by private health insurance. The member for Corio represents 69,946 people with private health insurance. The members of Ballarat and Bendigo represent 64,203 and 56,375 people respectively with private health insurance. More than 100,000 people with private health insurance are not being properly represented.


The member for Corangamite has been remarkably quiet since his very foolish intervention in the leadership battle. He claimed:


In my community in Geelong people do not believe that it is appropriate for people earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to get middle class welfare from the Commonwealth to help support them in having private health insurance.


We are not talking about people earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are potentially talking about mums and dads, a schoolteacher and a police officer raising three kids in Ocean Grove, in Mount Helen, in Golden Point or in Belmont—that is who we are talking about. Mr Cheeseman, the member for Corangamite, had clearly just picked up some notes and had not bothered to look at the Deloitte report when he said:


They are reforms that will make our healthcare system more sustainable, recognising that as we live longer our health needs become greater and we need additional money in the system to support people.


Deloitte says it is the exact opposite of that. He also told the House of Representatives:


… these bills are fair. They are appropriate. It has been a consistent position that we have held for a long time.


Let us talk about the consistent position of the Labor Party as told to us by the man who was supported by the member for Corangamite—the failed member for Corangamite—in relation to the leadership battle and everything else he touches. Before the 2007 election, what did former Labor leader Kevin Rudd tell the Australian Health Insurance Association? The shadow health minister, who is sitting beside me, knows that he said:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Nicola Roxon is now Attorney-General. I wonder why she was moved out as this was coming up. We will never know, will we? She said on 24 February:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


Mr Cheeseman was clearly wrong with when he said, 'It's been a consistent position that we've held for a long time.' That is simply not right. That is simply incorrect. That is another example of a broken promise. We have the Prime Minister's great political lie that 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'. We now have broken promises in relation to private health insurance. We have the members for Bendigo, Ballarat, Corio and Corangamite refusing to say anything about this matter. The only one who did say anything got it absolutely wrong when he said that the Labor Party's position in relation to this matter has been consistent. It has not been consistent with the ironclad guarantees given by Mr Rudd before the 2007 election.


A lot of Australians have voted on the back of their understanding of the Australian Labor Party's policy in relation to this matter. A lot of people have gone to ballot boxes on the basis that the Labor Party would never ever interfere with these private health insurance rebates. They have been absolutely let down by a government which refuses to keep its promises, and we will come in here day after day after day and demand that the Australian Labor Party keeps its election promises. They have failed to do so at the moment, they have failed to do so in the past and we will make absolutely sure that they do so in the future.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (22:30):  I rise to speak this evening about the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence, which this year is held tomorrow, Friday, 16 March. This national day of action occurs on the third Friday in March each year and is organised by all Australian education authorities through the Safe and Supportive School Communities project, which is managed by the Queensland government on behalf of Australia's government, Catholic and independent school communities. Students and teachers are encouraged to wear orange to take a stand together against bullying and violence and hold local activities involving students and families to raise community awareness of the importance of taking a stand against bullying and violence in schools. The national day of action is supported by the Australian government, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the ACMA's Cybersmart program, Kid's Helpline and Mix radio stations.


Bullying and violence, unfortunately, is still a feature of our schools and of society more generally. Bullying can take a number of forms, including physical, psychological, emotional, social, violence, and cyberbullying. Bullying in all its forms is an abuse of power by someone who is stronger in some way, whether it be physically, mentally, verbally, socially, electronically, politically or financially. The act of bullying can represent distrust, fear, misunderstanding, lack of knowledge or jealousy on the part of the bully—all factors that schools can address in positive and active ways.


Bullying can have a considerable effect on those who are bullied, causing cumulative layers of primary and secondary injuries. These include physical, psychological, social and identity injuries. Bullying can have a long-term effect on those who are bullied, affecting studies, careers, relationships and even financial wellbeing. It can cause severe post-traumatic stress disorder lasting many years. Those that are bullied may be targeted for a number of reasons, including those of gender, sexuality, cultural and linguistic diversity, religious diversity, disability, socioeconomic status, interests or who they associate with. It can occur regularly over months or years.


Everyone has the right to feel safe and respected, but we also have the responsibility to help guarantee these same rights for others. The focus of the 2012 national day of action will be on parents and families taking a stand together with school communities and recognising the important role everyone plays.


School communities should be positive spaces where students learn about who they are and their value and worth in relation to others. Positive changes can be made in school communities by incorporating support for individuals, by having fair and consistent expectations and by having approaches that address the deeper issues and encourage wellbeing for all individuals, groups and the whole school community. We know that school communities are addressing issues of bullying, harassment and violence. The national day of action helps school communities in this task by raising awareness and drilling to the core of some of these issues.


There are a variety of resources for the whole school, for the classroom, for parents and for students available at the Bullying. No Way! website, which can be accessed at bullyingnoway.com.au These resources include links to websites, fact sheets, teaching resources, T-shirt transfers and posters. There are also suggested activities for students, parents, a single classroom and the whole school.


As one of the key supporters of the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence, the ACMA are running a number of events around the country. These activities will focus on cyberbullying, with the use of social networking sites, mobile phones and texting central to the theme. These activities will include Cybersmart Hero activities in schools across the country and the promotion of their Tagged DVD, which features cyberbullying as a core issue to schools. Cybersmart Hero is an anti-cyberbullying program developed by the ACMA. In Cybersmart Hero, students play the role of the bystander who becomes aware of a cyberbullying program at school. As the scenario unfolds, students are required to discuss the issues and make decisions about the responsible course of action. Tagged has continued to be very popular since its release, with over 5,000 hard copies distributed and 28,000 views on YouTube. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the ACMA on the news that Tagged has been accepted as a finalist entry in the New York International Film and Television Awards, to be judged in April. To have this film nominated for such a prestigious award is a great recognition of the outstanding work the ACMA undertakes. 


The new Bullying. No way! website will be launched on the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence, which, as I said, is tomorrow. The new website will include some new innovative interactive applications, including a choose-your-own-adventure game for students to learn how to deal with bullying and videos for parents and students. The new website also includes dedicated parent, teacher and student portals, including resources for teachers and information for parents on their role in managing bullying. Students will soon have the chance to try out the popular avatar builder. Students will also be able to learn how to deal with bullying in their own portal, www.takeastandtogether.gov.au, also to be launched on the national day of action. To further support students, an iPhone application has been developed to keep strategies and tools for students close at hand. The app will be available free in the Apple app store from 16 March. This supports existing resources such as the cybersafety help button available for Windows and Mac, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone 7.


The ACMA's Cybersmart unit encourages families and schools to work together to inform and protect their children by having conversations on the national day of action about cyberbullying and understanding the role that each person can play in stopping the bullying cycle. An outreach internet safety awareness online presentation will be held for students on the national day of action following the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development's 'Illuminate' platform. This presentation examines the potential risks faced by teenagers when online and focuses specifically on identifying and preventing cyberbullying. It also includes the related areas of positive online activity, positive friendships, being a positive bystander and safe social networking. Digital citizenship, including digital footprint and digital reputation will also be covered.


ACMA is also encouraging schools to screen Tagged on the day and to use the supporting lesson plans and videos. As has been mentioned, Tagged is a cyberbullying resource for schools that encourages young people to reflect on the real-life consequences caused by cyberbullying, sexting and a negative digital reputation.


Cybersmart outreach trainer Greg Gebhart will present a workshop at the Kids in CyberSpace seminar at the New South Wales Teachers Federation Conference Centre tomorrow. The seminar will cover cybersafety, online behaviour, digital culture and cyberwellness of young people. ACMA will also have a stand to promote Cybersmart resources and the national day of action at this event. The ACMA Cybersmart website will also feature posts from various perspectives, including school principal, parents and a Kids Helpline counsellor.


All children have the right to learn in a safe and supportive school environment that values diversity, an environment free from bullying, harassment, discrimination and violence. The government is concerned about issues such as cyberbullying in our schools. As such, the government has dedicated a significant amount of money—over $125 million—to its cybersafety plan. I am pleased that these funds can be used to support events, including the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence.


It is exciting that the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence provides an opportunity to promote the excellent cybersafety resources produced by ACMA. As Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety I can assure the Senate that cybersafety is an important priority for this Labor government. We all have the right to be treated with fairness and dignity, whether in real life or online, and we all have a responsibility to keep others safe and to treat them in the same way—with fairness, dignity and respect. The National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence is an excellent opportunity to raise awareness of these issues in our schools, in our communities and in our homes. More information about the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence is available on the Bullying. No Way! website at www.bullyingnoway.com.au and I would recommend that everyone has a look at it.
