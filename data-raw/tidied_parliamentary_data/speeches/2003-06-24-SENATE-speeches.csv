"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I continue my remarks on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2]. The government's response to the submissions, letters, public meetings and lobbying that met the introduction of their first round of legislation changes in this area has been minimal. What we have now is a clear differentiation. What we have now is that all people who are currently receiving disability support pension, or who will have their claims finalised by the end of this month, will not be subject to the reduction in the capacity of work hours from 30 hours to 15 hours. However, all people who are now claiming disability support pension and who will be receiving their pension after 1 July this year will be treated differently. It is not just about the culture of differentiation among people who are in receipt of the same payment, who have the same disability, who mix in the same communities, who are facing the same challenges and who are, in fact, eager to be involved in `participation' as determined by the government—it is not just about that—it is about the very specific series of differences they will face in their daily financial lives.
We will have the situation where two people with exactly the same disability and barriers to employment will be on two different payments. One will receive the higher paying disability support pension, along with all the other benefits such as the pensioner concession card, pharmaceutical allowance, access to the pensioner education supplement, and—with an income test that claws back less of any earnings they make—they will have a greater incentive to work. The other person, with exactly the same disability, will receive a lower paying allowance that is worth about $60 per fortnight less. That is a significant amount. It is significantly more than the tax cuts which we are told people should be welcoming at the moment. Sixty dollars a fortnight! They will not have access to a pensioner concession card to reduce the costs of public transport, car registration, rates and utilities. Also, they will not automatically receive the pharmaceutical allowance, which will see them pay more out of their pocket for medicines that could help control their illness or disability. These differences are real and they are painful. It is in deep contrast to the statements by the Minister for Family and Community Services in this place only yesterday about the equity of people who are in the same situation receiving the same payment.
In Centrelink offices across the country, one of the impacts of the original band of legislation was the number of people who became concerned and afraid of these changes. They attended offices and called up because they were scared. They did not understand what was going on, but they knew that they were going to be affected. They were also offended, as the Brain Injury Australia newsletter, which I quoted from previously, stated. They were offended and angered by the stigmatisation of them as perhaps receiving charity or, even worse, being malingerers and taking things to which they were not entitled. There have been instances of people wanting to get out of the system, wanting to give back their current pension, because they thought somehow they would be affected by these changes.
This is not a culture or a situation which actively allows people to feel positive and to be part of any kind of program to encourage participation. Any particular immediate change that says, `This is for your good; this will make you participate; this will make you better citizens,' can only be described as a blunt instrument. And then you find that the only bank of changes that the government has made between the last time this legislation was brought to this place and now is to say that there will be a difference: the blunt instrument will apply for anyone who will be receiving payment and eligibility after 1 July. Anyone before 1 July will not be affected. They will not be affected unless for any reason they go off the payment and wish to come back on. People who have had a lifestyle, an expectation, a valuable way of existing in our society, receiving a certain payment, identifying with a certain payment and being part of society will find that if for any reason they go off the payment—one of the reasons could be trying to see whether they could be effectively employed, indeed participate—and then go back, they will be under different circumstances. This cannot be seen to be fair.
We in the Labor Party continue our position that we do not see this as a fair and equitable change. As we have said consistently, the way to encourage people to participate and the way to engage people effectively in any program which has the title Australians Working Together is to encourage and support people and to acknowledge that people identify as citizens of this country and expect that their government will provide them with appropriate support. This is not a handout, it is not charity and it is certainly not malingering. It is an effective methodology to engage and participate, and for that reason we continue to reject this very unequal process of changing the disability support payments.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-06-24,"—It is somewhat disappointing that the government should waste valuable time in the parliament stockpiling yet another rejected bill, particularly one aimed at saving the government money by cutting the incomes of some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. The reasons we Democrats continue to reject the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2] have not changed. The Democrats believe that the government is putting ideology before compassion, putting theory before evidence is gathered and exposing a large population of people on low incomes to a harsh regime for very little benefit. The bill still proposes to restrict access to the disability support pension by tightening eligibility requirements. It proposes to do this, firstly and most significantly, by restricting eligibility to those people with disabilities who are capable of working 15 hours a week at award wages—currently that is 30 hours—secondly, by removing the discretion for Centrelink to take account of the labour market circumstances of applicants over 55 years of age; and, finally, by making it even tougher for those on newstart allowance to gain an exemption from the activity test because of temporary disability by nebulously extending the definitions of on-the job training and work activity.
The clear and stated intention of the government is to substantially reduce the number of people on the pension over time. Most of those no longer eligible would instead receive the lower newstart allowance. The government has recognised the significant impact this shift is likely to have for people with disabilities. As a result, they have proposed to `save' those currently on the disability support pension and to only apply the new rules to new applicants. Eventually, even those saved will have the new rules applied to them as their eligibility is reassessed over time. The immediate impact, however, will be to create two classes of people on the disability support pension— two different sorts of recipients.
New applicants who under the new rules would no longer qualify for the pension will receive $60 per fortnight less than their counterparts on the disability support pension. Because earning thresholds are lower for newstart allowance, they will be able to earn less per fortnight than those on the pension, and many with part-time earnings will be hundreds of dollars worse off each fortnight. Additionally, those ineligible to receive the disability support pension will miss out on the other support benefits—including pharmaceutical and other concessions such as transport and communications—which are attached to the disability support pension, and they will be expected to compete with non-disabled job seekers in a very competitive job market.
It is clear that the proposed changes will place significant pressure on people with disabilities and will force many into greater poverty and isolation. The government clearly has very little understanding of the additional costs that many people with disabilities are required to pay—medical, transport, recreation, aides, equipment and so on—when at the same time it is expecting people with disabilities to survive on $27 a day. What is the context for this? The 2001-02 Department of Family and Community Services annual report states that in 2001-02 around 60,000 people with a disability were helped to gain, seek or maintain employment. Of these, only 40,000 had a job for some of the time in that year.
Let us put that in perspective. There were 658,900 people on a disability support pension as of June 2002; 40,965 of those people in some employment represents about six per cent of the disability support population, so it is likely that even fewer of those were working more than 15 hours a week for a sustained period. The government is now wanting to impose a stringent work testing regime on a population of over 650,000 people so as to get the savings from moving, say, one in 30 people off to newstart allowance. Of course, the sheer madness of Centrelink administration in this area means that, despite any good policy intent, the reality is that people on newstart allowance are subject to petty and harsh bureaucratic requirements that are so complex the administering staff have as little idea as the allowee as to the rationale for the rules.
The reality is still that people do not want to experience the terms and conditions of newstart if there are alternative options. Despite government rhetoric about the benefits of assistance into jobs, the harshness and complexity of the administration militate against any preference for this program when people are validly entitled to other income support programs. Many have argued that the creation of two classes of disability will act as a major disincentive for existing DSP recipients to attempt to secure work. Existing pensioners fear that to do so will force them even more quickly off the pension and onto newstart, with all of the additional financial hardships that will bring. In the most recent budget, announced just a few weeks ago, the government has pre-empted this fear by proposing to dramatically increase the number of DSP recipients subject to review. It would appear that, for a range of reasons, the government is intent on fast-tracking reform by whatever means to ensure fewer and fewer people with disabilities are entitled to their pension.
There is little doubt that the number of pension recipients has skyrocketed over the last couple of decades. There is, however, some contention about how this has occurred. The government has sought to infer with some regularity that the increase is a result of the pension being easier to obtain or the system being easier to rort. In fact, according to a report released last year by ACOSS which examined the causes of this increase, eligibility for the pension has actually become more and more difficult to establish. Indeed, there are several reasons for the increase in disability support pensions, some of which are locally driven, with others that are mirrored in comparable OECD countries. The ACOSS report found that an ageing population, changes to government policy and the labour market were the primary causes. ACOSS argued that any rationalisation of programs and their entitlements will invariably lead to a transfer from one payment to others. Thus, we could expect to see an increase in disability pensioners from the abolition of the mature-age and partner allowances.
As new entrants are reassessed for unemployment benefits, there is greater incentive for them to pursue the disability pension route as an alternative. It is also likely that, despite policy directions, medical practitioners who make decisions about levels of incapacity for work will be affected by judgments about the sort of work available and the scarcity of appropriate work. This has been observed in many countries where there is a relationship between levels of unemployment and disability pensioner levels. I have some sympathy with the government's position in such an environment given that, to a large degree, once on the disability pension people do tend to remain there. This bill seeks to remedy this by recognising that people who can work 15 hours a week in a fairly robust economy, as we now have, may be in a similar situation to many job seekers receiving unemployment allowance. However, there are compelling reasons why this approach from the government should not be supported.
First, the regime is punitive rather than supportive. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's report on breaching was scathing in its assessment of the quality of the administration of penalties. While the Australian Democrats have accomplished real gains in reducing the harshness of penalties for unemployment payments through the recent agreement on the Australians Working Together legislation, there is still a long way to go. The government's commitment to the reduction in harshness has yet to be tested. That is why we Democrats obtained government agreement for an independent review of the modified breaching regime. In any event, the existing penalties are still unanimously considered as too harsh by the Democrats and the welfare sector.
Second, the one size fits all mentality that is adopted in many Centrelink offices is likely to add further stress to those pensioners whose disabilities mean that they have a tenuous link to employment. We know that there are many different types of disability. Disabilities may be physical, affecting the body; psychiatric, affecting the mind; sensory, affecting seeing or hearing; or cognitive, affecting learning and understanding. People also experience different degrees of disability within that—they can range from very mild to very severe. Many people have more than one type of disability, yet the government's resourcing for programs is extremely unlikely to accommodate the range of impairments. Additionally, the 15 hours per week work test does not adequately accommodate those people with a mental health issue, HIV or other disabling illnesses and conditions whose work capacity may vary widely from one week to the next.
Third, while the labour market has certainly increased the supply of casual, temporary and uncertain jobs, it is not clear that the people who are least competitive are able to secure this work for very long. Despite a decline overall in the proportion of unemployed who are unemployed for a year or more, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that in May 2003 the proportion is still over 20 per cent. That is, one in five people who are unemployed are still unemployed—meaning having no hours of work at all, despite job seeking—after one year.
Finally, these measures add to the very significant barriers people with disabilities face in obtaining employment in the open market. The disability sector continues to call upon the government to address issues of systemic discrimination in employment experienced by people with disabilities. I commend the government for increasing resources to improve the quality of the support to people with disabilities. However, this is only part of the picture. The Democrats' view is that the government must not act to impose compulsion, lower income support and a harsher administrative regime while at the same time trying to improve the workings of its support system. By all means, continue to offer people with disabilities incentives and support structures to enable them to work, but this approach must be compassionate, equitable and positive for the people who experience it.
Ongoing evaluation of the government's reforms in the welfare area has become all the more difficult with the government's decision to remove from the public arena regular statistics about the performance of its income support programs. Where quarterly statistics used to be readily available for assessment by researchers and welfare advocates, this scrutiny is no longer possible. It appears that the government is content to conduct its engineering of the poorest in our community behind the cloak of secrecy. I find this very disturbing. Why is it that public scrutiny is enhanced in areas of financial regulation but in areas of very big government spending, such as income support, this scrutiny is diminished?
This lack of transparency inevitably leads to a sense of suspicion and it means that we in the crossbench and opposition parties are less likely to go along with experiments that supposedly enhance the lives of the poor when the government's performance to date is not obvious. Evidence is mounting that Australians are questioning the government's underlying philosophy that economic wealth is the endgame. Increasingly, the effects of this philosophy are being experienced as insecurity, lower expectations and greater anxiety. Professor Michael Pusey in his new book The Experience of Middle Australia: The Dark Side of Economic Reform eloquently describes how middle Australians are more unsettled and less convinced that economic reform has been to their advantage.
One of the most pernicious results from the `relaxed and comfortable' Prime Minister's policies is the greater insecurity that most ordinary people face. A recent report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has found that people are putting off having families and are not buying homes because of the casualisation of labour. Job security is more important than income levels in determining their decisions. We have parents worrying about the impact of user-pays in education, and now there is the prospect of uncertainty and user-pays in the area of health.
While user-pays is a fine philosophy for the discretionary things in life, governments do have a responsibility to ensure that all their citizens have the basics. In our wealthy country, I would argue that the so-called basics are being eroded and that the government is failing by kowtowing to the market in such an unfettered way. This government will need to demonstrate that this bill is in the best interests of those people with disabilities who are reliant on income support to persuade us to support it. The government has not demonstrated a holistic and workable approach to date, as is evidenced by the many income support recipients who have chosen to be supported by other payments rather than newstart. For that reason, the position of the Australian Democrats on this legislation has not changed since the first occasion when we opposed the bill.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-06-24,"—The Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2] is designed to reduce the current 30-hour a week inability to work test to a 15-hour a week inability to work test. This means that a person with a disability who works, or who is judged to be able to work, more than 15 hours per week will be unable to access the disability support pension and, more importantly to many, the benefits which go with that pension.
The purpose of the bill clearly is to reduce the significant number of recipients of the disability support pension which began to increase during the nineties. In 1990 there were around 312,000 disability support pension recipients; today we have around 650,000. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that the majority of these people—that is, 54 per cent—are aged 50 years and over. The government blames this increase on the assertion that it is too easy to get the pension, but there are many other more cogent reasons. Late last year, the Australian Council of Social Service released a report on the key causes of the rise in disability pensions. Their analysis found that 20 per cent of the rise was due to government policy changes, which cut off access to other social security benefits. This theory is backed up by statistics which show that the most dramatic growth was amongst mature aged women, 50 years and over, who presumably were able to access the disability support pension as the age limit for receipt of the age pension increased from 60 to 65.
The tightening of reporting requirements has pushed more people onto the DSP rather than unemployment benefits. This has provided the government with a short-term political benefit: it allows it to boast about reductions in the rate of unemployment. The single greatest disability experienced by recipients of the DSP is musculoskeletal and connective tissue conditions, such as arthritis. As people unable to satisfy stringent work search tests go onto the DSP, we are left with government employment statistics which look very rosy—masking the real hidden level of unemployment in Australia. Forty per cent of the increase has been attributed to an overall growth in the number of people with disabilities. Possible reasons for this include a generally ageing population, better medical diagnosis of health conditions, particularly mental illness, and better medical treatment resulting in lower mortality rates amongst people with severe disabilities.
The remaining 40 per cent of growth in DSP recipients is thought to be attributable to a number of different factors, including minimal employment growth during the early 1990s and the subsequent difficulties in finding suitable work faced by unemployed people with disabilities. The rate of employment amongst people with disabilities is only half that of the broader community, and long periods of unemployment detract further from the ability of an individual to re-enter the work force. On top of that, there are the significant costs associated with a person with disabilities actually entering the work force, such things as electric wheelchairs, continence aids and other accessibility requirements.
The government now wants to address the problem by implementing tighter restrictions on just who can get the DSP. The government ignores the reality that, for many people, this is the only option left. Every other door has been firmly closed. If the government closes this door, then clearly many will go back onto newstart and it is highly probable that we will be back here in the chamber in three years time debating some other bills designed to curb the dramatic increase in the number of newstart recipients.
For those potential DSP recipients who will be able to get the newstart allowance, there will be an increased financial hardship and erroneous reporting requirement, which many, due to their intellectual or psychological disability, will be unable to comply with. For example, it is simply not practical or just to expect a person with chronic mental illness to comply completely with the current work test. The very nature of a psychiatric illness is cyclic. During periods of wellness and compliance with medication regimes, a person in fact may be able to hold down a job. However, in reality, too often the support mechanisms, including specialised employment programs, break down and the person experiences a relapse in the illness, resulting in hospitalisation. Under the proposed changes, this would probably entitle them to receive the DSP. As they become well again, they would be put back onto newstart, and so the job cycle begins again. In the meantime, the person is so traumatised that they are unable to face the fact or the prospect of employment. So the cost to the health system balloons out of control. The pressures on the person's natural support—that is, their family and friends—becomes unbearable and the person becomes even further marginalised and stigmatised.
It is similar with physical disability. Let us take an example of a young man who experiences a spinal injury in circumstances where there is no compensation payment. That could possibly be diving into a creek. He spends nine months in a spinal unit and is then returned to his family with little or no support. His wife is his primary carer and receives a minimal carers pension for the 20-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job that she does. That is on top of caring for their young children. His employer offers him his old job back part time, for 25 hours per week. Around the demands of his physical care, the carer and the employer make the appropriate workplace adjustments. This person is a hard worker. He is intelligent, dedicated and reliable. He has to pay a support person to assist him. He can travel to work only by wheelchair-accessible taxi because, as he lives in a rural Australian area, there are no wheelchair-accessible buses. So he spends the majority of his income on the direct costs of his disability—that is, on transport, medication, mobility aids and equipment, therapy and personal care. He is on the waiting list for recurrent lifestyle support funding, but he is told that it will probably take about four years for that to eventuate. But he loves the job that he has. It makes him genuinely feel a part of society and the community benefits enormously from his skills and experience. He can have this life only if the disability support pension and its associated benefits enable him to support his family. Without it, he simply cannot afford to be employed. He could decide to work only 15 hours a week, but that would not cover his costs and he risks being deemed capable of working more and losing the pension anyway. Unemployment leads to depression, family breakdown and a huge increase in costs to the taxpayer in the form of the health and community services necessary to ensure his basic survival.
The community sector is in crisis. Demand for services outstrips the supply and the ability to provide those services. The latest Australians Living on the Edgesurvey confirms that, in the last 12 months, community welfare agencies have reported an increase of 12 per cent in the number of people receiving a service and an even greater percentage of people seeking but not receiving a service. Also, 42 per cent of community organisations report that they are expecting to be unable to meet the expected costs and the demand for services in the next 12 months. Although we have around 650,000 current DSP recipients, less than 64,000—or about 10 per cent—currently receive a Commonwealth-state disability agreement funded service. The potential for the demand to blow out if these changes to the DSP are passed is obviously enormous.
The government proceeds with the bill on the assumption that too many people are rorting the system. There is no doubt that broader welfare reform is necessary for sustaining economic growth and budgetary stability. But this bill will not address that issue. We are at risk of actually throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It is simply not good enough to say, `Go and get a job.' The government proposes to put savings from these amendments into increased employment services and disability support services. What it will actually do is force people out of jobs that they already have. It will take away their independence, it is diametrically opposed to our principles of human rights and full inclusion, and it is a travesty of justice.
On behalf of the disabled community, I urge the Senate to reject this bill until the real cause of the growth in number of disability reform pension recipients can be analysed and addressed. There must be a realistic assessment mechanism put in place which factors in the huge cost of disability to an individual, while recognising and genuinely valuing the contribution of people with disabilities in the workplace. I place very clearly on the record that One Nation will not support this bill.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-06-24,"—The Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2] demonstrates the government's real welfare priorities. The government is not interested in getting people into work; it simply seeks to punish some of the most disadvantaged members of our community. Instead of helping people get back into work, the government is attempting to create a two-tiered system of benefits for the disabled where claimants who lodge their applications before 1 July 2003 will be paid more than those who lodge their applications on or after 1 July 2003. Instead of increasing access to meaningful work, the government is punishing the victims of a welfare system which does not achieve its objectives. Instead of allowing disability support pension recipients to take part in the community, the government is cutting the benefits of some 100,000 Australians by $60 a fortnight.
There can be only one motivation for this bill: the continuation of the blame game that the government plays so well. The government will blame anybody but itself for its own failings. This bill is part of the government's concerted campaign against welfare recipients and part of the government's campaign to blame welfare recipients for the government's lack of action. Families, parents and children have suffered the consequences of this blame game that this government continues to play. One in three Australian families have been hit with a family tax benefit debt even though they have acted properly. Welfare recipients were inadequately compensated when the GST was introduced, and we all know that. The much vaunted tax cuts proposed in the recent budget are, by the admission of Senator Vanstone, a very small contribution to family budgets in light of their losses in other areas.
This bill is simply another step in the wrong direction. It proves that the government does not want to help welfare recipients find work; the government wants to cut benefits to suit its budgetary whims. The government has its priorities wrong. Let me give a couple of examples. It spent $140,000 of taxpayer money on public relations advice for cuts to Medicare. It spent over $360 million on its campaign to advertise tax increases that have made life tougher for millions of Australians. Now it proposes to cut $60.20 a fortnight from the benefits paid to disabled Australians. The bill will change the definition of `work capacity' so that people who are capable of working 15 hours a week at award wages will be placed on newstart rather than on the DSP. The current definition is 30 hours per week within two years and follows a medical decision that the individual has a disability. The new definition takes power away from doctors who have many years of training and knowledge and puts it into the hands of bureaucrats in the Department of Family and Community Services. 
Senate estimates hearings have confirmed that over 100,000 DSP claimants will be moved onto newstart in 2005-06 if this bill is passed and they will receive $60.20 less a fortnight as a result. Sixty dollars is a lot of money when you have serious medical problems. It is 12 per cent of the current rate of the DSP. But, when the effect of losing a pension card, discounted public transport and discounts on rates and utilities is taken into account, it is an even more considerable charge. Even worse, newstart recipients do not automatically qualify for the pharmaceutical allowance. This means that people who would have formerly qualified for the disability support pension will be out of pocket for medicines that help them control their illnesses and their disabilities. The bill not just will affect people with bad backs, the subject of Senator Vanstone's comments about malingerers, but will inevitably affect Australians with disabilities as diverse as psychiatric disabilities and severe physical disabilities. These are people who need special assistance to take part in the labour market, something newstart does not do.
As Chair of the Senate's Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, I have heard first-hand the problems that many Australians are facing. I have heard about the financial troubles they encounter every day. Witnesses have been reduced to tears in describing the difficulty they have had in making ends meet from payday to payday. There is an increasing division between rich and poor in our society. Nearly 2.5 million Australians live below the Henderson poverty line, which is $415 per week for a family of four. That is one in eight Australians who do it tough every day. As the member for Lilley said in the House of Representatives, the five years up to the year 2000 saw the real earnings of the bottom 25 per cent of taxpayers go backwards while the top five per cent of taxpayers' real earnings increased by nearly 30 per cent—five years, Mr Acting Deputy President, while your party has been in power.
The government's response to the issue of poverty has been to ignore the problems faced by Australian families every day. It has continued its attacks on workers, which is strange considering that almost every submission to the inquiry into poverty and financial hardship has emphasised the fact that reliable full-time work is the key to preventing poverty. Even conservative think-tank organisations agree that full-time work is the key to alleviating poverty. Throughout the inquiry we have heard from individuals and community organisations which are deeply concerned about the financial problems facing millions of Australians. Many of the organisations which have provided evidence to the committee deal with families who find it hard to make ends meet on a daily basis. These are families who have to make decisions about whether they buy food or they pay their bills. But this bill does not get more people into work; it simply makes over 100,000 Australians 60 bucks a fortnight worse off. There is no logical link between cutting welfare benefits and increasing participation in the work force. It simply makes recipients more reliant on the benefits they receive. If the government were serious about getting DSP recipients into work, it would not have slashed $90 million per year in financial incentives for people to find work through the earnings credit scheme and it would not be preventing DSP recipients from accessing services which make them more employable. This bill is motivated by the government's ideological opposition to welfare and its more general opposition to the involvement of government in the community.
We are now considering this bill for a second time. This time around, 100,000 people will be affected instead of 200,000. The amendments mean that fewer people will suffer the consequences of the government's ignorance of the issues at hand. But 100,000 is a still a large number. If this bill is passed, each and every one of them will do it much tougher because of the government's meanness.
The government's justification for its version of welfare reform has been diverse and complex. Senator Vanstone has used the `malingerer' argument, while the explanatory memorandum for the bill points to increases of four per cent in the number of disability support pension recipients over the last four years. But the primary justification, as with all the government's welfare reform, has been the recommendations contained within the McClure report on welfare reform.
The government was offered some sensible, considered advice on welfare reform, but its implementation of the McClure report has been selective at best. The government uses as its primary justification for this bill the report's recommendation that the work capacity criterion for people with disabilities should be reviewed. That recommendation was made, but only in the context of the rest of the reform that would reach across the entire welfare system. The government has selectively applied recommendations contained within the McClure report, and in doing so it has failed to implement what would appear to be some of its most important elements. The McClure report is peppered with the word `community'. Building social partnerships and increasing community capacity make up one of the main themes of the report.
If the recommendations relating to community capacity building were implemented, we would see businesses, community groups and government coming together to solve welfare related problems. The government has attempted to implement elements of the report which punish welfare recipients but none of the recommendations which bring them closer to the community.
The recommendations made by the reference group were a broad approach to the reform of the welfare system. But this government has consistently taken elements of the report out of context. It has simply used the reference group's report as a means of justifying its ideological attacks on the welfare system and denying people a fair go.
If the government were serious about welfare reform it would take the advice given to it by the reference group. It would develop a whole-of-government approach to welfare. The community would play a role in helping those who have been unfortunate enough to lose their job or become ill. This government has chosen not to take that route. It has chosen to attack some of the most disadvantaged members of our community and place unreasonable demands on them. This bill is another example of a mean and heartless government which seeks to impose its bizarre and apathetic ideology on the community.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-06-24,"—The Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2] is the third attempt by the government to secure parliament's support for significant changes to the disability support pension. The government modified its original proposal in the wake of overwhelming political and community opposition to the measures, but the changes do not go far enough. Consequently, the Senate rejected the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 in November of last year. Now the government has brought back the bill as a potential trigger for a double dissolution election. The Australian Greens will continue to oppose this bill and we trust that other crossbench senators and the Australian Labor Party will do likewise, because these measures do not deserve to become law.
This bill proposes to change the work test for people who claim the disability support pension after 30 June this year and for previous claimants who, after a period of not receiving their particular pension, then reclaim payment. Anyone deemed capable of working at least 15 hours a week will be ineligible for the disability support pension and will be required to rely on the Newstart allowance, the income support payment for unemployed people.
The effect of this change is to reduce the amount of income support by $26 a week, deny access to other financial concessions available to people receiving disability support pension and impose stricter income and assets testing. In addition, the harsh work test requirements and punitive breaching or fining regime that applies to people who are unemployed will apply to people with a disability who are no longer eligible for the disability support pension. Under the breaching regime, the government has stolen $1 billion from some of the poorest people in our community since 1996, according to figures compiled by the National Welfare Rights Network a few months ago.
The idea of assisting people with a disability to earn income clearly is reasonable, and measures to facilitate this would be supportable, but we know that this is not the motive for this bill. This bill is about cost-cutting by moving people from one form of income payment to another that provides less money. We know this because the government has not addressed the reasons for the increase in the number of disability support pension recipients. The number of people receiving disability support pension rose from 334,234 in 1991 to 652,170 in March last year. This payment cost the Commonwealth $2.8 billion in 1991-92, and the estimated cost for the current financial year is $6.9 billion.
Research by the Parliamentary Library shows several factors driving the increase in the number of recipients. Most of them are related to structural labour market issues, such as marginalisation of unskilled, semiskilled and older workers, increased incidence of early retirement, reduction in access to alternative income support payments, ageing of the population and work force and increased incidence of some acquired disabilities like spina bifida and head or spinal injuries.
So the disability support pension provides income support for people with acquired disabilities and work related injuries and for people who are unable to work or to find work who are ineligible for other payments. All these groups stand to lose under this bill. Rather than address these sorts of factors, the government prefers to blame individuals and impose mandatory work tests—in short, to make life harder for vulnerable and disadvantaged people. This is easier than engaging in the much more challenging task of investing in measures that address the obstacles to more people with disabilities participating in paid and unpaid work, addressing structural impediments to earning income or admitting to the Australian people that there is not enough paid work for everyone who wants it and then getting on with the task of working out a way to redistribute work and wealth.
The government needs to explain to the public that other ways of contributing to society are acceptable and that this society has an obligation to support those who cannot earn an income. The extra employment assistance that the government has promised does not contribute to creating additional jobs for people with disabilities or provide the practical support required for people with disabilities to engage in paid work. This additional employment assistance should not be tied to regressive measures or cuts to income support in the absence of earned income.
Peak disability and community groups have told the government that it can assist people with disabilities to participate in paid work without forcing them onto a payment with less support. Demand for employment assistance far exceeds available services, and the government's efforts would be better directed towards reversing this situation. The Commonwealth should be addressing employer discrimination, accessible transport, personal care and accommodation, and funding through the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, which to the government's shame expired last year and which it has taken almost 12 months to finalise, although agreements with some states remain outstanding.
This bill is further evidence of just what this government stands for: stealing from the poor, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable while it stokes the flames of a perverse envy—envy of the disadvantaged. We are talking about people who are among the poorest in our community and who face all sorts of physical and social barriers to caring for themselves and being involved in society. Australian studies have shown that people with disabilities and their carers have a higher risk of financial hardship compared with other recipients of social security payments.
The latest survey of disability, ageing and carers, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, found that about 3.6 million Australians have some form of disability and that most of these people experienced some kind of restriction with respect to daily activities, employment and schooling. It seems incomprehensible that anyone could resent the meagre assistance that we provide to people who find themselves in such circumstances, circumstances in which any one of us might find ourselves through chance.
We certainly do not provide enough funding. The ABS survey found that about 24,000 people with a profound or severe disability received no assistance at all and that a further 41,000 primary carers were receiving no support or assistance. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare unmet needs for disability services study last year concluded that, even with the additional funding that the Commonwealth and states injected between 2000 and 2002 for unmet need, there were more than 12,000 people still needing accommodation and respite services and more than 5,000 people needing employment support.
The government should be addressing these needs, rather than promoting `job readiness' for work that does not exist. The latest figures show almost eight people seeking work for every vacancy. Yet this government for seven years has fomented resentment for disadvantaged people among other Australians who find it difficult to make ends meet. In doing so, the government has laid the groundwork for its absence of commitment to social justice and its retreat from international human rights commitments. We have seen this wreaked upon refugees, asylum seekers, Indigenous Australians, unemployed people and, now, people with disabilities.
The Prime Minister has publicly acknowledged significant unmet need for people with disabilities, which means more funds are required. Yet the Commonwealth, under the direction of Minister Vanstone, has been prepared to make the disability agreement hostage to the passage of this bill. This is a reprehensible tactic that is unprecedented with this funding agreement. The Commonwealth might have thought it was punishing the state and territory governments, but it is really hurting people with disabilities, their carers and service providers. Nothing can justify punishing people in need in such a way.
The government's commitment to supporting people with disabilities is further brought into question by its proposal to abolish the positions of specialist commissioners, including the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, under a separate bill now before the parliament. In fact, the commission told the Senate's inquiry into that bill that it had decided not to fill the Disability Discrimination Commissioner and Race Discrimination Commissioner positions when they became vacant as part of measures to cover the $7.3 million cut in real terms in its budget under this government.
We have seen the scandalous situation of the position of Disability Discrimination Commissioner being filled on an acting basis since 1998. The last permanent appointment was Elizabeth Hastings. I know that the people who have been acting in this role have done a professional job, but that is not the point. They have also been responsible for other matters at the same time as acting in the role.
This situation reflects poorly on the government, because it is the government that has cut HREOC's budget and refused to appoint a permanent commissioner responsible for disability discrimination. Just last April, the Attorney-General extended for a further 12 months the current acting commissioner's appointment, but he is also the Human Rights Commissioner. The government's behaviour speaks volumes about its commitment—or lack thereof—to redressing disadvantage and improving the circumstances of people with disabilities.
This is the context in which we need to consider the bill before us, and it alarms us because of the implications for the future of income payments. The government's own discussion paper on simplifying income payments for people of work force age, released last December, acknowledges that anomalies exist in the current payments system. People in similar circumstances are treated differently, with different levels of benefits and associated assistance, for no good reason. Yet here we have the government perpetuating unwarranted discrimination at the very time that it has suggested to the Australian people that such discrimination should be removed. The move to reduce people's payments by shifting them from the disability support pension to newstartallowance is also contrary to the commitment that Minister Abbott gave, when he released the government's discussion paper, that simplification would not leave people worse off. Of course, we were told that about the government's industrial relations agenda too.
A speech the minister gave to the Young Liberals in South Australia in January this year provides insight into the government's intent. Minister Abbott said:
Work for the Dole is starting to change the culture of welfare and work ... If the alternative to working for a wage is working for the dole, even part-time work at modest rates of pay becomes considerably more attractive ... The Government is committed to a simpler, fairer welfare system with more built-in incentives for people to find work.
So instead of concentrating on structural impediments to work or the problem of increasingly insecure, low-paid work, the government would prefer to push people into taking any work. There are several problems with this policy approach. The first I have canvassed already—that is, the scarcity of paid work. The second is of a more philosophical nature. Once we accept that there is not enough paid work for all those who want it, on what moral grounds do we impose obligations on people in return for income support? We often hear the argument from the conservative side of politics that people should be better off with earned income than if they are not earning income—the rationale being that this provides the incentive for people to `get off welfare', to use the vernacular, with its overtones of unworthiness.
Paid work provides many benefits—social contact, meaningful activity and money for necessities and some comforts. But if paid work is simply not available or, in the case of people with disabilities, if engaging in paid work is not possible, what moral right does this government or this parliament have to make life harder for people? That is what this bill would do: make life harder for many people without just cause, reducing their income support and other financial assistance to force them to find some earned income, no matter how inappropriate or how difficult.
Last month the government delivered another large budget surplus and $2.4 billion worth of personal income tax cuts, hailed as a remarkable achievement in the face of drought, slowing world growth and an unjust war. In all this wash of money it could find only $160 million over four years for disability employment services, and $26 million of that is to come from projected savings from reducing income support payments. The government forecast no change to a six per cent unemployment rate, even with anticipated economic growth of 3.25 per cent. Yet somehow it expects thousands of people receiving the disability support pension to miraculously find paid jobs.
What is the value of a budget surplus secured through the running down of public services like health and education spending to support those in need? The point of government is not to direct ever more wealth, advantage and power to those who already have these in abundance; it is to improve the circumstances of the poor, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable members of our community and, by doing so, make ours a more just and compassionate society. This bill does not bring us a single step closer to that goal. The implicit threat to send this country to an early election, should the Senate reject this proposal again, cannot shake us from our view that this bill fails the Australian Greens' test of good government. Accordingly we oppose it and urge the Senate to reject it.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-06-24,"—The purpose of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2] is to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 by changing the qualification criteria for disability support pension in relation to work capacity and to limit exemptions from the activity test requirements for newstart allowance and youth allowance.
The bill ensues from two previous amending bills for the disability support pension. The Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill 2002 was the original bill introduced in the Senate. The second bill, tagged the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002, was rejected in the Senate on 19 November last year. The only differentiation between the first and the second bill is that the second bill outlines that the DSP recipients granted payments on or before 30 June 2003 would remain under the existing 30 hour a week inability to work test. Subsequently, it would only be those granted DSP from 1 July 2003 onward that would be exposed to the 15 hour a week inability test. The current bill duplicates, in content and in spirit, the second 2002 bill.
This legislation proposes that the new rules apply only to people seeking the disability support pension who apply on or after 1 July 2003. Like its predecessor, this bill seeks to alter the rules relating to access to training and rehabilitation for those receiving newstart incapacitated and youth allowance incapacitated payments. Essentially the bill is just another of the Howard government's double dissolution triggers. There is no real intention to assist Australians in need; there is only an illusion of assisting those in need to provide the government with a degree of electoral comfort.
From the inception of the very first bill of this nature, the ALP have been steadfast in our position of opposing it, and we remain so. The ALP's rationale for this is both logical and moral. The Howard government's position—that you need to cut a person's entitlement in order to help them get work— is not only a load of nonsense but also a mean and cruel measure that will damage many decent people in great need. How so? This bill will give effect to the government's budget decision to cut the payments to approximately 100,000 people with disabilities by at least $60 a fortnight—a 13 to 14 per cent drop in their income. This will not be their only loss. They stand to lose access to their pensioner concession cards, their pharmaceutical allowance, their telephone allowance and their education supplement. They will also not be guaranteed a place in a service or rehabilitation program. In other words, those removed from DSP benefits will not get the support they need.
In the Howard government's attempt to have this bill passed they have used various gimmicks to promote their quandary, both past and present. They have referred to it as `the next stage of welfare reform' and `a crackdown on rorters with bad backs'. Into this scenario came the Centrelink footage of people on pensions laying bricks or riding horses. I say to the government: if there are people out there who are doing those things, deal with them, but do not penalise every decent Australian who is reliant on this support because you are too lazy to deal with the issue in a proper way. What we are relentlessly seeing is a manipulative government that use generalisations and stereotypes and subsequently play upon the bigotries within the community to promote the passage of bills such as this.
The facts of the matter are, firstly, that 32 per cent of DSP recipients have a musculoskeletal condition. This is the category of the so-called bad backs. The definition is broad because a person with a nervous system disorder may also have a musculoskeletal disability and vice versa. Secondly, 71.1 per cent of pensioners with a musculoskeletal disability are aged over 50. It is pretty hard to get a job out there when you are over 50. Thirdly, of the more than 660,000 people receiving the disability support pension, one in nine are in the 55 to 64 age group. In most cases these recipients are older blue-collar workers who have paid their taxes and worked long and hard all of their adult lives. They now endure chronic physical pain and have redundant sets of skills that make them unavailable to the modern work force. The truth is that these people may never work again unless the government makes a special investment for them. This is highly unlikely under the present government. The Howard government is unwilling to recognise the importance of investing in assistance, training, rehabilitation and support. These are the things we need to invest in if we are to increase people's access to work; these are the things we need to invest in if we are serious about assisting these Australians in need. 
The reality is that, once your remove the fluff of the gimmicks, what you have is an unparalleled assault on 3.1 million Australians with disabilities. Our consciences tell us that this is not the right way to force people with disabilities off the pension and onto the dole. What this bill so blatantly does is show us how ruthless, callous and cruel this government is. At least this bill has brought to our further attention the unmet need for disability services in our community and the fact that this country strongly needs and definitely deserves genuine welfare reforms—reforms this government will not address. In other words, we need a fair go, and nothing could be further from a fair go than what the government has given us. It is on that basis that I continue to support my colleagues on the Labor benches in opposing this bill.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—I rise today to speak on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2], a bill that has changed from the first one we originally saw in this place. Basically the legislation will now only affect those who apply for and are granted the DSP as of 1 July 2003. As we look at this piece of legislation, we must look at the bigger picture and the context. We have to take into account the current labour market and the social security system in its entirety as well as other specific issues that impact on people with disabilities. The conclusion one reaches is that this legislation, if passed, is not going to enhance the wellbeing of people with disabilities.
Restricting access to the DSP will contribute little, if anything, to the opportunities people have of reaching their full potential. It does absolutely nothing to improve income security or indeed anything that may directly assist people to increase their actual level of income. What it does do is put them at risk of not qualifying for a stable income and full health care concessions. It will probably in many instances, if passed, put people with chronic illness at risk of being breached for not fulfilling job activity requirements and therefore of losing their incomes altogether. Yes, they can get some concessions when on newstart if they have a medical certificate. But while they can ask for an exemption from the work test, due to the government's expansion of the definition of training in this bill, such an exemption could be very difficult to obtain. And this expansion of training will make obtaining the DSP more difficult.
The government has made the change to this legislation following the community's reaction to the original bill. The original version of this bill would have placed an enormous burden on chronically ill people currently receiving DSP by forcing those deemed capable of working 15 hours a week off DSP and onto newstart and all the requirements and risks associated with that. The assertion that what was really intended by the government was to remove all those suspected bad backs does not wash when we look at the details. The government also says, in its briefing paper on proposed changes to the DSP:
The government wants to support the aspirations of people with disabilities through providing them with the support they need to participate to the extent of their abilities.
How is lowering income or removing access to income support? How is removing access to a pensioner health care card support? How is pushing people out into the open work force—where already, on average, there are some six people after every job that is advertised—support? Support could, if the government were serious, include incentives for employers to employ people with a disability. It could also include direct assistance, such as an adequate transport allowance, a mobility allowance or quality supported accommodation. It could include a more relaxed income test under the DSP and Newstart. It could also include removing the hurdles in Newstart that result in such high rates of breaching. Those extra spending measures the government has flagged are welcome. These include extra rehabilitation places and personal support programs, and vocational education and training. But people on DSP can now attend TAFE or university part time according to their abilities, and this is not possible on Newstart. People on DSP can access an education allowance; people on Newstart cannot.
Those most at risk under the new rules would firstly be those with a mental illness. About 25 per cent of DSP recipients have an enduring and debilitating mental illness. This is partly because their illness is generally hidden. In some instances people may present well but the next week or the next day they may not. So a Commonwealth medical officer may indeed assess, if a person is feeling well on that particular day, that they are capable of working over 15 hours, and their livelihoods would be permanently affected. It is also because of the stress caused by the increased uncertainty that people with a mental illness are at risk as well as having increased obligations if they fail to qualify for the DSP. To put these people under more stress will frequently only worsen their health, not increase their chances of getting a job. Their chances of becoming trapped in the breaching regime are particularly high.
Also at high risk will be those with other episodic illnesses—ones that flare up irregularly. These people will not always be able to meet the requirements under Newstart. They will not always be able to attend an interview, a training program or appear for their Work for the Dole placement. They too may have an illness that is exacerbated by stress—illnesses that one week are not causing them significant difficulties but for the next three may cause them major problems.
Another group at risk are current DSP recipients who get work for more than 30 hours per week. If they are unable to sustain this employment, they will not be able to receive the DSP and will be required to go back and claim the newstart allowance. In fact, I argue that this is quite a disincentive for those on disability support pension to risk giving it up and getting a job, because they will not be able to get back on it under the current conditions.
Let us just compare the two payments that are in question. A single person on DSP currently receives $429.40 per fortnight and qualifies for a pharmaceutical allowance, a pensioner health care card and the education allowance, as I mentioned, whereas a single person on newstart receives only $374.90 a fortnight, no pharmaceutical allowance until they are 60 and fewer concessions than those available to people with a pensioner health care card. So there are considerable savings for government over the coming years if, as their briefing paper says, over 60 per cent of people on DSP could work up to 15 hours per week.
Just as there are savings on one side, there will be considerable losses for people already living in poverty. Losing $54.50 a fortnight may not seem much to some Australians, but for people who only get about $215 a week it is a considerable amount. Also, while we are talking money, does the government really believe that $215 a week is a disincentive to work? Even with added support such as a health care card and rent allowance, this means people are barely surviving week to week—as our poverty inquiry is telling us. Add on other costs of disability and you may find that with copayments for health care, for the extra services that are needed and special needs such as diet and complementary medications as well as medications that are not on the PBS, the roughly $31 a day people are entitled to is hopelessly inadequate. Recent research shows that some pensioners spend eight to 12 per cent of their income on copayments for health care alone.
Let us look at another problem in this legislation. The newstart allowance has a provision at the moment that, if a person is unable to undertake eight or more hours of work per week, they get a temporary exemption with a doctor's certificate, and they can get exemption from the activities test for up to 13 weeks with medical justification and those certificates. Currently 84,000 newstart and youth allowance recipients on average are exempted at some stage for a period from that activity test.
This bill, if passed, takes out that exemption, which means basically that a person with a disability who was assessed as able to work over 15 hours a week has to still fulfil the work test. Also it means that people with a total but temporary impairment, such as a broken leg, could be required to keep fulfilling the work test. Apparently medical exemptions for six weeks, say, for time for recovery will no longer be acceptable. Under the new bill people will generally be judged as being capable of undertaking other activities, perhaps training. In this bill there is also a change with regard to the carers pension, and that is the insistence that the person they are actually caring for is on the disability support pension. This in itself has its own risks.
In closing I want to look specifically at three key problems. Firstly, there are many jobs waiting to be done. If you read the Saturday employment section, you will find there are jobs and more jobs. They include nursing, teaching, environment repair, IT jobs, jobs in the restaurant and catering fields and a raft of other skilled jobs. Some of these employment fields may indeed be suitable for people with a disability. The training options under Newstart are not of a sufficient calibre and quality to qualify people for these types of vacancies, whereas currently while on DSP, as I said, they may access proper TAFE courses and attain university qualifications. A teacher shortage is certainly looming. It is possible through doing a university course part time that indeed a person with a disability may be able to eventually teach part time. That would not be an option if that person were forced off DSP. 
This leads to the second problem, which is that the lower skilled jobs—by this I mean the sorts of jobs you can get with little or no training or the sort of training available under Newstart—are generally highly sought after and people with disabilities will have to compete with dozens, if not hundreds, of able-bodied workers for each vacancy. So even though many people on the DSP are actively looking for work and indeed training—they want to work—they find their disability a severe impediment to finding a job through negative stereotyping about their disability, straight discrimination, lack of accessible workplaces or lack of accessible transport.
Thirdly, people must fulfil requirements under Newstart that are daunting for many people who do not have a disability. The breaching rates are punitive and extremely high. Most Australians accept that healthy people in receipt of government benefits should be giving something in return and making a real effort in finding a job. But I do not believe that we should be enforcing the level of penalties that we as a community are forcing on people who are already on inadequate incomes. Indeed, I do not believe that most Australians would support the thrust of this bill, which is basically making people who are in many instances very sick and people with disabilities jump through significant new hoops—indeed those very stringent hoops that are now required for the newstart allowance. 
Most people on the DSP will struggle to fulfil the requirements of mutual obligation and face the very real possibility of being breached and losing their income support altogether. When you look at the detail of this bill, it just does not back up the government's stated intention of wanting to `support the aspirations of people with disabilities'.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I rise to place my name on the record against the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2]. If this bill were to successfully pass through the parliament, the much relied upon pensions of thousands of Australians with disabilities would be cut by around $60 a fortnight. Over 103,000 Australians would be affected by these changes, and those in receipt of the disability support pension, if and after such changes were to eventuate, would fall into two separate categories. There are around three million Australians who are identified as being plagued with differing disabilities. There are currently something like 650,000 Australians on the disability support pension. 
The bill before us proposes to cut the support pensions of over 100,000 Australians with disabilities by around $60 a fortnight. These figures were provided during Senate estimates hearings last year. The proposal before us, which seeks to protect those receiving the DSP as at 1 July this year, creates a separate system for those who access the DSP after 1 July this year and will result in approximately 103,700 claimants for the DSP having their applications for the payment over the forward estimates period 2005-06 rejected. Many of these people will qualify for the lesser newstart allowance—an income reduction of $60.20 per fortnight. Some will qualify for other pension payments, and a small proportion of people will not qualify for a payment at all. The only specific and defined exception will be granted to those with permanent blindness. This bill would establish a two-tiered system that will create two classes of disability support pension recipients depending on when their claim was lodged. 
The government has argued that the people who work in business services, also known as sheltered workshops, will be protected from any adverse effects of this law. However, the only protection afforded to those working in business services will be for those who were doing so before 1 July this year. All those who take up positions in business services after 1 July this year will have to do so on the newstart allowance, and with that pension comes the responsibility to seek a job. 
Enshrined in this package is a two-tiered system, and it is totally inappropriate. Most of us envisage a society where everybody is rich in wealth and opportunity, a place where there is no poverty and where everybody is equally endowed with strength and health. However, we do recognise that this society simply does not exist. In fact, it is precisely because of this that many of us, including me, are in this chamber today. 
There currently exist, and there will always be, those among us who are less fortunate than others in one way or another. Most often this is through no fault of one's own, but it is precisely these people who require and deserve the care and help of wider society to ensure them a quality and rewarding existence. An egalitarian society rests upon the notion and existence of real, tangible social justice. Social justice itself is built upon a strong economy with the state committed to making socially just laws which protect and support the more vulnerable. You do not respect or achieve an egalitarian society by delivering cuts to people's pensions. 
The government's rationale and justifications for these cuts are poor. Reasons have changed over time, but at the end of the day the government's intentions are clear: they intend to blame the victim. Originally when the government introduced the disability reform package into the parliament, they argued that their reforms were about supporting people with disabilities in finding employment—a very admirable and acceptable notion.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-06-24,"—Yesterday Senator Bartlett asked me a question, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, regarding the Burnett River Paradise dam, and I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Bartlett asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, without notice, on 23 June 2003:
(1)	(a) Can the Minister confirm that earlier this year he gave approval to the Burnett River Paradise Dam? (b) Can he confirm that the approval was conditional on management plans being prepared for listed migratory species and for endangered vegetation? (c) Given construction has started has a plan been submitted and if so can it be tabled?
(2)	(a) Can the Minister confirm that the Burnett is one of the top 10 rivers in terms of its impact on reef quality targets? (b) Why did the Minister not require Burnett to comply with terms of the agreement or implement the plan?
Senator Hill—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	(a)	The Burnett River Dam was approved on 25 January 2002.
(b)	The approval requires management plans to be submitted addressing impacts on listed migratory species and a listed threatened species, the Black-breasted Button Quail. No management plans are required for endangered vegetation, as the assessment of the proposal concluded that the proposal would not impact on Commonwealth listed threatened plants.
(c)	Whilst construction of the main access roads to the proposed dam site has commenced, the dam is currently not under construction. Dam construction is currently scheduled to commence in November 2003. As a result, no plans have been submitted nor are currently required under the conditions of approval. The plan for listed migratory species is not required until 1 year prior to operation and the plan for the Black-breasted Button Quail must be approved before operation commences. Construction of the dam will take approximately 2½ years.
(2)	(a)	Yes.
(b)	The plan for listed migratory species requires sufficient monitoring of water quality and environmental flows to determine whether the dam is impacting on the species, and measures to be taken if adverse impacts become apparent. The Minister will ensure that the approved plan has a commitment for implementation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Paradise Dam</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to communications and to family payment debts.
The element common to both of these answers is information technology. In the case of Senator Vanstone, we saw a quick pass back to the other place with respect to responsibility for IT problems in the Job Network. But I would like to focus my comments on Senator Alston's performance with regard to broadband in Australia—another critical ICT matter. It is very well established now how important broadband services are to Australia's economic and social future. We consistently see a very obvious reticence—indeed a paucity of activity—from the government to actually address these issues.
What we do have today is an article in the newspaper flagging a broadband response to the Estens inquiry. Although we are yet to see detail, it is the first time that the government, despite the Estens report and the Broadband Advisory Group report—which was provided back in January, nearly six months ago—have actually said something, or done something, about the issues. I will wait with interest to see what they will do, and I suspect that, indeed, it is only because of pressure sustained on the government from the community, from regional areas, from the opposition and from those who are complaining about the poor services they are receiving on broadband that the government have been forced to move at all. I can say this much: if Telstra had anything to do with it, the minister would continue to sit on his hands and do absolutely nothing.
More than anything else, the report released recently from the ACCC about emerging markets and competition in broadband areas shows that it suits Telstra just fine to undermaintain their copper network and to maintain interest in the two networks that have the capacity to provide broadband services to Australians—the PSTN and the cable network—in the interest of preserving their own revenues. And that has had a negative impact on competition in broadband in this country.
Also, as my question—and indeed the minister's lack of answer—highlighted in the Senate today, within those broadband services there are several themes emerging as to the types of complaints that are being expressed. In Mr Steve Mann's case, the theoretical access regime allows him to be able to get a broadband service through a Telstra competitor—through a reseller of that service—and yet his case shows that Telstra are not allowing that to happen in some circumstances and, indeed, are trying to secure those customers for themselves. The most disturbing feature of Steve Mann's case is that Telstra made a decision to sign him up after refusing to allow that service to be provided through a competitor and subsequently Telstra visited him and said that they would be disconnecting his service.
I would like to highlight the fact that, after a lot of procrastination, the minister said today in the chamber that he would look into this issue on behalf on Mr Steve Mann. I urge him to do that because, despite the minister's protestations, which indeed reflect Telstra's line—`Is there really a problem?'— and imply that this was not in fact a genuine complaint, I believe there is a real problem and it is not just a one-off case. Evidence to my office from several consumers shows that this is not the first time this has happened, and that indicates to me that this problem is systemic in Telstra's handling of the wholesale and retail aspects of their ADSL broadband service. If this is the case, Telstra have a serious problem, and the minister is the person in a position to actually do something about it.
I think it is incredibly disappointing for consumers of broadband services in this country that the minister so pedantically insists on supporting Telstra, on taking Telstra's side, on reflecting positively upon Telstra in this place and negatively upon consumers with complaints, as he did today, and in effect does absolutely nothing to solve these growing problems in the broadband market. I believe that the proposed inquiry into broadband matters will help shed some light on this. Most of all, it is a very sad and serious reflection on the government that complaints about broadband services are on the increase and the coalition has not been prepared or willing to do anything about it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-06-24,"—Senator Lundy said that she was taking note of questions that had been answered by both Senator Alston and Senator Vanstone but she did not somehow find a way to Senator Vanstone, so I will, because I think that what we have heard from the Labor Party over the last few days and what has been reported in the press is yet again so misleading and so emotive. I am of course talking about the reference to using a mercantile agent to recover Commonwealth debts. The questions that were asked yesterday and today imply—and are meant to imply—that this is a new measure brought about by this government. They were also meant to imply that people on welfare were being chased by a mercantile agent. Both are incorrect. The practice of using a mercantile agent to recover Commonwealth debts was actually introduced by none other than the Labor government.
—Fancy that!
—Fancy that, yes! Why do they come in here and talk about a mercantile agent `now' being used? The fact of the matter is that no-one who is currently receiving a Centrelink payment is being pursued by the agent. In addition, the contract with the mercantile agent includes privacy and security provisions that have been approved by the Privacy Commissioner and comply with ACCC guidelines on debt collection. If one were to listen to the Labor Party and, as I said, read the reports in the paper where the journalists have not even bothered to check history, one would believe that this was a new initiative. It is not—and this practice contains all these safety nets and provisions, which have been in place for quite some time. Most importantly, as I said, the practice was introduced by none other than the Labor government.
The mercantile agent Dun and Bradstreet recovers some of the overpayments under contract to Centrelink when it is no longer cost-effective for Centrelink to pursue them or where the debtor cannot be located. By virtue of the fact that all of these people are now no longer receiving Centrelink payments, Centrelink has no reason to know the address of the people who have incurred the debts. So I do not know what the Labor Party are suggesting. One can only presume they are suggesting that, firstly, somehow the person who has incurred the debt should not be pursued at all and that the rest of the taxpayers of Australia should just carry the can or, secondly, Centrelink should somehow know the address of everybody in Australia. How preposterous! How absolutely and utterly ridiculous!
But that is the state of play with the Labor Party now. Once again, this is an example of the Labor Party, after seven years in opposition, not having put down one single solitary policy as an alternative to those of the government. At this stage in an opposition's life, that is absolutely unprecedented. But if the Labor Party believe that their policy of using a debt collector is somehow wrong then I think it is now up to the Labor Party to explain to the people of Australia what they would do instead. Rather than do that, they come into this place and try to create a further furphy. Furthermore, the debt is not sold to the mercantile agent; the agent seeks to recover the debt on Centrelink's behalf. I think that is an important component of this issue that is once again being wilfully and scurrilously misrepresented by the Labor Party. As I said, if they disagree with their own policy, which has been continued by this government, then it is up to them to explain the alternative.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-06-24,"—It is interesting to note, and the record will show, that after a minute and a half Senator Lundy raised a point of order in her question without notice. History will show that, even though the minister mentioned the word `Telstra' only twice in that time, he failed to defend his record—or lack thereof, when it comes to being able to support any coordinated broadband policy of this government—and failed to defend what his government is trying to do about Telstra's actions in its roll-out of broadband services.
Senator Alston, I noticed, accused the Labor Party of being anti-Telstra. That is not correct; it is far from the truth. Trying to bring a company to accountability and ensuring that it is competitive and offers the best services for its clients across the board is quite a different matter altogether. This is a minister who is anticonsumer, and who could not answer a question today from Senator Lundy about a particular instance of a customer accessing broadband services and pointed the finger at our party being anti-Telstra. Rather than trying to defend or justify the actions of Telstra, we have a minister who is anticonsumer and does not put the interests of the consumers up front when it comes to what Telstra is doing with broadband access.
Let us have a look at some of the statements from this minister. Just last Sunday, on Channel 10's Meet the Press, he was asked about this. The minister has rejected the ACCC's view that Telstra's ownership of 50 per cent of Foxtel and its HFC cable network was anticompetitive. He said:
It is not as if Foxtel or Telstra have been caught red-handed engaged in some anticompetitive activity.
In fact, that is not entirely correct. Telstra's actions in the broadband Internet market in recent times must have simply slipped the minister's mind. There are widely reported allegations that Telstra has been turning customers away from ADSL broadband until they apply through Telstra BigPond, as was the case in Senator Lundy's question to the minister.
Allegations were raised in Senate estimates that Telstra ignored the concerns of an ADSL reseller in Croydon, Victoria that was unable to provide its customers with a service for almost a month in April following Telstra's upgrade, or so they said, of the exchange. Then there is the recent OECD report which found that Telstra deliberately manipulated broadband Internet uptake in Australia, through their ownership of both cable and copper networks, in response to the potential threat of competition.
So just about every player in Australia's broadband Internet market seems to have a story about alleged anticompetitive conduct from Telstra, and now the ACCC has added its claim to these accusations. But we have a minister who refuses to accept that is the case and who points the finger at consumers and criticises them. We have a minister who has an anticonsumer policy when it comes to access to Telstra.
We know that this afternoon before the Senate there will be a motion supporting an inquiry into broadband services. I understand that iPrimus, Hutchison Telecommunications and Macquarie Corporate Telecommunications have all urged the federal government's support of the terms of reference. So what we have seen are industry and businesses across the board wanting to have a very good look at what is happening with broadband services. Why? Because they understand that there is a need to have good access to this service for their businesses. Health, education outcomes and a range of other services across this country would improve if broadband services were able to be obtained by people equitably across this country. But we have a minister who is not prepared to accept that there is a problem and that this needs close scrutiny, and indeed it needs to be inquired into.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2003-06-24,"—Senator Lundy and Senator Crossin have complained that Telstra have rejected customer applications from their wholesale customers but then later connected them to BigPond ADSL. Neither of them make any mention of where applicants to Telstra's BigPond have had ADSL services rejected on similar grounds but then have been successful at a later time in being connected to a service provider using Telstra's wholesale ADSL service. They are quite prepared to put up an argument that suits what they are trying to get across to the Australian people, essentially misrepresenting the complete picture. But they do not make any mention of situations that might work the other way.
When connecting to ADSL there are several things that are generally accepted. One is that customers need to be less than 3.5 kilometres from their exchange to qualify for ADSL. Telstra, in circumstances where they receive an application, provide what they call a full service quality check. This check is performed via a database check and identifies technical factors, including distance from the exchange and the presence of incompatible products and technologies. It is performed using the same computerised service quality check system regardless of whether it is a Telstra wholesale or a Telstra BigPond application. Under those circumstances, given that the same process is used, how can one application be favoured over another?
Telstra has now introduced additional checking procedures on manual processing to remove any inadvertent errors that might occur. That is an area that the ACCC, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, are actually looking at. The ACCC obviously have extensive powers to do that, and I see no real issue with them undertaking that particular procedure.
Australia has seen significant improvements in the telecommunications industry in the last seven or so years of this government. We have seen advances to services in regional Australia, new services that have been developed and improvements in all sorts of telecommunications systems. I am aware that in my electorate Customs now receive mobile telephone services in areas where they did not receive them previously. Fishermen off the west coast of Tasmania now receive ADSL telephone services, which significantly improves the safety of their operations. Improvements to the telecommunications system have been due particularly to the sale of Telstra's T1 and T2 tranches. The improvements that were put in place following the delivery of the Besley report have made life much safer, more secure and much better for the businesses of fishermen off the west coast of Tasmania purely and simply because of the advances in the telecommunications system in this country. Australians can look forward to further improvements under the government's announced proposals in response to Estens. As I have said, the past seven years have seen huge advances in telecommunications in this country, including a huge uptake in broadband, approaching 200 per cent in the past 12 months or so. 
Senator Lundy mentioned that she would also take note of the answer from Senator—
—Vanstone.

This government has an extremely proud economic record of economic management and assistance to families in this country, something that is rarely mentioned by the opposition, including things like lowest interest rates—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-06-24,"—In regard to Senator Vanstone's answer to the question without notice I asked today, it is obvious from the minister's answer that she has very little or no knowledge of what is happening in the Department of Family and Community Services, and of the impact the introduction of the new IT system for Job Network is having on her department's capacity to deliver services to Centrelink clients. The department, at a series of estimates hearings, claimed that the new computer program for Job Network is a state-of-the-art IT system—it has all the bells and whistles that will ever be needed to effectively operate the Job Network system—and the outcome of that new IT system will be that, within minutes of pressing a button, every job seeker in this country will be able to be put in touch with people who are advertising job vacancies and will be transported into well-paying, permanent jobs within the Australian economy. 
The government have consistently ridiculed the fact that there may be major problems or any problems at all associated with the introduction of this new IT system. However, the truth of the matter is that there are significant problems associated with its introduction. The new system will introduce massive system changes. It is a very significant system—over $15 million was spent on it last year alone. Something like 220 IT staff are working full time on the system within the department. The changes that are required are so extensive that virtually all of those staff are being compelled to work excessive overtime in an attempt to complete the changes prior to 1 July, when the system is supposed to be up and functioning. 
The department are attempting to do too much. They are attempting to introduce extensive changes to how the Job Network operates after 1 July and implement massive infrastructure and software changes to the computer programs in the context of opening new sites as well as closing old sites; and they are attempting to do this according to a far too optimistic transition timetable. As a result we are seeing a system which is not stable and frequently does not operate as it should. It frequently shuts down because of problems within the system. It has very slow response times, it takes too long to do simple things—a bit like the minister herself takes too long to do simple things—and it does not contain sufficient features in order to service the needs of employers. 
This technology is more bleeding edge than leading edge. That is one of the major problems with the system. The system has been designed by the department rather than by the people who have to actually do the work. This impacts on Centrelink's ability to refer job seekers and causes Job Network members to not get the anticipated flow of job seekers. 
This government has a great record on implementing new IT systems—that has clearly been demonstrated by its outsourcing program—and it would appear once again that this government is behaving a bit like the Bourbons: it knows nothing, it has learnt nothing and it has forgotten nothing. It is very obvious that the minister fits very well into that scenario. That is where she feels most comfortable in dealing with these issues. When you talk to her about IT, I think she thinks it is a new form of food for her dogs rather than a system that helps get young Australians into jobs and connected with job opportunities.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-06-24,"—by leave—I make this statement on behalf of the Minister for Science. On 25 June 2002, the Senate sought:
 ... the study commissioned by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, on behalf of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, of the preliminary evaluation of the construction site for the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights, carried out by the New Zealand company, the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences, which included geological mapping of the excavation of the construction site and has revealed a geological anomaly or `fault' at the site.
At that time, the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences had not completed any such study. On 26 June 2002, the government indicated that studies of the geology of the replacement research reactor site were still being conducted and that it was unable to meet the Senate's request at that time. The government indicated it would consider tabling the report once it was completed and the government had taken advice on the matter. I now table a summary report entitled Submission to ARPANSA on the site geological investigations for the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. The report incorporates the outcomes of various geological studies undertaken as part of the detailed seismic assessments of the replacement research reactor site, including the regional and near-site studies—which are included as background—the geological mapping of the site, the assessment of the fault type and characteristics found in the excavated area, the assessment made of the similarity of the fault to the information known about faults in the region, the dating of the fault and the comparison with criteria on fault capability.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-06-24,"—Originally, when the government introduced the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2] into the parliament, it argued that its reforms were all about supporting people with disabilities in finding employment—a very admirable and acceptable notion. The government should be putting the economy to work for people with disabilities who want to work. However, there are no such proposals contained in this bill. Nobody disputes the need for welfare reform—Labor has been quite vocal in this regard for some time. Labor recognises that we need to increase the number of people on the disability support pension who work and it agrees that too few people with disabilities are working when they can and are willing to do so. However, this government's proposal does very little to facilitate this. In fact, the proposal does nothing to promote this goal.
Under the bill before us, an individual who was to find work and move off the DSP but who, for one reason or another, has to return to the support payment will lose benefits. For those currently receiving the benefit, this is a massive disincentive to move off it and find work. This is firmly in contrast to the supposed objective of the government, which was to support an increased participation of people with disabilities in the work force. What incentive does an individual have to get out there and seek work if there is a risk that they will lose their much-needed support if, for one reason or another, they need to rely upon it again? There is simply none. This is a fundamental flaw in the legislation before us.
This government's proposal is not about disability support reform. It is a full-frontal attack on a social safety net—the net that protects Australians with disabilities from impoverishment. Over time, Senator Vanstone and many other members of the government have made crystal clear their real rationale for these changes to the disability support pension. It is not about facilitation for people with disabilities who want to work. This government argues that many people receiving disability support pensions are no more than whingers, malingerers or rorters of the system who refuse to work. Senator Vanstone has cited that many people in receipt of the DSP have no better excuse for receiving it than having a bad back. How much further from the truth can that view get?
To receive the disability support pension in the first place now and before these proposed changes were to enter into force, people need to demonstrate to Centrelink that they have disabilities, illness or injuries that attract an impairment rating of at least 20 points on the impairment table and also be able to prove that they have been unable to work full time or be retrained for full-time work for at least two years due to their disability. `Full-time work' is defined as being able to work for at least 30 hours per week at award wages. The intention of the bill before us today is to reduce that 30-hour requirement to 15 hours a week at award wages. If the minister is satisfied that so many individuals are receiving a DSP for having no disability other than being plagued by a bad back, why doesn't she increase the capacity for Centrelink to undertake compliance investigations against those suspected of committing fraud of the system? It is interesting to note that the government has not increased its efforts in this regard; rather, it has decreased its efforts in stamping out Centrelink fraud and funding the compliance sector of Centrelink.
These reforms come from a government which promised before the last election that nobody's pensions would be cut. The Prime Minister, who spoke at the ACOSS conference on 25 October 2001, said:
... nobody's benefit will be cut as a result of changes to the social security system.
It is another story of saying one thing before an election and committing to undertake exactly the opposite after the election. This is a government hell-bent on fulfilling its ideological agenda. This reform package has nothing to do with facilitating people with disabilities who can work to find a situation in the work force; rather, the package has everything to do with slashing the number of people in receipt of the disability support pension in whatever and whichever way it can. The government has recently demonstrated its ability to find the resources necessary to undertake a war, yet it cannot find the resources to fund the disability support pension. This is a strange set of priorities. I urge the Senate to again reject this bill. It is fundamentally flawed. It is an insult to the many people with disabilities in Australia who rely upon a fair go.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISABILITY REFORM) BILL (NO. 2) 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-06-24,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2]. I do not want to take long in responding; I just want to say a couple of things. Firstly, everybody who has had even a cursory look at this issue understands that reform of the disability support pension is long overdue and that we have an unsustainable system. In Australia's long-term interests it must be changed. We cannot afford to keep pretending that we can have a system that does not provide the appropriate incentives for people who may have some apparent disability and that simply accepts they do not need to get out there and do the best they can for themselves and participate in the work force if that is possible. We simply can no longer afford to have the system that we have; nor—and this is my primary reason for advocating change—even if we could afford it, should we.
The basic premise being put to the Senate in this bill is whether it is really fair that we pay a person who is so incapacitated—they might be in a wheelchair; they might be tube fed—and cannot work the same as someone who can tile a roof at award rates for 25 hours a week? I do not think Australians, if the question is put to them that simply, will say, `Yes, I think that is fair. Yes, let's pay the bloke who can do fencing, or tiling, or paintwork, or vine pruning, or work as a clerk or as a receptionist'—not meaning a Clerk of the Senate, of course, Mr Evans but meaning a clerk in the administrative sense. Very few could aspire to that high office, I understand.
—It's not 25 hours a week either.
—And he certainly works a lot more than 25 hours a week; more like 75, I would have thought. But that is the basic premise: do we really want to pay someone who has so serious a disability, born with or acquired, as to not be able to work at all or maybe be able to do only two or three hours, and not even at award rates, the same amount as someone who can work for 25 hours a week? On this side of the chamber we answer no. On that side of the chamber they say yes. That is the difference. I listened to some of the debate, and I heard one of the senators contributing to this debate last night talk about the inequity of the government's proposition. It was Senator Moore. Senator Moore claims that if this bill is passed there will be two levels of people on disability: the people who will be quarantined in the existing system and the people who will move to the new system. She rightly points out that there would be some people with the same disability on a different benefit. 
Mr Acting Deputy President, let me tell you a couple of things Senator Moore did not say. The people with the same disability who are really disabled and who cannot work for 15 hours or more would be on the same benefit. The ones who would be on a different benefit are the ones who can work 15, 20, 25 hours. That is because Labor and the Australian Democrats made such a fuss about changing the existing system that the government said, `All right, we will quarantine the existing system. If you want to leave the unfairness in the existing system, if you want to say to people who could do more on the existing system, “We will keep you protected,” fine, say it. But do not do it to future people.'
So, if this bill passes, the only people who will be getting a different benefit for the same level of disability will be the people who can work more than 15 hours. The ones I am really concerned about, the ones with a serious disability, would be on exactly the same benefit. So the passage of this bill will protect all of those who have a serious disability who cannot work for 15 hours or more and it will give them all the same payment. If Labor were happy to do the same for everyone else, we would be happy to change the bill and include the existing DSP population, or if the Democrats were happy we would be happy to change it. It is all very well to say we have some people on the same level of disability but differing benefits and neglect to mention that they are the people with the lesser disabilities and that the people with serious disabilities would be on the same benefit. That is what would happen if this bill were passed.
But let us look at what will happen if this bill is not passed. What will happen is that the guy who cannot work, who would love to be included, love to participate, love to feel that there were other people who valued his contribution, however small it might be, will be paid the same amount as someone who can do a lot but does not. And why? Because we have designed a system that encourages that. We have said to people, `If you can't work for 30 hours or more at award rates, then don't worry about it, mate, buddy, pal; we'll pay you to not do it.' That is the inequity.
The bill as it currently stands will pay some people who in my view should be doing more to stay on DSP and it will quarantine them. To make a change for the better in the future I will accept that inequity—that some people will be quarantined who in my view should not be. Some people who can work for more than 15 hours a week and are now on disability support will be quarantined and protected, and those in the future will not. I can live with that inequality. What I do not want to live with is the inequality where the same benefit is paid to people on vastly differing levels of disability.
That is a consequence of rejecting this bill. That is what Labor and the Democrats are supporting—an inequality that pays the same amount to people on vastly different levels of disability, unlike what they do in New Zealand, unlike what they do in the United Kingdom and despite the fact that one of the worst things you can do is encourage any level of dependence. Despite all of that, despite the national interest, despite having no alternative policies yourselves, despite having listened to McClure and his suggestion that we look at the New Zealand system and the United Kingdom system, because on the other side you cannot do anything but oppose—and for what reason the Democrats have chosen this position I am at a loss to understand—you want to vote to maintain this inequity. Well, you do so.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—I move APA amendment (1) standing in my name:
(1)	Clause 2, page 1 (lines 9 and 10), omit the clause, substitute:
2 Commencement
	(1)	Sections 1 and 2 are taken to have commenced on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent.
	(2)	Subject to subsection (3), this Act (other than sections 1 and 2) commences on 1 July 2003.
	(3)	If, before the day on which this Act would (but for this subsection) commence under subsection (2), vehicle standards have not been determined under section 7 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 that:
	(a)	relate to motor vehicle emission standards; and
	(b)	adopt the technical requirements, relating to motor vehicle emission standards, of the following:

this Act does not commence until the day on which those vehicle standards are determined.

This amendment puts back the commencement clause from what was a temporary bill, the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Bill, and ensures that fuel and engine specifications are put into the act in line with the Measures for a Better Environment package, which was negotiated with the government. I am not quite sure why this clause was dropped, but I am very pleased to see that the government has now agreed that this oversight needs to be rectified and the clause reinstated.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I want to make some preliminary comments and will use this amendment as a device to do so. It is interesting that these energy bills give partial effect to the commitment made by the government to the Australian Democrats in May 1999 under the Measures for a Better Environment package to replace the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme with a single scheme called the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. It is to ensure that a person who is entitled to an off-road credit when purchasing diesel fuel for use in eligible activities that are the same activities as those activities currently eligible for rebate under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme continues to be entitled. Similarly, the stated intention of these bills is to ensure that a person will be entitled to an on-road credit when purchasing fuel for use in activities that are the same as those activities eligible for a grant under the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme.
The opposition will support this legislation. We have long indicated to the government our support for these bills, subject to a Senate committee inquiry and subject to draft regulations being made available to the Senate prior to its deliberation on the bills. In relation to these two conditions, the Senate committee has tabled its report but, despite an undertaking from the Treasurer's office some months ago, the opposition has only today been shown the draft regulations and then only under a confidentiality agreement. The Senate as a whole, and therefore the parliament and the Australian people, still awaits the draft regulations that are critical to the operation of this scheme. It is critical with legislation such as this, where the devil is always in the detail as to how the legislation will work, that the parliament have the opportunity to properly consider them before, or at least concurrently with, the consideration of the legislation.
As I pointed out in the Senate last Thursday, most ministers within the Howard government follow this course, but not in this case. Some months ago, on 20 February, the opposition was briefed on these bills in Treasury Place, Melbourne. At that meeting the Treasurer's office undertook to make the draft regulations available before the Senate's proceedings. On that day Labor accepted that the draft regulations would not be available in time for the consideration of the bill in the House, and we therefore cooperated in good faith to allow the bills to advance through the House of Representatives. Then things changed. In his response to the Senate's return to order—and the return to order was about production of the regulations—the Treasurer claimed:
It is long-standing practice in this portfolio not to release draft regulations relating to amendments currently under the consideration of Parliament.
The Treasurer's office has also advised the opposition that the provision of draft regulations to the opposition before this bill had passed the Senate would `set a precedent' for the Treasury portfolio. As this is an important Treasury bill we could have expected, and should have been given, full cooperation in our efforts to review the regulations to ensure that, if enacted, this bill will deliver what is intended. But the Treasurer is so arrogant that he is prepared to play games at the expense of good public policy and that is why he will not allow the Senate to properly consider the functioning of a multibillion-dollar taxpayer funded program. In the face of this arrogance we must look to precedent and that which the Treasurer does not wish to set. 
A very quick review of legislation has revealed two instances I wish to draw to the attention of the committee: the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Income Tax (Superannuation Payments Withholding Tax) Bill 2002. In the case of each of these bills draft regulations were released on 9 March 2002. The bills were introduced into the House of Representatives on 14 February 2002 and passed the Senate on 21 March 2002. Senators will be interested to learn that I looked up the explanatory memoranda for these bills. Imagine my surprise to discover that both memoranda were circulated by the authority of the Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello MP.
The bills before us relate to a scheme that was promised to the Democrats and the Australian people to be in place by 1 July 2002. But the Howard government, true to form when it comes to promises, could not or would not meet the original promised deadline. Labor had reasonably expected to see these bills before Christmas last year, based on the need to get them passed by the parliament in time for the 1 July 2003 commencement date. Labor was told that the draft regulations would not be ready in time for the bills to be debated in the house—this debate occurred at the end of March—yet on 15 May this year draft regulations were circulated to industry bodies. Labor agrees that the industry should be fully consulted but, unlike the Treasurer, Labor believes that the Australian people should also be properly consulted on where and how billions of dollars taken from the pockets of working men and women by the highest taxing government in Australian history will be spent. 
The Treasurer's refusal to provide draft regulations to the Senate is a damning indictment of the contempt with which the Treasurer, the pretender to the Camelot of Sydney Harbour, holds this parliament and the Australian people. I am sure senators are disappointed, as am I, that the Prime Minister is currently whipping up the spectre of an obstructionist Senate. He claims to be interested in ensuring that the parliamentary process works effectively for the good of the nation. Those are high ideals indeed for a man who was a senior member of the opposition that in 1975 blocked supply and precipitated the gravest constitutional crisis in our history—at least until this year. Whilst the Prime Minister pontificates on the need for an effective parliamentary process, his Treasurer actively works to undermine that very process. If the Prime Minister is truly interested in an effective parliamentary process he must pull his overtly loyal but increasingly impatient deputy into line.
The Treasurer's assertion that it is longstanding practice in his portfolio not to release draft regulations relating to bills currently under the consideration of parliament is simply untrue. The Treasurer has set the precedent he claims he wants to avoid and has released such draft regulations when it has suited him, and he has done so again today but only after Labor embarrassed him by pointing out the precedents I mentioned earlier. The Treasurer finally agreed last night at 7.30 p.m. to allow the opposition to see the draft regulations today but on the condition that we sign a confidentiality agreement. I suppose this will be the Treasurer's new precedent. I suppose we can expect that in future he will make draft regulations available but only on a confidential basis and only minutes before a bill is due for debate, thereby stifling the opportunity for proper, open consideration of these regulations.
There are some other matters which I will further address during the course of this debate. In relation to amendment (1) as moved by Senator Lees, this amendment appears to be from section 2 of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999 and links this measure to the introduction of Euro vehicle standards according to the timetable proposed under the Measures for a Better Environment package. Labor will be supporting the implementation of the Euro standards as agreed under the package. Therefore, Labor supports the amendment to the legislation to ensure that the Democrats and the Australian public are not dudded by the government, as they have been with so many other parts of the Measures for a Better Environment package.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—I am in the very pleasant position of agreeing totally with Senator O'Brien. Equally, I am objecting totally to the process here whereby the committee is being asked to deal with a very important matter which has been an ongoing subject of debate in this place but is immensely important to communities outside this place. The government says, `We will dump the regulations on the Labor Party at the last second but we will not even show them to the crossbench which has a huge interest in the issue.' That is absolutely unacceptable. I do not even ask the minister to say why he has given the regulations to the opposition but will not give them to Senator Lees, Senator Allison or me. The fact is there is no valid reason for that situation pertaining. On behalf of the Australian Greens I too will be supporting Senator Lees's amendment, but I do not think we should move to a debate until we get the information on the crossbench that has been supplied to the opposition so late in the piece. 
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-06-24,"—Today we are considering the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. This bill is the third attempt by this government to reduce the rate of the surcharge from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent over three years. I note that Senator Kemp is laughing. There chuckles the chief architect of this tax. This bill will provide an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners— those currently earning more than $90,500— with the greatest benefit going to those earning more than $109,900. This is a blatantly unfair tax cut that will result in substantial benefits flowing exclusively to less than five per cent of working Australians. It does not reduce the tax burden for low- and middle-income Australians who are struggling to save enough for retirement.
It is Labor's belief that, particularly in a time of negative returns on the superannuation of most Australians and with record amounts of tax coming from superannuation—imposed by Australia's highest taxing Treasurer, Mr Costello—the Liberal government should be cutting superannuation taxes for all working Australians, not just for high-income earners. Labor has presented a plan to deal more fairly with tax on superannuation, with its proposal to cut the contributions tax for all, which I will deal with in detail later. First, let us recall the previous occasions when this bill has been before the Senate.
During both previous debates on the surcharge tax reduction, Liberal government speakers repeatedly insisted that the surcharge tax was a terrible burden on high-income earners, a burden that should be reduced to encourage high-income earners to save more for their retirement. Obviously, government senators have forgotten that the surcharge tax was an invention of the Liberal government in 1996—an invention that broke the promise made by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, on 1 February 1996, when he said:
We are not going to increase existing taxes and we're not going to introduce new ones.
That was a clear and unambiguous promise that the Liberal government broke just six months later, when it announced a new higher tax on superannuation contributions. At the time, the Liberal government justified the imposition of the surcharge as an equity measure. Mr Costello, the Treasurer, in his budget speech on 20 August 1996, said:
The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer. A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. 
He continued:
For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.
The same Liberal government that introduced the surcharge tax as an equity measure now wants to reduce it—an inequitable measure even in its own view. When this issue was previously debated, did anyone on the government side raise this issue at all? No, not one. I can recall back in 1996 both the Treasurer and the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, complimenting themselves on the decision to impose this new tax on themselves. On 27 August 1996, Mr Costello boasted:
... the point I'd like to make is that on Budget night the first Treasurer in history—me—stood up and put a surcharge in respect to high income earners and applied it to himself and every other politician, you know, we're the good guys in relation to this.
We had similar statements from the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, in this chamber. Where did Mr Costello say this? It was on the Midday Show while he was dancing the macarena. How things have changed since then. I doubt whether the Treasurer will be dancing the macarena again, at least not after the Prime Minister's recent announcement of his leadership intentions. But we are likely to see today a whole line of macarena dancers from the government side arguing passionately for this tax cut. I challenge senators on the other side to explain how they are going to justify to the vast majority of voters in their respective states a substantial tax cut that applies exclusively to high-income earners.
The reality is that this is an unfair bill that will provide a significant benefit for a small minority of people. I think most people in the community, given the current circumstances, would agree that this is extremely unfair. There is one legitimate criticism of the surcharge tax—that is, the administrative costs. It is an unnecessary expense. It is Australia's most expensive tax to collect. In the first year of operation some superannuation funds incurred as much as 30 per cent of the revenue paid as associated administrative overheads. I think it was only yesterday that, in the Australian Financial Review,there was a report detailing the ongoing costs of collecting this tax at about 11 per cent. Of course, the remaining administrative burden of the surcharge falls on all fund members in some way. The associated collection and compliance costs must be met and consequently must reduce the overall accumulation of all fund members, not just those on whose behalf the surcharge is levied. But reducing the rate—this is what Senator McGauran needed explained—of the surcharge does absolutely nothing to address the administrative costs. If anything, the implementation of a 4.5 per cent reduction over three years is more likely to increase the administration costs that will be carried by all members of superannuation funds. 
In the time since the last debate on this issue, the Liberal government has done a bit of dodging on the issue. The minister responsible, Senator Coonan, has routinely argued that this measure is designed to `enable those who are able to save for their retirement to do so'. Here we have a minister caught by her own rhetoric. Starting from the reasonable premise that high-income earners are already able to save for their retirement, she makes the absurd argument that they need a tax cut to enable them to do what she says they are already able to do. Labor, on this side of the house, would ask the minister: what about those middle- and low-income earners—more than eight million of them— who, right now, are struggling to provide for their retirement? Where is their tax cut? What is the Liberal government doing to enable them to save for their retirement?
The minister has accused us of playing the politics of envy, but Labor is concerned with the politics of fairness. Is the minister accusing ordinary Australians of being envious of those on higher incomes? Ordinary working Australians are not envious but they expect fairness. They are justifiably angry that the Liberal government gives them nothing yet it is prepared to throw hundreds of millions of dollars towards that exclusive tax cut on superannuation for high-income earners. While the co-contribution will be debated at greater length at a later stage, let me reiterate that Labor will support the low-income earners co-contribution. Furthermore, we welcome the government's decision to introduce it as a separate bill—a sign that it has abandoned its cynical tactic of linking it to the surcharge reduction. That said, the contrast between the surcharge reduction and the co-contribution for low-income earners could not be starker, and the contrast goes to the heart of the inequity in the Liberal government's approach to the taxation of superannuation.
—And the Nationals.
—I am sorry if I am forgetting the National Party in the critique, Senator McGauran. The co-contribution is only payable where low-income earners— those earning less than $32,500 a year—can find the extra cash to make voluntary super contributions. On the government's own figures that is about one in 20 low-income earners. The surcharge tax reduction, on the other hand, will benefit everyone earning more than $90,500 a year, regardless of whether or not they make any extra contributions. The Liberal government claims its measures constitute a balanced package. What does the Liberal government mean by a balanced package? What it means is a benefit for one in 20 low-income earners, at the other end of the scale a guaranteed benefit for high-income earners and nothing for the millions of middle-income earners—not one cent for those earning between $32,500 and $90,500. So much for balance.
No doubt the government will also try to grandstand about the Senate obstructing its mandate to reduce the surcharge. Well, I hope it does. I look forward to the day when we see government ministers more vigorously advancing the rationale for an exclusive tax cut on superannuation for high-income earners. Go out there and argue it. We will happily take up the challenge of a potential double dissolution in respect of this bill. We will argue this one; we are very happy to argue it. We will continue in our position not to support this exclusive tax cut; rather, we will argue for a cut in the tax for low- and middle-income earners. I am quite happy on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to put to the Australian people that Labor will not support an exclusive tax cut for the top four or five per cent of taxpayers but, rather, will put our proposition that there should be a tax cut on most Australians' superannuation contributions.
It is interesting that the Treasurer did not mention this tax cut in his recent budget speech. He has kept it hidden. But this bill clearly shows that the government's tax cut is much more expensive than it first thought. There was no word in the budget about the blow-out in costs, but the explanatory memorandum that was released just a few weeks later says that this exclusive tax cut for high-income earners will cost some $525 million over three years—some $155 million more than in the budget a few weeks before. While not disclosed by the government, the cost in 2006-07 is at least equal to the $290 million in 2005-06. With this included, the total cost over three years is even higher. Clearly, the Liberal government is giving more to high-income earners than it admitted a year ago. We now have an opportunity to implement a fairer proposal to boost retirement incomes, but this chance will be lost if the Liberal government is successful in passing this unfair tax cut through the Senate.
In contrast to the Treasurer's embarrassed failure to talk about superannuation on 13 May, Labor have shown leadership by presenting a detailed and fully costed plan to cut the superannuation contributions tax paid by all working Australians. Labor's plan to cut the contributions tax is the best way to deliver higher retirement incomes to millions of working Australians. It is a way to encourage all Australian workers to better prepare for their retirement. It is interesting that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has admitted he cannot do anything, that he is totally bereft of policy in this area. He has given up. He said in a radio interview on 22 October 2001:
It's pretty complicated. The taxing of contributions on the way in started back in the mid eighties ... and I think now that it's started that's going to always be with us ... So it's still better to put money into superannuation, than to take it as income. But that system having commenced 15 years ago would be incredibly complicated to unravel now.
It seems quite incredible to me that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, thinks it is too complicated to unravel the contributions tax, or at least reduce it a point or two, but that somehow it is less difficult to unravel the surcharge tax. One would think it would be considerably less complicated to unravel the universal contributions tax than the high-income earners surcharge tax. It is the first time I can ever recall the Treasurer, who is not renowned for being meek and mild in his contributions on policy, actually admitting that he cannot do anything. Why does Mr Costello believe so desperately that he needs to unravel the surcharge tax on high-income earners when he believes it is too difficult to unravel the contributions tax?
Perhaps the Treasurer refuses to cut the contributions tax because to do so would be an admission that under his government superannuation taxes have reached a record level of almost $5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion when the Liberal Party was elected back in 1996. I will repeat those figures. When the Liberals were elected in 1996, tax on superannuation contributions stood at $1.6 billion. Where is it this financial year? Five billion dollars. And if you look in the budget papers for the fastest growing tax in Australia, it is not income tax, it is not the GST, it is superannuation tax. Is it any wonder Mr Costello is the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history. Another reason the Treasurer is refusing to cut the contributions tax may be that he does not really believe in superannuation as a policy to increase retirement incomes for ordinary Australians, nor does he believe in superannuation as a policy for preparing Australia for the challenges of an ageing population. As with Medicare, the Liberals opposed compulsory superannuation from the word go and are determined to undermine it from government.
Labor proposes that this bill, together with the unfair and unnecessary changes to Commonwealth public sector superannuation which will be debated later, should be set aside and the money redirected into cutting the contributions tax from 15 to 13 per cent, phased in over four years. As outlined in my statement, this plan is affordable and will add thousands of dollars to the retirement savings of ordinary Australians over their working lives. I will give a couple of examples of people who will benefit from Labor's approach. Matthew is 20 and earns $40,000 a year over his career. He gets an extra $7,128 in a retirement nest egg under Labor's plan to cut the contributions tax. Matthew would receive nothing under the Liberal government's exclusive tax cut. Another example is Heather, who is 40 and earns $60,000 a year over the rest of her career. Under Labor's fairer tax cuts she receives an extra $4,069. Heather would receive nothing under the Liberals' proposal. These examples are in present values so they reflect the value in today's terms. The benefits would be substantially more in the dollars of the future. These outcomes provide a powerful incentive for Australians to invest in their own future, helping us to cope with our future needs. At a time of negative returns and widespread dissatisfaction with excessive fees and charges in some funds, Labor's plan will boost confidence in superannuation.
When we first introduced our alternative proposal to reduce the universal contributions tax instead of the selective high-income earners tax, the government's reaction was to challenge the costings. But they soon did a backflip, particularly in relation to the central feature of their superannuation policy—the laughable children's accounts—which has proved to be a spectacular failure. If ever a government's superannuation policy could be called weak and wimpy, it would have to be in relation to these accounts. In launching the package on 15 November, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, boasted that children's superannuation accounts, the centrepiece of Liberal Party policy, were trailblazers, particularly in the area of superannuation for children; that it was a policy that would teach children the wonders of compound interest and produce a strong savings and investment culture; and that $42 million had been set aside to provide for the cost to revenue of 470,000 of these accounts. This was later revised down to 47,000 accounts. So far we have got one open. I think it will be more than one, but it will be a lot short of 470,000.
The contrast between the Labor and Liberal parties on superannuation could not be clearer. The Liberal Party does not really believe in superannuation and is only prepared to offer an exclusive and unfair tax cut to those earning more than $90,500. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate is of the view that the bill:
(a)	should be withdrawn by the Government because the proposed surcharge tax reduction to high-income earners is an exclusive tax cut to those earning greatrer than $90 500 surchargeable income ($94 961 from 1 July 2003) with the greatest benefit going to those on an income greater than $109 900 ($114 981 from 1 July 2003) with the result that it assists only the highest 5 per cent of income earners; and
(b)	should be redrafted to cut the contributions tax for all Australians, a fairer approach, particularly at a time of negative returns, to boost the retirement income for all Australians and assist the Nation in preparing for the ageing of the population”.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I will take up only a moment or two of the Senate's time to speak on the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. I have a great deal of interest in the bill because, as I see all that the government has attempted to do with this bill, it does not have the best interests of low-income workers at heart. The amendments in this bill reduce the superannuation surcharge rates by one-tenth of their current level over three years and the amendments are subject to a large degree of controversy. The controversy is built around the inequity of low-income against high-income earners. Through this bill the government is implementing its election promise to reduce the superannuation surcharge. But what does it do in real terms? It establishes the low-income earners co-contribution scheme and it reduces the high-income earners superannuation surcharge.
The government cannot take credit for doing very much for ordinary Australians who are battling to save as best they can for a more secure and more comfortable retirement—something we should all be very mindful of. Indeed, I think we would all be looking for a more comfortable and more financially secure retirement than that which many of us know our parents and grandparents had. This bill is not really doing that for low-income workers, and that is where my real concern lies. It seems to me that there is an exclusive benefit to the high-income earners with the surcharge tax reduction at a four-year cost of $525 million, up from some $370 million over 18 months ago. It is considerably higher and more beneficial to the high-income earners. There are about 340,500 active super fund members contributing who earn what would be considered high income of $90,500 per annum. These are the people who gain most from the surcharge reduction.
What about the low-income earners? For them there is the co-contribution with a maximum of $1,000 matching payment at income below $20,000 a year tapering down for those on incomes of up to $32,500, at a four-year cost of just $337 million. This is clearly a benefit to those who currently make contributions or may be encouraged to do so. But the low-income earners are those who gain least from what the government is attempting to do. Superannuation is an area that needs much more attention than is being given to it now. The work of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is finding with each inquiry that there are avenues opening all the time for further inquiries into the regulation, management and dealings with superannuation in this country.
The surcharge has never really met the objectives that it set out to achieve. It is in relation to this point that I think we need to be cautious about how we move ahead, and it is for this reason that the government really has not tackled the real issues that are before it with this particular bill. The minister should consider further ways in which there can be equity between high- and low-income earners. Apart from the 2002-03 budget papers, the government has not produced any economic analysis of the benefits of its proposal. The crux of the bill is that it will narrow the tax base and reduce the tax burden on high-income earners by $520 million a year by the end of 2005-06, and it does very little—if anything meaningful—for those workers and contributors on low incomes. They were the only comments I wanted to make in relation to this bill this afternoon. Senator Sherry was certainly more eloquent and thorough in dealing with it and I am confident that my friend and colleague Senator Hogg will make a very worthwhile contribution to this debate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-24,"—Like Senator Buckland, I want to make a few comments on the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 this afternoon. It is one of those bills in respect of which we in the Labor Party stand quite distinctly apart from the policies of the government. There is a clear delineation, and it comes about as a result of what one can see the government are trying to do in this bill. This bill is really about equity and fairness, something the government really know nothing about.
In my maiden speech—or first speech, as they now call it—I referred to three elements of security in your life which are important: security in youth, security in work and security in retirement. I will come back to them on each occasion I speak in a debate on a superannuation bill in this chamber. Superannuation really went to achieving security in retirement for people who had never known anything other than access to the age pension. Of course, the Senate superannuation committee—and I have been a member of that committee although I am no longer a member of it—over a period of time has done a number of inquiries into the adequacy of superannuation for retirement. It can be clearly seen that, over a period of time, even with superannuation now at the level of nine per cent, it is not going to provide an adequate retirement benefit for those people when they reach retirement age. There will still be a dependency upon the age pension and other social security arrangements to ensure that those people have dignity in their retirement.
The government could at least take away some of the reliance upon social security and other payments by making sure that the taxes that affect superannuation are reduced. This is an ideal opportunity for them to do this, but they have not chosen to reduce the contribution rate, as has been suggested by Labor as a real alternative. What they have chosen to do instead is to look at the issue of the surcharge tax which was put in place a number of years ago by this government. Of course, as my colleagues have clearly outlined, this is going to favour those who are well heeled in our community, those who are well off, and it is not going to provide any taxation relief for those people who are low-income earners and who need the most benefit out of superannuation because the superannuation that is currently in place at nine per cent will not provide adequately for those people when they reach retirement age.
If one thinks back to the introduction of the surcharge, it took the government a long time to admit that it was a tax. But it is a tax, and of course we know from its introduction that it was always a flawed tax—it was a flawed tax in the first place. It was a cumbersome tax; it was difficult to apply; it was costly to collect and it was an inefficient tax that was criticised widely throughout the superannuation industry and by people throughout the tax industry. They knew that it was a flawed tax, but nonetheless it was there. It was being levied and applied, and the relief that is now coming out of this initiative by the government is going to favour those people who have the greatest capacity to pay tax. Those are the people who should not be getting the relief. The people who should be getting the relief are those people with the least capacity and the people whose superannuation will deliver them a substantially lesser benefit than that of the people who are going to get the relief out of this particular legislation.
In that sense, it really is quite immoral that we are faced with this piece of legislation in this chamber today. As my colleagues have rightly pointed out, it should be addressing those people who are in low-income areas. Even a two per cent reduction in the contribution tax would assist the account balances of many of the low-income earners over the long period of time that most of their superannuation is invested until they reach retirement age. Whilst it would not totally take away dependency on social security benefits in many of those instances, as I said, it would nonetheless assist those people in having a greater degree of independence. It is really quite sad to see these things come before the chamber with no real social benefits, no real community benefits and no real benefit to any group of people other than those who are extremely well placed in our community already.
It is worth while to look at BillsDigest No. 166 2002-03 on this particular issue, particularly at some of its concluding comments because I think they best sum up some of my feelings. I quote the first paragraph of those comments:
Apart from 2002-03 Budget Papers, the Government has not produced any economic analysis of the benefits of this proposal.
It goes on to say in a qualified way:
The Government could correctly argue that such arguments have been made elsewhere.
I do not believe that argument has been made by the government elsewhere. I think the government has shown that it is a divisive government, a government that favours those who have the financial capacity to pay tax over those who do not have the capacity, and I do not think that the government has substantiated its case in any way. It goes on to say:
Notwithstanding this omission, the inescapable conclusion is that, based on the estimates in the Explanatory Memorandum, this Bill will narrow the tax base and reduce the tax burden of high income earners by $525 million by the end of the 2005-06 year.
What an absolute disgrace! The people with the greatest capacity to pay are going to be the beneficiaries of this bill. It is going to reduce the tax burden of high-income earners by $525 million. It would be far better to have that distributed to those people who do not have the capacity to pay the tax and those people who do not have the capacity to receive the benefit by way of a lower contributions tax. The BillsDigestgoes on to say at the bottom of page 5, in the concluding comments:
While these amendments will assist in a small way the individuals in the catch-up phase and those receiving redundancy payments, the amendments in this Bill also undermine the equity argument by increasing the level of tax concession available to high income earners. The Government has yet to justify the vertical inequity of this measure (i.e., why high income earners should be treated to this tax cut and not lower income earners). 
I will not prolong my contribution to this debate, because I realise that time is now important in the consideration of other business of the Senate, but I cannot let the moment slip by without pointing out the absolute inequity of and the lack of fairness in the proposal that the government has before this chamber this afternoon. It does nothing to assist low-income people, the people who really need the assistance. There is no justification and no fairness to this measure. No-one with a reasonable conscience would say that saving high-income earners $525 million by 2005-06 with low-income earners receiving no benefit at all can in any way be justified. It stretches one's imagination to see how one can justify that sort of tax cut being given to those who are well off but not to those who are not well off, who need the benefit of improving superannuation conditions—and I know that this bill is not about that—and who also need access to lower rates of tax. If there is an opportunity to cut the tax, then that should be afforded to those people first and foremost. Then if the government wants to look after the high-tax payers at some later stage, let it do so but not at the expense of low-income earners, who rely on their superannuation to provide them with some element of dignity in their retirement.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-06-24,"—The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 tonight. We are not supporting it because it goes too far in providing too big a benefit for too few people. This bill is about ensuring that those people who are earning six-figure salaries get a tax cut of 4½ per cent on their superannuation. The surcharge applies in 2002-03 to those in the income level between $90,527 and $109,924. It phases in over that particular period. In fact, from the 2003-04 year on, the full 15 per cent rate will only apply to incomes of $114,981 and above. The tax cut is also retrospective in that it applies from 1 July last year, so it is an extraordinary thing that when the surcharge figures are done for this year people will get this little present from the government for last year. 
The cost to the budget is quite substantial—$525 million over the next four years. By the third year of operation it will be $290 million a year—a $290 million tax cut for people earning effectively over $114,981 a year. I have heard Senator Coonan, in various interviews, describe those people as `the battlers' but I must confess that there are not too many battlers in my state of Queensland who are earning $114,981 or more a year. What is very sad from my point of view is that the battlers are the people on the low incomes in the $20,000 to $30,000 range and this government is only offering those people $115 million a year in terms of the co-contribution for low-income people. So almost three times as much money is being offered in tax cuts to the very high-income people earning $100,000-plus while only $115 million is being offered to those people on less than $20,000 or in the $20,000 to $30,000 range.
The other interesting thing is that, from the time this was announced in last year's budget to the time the explanatory memorandum actually came out, the cost of this measure blew out quite significantly. It blew out from $200 million in that third year to $290 million, which is an increase of about 40 per cent. That reflects the fact that the superannuation surcharge is a very profitable tax and is collecting an awful lot of money for the government. The reason for that is that, even after the 15 per cent contributions tax and the 15 per cent surcharge, super is still a very good deal for high-income people. They still get a tax concession of 18½ per cent off their marginal tax rates. It is the reason why there is plenty of evidence that high-income people are still attracted to super and still putting money into super, which is why the collections on the surcharge have been growing so sharply in recent years. This particular tax cut comes on the back of many tax cuts this government has already provided for high-income people. The Democrats and the Greens I think were the only two parties to vote against the billion dollar tax cut in capital gains tax in this place two or three years ago—80 per cent of which went to the top income bracket. Only last week, we raised concerns about the fact that the tax cuts could have been pared back on the above $60,000 range; $175 million of the tax cuts voted on by this parliament last week were because of the reduction in the tax bracket of the $60,000 and above range.
The Democrats are prepared to concede that there may be a need for some amelioration of the surcharge. We do not like it; we do not like a lot of things that we are forced to deal with in the Senate, but we recognise the government has a political problem with its supporters in the high-income range. We recognise that, when Mr Stone was still President of the Liberal Party and he was accusing the Treasurer of leading a government that was mean, tricky and out of touch, the surcharge was one of the three touchstone issues that the government was obviously struggling with. So we recognise that the government may need to do something in this area. But we say to the government that if you must do something in this area then, for goodness sake, structure it in a way so that the bulk of the money is going to low-income people. Instead of putting $290 million a year into the high-income bracket and only $115 million into the low-income bracket, why don't you reverse the percentages? To me that would make sense; that would be a package that would be supportable from the Democrat point of view. But at this point in time, given that we have two stand-alone bills—a bill for the co-contribution for low-income people, which has a very puny and very small incentive going to a very small number of people; and a bill for a high-income earners surcharge, which is very big and provides an awful lot of benefit to a very small number of people—the Democrats will have to vote against the bill before the chamber.
We have made it quite clear to the government over several months, as well as in my correspondence with Senator Coonan, that we would be prepared to support a compromise, but no compromise has been forthcoming from government. I would remind the Senate that the compromise we have offered to date is that we want this surcharge cut at least halved and the savings from that put into the co-contribution. I do not care how it is put into the co-contribution. That is a structural matter for the government and they can come back with the various costing options. But I do want to make sure that, if this government is putting up a package of concessions to superannuation, it must be balanced in favour of low-income people. The reason why that is so necessary is that the superannuation system is so regressive in its taxation. The flat rate tax, the 15 per cent tax that the Labor Party is talking about reducing, actually provides a much greater concession for high-income people than for low-income people. At a 15 per cent `concessional' tax rate, the concession for people earning less than $20,000 a year is only 3½c in the dollar, which is 18½ minus 15. For the middle range—the people in the 30 per cent tax bracket—their concession is only 16½c in the dollar. For the moderately high-income people—earning between $60,000 a year and $115,000 a year—their tax concession is 33½c in the dollar. You can see that it is very unusual in tax terms in this country for the rate of tax concessions to increase with income levels, but that is what we have with the flat rate of taxation on superannuation.
The Democrats have for a very long time been calling for superannuation to be taxed at marginal rates—tax which is not in the hands of the funds but tax which is in the hands of the employee. It would get around that enormous administrative cost that the surcharge has, which was reported on by the Australian Tax Research Foundation only last week. The Tax Research Foundation actually found that the collection costs of this surcharge are equal to about 11 per cent of the tax, which is an extraordinary amount of money when you think about it. The fundamental problem is the design of the tax. The fundamental problem is not the fact that we are asking high-income people to actually pay more tax; they should pay more tax in their super contributions because they get more of a concession. Even with this 15 per cent surcharge plus the 15 per cent contributions tax, they are still getting a higher tax break at 18½c in the dollar than someone on a low income or even someone on a middle income. Certainly from that point of view, the Democrats are of the strong view that the surcharge itself is supportable as a tax impost, although it would be preferable for it to shift to a more progressive system of taxation through the income tax system.
We say to the government that the Democrats are prepared to talk about a system which actually delivers more for low-income people rather than high-income people, but we are not prepared to talk about providing $290 million a year to high-income people in a tax break that clearly they do not need, judging by the amount of funds flowing in from high-income people into superannuation. Certainly from that point of view, the Democrats urge the government to look at a better way of using the $525 million in this bill. That $525 million could do an awful lot to attract low-income people into superannuation. That $525 million could actually ensure that the low-income earners contribution could be extended from its current range where it starts to cut out, at $20,000, right up to very close to average earnings. That would actually provide one, two or possibly 2½ million Australians with access to that co-contribution, encouraging them to save for the first time.
To me that is a very important objective because Australia has, at the moment, I think the lowest saving rate in the OECD. The last figure I saw was a zero per cent savings rate. This country cannot afford a zero per cent savings rate. We cannot afford the fact that, over the last year because we had the worst returns from superannuation in 28 years, we had one of the biggest falls in personal contributions to superannuation—I think it was down $3 billion in a year. That is an enormous fall in personal contributions to superannuation. We need to encourage people to save. We do not need to encourage high-income people to save because they are saving very merrily and that is shown in the surcharge collection figures. What we need to do is encourage low- and middle-income people to save, and that is why we believe this money needs to be adjusted across and put into the co-contribution for low-income people. We will be supporting the bill later when it comes before the chamber, but on this occasion I say to the government that the Democrats cannot support this bill.
I also say to the ALP that we will not be supporting their second reading amendment to this legislation. The reason is that, because the contributions tax on superannuation is a flat tax across the board, it is in itself regressive, and the notion of cutting that tax rather than trying to improve the progressiveness of the taxation of superannuation, to me, is a second order reform. The first order reform should be to try to encourage low-income people to put more money into superannuation. You can do that not so much by cutting everybody's superannuation contribution but by cutting it for low-income people by increasing their co-contribution.
We have just heard speeches from Senator Hogg and Senator Buckland. They talked about why high-income people should not have a cut in their superannuation taxes. The contributions tax is also paid by high-income people—by all the senators in this chamber. Under the Labor Party's proposal we would get a two per cent reduction in our contributions tax. I do not particularly think that we need one. I would prefer to see that money go towards encouraging low-income people to save through the co-contributions system. I add that the co-contributions system is a variant of a model that the Keating government originally proposed—their second version, the l-a-w tax cuts, back in 1996. It was a good reform then and, even though the government's proposal is a very pale imitation of what the Keating government proposed in 1996, I think it is a good reform now.
From that point of view, the Democrats will not be supporting this bill tonight. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment and we will be opposing the motion for the second reading when the question is put.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-06-24,"—I rise to sum up the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. The government first foreshadowed its intention to reduce the maximum surcharge rates in its 2001 election policy statement, A Better Superannuation System. That policy statement noted that, while this government's low interest rate environment has made home ownership far more achievable and capital gains tax has been reduced to encourage other investments, superannuation remains a crucial element in planning for a comfortable and secure retirement.
A Better Superannuation System set out a range of measures to provide greater incentives for voluntary contributions: the removal of inequities in the system, improved security of superannuation benefits, broadening the availability of superannuation to more Australians, and promoting the value of lifelong saving. Among the government's package of measures to provide greater incentives for voluntary contributions are the government's proposed co-contributions scheme for low-income earners and the proposal to reduce the maximum surcharge rates. These measures provide incentives for people, both higher- and lower-income earners, to make greater personal contributions to superannuation than they otherwise may do, and achieve greater self-reliance in retirement.
The government announced its intention to proceed with the rate reductions effective from 1 July 2002 in the 2002-03 budget. This initiative will reduce the maximum surcharge rates to 13.5 per cent for the 2002-03 income year, 12 per cent for the 2003-04 income year and 10.5 per cent for the 2004-05 income year. The government remains committed to this initiative, notwithstanding comments by Labor that it will not support this measure and qualified support, although not tonight, from the Democrats.
The government's commitment is reflected in the fact that this is the third time that the House has considered this measure. During the course of the debate, both here and in the House of Representatives, we have heard some very tired arguments to the effect that this is a tax break for the rich. It is disheartening, to say the least, that such a narrow focus is being taken by those opposite on what is in fact a much broader issue—that is, the ability of people to save for their retirement, their retirement incomes and saving incentives.
In any event, the Labor Party fails to recognise that higher-income earners will still be paying significantly higher rates of tax and surcharge once this measure has been passed than will other income earners. I think that point has not escaped Senator Cherry's attention. The application of the surcharge can be a huge disincentive for people to save for their retirement. Why, when the issue of an ageing population is widely known, are we still arguing in this place about sensible policy measures designed to decrease retirement savings disincentives? 
What is more, the application of the surcharge positively hampers the attempts by some groups in our society to save effectively for their retirement. Let me give an example. I refer particularly to women attempting to compensate for broken work patterns and, indeed, to older Australians approaching retirement who may be attempting to supplement their current savings. This was certainly not an intended consequence of this legislation. Here are at least two groups who are clearly in need of support from the government if they are to have a chance to make further savings in order to enjoy a comfortable retirement. It is nothing less than appalling that the Labor Party feel that it is right for these groups to be subject to savings disincentives.
Whilst those opposite may not care about issues facing older Australians and women juggling work and family responsibilities and returning to the work force, I can assure them that the government does. I draw the attention of honourable senators to an editorial in today's Financial Review. The article indicates that recent research has indicated that taxpayers on only $60,000 a year can be subject to the surcharge. It was never the intention to subject these taxpayers to the surcharge. It is disturbing that the surcharge measure is being cynically opposed under the guise of opposing tax cuts for the rich when what is being sought to be achieved is to reduce the burden on these taxpayers.
Ultimately, the underlying issue is one of incentives—or, rather, getting rid of disincentives. I cannot overstate the importance of incentives to encourage people to save for their retirement. That is why this government has been so active in bringing forward policies to encourage saving. I have mentioned the co-contributions and the surcharge reduction, the increased dollar for dollar deductions for superannuation contributions by the self-employed, increasing the age up to which contributions can be made, child accounts to promote lifelong saving, allowing superannuation contributions by those receiving the baby bonus—and the list goes on. Another policy allows people whose marriages, unfortunately, have broken down to be able to split their superannuation on divorce. And I will shortly be bringing forward proposals to allow spouses to split superannuation. 
This is a list of accomplishments and policies of which any government would be justifiably proud. However, the Labor Party—apart from talking about the contributions tax and having little idea about how to pay for it other than to raid other policies—have no other policies and can only obfuscate. The only object of derision in relation to this bill should be the obstructionism by some in this chamber of what is a sound measure that will remove a disincentive on those who would otherwise probably be inclined to put away some more money for their retirement. No attempts to misrepresent the government's policies or retirement income goals will dissuade the government from moving forward with a sound agenda to provide decent outcomes for retirement savings for all Australians.
I note that the opposition continue to call for the removal of this proposal and for the implementation of their own policy proposal through a second reading amendment. However, I remind the Labor Party that they are not in a position to make such a demand because they were not successful at the last election—
—It's policy. We are putting forward policy.
—much as Senator Sherry wishes he had been. Had the opposition gone to the electorate with any superannuation policies at all, and had they been elected, their position might have been different. But they did not. The opposition should now recognise this fact and allow the government to implement the policies that were put before the Australian people and on which it was elected. The Labor Party should also listen to the electorate on this issue and to the calls for a bipartisan approach to this matter. It is not just me calling for it; once again, an editorial today says:
The potential failure to get the surcharge changes through the Senate illustrates the complexities of superannuation taxation and the need for both major parties to adopt a bipartisanship approach.
I think the electorate is saying to this chamber tonight that they would like a bipartisan approach on these sensible measures that have already been subjected to an election and on which a government that was prepared to implement these policies was, in fact, elected.
The government will be opposing the second reading amendment. The government's measure to reduce the superannuation surcharge is, when all is said and done, a modest reduction in the extra charge that affected Australians' pay on their superannuation. It is appropriate that this burden be reduced to encourage those who have the capacity to save for their retirement to do so. Why? Because it removes the burden on those who cannot. Even after the reduction, other higher income earners will still be paying a higher rate of tax on their superannuation than others. This measure is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government which will make superannuation more attractive and more accessible and will encourage all Australians to save for their retirement.
In the course of debate it was said, I think, by Senator Buckland and Senator Hogg that the bill does not do anything for low-income earners—and I think Senator Cherry said that also. The low-income earner co-contribution will, however, deliver benefits to 350,000 recipients in 2003-04. The measure will deliver $385 million into the superannuation accounts of low-income earners over three years. Senator Cherry also said that the increasing dollars in superannuation—in other words, the increasing amount taken in relation to the super surcharge—indicate that the surcharge reduction is not required. However, the increases in contributions are, of course, not voluntary. The increases in contributions are not because people see superannuation as such a fantastic deal; they are occurring due to the increased incomes—thanks to the government's sound economic management. Similarly, the superannuation guarantee rate has only recently increased to nine per cent. Those factors explain more accurately why there is an increase in the surcharge received.
Finally, these two measures—the co-contribution, in a separate bill, and the surcharge—are carefully thought through measures aimed at targeting two specific areas where it is thought that significant improvement can be made to superannuation. The first measure is for low-income earners, who otherwise would not have the capacity to save for their retirement and who need an incentive to do so. That is clearly a well-targeted measure and one that has been carefully thought through. It is not one that has been directed at assisting people right up the scale; it will assist those who most need help. The surcharge is an extra charge that certain people pay over and above the taxes that everyone else pays. It is, in its effect, inequitable in the ways that I have outlined. I call upon the Labor Party and the Democrats to pass the reduction in the surcharge. People need to have the yoke removed from their nest eggs. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Sherry's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-06-24,"—I will continue with the issue that was being addressed prior to the committee deciding to report progress, and follow on from the points made by Senator O'Brien and the good research he has done on previous draft regulations that have been provided to the Senate. I know that a hastily arranged meeting provided what I understand was a confidential showing of regulations to a few people at the back of the chamber. It may or may not have been confidential. The point that I want to make and which I think needs to be made—and it is a much broader one than just this bill but obviously is germane to it—is that there was a return to order passed by this chamber last Thursday that the government refused to comply with. Once upon a time not that long ago—I have been here getting close to six years now and even in that recent history—refusal to comply with a return to order was seen as highly inappropriate and bordering on a contempt of the Senate. I recall at least once a mild punitive action was taken by the Senate in response to a failure by the then social security minister Senator Newman to comply with a return to order.
In the life of this parliament, in less than 15 months, according to the Notice Paper, there have been 24 different returns to order or orders for the production of documents that this government have refused to comply with. It is certainly contempt in the general sense of the word if not in the legal sense of the word. More importantly than that, the statement given by the government on behalf of the Treasurer, when they refused to comply with this order for the production of documents, said, `It is longstanding practice in this portfolio not to release draft regulations relating to amendments currently under consideration of parliament.' That, Senator O'Brien has clearly demonstrated, is a false statement. The minister, on behalf of the Treasurer, misled the Senate in refusing to comply with the return to order in terms of the reasons given.
That is not something that should be waved aside as a bit of gamesmanship. It is bad enough to be contemptuous of the Senate in refusing to comply with the return to order but to then give a false reason for not complying is extremely serious. I believe that the government needs to respond to that. It needs to correct the record in terms of its reasons. It has now shown the regulations confidentially to industry and to the tax office's fuel grant advisory forum—they got to see them back on the 15th. It then showed them to the Labor Party today confidentially and, after the reasonable point was made by others in the chamber, it then showed them to a few of us. It still has not actually tabled them. It has not actually made them available to the public. It still has not got them on the record. I do not know whether any of us are able to take copies with us. No copy is provided—we get a quick glance, a few notes, and that is it. I will leave others to judge whether that is sufficient in the context of this debate. 
The broader point is that the Senate made an order for the production of documents that was not complied with for the 24th time in the short life of this parliament and for a reason that has now been shown to be false. Also, absolutely no reason has been given as to why the regulations should be confidential, why they should be shown to the tax office's fuel advisory forum confidentially and why they should be shown to the rest of us confidentially. If you are going to be contemptuous of the Senate, at least give us some truth when you are using the reasons why you are being contemptuous. The Treasury portfolio seems to think it is exempt from the practice that is used by other portfolios. Why is the Treasury so special that it does not have to be open to scrutiny? Why is the Treasury so special that it is not required to be cooperative in terms of giving an idea of what is in draft regulations? It has certainly happened in other portfolios that I have had experience with, and I am sure others would agree. I do not know why this portfolio seems to get special treatment or seems to think that it should be exempt from this approach. I think it is a dangerous precedent to suggest that Treasury can have greater privilege than other portfolios in not assisting with showing people draft regulations. It is not enough to say, `You can disallow them if you do not like them.' Once legislation is through, disallowing the new regulations leaves you with nothing at all, which is often not tenable.
It is simply another case of a government refusing to open itself up to scrutiny. I guess it is not surprising in this particular area of the energy credits scheme where it has clearly failed to deliver on its commitments to the public and to the Democrats for a number of years. Even now, it is trying to hide things under a cover, once again showing contempt for the Senate. This body is here to enable the public to have proper scrutiny of what is going on. It is here for a check on the actions of government. We know that the Prime Minister does not like the Senate. We know that the Prime Minister wishes the Senate would go away. We know that he would love to remove our powers to do what we have been doing in the last week: significantly improving legislation, putting a spotlight on the government's failings, getting improvements, enabling public awareness about what the arguments are and enabling Senate committee inquiries. I have noticed the constructive approach of the crossbenches just recently in actually preventing a Senate committee inquiry, despite the committee unanimously recommending that that was what they wanted. I am not quite sure how that fits into working constructively rather than working obstructively, but that is neither here nor there.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: the question before the chair relates to Senator Lees's amendment which would amend clause (2). You have put that question and I do not think that anything Senator Bartlett has said is relevant to that question. I think he needs to be relevant to that question.
 (Senator Chapman)—We are dealing with clauses relating to the commencement of the bill, so that does enable a degree of breadth in terms of comment. I would ask Senator Bartlett to be mindful of the need in the committee stage to remain relevant to the subject under discussion.
—If the Democrats want to filibuster this bill, I remind them that I asked their spokesman on this issue whether she was happy to proceed with this legislation after the briefing from the Treasury officers and Tax officers. I was given a clear agreement that she was. So were the Greens. I heard through a spokesman from Senator Lees'office that they were happy to proceed immediately after the surcharge. If there is genuinely some problem with this then I am happy to adjourn it and go to the next legislation, but I really do not want to waste the next 25 minutes—very valuable minutes—by debating issues that are extraneous to the bill. If there is a concern, just tell me. Be upfront and honest and I will adjourn this bill again and go on to the next one. I would be quite happy to that but I do not want to waste 25 minutes of the Senate's time in a week when we do not have much time.
—Senator Campbell, that is a point to be raised in debate rather than as a point of order.
—If the minister wants to talk about commitments from the government, how they have blatantly breached them in recent times and reasons why that might be annoying, then I am quite happy to have that debate.
—Do you want me to report progress?
—No. I am not interested in reporting progress.
—Then it is a waste of time.
—If you think that it is a waste of time to point out that you have blatantly misled the Senate about a return to order and your reason to comply, then that is your—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I ask that that reflection on me be immediately withdrawn.
—I ask Senator Bartlett to withdraw. That was a reflection on Senator Ian Campbell.
—Which reflection, sorry?
—The comments you made alleging that Senator Ian Campbell had blatantly misled you or the Senate.
—I do not think I was implying that. I withdraw that, if that is what I said.
—Thank you, Senator Bartlett.
—If you are not sure about what you are saying, you should seek advice.
—Order! Senator Ian Campbell, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, you know that interjections are disorderly.
—If Senator Ian Campbell were genuine in trying to progress the debate then he would probably not try to provoke me with highly unhelpful reflections on what I am doing. I thought I said that the government misled the Senate last Thursday in its reasons for not complying with the order of the Senate. He suggests that it is not worth even five minutes of comment about regulations that are the subject of this bill and the amendment before us. If he thinks that is wasting time, I disagree. I think it is a very appropriate point to make. I should say that, in the context of what I repeatedly say is a difficult job for the Manager of Government Business in the Senate—to get all these issues through—it is a matter of cooperation across the board. 
If the government maintains a huge record of contempt for orders of the Senate then it cannot expect cooperation every single second of the day. If some ministers wish to blatantly breach agreements about negotiations that are under way on other pieces of legislation and to completely go back on agreements—the energy grants scheme is a perfect example of where there have been four years of breached agreements and breached pledges—then they cannot expect us to be 100 per cent cooperative every single second of the day. I am sorry. Perhaps Senator Ian Campbell, who I know has a very difficult job, might like to talk to those of his colleagues who are quite happy to breach written agreements and undertakings regularly. He might get more cooperation. If he thinks eight minutes of pointing out these difficulties is hugely uncooperative, I suggest to him that I can be a lot more uncooperative than this. I think it is an important point that needs to be made. When the government does not comply with returns to order at the best of times, and when the reason it gives is clearly wrong, as Senator O'Brien points out, that compounds the contempt. I simply flag the point that treating the Senate with contempt time after time is eventually going to lead to some opposite reaction that will not be in the interests of the government or, I suspect, of Senator Ian Campbell's blood pressure.

From what I can see, this amendment simply lifts some text out of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme legislation and puts it into this bill. But I would like some indication of the implications of that. For instance, I note that in proposed subsection (5), which is to do with vehicle standards that must come into effect, we are talking about standards that came in on 1 January 2002—and 1 January 2003, for that matter—which would all appear to be retrospective.

3A The Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme
	(1)	The purpose of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme is to provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels.
	(2)	In the case of diesel fuel, the Commonwealth intends to restrict entitlements available under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme to ultra low sulphur diesel for purchases from 1 January 2006 when a mandatory standard of 50 parts per million of sulphur will come into effect.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—The Democrats will not support amendment (3) because it does not, in fact, encourage the move to cleaner fuels. There is nothing in this bill or in any of the amendments to do so. For us, this makes no sense. The other point is that paragraph (2) would appear to be redundant. Given that ultra low sulphur diesel is mandated to be 50 parts per million by January 2006, there is little point in this amendment. This amendment says that you are not entitled to a grant unless you have ultra low sulphur diesel, yet that standard is already mandated. It is totally redundant and totally unnecessary because, if the law is complied with, no diesel has more sulphur in it than 50 parts per million. Can the minister answer that question? What is the value of the second paragraph? I am sure he would disagree with my comments about the first, but what is the point of putting in such a paragraph?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—We are now talking about ultra low sulphur, which is even cleaner than low sulphur fuel. Basically, we are putting the purpose of the legislation back in as it was in the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—The first paragraph of Senator Lees's amendment is essentially the same as the amendment to the consequential bill circulated in my name. Both amendments include the purpose in the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999 to provide active encouragement to move to alternative fuels. Section 4(2)of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999 states: 
(2)	The purpose of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme will be to provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels by measures additional to those under this Act ...
This purpose was removed from the bill currently under debate. Interestingly, it appears that Senator Lees has given up on having any additional measures to those contained in the act, as her amendment is limited to stating:
The purpose of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme is to provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels.
As the government has indicated, it is prepared to support this amendment. Labor will support Senator Lees's amendment as a compromise to ensure that the purpose is carried through to the new legislation. Therefore, I will be withdrawing the amendment to the consequential bill that has been circulated in my name in this respect.
The second proposed subsection of the amendment limits the entitlements to ultra low diesel from 1 January 2006, when the mandatory standard of 50 parts per million of sulphur will come into effect. This amendment is, I must admit, largely redundant as it excludes providing the grant to something that will not be available at that time, unless of course the government breaks another promise under the Measures for a Better Environment package. Of course, we are not expecting that it will be in a position to do that in 2006. Obviously Senator Lees does not trust the government to deliver on its deal and, one must say, it is no wonder with the government's track record, yet Senator Lees stands here to broker another deal in which the Australian public loses out—not only on media ownership but on heritage protection as well. Labor will support this amendment as it is designed to do what the Democrats and Senator Lees have so far failed to achieve—keep the government honest with its GST deal.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—There is no good point and no bad point for putting this so I will put it to the government now because I expect that after dinner would be a good time to get an outline of it. In his second reading speech the minister, in responding to the failure to have active measures to protect the environment as promised in the GST deal some years ago, says:
The Measures for a Better Environment package also noted that the Energy Grants Credit Scheme will provide encouragement for the conversion to cleaner fuels. The government is committed to pursuing options to achieve this and is doing so by examining the issue as part of the consideration of alternative fuels within the Energy Task Force.
I will paraphrase that: we have done nothing, but we are noting things, we are examining things, we are encouraging things and we are even going to consider things. What I want from the government here is really very important, because through this legislation we have $2.8 billion going to encourage the burning of fossil fuels in the country which already is the worst greenhouse gas producer on the face of the planet. This bill is actually an incentive to pollute. What we want to hear from the government are not these weasel words but its action plan. Three years down the line, where is it? What is the action the government has brought in to even offset the incentive to burn fossil fuels that is built into this bill? Where is the $2.8 billion to promote solar power and energy efficiency and clean alternatives? The fact is the government has cut back on spending on those items.
Anybody who understands what is happening in terms of global warming, not just the environmental but the economic threat to this nation's future and the planet's future, has a right to be very angry indeed about the government's cavalier treatment of everybody involved in this, not least Senator Lees and the then Democrats who negotiated an agreement out of which were going to come active measures. They have not come. They are not here. But we are still being asked to pass on this incentive to burn fossil fuels in the form of this legislation. The Greens will be opposing this bill for those reasons. We must, in the committee stage, hear from the government what its action plan is. Where is it? Why hasn't it been implemented? When will it be implemented? And what is going to be the outcome in terms of an environmental good?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—I will very briefly answer Senator Brown. Parts of this package have been extremely successful. The photovoltaic package was oversubscribed to the point that the government has now agreed to put more money into it. The trucking industry assure us that there have been considerable changes in engine specifications, and the fuel industry tell me that this is going a long way to give them the incentives they need to clean up diesel much earlier and in a far more cost-effective way than they would otherwise have done. So we have already seen some changes. They are there for all to see, indeed. And with the passage of this bill there will be further improvements.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—Senator Lees might be happy that she has got assurances from the trucking industry but that was not what I was asking about. I was asking about the actual achievement of environmental good coming out of this. We should be getting measurement. Senator Lees, I was not attacking you over this. I thought that you opposed the GST totally but there was built into that a commitment from the government which went to the nation, over your handshake with the Prime Minister, that there would be extraordinary environmental benefits coming out of this. They have not surfaced, and the response you give is minimalist. We are talking about very major moves to clean up this nation's worst in the world environmental record. They have not happened. Where is the evidence before this committee that the hundreds of millions that were going to be committed to that end have achieved what was promised?
You talk about fuel alternatives. In terms of the solar industry in the last few years, we have the best technology in the world but the photovoltaic industry in this country has had to go cap in hand for every cent it can get. It has had funds cut from it in this country as money went across to the coal industry in the pursuit of that oxymoronic term `clean coal' as an energy future. So let's call a spade a spade here. The GST deal, as far as giving an environmental good to the country, is a flop. It did not work. Mr Howard dudded the then Democrats leadership. We have to recognise that the government is reckless when it comes to the environment. We are dealing with a $2.8 billion stimulus to the bad. Where is the $2.8 billion for the good? It is not there; it has not been given. It is not working. To talk about getting assurances from the trucking industry, or from the mining industry for that matter, is simply fatuous. It has been a failure.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—I cannot go to dinner and leave Senator Bob Brown's comments unanswered. I just say to Senator Brown that if he wants to talk to a couple of industries that have had huge boosts then one he needs to talk to is the rail industry. What we did under that bill—and I have not brought all the correspondence with me—has made a huge impact with the success in particular of rail freight. We would not have a photovoltaic industry without the original money that was in this package. You can go and ask the industry. Again, I do not have the correspondence with me, but that has been hugely successful. Perhaps I should go to dinner leaving some questions to Senator Brown. What have you achieved in your time here by way of money for the photovoltaic industry, for the rail industry, for cleaner fuels?
No, we do not have a magic wand. We did not expect the impact of what we did back in 1999 to be equivalent to a magic wand. We do not believe you can jump from where we are today, with the mess that we are still in, to nirvana and find everything perfect and in complete order and exactly as we would want it. But the Measures for a Better Environment package that we negotiated with the government have made significant improvements. We have real outcomes. We have done the hard yards. I say again to Senator Brown: I do not see any packages that you have negotiated for the rail industry or the photovoltaic industry. I do not see any packages that you have negotiated to improve engine specifications and to clean up diesel fuel. It is a step-by-step process. We are not going to get there in one leap. It takes hard work. It takes a lot of discussions. It takes putting a considerable amount of evidence before government and a process where, yes, industry is involved. I did not mention the mining industry, but certainly the trucking industry I would congratulate for coming on board with many of these initiatives. I also congratulate particularly one of our key fuel providers, one of the big companies which is investing a lot of money in research in clean green energy, particularly in solar energy. We certainly have a long way to go, but we have also made a significant impact.

	(4)	A determination under subsection (1) or (2) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
	(5)	The Commissioner must, 30 days before making a determination, publish a draft of the determination on the Australian Taxation Office website together with an invitation seeking public comment on the draft determination.
	(6)	The Commissioner must cause to be included in his or her annual report, in respect of each determination he or she has made:
	(a)	a summary of public comment received in accordance with subsection (5);
	(b)	a description of how public comment was taken into account in the final determination;
	(c)	where public comment is not taken into account in the final determination, a statement of reasons why the comment was not taken into account.

 (6)	Clause 34, page 28 (line 5), omit “turtles, dugong,”.
I will speak very briefly to each of these amendments. Amendment (4) adds the Total Environment Centre to the specific groups that will be consulted. Amendment (5) is for the purpose of public transparency in making the termination disallowable. Amendment (6) specifically identifies dugong, which are a listed threatened species—as are turtles. Many of them are endangered and they should not have been listed as allowing any sort of a rebate.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I will deal with the opposition's position on these amendments. Amendment (4) includes an environment group on the list of those to be consulted when a determination is made by the commissioner on what operation of a journey constitutes a journey. Labor certainly supports the inclusion of an environment group in those to be consulted, so we support amendment (4). Amendment (5) makes the determination of the commissioner on what operation of a journey constitutes a journey a disallowable instrument and introduces a public consultation process. In the interests of good public policy and accountability, Labor will also support this amendment. We will also support the exclusion of turtles and dugong from the meaning of fish for the purposes of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003. We think that is entirely appropriate and taxpayer funds should not be used to subsidise fishing activities that catch either of these protected species.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—From the government's point of view, it speaks for itself.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—I am still not clear what this does. As I said, I thought you were not entitled to fish for dugong anyway and that there are other provisions that would have prevented that.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—The technical reason is that we brought forward the definition of fish from the old act which was written before the parliament and the government took an interest in turtles and dugongs. Senator Lees has very diligently picked up the fact that many other pieces of legislation and environmental protection measures at state and federal level now protect those species. This measure would have left it open for a fisherman who—illegally in many jurisdictions—caught turtles or dugong to still get the rebate. I do not think any of us would want to see someone getting Commonwealth government assistance for doing something that hurts turtles and dugongs.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"I move Greens amendment (2) on sheet 2881:
(2)	Clause 35, page 28 (line 20) to page 29 (line 11), omit the clause, substitute:
35 Wood production
wood production means:
	(a)	the planting or tending, in a place, of trees, intended for felling; or
	(b)	the thinning or felling, in a place, of standing timber;
and includes:
	(c)	the transporting, milling or processing, in a place, of timber felled in the place; or
	(d)	the milling of timber at a sawmill or chipmill that is not situated in the place in which the timber was felled; or
	(e)	where timber is milled at a sawmill or chipmill that is not situated in the place in which the timber was felled—the transporting of the timber from the place in which it was felled to the sawmill or chipmill; or
	(f)	the making and maintaining in a place referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of a road that is integral to the activities referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c);
and it does not include:
	(g)	wood production or related operations, including making or maintaining a road, in a native forest or in a place where native forest existed in 1990; or
	(h)	clearing of native vegetation.
native forest means forest dominated by tree species that are indigenous to the place in which it is situated.
native vegetation means vegetation indigenous to the place in which it is situated.
forest means a vegetation community dominated by trees with a projective foliage cover greater than 30%.
Under this amendment the diesel fuel subsidy that goes to the woodchip industry would be removed from the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003. The amendment would not remove the subsidy if it were going to the plantation industry per se, but it would remove it as far as native forest logging is concerned. This would apply not least to the woodchipping industry and to the industry that the Tasmanian government has been trying to foster but cannot find an investor in, which is to cut down native forests and put them into forest furnaces and send that energy as so-called renewable energy to Melbourne so that unsuspecting Melbournites will be having native forest burnt to supply them with so-called green energy. I will be very brief about this, but it needs to be said again that this year 150,000 log trucks under the regional forest agreement signed by Prime Minister Howard with Premier Bacon's assent will go to the woodchip mills in Tasmania taking native forest timbers, ecosystems and the living places for wildlife to destruction. The forestry minister says that the intention is to totally remove 20 per cent of remaining native forest cover in Tasmania in the coming years—that is, if you do not count the selective logging and so on. We have less than half of what we had, but the intention is to destroy 20 per cent under a scheme which we are now being asked to subsidise through the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, and that is totally outrageous.
At the same time Gunns, the biggest export woodchip company in the world for hardwood, is announcing record profits. This corporation is squeezing the Tasmanian contractors—the people who do have the trucks and the machinery—for every last cent; it is wringing every last drop out of them. Those people are put over the rack by this big corporation, with former Premier Robin Gray and Mr Gay and others on the board who are getting hundreds of thousands of dollars as their annual subsidy.
What we are going to do here is simply put more money on their table out of the taxpayer's pocket. This money should be going to the environment, to education, to hospitals—to a whole range of public purposes. Instead of that, it is going to help wreck the environment. There is no way the Greens would support that. This is a very important amendment as far as we are concerned: the woodchip industry should not be subsidised through this legislation. Notwithstanding our opposition to the bill as a whole, this amendment is a very important one to take that nefarious component out of the bill.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—Labor supports continuity of eligibility between the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Energy Grants Credits Scheme. This amendment will interrupt that continuity by redefining the meaning of `native forest', `native vegetation' and `forest' under the bill. Native forest is currently being harvested in the terms defined under the regional forest agreements, and Labor supports the regional forest agreement legislation. We will be opposing this amendment.
I point out that, although Senator Brown refers to Gunns squeezing contractors, in fact his amendment would further squeeze contractors by denying them access to the rebate for diesel fuel that they use, so there is a bit of an inconsistency in the position that he announces where he seeks to differentiate between the contractors and a company such as Gunns. I am a little confused because, in some debates, Senator Brown and his colleagues in the Tasmanian Greens suggest that Gunns is not as financially strong as it should be, but in this debate Senator Brown is suggesting that they are so strong that perhaps all we are doing is building them up even further with grants available under this legislation. Labor does not believe that there should be a break in the continuity. We believe that there should be a transition between the areas of coverage of the current legislation and the legislation that will be made if this bill is passed. As I said, we will be opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—The government will oppose the amendment for similar reasons to those enunciated by the Labor Party opposition spokesman, Senator O'Brien. The government has given commitments about maintaining what Senator O'Brien calls continuity. I was partly distracted during Senator O'Brien's contribution, but I think he was referring to the fact that contractors would generally do this sort of cartage. I know in my own state of Western Australia that would be the case, and I know that Senator Brown's amendment aims to maintain the grants for plantation based timber but not for timber taken from native forests, even though certainly the taking of the timber from the native forests in my own state—and I presume in Tasmania—would be done under a strictly controlled process, the subject of a range of environmental protection measures. I think from an implementation point of view—and I do not think Senator Brown would probably care too much about this—you could potentially have a contractor carting some logs from a native forest block legally, under a contract, to a timber mill in the morning and then, that very afternoon, using the same tank of diesel, carting some logs from a plantation forest operation on the same day. There would be ways of trying to figure out and apportion the difference between native and plantation.
—I guess it would be easier, Senator Brown, if you got rid of all native vegetation harvesting—that would make it easier from your point of view—but I do not think anyone would agree with that. There are compliance costs and difficulties, which I am sure the Greens do not really mind, but the main point is that the government has made commitments about continuity, and we will be sticking by them.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—I reiterate that we would remove the diesel fuel rebate altogether if it was put to us, and we would put that money into the environment, education, hospitals and so on. We are talking about $2.8 billion here. As far as Senator O'Brien's defence of Gunns goes, the logging contractors in Tasmania know where they are; they are squeezed. It is just nonsense. He says, `Not giving them this subsidy is going to put them into a bigger squeeze.' What rubbish!
The Bacon government, his friends in Tasmania, repeatedly refused to enact in any way protection for those forest workers or even a stipulation that written contractual arrangements must be made to guarantee their viability. Gunns rules the roost down there. When Gunns says to forestry minister Lennon, `Jump,' he says, `How high?' He is a complete lackey of this big corporation. Besides his numerous dinners with Mr Gay, he repeatedly turns his back on the Tasmanian people and these contractors in the bush. I have never seen him step off a kerb anywhere in defence of their rights—not once.
 (Senator McLucas)—Senator Brown, I request you to withdraw those comments. I think you are referring to a minister of the Tasmanian government.
—I would ask you which comment, Temporary Chair. I would need to be acquainted with which one.
—The term `lackey' I think is unparliamentary.
—I take back `lackey'. He is completely compliant with the wishes of Gunns in Tasmania and when asked to jump he says, `How high?' His performance there is a total disgrace. I think the word `lackey' is not appropriate because it cannot put into the negative the character of that minister. That being said, this is a regressive bonus to industries like this and it is doubly regressive in this case to the environment, and that is why the Greens have put the amendment forward.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 2884:
(1)	Page 31 (after line 12), after clause 37, insert:
37A  Non-entitlement
		Despite the other provisions of this Part, use in marine transport does not include use for a purpose in a vessel in marine transport where a vessel is operating under a single or continuing voyage permit.
The open application of this significant benefit for the operators of foreign vessels operating under single and continuing voyage permits is a major issue for the opposition. This benefit adds to the existing high level of advantage given to foreign operators with the permit system. The opposition has been asking about how these bills apply to these vessels, and we finally got a few answers. It is now clear that some benefit accrues, and Labor opposes this.
Advice from the Treasurer's office is that overseas vessels operating on the Australian coastal trade on single voyage or continuing voyage permits are able to claim a rebate under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme for fuel they purchase in Australia or import into Australia. We are also advised by the Treasurer's office that overseas vessels entering into Australia to commence coastal voyages are required to pay import duty on any fuel on board the ship on arrival. Overseas vessels operating on the Australian coastal trade are not allowed to purchase duty free fuels. Importantly, the advice from the Treasurer also confirms that the ship owner-operator can apply for a rebate under the marine transport category of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme for any fuel that has been imported or purchased duty paid and that the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme will maintain this entitlement.
This is another example of the Howard government propping up foreign operators in unfair competition against Australian shipping and their workers. The permit provisions were placed in the Air Navigation Act under Labor. They were designed to be used in extreme circumstances for domestic coastal trips when an Australian licensed vessel was not available. Labor did not issue a single continuing voyage permit; the Howard government issued 123 in the year 2000. These permits allow foreign vessels to operate for periods of six months in our domestic trade and they can be extended. There are examples where these vessels have operated for periods of over two years. In the year 1996-97, almost four million tonnes of freight was carried under these permits. But starkly, in the year 2000-01, that figure has risen to almost 10 million tonnes. Foreign vessels are operating under these permits and are competing directly against Australian company shipping, road and rail operators with big advantages. They are not required to apply Australian award wages and conditions. These foreign companies are not required to pay the same tax. And now we learn that, whilst they get those benefits, they are exempted from the obligations that apply to the Australian coastal trade vessels, and they are eligible for the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme rebate.
These vessels are being given these concessions and amongst them are flag of convenience vessels which pose significant risk to our marine environment. The opposition is yet to hear a credible argument in the face of this evidence as to why the Australian taxpayer should give these operators an excise holiday. That is what is proposed under these bills. That is what the opposition objects to, and the force of the opposition amendment is to remove that benefit. We do believe in a fair go and fair competition, but the Australian transport operators continue to be disadvantaged by the Howard government with respect to the liberty and access given by this government to foreign operators in the domestic transport market. They are not obliged to observe other Australian laws, particularly with regard to wages or tax, yet in this regard they are to be given the benefit of legislation which would effectively not require them to pay part of the duty on the diesel fuel that they use. The Howard government has continued to exploit every law to advantage foreign ship operators alone in the name of cheaper shipping costs, which is not in the public interest. It is a pity that the government has not directed more effort towards dealing with critical issues. They could, for instance, focus on policies to ensure cleaner fuel and working to implement commitments they have given instead of looking for ways to let foreign shipping operators undercut Australian shipping, road and rail operators.
I advise senators that Senator Ian Macdonald, I think at estimates, reminded the committee that we were now seeing that the cost of freight shipped on single or continuing voyage permits was cheaper by sea than it was by rail from Western Australia to the eastern seaboard. In other words, the fact that these vessels operate with the advantages of not having to pay Australian tax or wages allows them to compete unfairly with Australian operators in the rail or trucking sectors. They are instead looking for ways to let foreign shipping operators undercut Australian shipping, road and rail operators in this uneven market and therefore taking Australian jobs as well as risking our marine environment, particularly in the case of the operation of flag of convenience vessels.
So the opposition believe it is inequitable that this rebate be available to vessels operating on the Australian coast under single or continuing voyage permits. We believe this amendment will return some equity to the situation—not a lot, just a little. The fact of the matter is that the rebate is clearly a disadvantage to Australian registered vessels—and, to the extent that the Australian shipping fleet is getting older, there is no incentive for Australian companies to invest in vessels to ply the Australian coastal trade when their markets are being taken by vessels that, effectively, are subsidised by the Australian taxpayer and by Australian workers.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—We will be opposing this amendment. I think some of the underlying reasons Senator O'Brien explained for the ALP moving this amendment are in stark contrast to the position he took in relation to the Greens' amendment which he voted against in the last division. One of the key arguments he put forward was that we maintain continuity by continuing the features of the old administration into the new legislation. We are talking about a package of measures that does seek to improve environmental outcomes—even though they are not improvements to the extent that Senator Brown and some others would want. I missed where the figure that Senator O'Brien gave of four million tonnes came from; obviously it was a previous year.
—It was four million tonnes in 1996-97.
—So in 1996-97 there was four million tonnes of materials carried around the Australian coast under the previous government's regime. That has built up to 10 million tonnes for the latest year.
—That figure is for 2000-01.
—Yes, it is 10 million tonnes for 2000-01. So there has been significant growth. I think it is fair to say there has been significant growth in trade in that period anyway; the economy has grown. I have only been briefed in the scantiest detail by my officials tonight, but I am told that about 80 per cent of the coastal trade is owned and operated by Australians and that the proportion of the marketplace we are talking about here is about 20 per cent. I am told that, in terms of the transport sector, Australian owned shipping operators are up to a very high capacity utilisation; clearly they are very busy. The figures Senator O'Brien gave us show that coastal trade is improving. I think that is a fantastic thing. It has always struck me that Australia is a maritime nation with ports around its borders and that it should be doing what it can to ensure that the transport of as many goods as possible takes place across the oceans. It strikes me as a incredibly efficient way to move very large amounts of goods in terms of both cost and the movement of goods across large distances, and it is environmentally advantageous.
Clearly it is desirable for Australia to develop a solid Australian owned and operated domestic shipping fleet—and you have to put in place measures across a range of portfolios to do that—and having an efficient waterfront is a crucial part of that. I do not want to reopen a very heated debate, but, from an economic point of view, being able to move goods across the wharf, get goods to the wharf through efficient rail systems and ensure that you can move goods on and off ships efficiently and cost effectively is a crucial part of that. Having efficient, modern ships crewed by talented people—good seafarers who are properly remunerated—is also a crucial part of that. Having foreign ships in your coastal waterways is also quite important. There are many ships which travel around the Australian coast, and to put in place measures that could ultimately have the effect of shifting 10 million tonnes off these ships and onto the roads would be an environmental disaster.
It seems to me that Labor are seeking to use this legislation, which seeks to maintain the status quo. If a foreign ship comes into an Australia port to refuel and then heads back across the seas to another land, it pays no tax. Contrary to Senator O'Brien's assertion that they do not pay tax, they do in fact pay tax. They have to pay all taxes when in Australia. The normal legislative requirement, which was in place under the previous Labor administration, is that they get that rebated if the ship is used for a coastal voyage and they do not pay it in the first place if the fuel is put on for an international voyage. So we are maintaining the status quo here. With this amendment, the Labor Party are seeking to run, I guess, a quite legitimate industrial relations agenda through the tax system. We know that the Maritime Union would prefer to have only Australian owned and operated ships on the coast; they would prefer not to have foreign ships on the coast.
—Wouldn't you?
—I have already said, Senator O'Brien, that I would prefer to have a stronger and a bigger Australian fleet, but I do not think you would do that with this sort of fairly obtuse measure. I am sure that a number of people in the trade union movement would say, `Well done, comrade. Good try.' But you need to look at the other effects of it. The other effects will be an increase in the freight costs around the coast. I come from Western Australia and I think Senator Macdonald made a good point. He said that more and more freight is going to Western Australia from the east using ships. That is a good thing for the environment. It is a good thing for West Australians. We already pay a premium for our cornflakes, for our beer and for anything we buy from the Eastern States. It costs West Australians more to buy all of the things that people in the Eastern States take for granted because you have to move virtually all of the grocery items and all of the important things in life—like beer and those sorts of things—across the Nullarbor for many thousands of miles.
—Don't you make beer in Western Australia?
—We make lots of wonderful things, Senator Brown, as you know. We make wonderful beer, too, but some West Australians like drinking James Boags and other beers from your part of the country. That is the wonderful thing about trade: you do not always have to drink Swan Lager or Emu Bitter; you can drink James Boags or other Tasmanian brews—and even Tasmanian champagne if you are celebrating something. That is an important thing. Clearly, I would have thought, Tasmanians have an interest as well. This will have the effect of increasing the cost of moving freight around Australia. It will have the effect of shifting freight back onto Australian roads and pumping more diesel fumes and more pollutants throughout the mainland road network. So I think it is a perverse measure. I can see the motivation behind it, but I do not think this is the way to solve the issues that the Labor Party sees in relation to foreign ships on the Australian coast. We will oppose it for those reasons.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—I have been influenced by what Senator O'Brien has had to say, for the second time tonight. It would help to sort it out for me if Senator Ian Campbell could tell us that Senator O'Brien is wrong—that the wages and the conditions on these foreign owned ships are the same as on Australian owned ships, by law.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I do not have that information at hand. I am happy to accept Senator O'Brien's word that the conditions are not the same. I accept that that is the case. But I put it to the Senate that, if you want to address the issues of wages and conditions on foreign flagged vessels on the Australian coast, a fuel taxation measure is not the way to solve that particular problem. The direct result of this will not change the wages and the conditions of seamen on foreign owned vessels. What it will do will be to put up the cost of cornflakes to people in the suburbs of Australia and to ensure ultimately that there are more diesel fumes around the suburbs of Australia. It is far more efficient to shift goods around the coast on a ship. If you put this impost onto the cost of that shipping, you will undoubtedly put the cost of transport up and you will increase diesel fuel emissions. So it is entirely against the objectives of the bill and it is entirely detrimental to the environment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—Senator O'Brien wins in this case. If we cannot legislate to ensure that people are paid fairly—the same pay for the same work—in this country then those who do not pay should not get the subsidies. That is pretty clear. On the matter of shipping, I was speaking with Mr Laurie Goldsworthy, who is of international stature, in looking at this. Let us not forget that the diesel burnt in ships produces photochemical smog—a big contributor in the Northern Hemisphere, in particular—so it is not free of environmental costs. I was not being altogether trite when I suggested that Senator Campbell drink Swan, because we ought to be very aware—particularly with bottled goods and heavy goods that are moved around the country—that there is a big environmental impost on that. I think the best time to drink Boags is when you are in Launceston.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—The Senate should know—I do not have the figures with me, but I am happy to supply them at a later date because it would be very interesting if the Greens were to vote for such a measure—that there is no doubt that you can carry significantly larger amounts and heavier weights of goods on board a ship far more efficiently, in terms of the fuel that will be used to move that, over longer distances. So the reality of this measure is that the Greens are really indicating that they are much happier to see diesel burnt at a much greater rate per kilojoule of energy to move a certain good across the roads. That is what they are really saying. 
There is no doubt that a ship will burn fuel and will create emissions—no doubt about it—unless you reach the nirvana that I aspire to, Senator Brown, and move these vessels back to using sails. In the good old days, sailing ships used to shift all of the hard goods, which is of course my chosen way of transport. I spend most of my time across the sea with my sails up, getting transported by the wind. It is not free either, I might tell you—you have to pay for the sails, the masts and everything else. The fact is that transport across the sea uses a lot less energy and therefore creates a lot less emissions per tonne of cargo than carrying that cargo across the highway. So the effect of this will be to increase the amount of emissions into the atmosphere, and it will be an interesting vote to see how the Greens go on this.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—I will say first of all that it is good to hear the minister extolling the virtues of fuel efficient transport and shifting transport off road but, of course, this bill does not do anything to further that objective. My question, before determining whether this has our support, is: what exactly does this mean? Are we talking about enormous quantities of diesel? What are the revenue implications? Is there some estimation of the percentage of transport which would shift to road? The minister seems convinced that there would be a lot, presumably. Can we quantify that? Can we have some idea of what it is we are debating?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I do not have those figures at hand. It is a Labor amendment and I am not quite sure how long we have had it. To get a revenue impact on it, you would have to look at the impact on foreign ships. They may well, as I have indicated, just put their prices up to cover the loss of the rebate, which would transfer to the packet of cornflakes I was talking about. It may well see significant amounts of freight shift to the roads. I think it would be quite a complicated thing to model.
In terms of the amount of the rebate that goes to various industries—I am quoting from Mr Colmer, who was in Senate estimates on 18 March answering questions from Senator Conroy; I do not see the question but apparently this is the break-up of which industry gets the benefit of the rebate for 2000-01—it says here that mining gets 48.3 per cent, which will make Senator Brown happy; agriculture gets 28.8 per cent, which will make Senator Boswell happy; rail gets 9.3 per cent, which will make Tim Fischer happy; fishing gets 5 per cent; marine gets 3.8 per cent, which is the figure I think Senator Allison was looking for; and forestry gets 2.7 per cent. The rest get about 0.7 per cent—that is, residential, hospitals, nursing homes, aged care homes et cetera.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,—Perhaps it then comes to the ALP to give us some sort of grasp of what percentage of that 3.8 per cent is likely to be in this category of overseas ships. It is my understanding that there are few vessels that are Australian owned these days. It is interesting that the Labor Party should be so keen to see Australian ownership when they sold the ANL—but that is another story. Can there be some indication given of whether we are talking about a very small number of voyages or whether this is most of them—just some sort of grasp of the extent of the issue?,SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—We have requested more detailed information from the government. As you would appreciate, the opposition is not in a position to gather that information itself. To date, that information in precise terms has not been supplied. There are a couple of points that one should make here. If our amendment is carried, then there will be less rebate applied to the maritime sector—that is, they will not get the rebate and, therefore, the effect on the budget will be a positive not a negative. In terms of the measure, we are providing the government with money to spend as is appropriate. In terms of the effect on the trade, that might ultimately be neutral if there were measures put in place—and they have not been put in place by this government, notwithstanding what Senator Campbell says—because the Australian fleet is ageing.
Many operators are coming to a point where they will need to make critical decisions about investment, yet more and more of the Australian cargo available to be shipped is being carried by vessels flagged overseas. In some cases, Australian vessels purchased by overseas companies have had the Australian crew dismissed and a foreign crew engaged, and trade has carried on under continuing voyage permits by a now foreign flagged vessel—that is, the vessel that was previously Australian flagged is now foreign flagged. That vessel may now be carrying a Ukrainian crew. I do not want to single out that country for any particular purpose, but there is a circumstance in which a Ukrainian crew has replaced an Australian crew at lower wages.
What we would say is: they should not get the benefit of the positives of the Australian legislative package when they do not take the other parts of it. They do not pay the same company tax and they do not pay Australian wages and conditions under our award system. The question we pose is: why should they get both advantages? They are exempted from the requirements of other laws which, one might argue, would impose a burden upon them, but in this case they would be given the benefit of an Australian law which gave them cheaper fuel. We say, in terms of a budgetary cost and in terms of equity, that there are no grounds on which to reject our amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I would like to make the point—because Senator Allison asked the question of Senator O'Brien and it was not answered even though I had referred to it earlier—that 80 per cent of coastal trade is under Australian owned, flagged and operated vessels and roughly 20 per cent is foreign vessels. I also make the point that if you wanted to apply the logic that Senator O'Brien is asking us to apply to shipping you would say to a foreign airline that was operating in Australia, let us say Garuda Airlines, that while they are flying in Australia they should apply Australian wages and conditions to all of their staff.
—They don't fly domestically.
—They fly across Australia; they fly Australians to Jakarta. It is the same difference. Using tax measures to change other countries' industrial relations practices is a bizarre thing. The bottom line is that this measure will see transport shifted back onto the road. That is what Senator O'Brien wants to do. He seems to think that shifting stuff to Western Australia on ships is a bad thing. The reality is that you could well, as a result of this measure, see far more diesel used up on the road transporting stuff that was otherwise transported by ship and that you could in fact end up paying out more by way of rebates. We will not know until it happens but let us hope that it does not, because it is such a silly idea.

The reason I ask that the amendments be moved together is that they are complementary. One deals with on-road use and one deals with off-road use. These are perhaps some of the most important amendments that we are dealing with in the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003 tonight. They ensure that we are not giving any taxpayer funded credits to in any way destroy marine migratory species, other habitats or, indeed, anything that is on the register of critical habitats or threatened ecosystems. 
There have been incidents in the past where damage has occurred. For instance, on one island—it might have been Groote Eylandt—a company lost 10 million litres of leaked diesel fuel. The government at the time could never quite answer the question whether or not the company had got some $3 million of taxpayer subsidies under the precursor to this legislation—the scheme we are replacing—the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. Basically, we suspect that the company did get that $3 million for effectively polluting the marine area. Unfortunately, farmers have been caught clearing areas of the national estate, particularly in national parks. Logging, for example, goes on surreptitiously in national parks. If caught, people will not only find that they are subjected to all the usual fines and prosecutions but also be made to repay any rebate that they have.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—Let me be clear about how it works.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—Can the minister indicate how many actions which capture, destroy or whatever listed threatened species that have not been the subject of the EPBC Act have involved the use of diesel thus far?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—We do not have a detailed answer to that. In principle, this is a measure that Senator Lees, to her credit, has brought forward that reinforces the objects of the act. It makes it quite clear that the government is not going to be part of subsidising fuel for actions that are in contravention of Australia's environmental laws. Quite frankly, Senator Lees is to be commended on taking the initiative in improving this bill in this way. I commend her and her staff on approaching this legislation in a very constructive way and seeking to find ways within the government's policy objectives for this bill to be improved. The words of the amendments speak for themselves. The government thinks that they enhance the bill and is happy to accept them.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—These amendments prohibit granting an entitlement for both off- and on-road activities that are regulated under the EPBC Act and impact on listed threatened species and listed threatened ecological communities. That includes taking, capturing or destroying any listed species and communities, listed migratory species, listed marine species, habitats on the register of critical habitats and critical habitats identified in all recovery plans. I must say that that is entirely consistent with the existing regulatory regime. However, the fact that Senator Lees feels that these amendments are necessary indicates that she is not confident that the EPBC Act is protecting the species and habitats that it is designed to protect.
Labor will support these amendments, but we note that the EPBC Act is failing to protect the environment at the same time as it is administratively complex and cumbersome for those it regulates. We are not offended by the amendments, but we think that they indicate that the great EPBC package that the Democrats supported when Senator Lees was with them obviously is not all that it was purported to be when we passed that legislation here on a Saturday, spending about 10 seconds on average per amendment that went through when the bill went through. So I suppose bad process gives you bad legislation. Senator Lees obviously feels that there is some want in that legislation which requires these amendments. We will support her and accept that omission.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—Certainly, these amendments are not because of any failing of the EPBC Act whatsoever. Indeed, I stand by that act as one of the most effective pieces of environment legislation anywhere in the world. We have seen already a number of people taken all the way through to the Federal Court processes, which would never have happened under the previous various pieces of environment legislation which were rolled together to create this act. We have found that people have been locked up already under this act, which would certainly never have happened under Australia's previously existing environment legislation. The amendments are absolutely no reflection on this act whatsoever. They simply say that, when people are caught under this act, why should they continue to receive what is effectively a tax subsidy? Why should they not have another level of penalty besides whatever else is going to happen to them under this act? In the example I gave earlier, the amount of subsidy in question was some $3 million. Surely this chamber should be very keen to get that back if someone is caught damaging the environment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—We have already heard Senator Lees talk about when someone is caught. We presume from that that they have breached the EPBC Act. But amendment (R8) says that the activity requires approval, not that someone has been caught breaching the act. That is why I ask what the process is. It is perfectly obvious that if somebody has been found guilty of breaching the act you would also want to throw the full weight of the law at them, including taking off their rebate. But for those for whom the activity actually requires approval, would this not broaden the scope of activities? At what point would a determination be made in terms of the activity requiring approval? Who determines that an activity requires an approval? At what point do you say, `This activity doesn't get the rebate or the credit'?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I think Senator Allison has not understood the wording of the new clause that Senator Lees seeks to insert into the legislation. It is quite clear that either you are in breach of the EPBC Act or you are not. I think it has been worded quite clearly and quite sensibly. Clearly, if you have an approval under the EPBC Act then it is not a breach of the law. If it is a breach of the EPBC Act then you do not get the grant. I think we are beginning to saw sawdust here.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—That is not what amendment (R8) says. It simply says that the activity requires approval; it does not say that there has been a breach. It does not say that it has not been given approval; it just says that it requires approval. Minister, I am not sure we can be confident of this amendment if you do not know how it is going to work either. All I am asking is what the process is. Is it the tax office that pursues such activities? How is this progressed?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—Perhaps I can assist by reading what is, I think, for Senator Allison the unclear part of amendment (R8). Paragraph (2) goes on to state:
Note 1:	Division 3 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 make it an offence to take action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on a listed matter of national environmental significance unless an approval is obtained under that Act.
That is the act we are referring to—the EPBC Act. I think it is perfectly clear that, if someone is found to be in breach of this act, all these penalties apply. All that we are saying in these amendments is that there should be an additional penalty, in that, if they have obtained any rebate for the fuel used in the committing of that particular illegal action against the environment, they should not continue to get the rebate. Surely, in the trawling industry, if someone catches a dugong or perhaps some other endangered species—
—Or in the mining industry.
—then they will have to forfeit the diesel fuel that can be reasonably shown to have been used for that purpose. Yes, the same thing may happen to a mining company that rolls out the bulldozers straight through some heritage listed patches of protected vegetation. Vegetation in the eastern Mount Lofty Ranges is now protected under the EPBC Act because of endangered species, particularly the emu wren. Anyone who interfered with that in any way and was caught, if they had used any fuel that was subsidised, would have to pay back the subsidy.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—I am sorry to pursue this again, but shouldn't this then be reworded to say that the activity requires approval and approval was not sought, or something to suggest that this is not just pending—that this is an action which does not comply with the EPBC?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I am not sure whether Senator Allison is reading from a different sheet. I might just make sure that she is reading from sheet 2916 dated 24 June 2003 at 5.48 p.m.—that is at the bottom of the page. There has been a revised sheet; perhaps she does not have it. As to the amendment that is before the chair at the moment, the government is totally satisfied that it does what Senator Lees has explained it does on two occasions now. It is quite clear, and I think that even what Senator Allison is saying she wants to occur is covered by the amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—I am sorry, I did have an older sheet. I see that the wording has been changed to `apply unless an approval required under that division were in operation'. Thank you; that answers my question. There was another matter. Division 3 is referred to in note 1.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I do not have a copy of the EPBC with me; I usually carry it around most days. I thought that these things were called divisions in this act. The Clerk has told me that a part is part of a division, so division 3 may have some parts to it.
 (Senator Chapman)—I might be able to clarify that. A part is within a division, if that assists your query.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—Maybe that is something that can be taken on board to check. Also, in relation to note 2, why is it that there is only mention of exemptions in part 3 when there are, as I understand it, other exemptions—for example, the national interest in section 158—that are not in part 3? That presumably does not exclude those.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1) and (4) on sheet 2881:
(1)	Clause 4, page 6 (after line 29), after the definition of State or Territory authority, insert:
Sun Fund is the fund created when an energy grant for an off-road credit is used to generate renewable energy and improve energy efficiency.
(4)	Page 45 (after line 12), after Part 5, insert:
Part 5A—Sun Fund
57A Sun Fund credits
Basic rule
		If you are entitled to an off-road credit you may use all or part of the estimated credit to which you would otherwise be entitled for a period of up to ten years to generate renewable energy, including installing and maintaining renewable energy systems and installing and maintaining systems, equipment and appliances to improve energy efficiency.
57B Draft regulations
	(1)	The Minister must cause draft regulations to implement the Sun Fund to be released for public consultation no later than 1 September 2003.
	(2)	The Minister must cause regulations to implement the Sun Fund to come into effect no later than 1 March 2004.
This is the Sun Fund bill, which Labor blocked—Senator Kerry O'Brien will remember this—some years ago. It was and is a move for rural people to be given 10 years of their diesel fuel rebate upfront so that they can convert to renewable energy—solar power for energy efficiency—and other forms of energy on their stations, for example. A terrific environmental bonus is involved in it. It would have produced 50,000 jobs in the bush and would still do so. It would stimulate small businesses right throughout the regions.
It would certainly stimulate the photovoltaic industry, for example, in Australia through enhancing hot water delivery to the bush and for other power sources. Of course, you cannot apply it to your moving machinery just yet. But certainly there are other uses, and it was very much supported by the renewable energy industry in Australia. It is effectively revenue neutral. It is positive in every way you look at it. So here is an opportunity a few years down the line to see how important this move is. I again pay tribute to Margaret Blakers, who devised the legislation originally and is still a great promoter of renewable energy in Australia. I ask that the government and the opposition think again about their opposition and previous negative attitude to what is a pretty wonderful scheme—a win-win for everybody.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—I indicate support from the Democrats for this amendment. In fact, this was one of the ideas that were put in our discussion paper for the energy credit scheme two years ago. I think there is great scope for farmers in particular but also mining companies to bring forward those credits and allow that money to fund a small wind turbine or solar energy and in some way displace some diesel from current use, which is often for pumping water from a dam or other purposes. I think a lot of work has to be done to put in place such a scheme, but it was always disappointing to us that the government did not take up this idea and talk about it with those sectors that could benefit from it.
It makes a lot of sense to me because so many of the users of the diesel rebate are locked in—they are disinclined to change fuels or to radically alter their consumption of diesel because they are tied to the rebate. If you were to free up some of this money, to bring it forward up front, as I said, then I imagine there would be a number of circumstances where using diesel could be displaced by generating renewable energy. There is just not the leadership on the part of the government to follow this through, either with the mining sector or with agriculture, where there is the greatest scope for the use of renewables. So we will support the amendment. Clearly if it does not have the support of the opposition it is not going to get up; but, in terms of sending a message, we want to join the Greens in supporting this idea.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-24,"—This amendment appears to be intended to assist in the generation of power from renewable sources instead of diesel in those areas of Australia not serviced by the main grid, for example. We are not of the view that this is an appropriate use of this scheme, especially in light of the fact that through the Australian Greenhouse Office, as I understand, there is currently up to $264 million available for its Renewable Remote Power Generation Program. Labor do support renewable energy. Labor moved to increase the mandated renewable energy target to five per cent by the year 2010, an amendment voted down in the other place by the Howard government. But, given that Renewable Remote Power Generation Program funds appear to be underspent for want of suitable projects, we are not convinced that this measure in relation to an Energy Grants Credit Scheme will drive a renewable energy solution or further use.
We think that perhaps there has been a failing of the government in terms of seeking to drive the expenditure of moneys available under that program. I know that there are substantial examples of the use of solar power in regional Australia just for the purpose that Senator Allison referred to—solar pumps. There is certainly a lot of solar use in heating water. I visited a property on Flinders Island where the entire property was powered by solar or wind power—there was no diesel generation at all. That was the sort of model I would have thought this government would have been using to promote the ideas of replacing nonrenewables with renewables in a way that would benefit remote communities and properties. An opportunity is there. Perhaps the government will decide that there is a way to find projects that are suitable for this money, or there may be ways in which the money can be made more attractive.
In relation to amending the legislation to effectively adopt the Sun Fund scheme, I am certainly not in a position to block legislation, Senator Brown. I think you are recalling a Senate committee report, which I was a signatory to, on the proposed Sun Fund Bill where, on behalf of the opposition, I indicated that the opposition would not support that legislation. I guess if that is blocking it that is blocking it, but I did not think that was quite what it meant. In essence, we will not support this amendment. We think there are better measures available.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-06-24,"—I will be brief. The government will not be supporting it. It would be the creation of a new category within this scheme. But I can say that the government does budget significant amounts for alternative energy sources, particularly in regional and remote areas. I am aware, just anecdotally, of announcements of funding of projects around Australia coming from the fund that Senator O'Brien referred to.
I am also aware that he is quite right— there is money in that account. I have not been briefed on it lately but I know that the government is interested in proposals and that a number of proposals have been put up and have failed to comply with the various requirements. I think that is probably because the government has been quite diligent in ensuring that they do achieve the outcomes of the program. The government is not going to be involved in just anything. I do recall a strong effort from Western Australians to see some of that money going to the Derby tidal power project, and that was a significant investment in a long-term alternative energy source which would have replaced carbon fuel energy in the north-west of Australia to a significant degree. But that was opposed by the Labor government of Western Australia and in fact by the Australian Democrats. The mind boggles.
—It was supported by Wilson at least.
—Yes. I think the project had enormous potential, but that has been killed. Senator O'Brien is right—the government has allocated over a quarter of a billion dollars. It is a significant amount. We would like to see that going into viable renewable energy projects around Australia.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-06-24,"—I might say that the Derby tidal power scheme is not viable. Under any measure of viability, almost every other renewable energy project stacks up against the Derby power scheme, which is why it is having such trouble getting off the ground. Of course, it would be typical of the government to put its support behind a project which is sure to be very environmentally damaging. I think that is a great shame. It would be nice to think that we could provide investment funding for wind farms and for solar energy that does not have the sort of footprint—or boot print—that you would describe the Derby power scheme as having. I really welcome the cost benefit analysis that might be put on the table sometime about this scheme, but all of the figuring I have seen so far shows it to be very costly and very doubtful in terms of its long-term sustainability. Again, I say it is a great pity that at the only time we ever talk about renewable energy in this place the government trots out the Derby tidal power scheme even though it would do as much damage as it would and is probably 100th in terms of viable kinds of projects for renewable energy.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-24,"—I add my support to Senator Brown's amendment. I realise that there have been some criticisms and some suggestions of potential rorting of schemes if people are given 10 years payment up front, but I think we can overcome those. We must move faster in the direction of renewables. One of the issues in South Australia as we try and get more wind turbines up and running is the transmission issue. It is important that we encourage farmers, in particular, to put a turbine on their properties. It is a viable proposition already but with some additional support we could have quite a lot of individual systems providing power to the individual farm and running everything the farm needs and then feeding into the grid, particularly off-peak at night. I commend this amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-24,"—What an extraordinary contribution from the Labor Party. Senator O'Brien says that he went to Flinders Island and he saw this house and property that was totally powered by alternative energy. It was just great, but here is a scheme that would promote that to other properties and we are going to oppose it. It is just this old guard, last century failure by the opposition. It should be tackling the government with positive options on the environment, and here it is failing totally. It is a real sell-out of the Labor electorate and the aspirations of people out there and the wish to see opposition being positive. It is an entrenched, negative and losing strategy for Crean Labor that has been expressed by Senator O'Brien here tonight.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2003-06-24,"—I realise that we may be taking a few people by surprise, but I think there are about two minutes left for me to conclude my remarks. I simply say that this bill remains as important as ever. It is one that provides an opportunity to introduce some real flexibility into what should be a dynamic sector of the economy. If you look at what is happening in other countries, they very much understand this imperative. We have been saddled with laws that have been in place now for far too long. We want to move out of the information stone age and into the 21st century and to do it in such a way that media organisations have the opportunity to grow and expand and not simply focus on cost-cutting, as many of them are doing at the present time.
It is important to understand that the beneficiaries of this legislation are virtually every media organisation in the country. In other words, far from it being simply a matter of interest to some of the larger players, it is in fact of very significant interest to small and medium sized players who all see the opportunities that it could well open up for them. It gives them new horizons and new opportunities. That is really what diversity of opinion should be all about. If we can relax foreign ownership laws at the same time then clearly there is an opportunity there for new players to emerge and to introduce the competition that many people would say has been lacking for far too long. If that is the case, I hope that when the Senate does come to consider the committee stage amendments senators will be conscious of the need to ensure that we do not end up with unacceptable proposals that would simply mean that we were not able to progress this very important issue. I think it is an opportunity for all in the Senate—particularly the Labor Party, who, as we know, prior to the last election were in favour—to actually get serious this time around and focus on what is important in terms of the media sector and not just on what short-term political advantage might deliver.
Question put.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-06-24,"—I rise tonight to address an issue I have spoken to before in this place, and that issue concerns administrative review in the veterans' and ex-servicepeople jurisdictions. The Senate will be aware that last Thursday, on my motion, the Senate agreed to refer this matter to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee with particular terms of reference. Tonight I wish to speak to that reference briefly and to clarify its purpose and motive in so doing.
Essentially, there are two issues in this quite complex matter. The first concerns the existing system of review in the veterans' jurisdiction, which in itself is in need of special examination simply because of its inefficiency, its cost and the outcomes in terms of veterans' access to their entitlements. The second concerns the existing process of review for serving ADF and ex-servicepeople without veterans' entitlements, which is in a complete and questionable contrast to that available to veterans. It is also questionable whether, in the event of a new single compensation scheme being introduced, as is proposed by the government, the continuation of such duality is practicable.
It seems to me that, in the event we are going to be looking into the detail of a new military compensation scheme which seeks to establish the best of both current systems, the opportunity ought to be taken to do it thoroughly. No doubt when the new scheme is revealed in draft, as I understand it will be later this week, this issue will come out as an area of significant controversy. Given its complexity, however, and given that it also raises the adequacy of the existing system for veterans whose interests might well be grandfathered, I believe it requires separate examination. The outcomes of this inquiry can therefore be dovetailed into the larger review, in due course, in the inevitable event that it, too, will be referred to a Senate committee.
So, in essence, we are looking at the strengths and weaknesses of the current system and at a preferred model for the future. The outcomes might be applied to the present, depending on the views of veterans and the whim of the government, and they could also just be applied to the future. Having said that, I want to say to veterans and ex-servicepeople that the shortcomings of the current system are well understood, though the solutions we are grasping for may not be. This inquiry is very much in their interests, but I want to assure them that the key principles are sacrosanct, in my view, at this stage.
For example, I am aware of the huge importance placed by veterans on the separateness and independence of the Veterans Review Board. The principle on which the VRB was established, that military compensation is a unique benefit resulting from unique service to the nation, is not in question and nor is the non-adversarial nature of its processes or the formula by which its members are chosen, reflecting an ever-present familiarity with service life and experience.
What is in question, however, is the process by which review is conducted. That process is conducted as follows: firstly, at the internal review stage within the Department of Veterans' Affairs; secondly, in the information gathering thereafter and prior to the VRB; thirdly, in the processes beyond the VRB where information is sought, yet again, to remedy earlier deficiencies which are seen to be the cause of failure; and, fourthly, the processes leading up to the AAT, including the issue of legal aid. From my discussions with many veterans and, in particular, their advocates—who do the most wonderful work for veterans—it is clear that, within this very drawn-out system, there is considerable room for improvement. In fact if I were to put their combined views in a nutshell, it could be said that the great bulk of worthy cases could be agreed at the primary claim stage if the claim had been properly prepared in the first place.
What we have, though, is a system where many claims are not adequately supported at the primary level with the necessary evidence and therefore must fail. What flows thereon is a litigious process to find the evidence—a process not often completed until the AAT stage, where legal aid becomes available which buys the legal skill and knowledge and which quickly finds the missing evidential link. It has been said to me that this in itself is an incentive for applicants to run dead through the early stages as a technique of getting legal aid. If this is the case, there is something very wrong with the system indeed.
By contrast, serving ADF members and ex-members have none of this. As I understand it, these people have internal review followed only by access to the AAT—for which they must show cause—no ability to adduce new evidence thereafter and, most importantly, no advocacy support apart from that which ex-service organisations can give them from their meagre resources. In many cases they must combat legal advocates hired by the government, including Queen's Counsel. It is, by all accounts, a most forbidding and unsympathetic process for people who, in essence, are no different to veterans in their ability to pursue their case.
I know that all of this is based on the premise that veterans have served overseas and hence attract what is termed as qualifying service, which in turn carries some valuable additional benefits. But the question being asked is whether those values, forged in the mud of the First World War and the horrors of successive conflicts, remain as relevant for the modern ADF and the nature of their service—that is, is this distinction still relevant or does it apply quite a serious discriminatory factor between peers? Those questions are perhaps matters of political judgment but, nevertheless, they need to be answered. It is also clear that, in looking at this issue of adequate evidence to support a claim, the capacity of the veteran and the ex-ADF person, in perhaps the most complex jurisdiction of all, to properly research their claim is often limited, even though the whole approach is one of assisting the self-represented applicant. This is effectively a fiction, though some obviously do succeed.
Also uniquely within this jurisdiction, advocacy support is provided by ex-service organisations, supported in part by government grants and with training. It is, however, very modest. Clearly, with some supplementation, it could improve the performance of the system enormously, especially by becoming involved in the primary claim. Perhaps savings made in reducing the volume of appeals by increased acceptance rates for better claims at the primary level might help. This form of aid is clearly set out in the terms of reference, as is legal aid, which is said by some to be the subject of continuing cutbacks, inadequate rates and poor understanding of the merits.
Finally, for the benefit of veterans and others who want to better understand the origins of this inquiry, I must also mention the critical nature of records, especially service records and health records. From what has been said to me, even if the best medical diagnosis is available, access to records is still a major problem, which of course can only be useful if they are complete. We also know that moves are afoot to combine records management with the DVA, which seems to be a good idea. But it must not be forgotten that they are Defence records, and the responsibility for their content rests there.
The continuing devolution of personnel matters from Defence to DVA must not allow the Department of Defence to reinforce its attitude to former members, which seems to be one of washing its hands. At least perhaps the service ethos of DVA will prove to be advantageous, as seems to be the case with other responsibilities which have similarly passed across, although I must say it does really beg the question of institutional arrangements which seem to unnecessarily cut right across the continuum of care for ex-service personnel, whether they are veterans or not. That briefly encapsulates some of the issues which go to the heart of the terms of reference.
May I remind veterans that the purpose of this inquiry is to try and get a better system for current veterans and ex-servicepeople, past and present. The struggles of past claims processes are known and understood, and I hope that it is also understood that improving the system is the motive here, not revolutionary change. We want to assist veterans and ex-servicepeople, not make it harder. But at the same time there are some fundamental questions to be asked. I simply reiterate that we have an opportunity now, with a new scheme on the drawing board, to get it right.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Veterans: Entitlements</title>,Adjournment,28,1
