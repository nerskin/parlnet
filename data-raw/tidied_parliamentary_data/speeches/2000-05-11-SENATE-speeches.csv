"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-05-11,"—This bill is simply an attempt to stifle discussion on the GST. It is simply about censorship. It is a crude attempt to intimidate and silence Australian businesses from speaking about the true effects of the GST. The less that can be said about the GST, the fewer the inequities, the fewer the inefficiencies, the fewer the government failures that will be revealed, the fewer the broken promises that will be exposed. On the face of it this bill is an attempt to strengthen the powers of the ACCC in ensuring that price exploitation does not happen. The bill seeks to amend the Trade Practices Act to insert into the GST price exploitation provisions a prohibition on misrepresentations as to the effect of the new tax system. But the effect of the bill is to silence critics of the GST, to put an end to the growing chorus that the government has failed to deliver the GST it promised. The GST the government has delivered is a complex and cumbersome tax, a tax which businesses are fighting to implement in time for 1 July, hoping it will not cause them to fall foul of the price exploitation provisions. 
In this bill the government has adopted a particularly heavy-handed and inept approach. This view is echoed in a submission by Pricewaterhouse Coopers on behalf of the Australian Industry Group to the Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into the provisions of this bill. The Australian Industry Group is one of Australia's largest industry associations, being the organisation formed from the merger of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia. I should declare for the public record that I was a former employee of the MTIA, just so that there is no suggestion that I am in any way influenced unduly by their views. The submission says:
The width and scope of the new provisions of the Bill relating to misleading and deceptive conduct and misrepresentations about the effect of the New Tax System raise serious concerns for industry organisations committed to assisting the business community in a proper and professional manner without risk of penalty or liability in an environment where the actions of the organisations are designed to help in a practical way, the transition to a new tax system.
The government is getting the implementation of the GST wrong, and now business is being told not to say so. But this is not surprising. As was revealed in the Senate inquiry into this bill, Professor Fels, the Chairman of the ACCC, revealed that the 10 per cent GST price cap has no legislative backing. Professor Fels admitted that there was nothing in the Trade Practices Act requiring that no price should increase by more than 10 per cent as a result of the new tax system changes. There is nothing to require 10 to mean 10 to mean 10. Further, despite the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation on 15 January 2000 saying he had directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10 per cent, Professor Fels said that the ACCC had received no such direction.
This matter has been taken up in the other place, and the minister again has sought to back away and hide from his press release. I understand that it was a very difficult time for Mr Hockey in that January period. He was struggling with how much a bottle of coke was going to cost. And if the government accepts the proposed amendments that we have later on, under the amended act that we hope to get through he himself would have been guilty of false and misleading provisions in his description of the price of a bottle of coke. He himself would have been guilty, if we are successful in this chamber today, of breaching his own law. That is the extent to which this government is prepared to go to silence legitimate discussion on this bill. They are prepared to silence genuine attempts at discussion so that nobody is allowed to mention that the GST is a dog's breakfast, that it is unravelling on them and that their purported attempts to misrepresent the outcomes of the GST will cause enormous grief in the broader community. But that is what this bill with these amendments is designed to stop the government getting away with.
The ACCC has received no such direction from either the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation or any other member of the government. Why has no such direction been issued? Why, you ask? Simply because it cannot be issued. Because if the government was fair dinkum in trying to convince the Australian community that 10 really was 10 really was 10, it could stand up today, move a further amendment to this bill and say that 10 really was 10. It is that simple.
The government could end this debate. They could get Allan Fels off the hook and they could give the emperor some clothes. They simply have to move an amendment in the chamber today that says, `10 is 10 is 10'. I invite the government, I invite Senator Campbell, to stand up and move an amendment that says, `10 is 10 is 10'. You can end the debate today. Here is your chance, and we will take this up with Senator Kemp later in the debate. 
This issue was poignantly pointed out in the submission by the Law Council of Australia, written by Professor Warren Pengilley. In fact Professor Pengilley poignantly pointed it out, just to assist the chamber. He said:
... the ACCC Guidelines say that no price increase more than 10 per cent. This conclusion resulted from an embarrassing public debate in which Minister Hockey eventually was forced, politically, to give this assurance. But it is not the law and the ACCC is misleading in its Guideline in saying that it is. If a corporation's increased tax, purchase and compliance costs exceed 10 per cent, there is no reason at all, as the writer sees it, why prices cannot increase to cover these.
In making the claim that 10 means 10 means 10 the government, if it were a corporation engaged in trade and commerce, would have breached the provisions of this bill. Further, the ACCC pricing guidelines state that where firms have dual pricing the ACCC would expect prominent notices to be displayed indicating that `under the New Tax System some prices may fall and some prices may rise but nothing may rise by more than 10 per cent'. That is right—the government will not intervene in this situation to stop the ACCC engaging in a political propaganda exercise on the government's behalf to mislead the Australian community and ordinary consumers about the effects of the ANTS package. This government is prepared to go so far in protecting its own political backside that it will assist the ACCC in engaging in false and misleading conduct. That is how far this government is prepared to go to ensure its own survival—to actively engage in false and misleading conduct.
This is no surprise, because we have seen the John and Wendy ads. We have seen how far the government have been prepared to go to deceive ordinary Australians by spending ordinary Australians' money to run a false and misleading advertising campaign. Unfortunately, the government seem to have withdrawn that ad. Maybe they have finally woken up to the fact that those ads were false and misleading, maybe they decided to cut their losses, but the damage has been done. This government have shown that they are prepared to do anything and spend any amount of Australian taxpayers' money to falsely mislead them about the effects of the ANTS package. As I have said, a corporation will be in breach of this bill if they display such a notice. The government are insisting on this type of notice and they would be found to be in breach of this bill if the laws applied to them and not just to trade and commerce.
As I said, Labor will be proposing an amendment to correct this anomaly. We will be moving an amendment that makes the government and its agencies subject to the same prohibitions and penalties against GST related misleading and deceptive conduct as this bill seeks to apply against business. The key point is: if you are correct in what you are saying—that is, that you are not falsely misleading people—you can support this provision; there is nothing to be afraid of from the perspective of the government and the ACCC in this provision. Surely the government should not be falsely misleading or conning the Australian public. Therefore you can accept the amendment. There is no reason why the government, if it is not engaged in misleading conduct, cannot accept these provisions. That is the challenge for the government today. If you have nothing to fear, if you are right and you are not misleading Australians, you can accept this amendment; but if you are wrong. if you have something to fear from this amendment, then you will vote us down. That is right—if you have nothing to fear, you can vote for it; but if you have something to fear, you will vote this down.
It was also interesting to note that last week it was revealed how the ACCC intends to police this supposed 10 per cent rule. In a doorstop interview on 2 May 2000, Professor Fels said that the compliance costs associated with the GST can be recovered. He stated:
They can be recovered, but they can't be recovered by means of price rises in excess of 10 per cent. They can be recovered by other means at other times and so on, but not by putting up prices at the start by 10 per cent.
Professor Fels finally fessed up to the cosy little deal that he, the government and the business community have done—that is, that it is all right to put up prices later. Is Professor Fels saying that prices cannot increase by 10 per cent on 1 July, but that on 2 July that will be okay? Is Professor Fels now saying that business is to be permitted to stagger price increases over time or spread price increases over time so that prices may in total increase by more than 10 per cent? The deception by the government continues: is it one story for consumers and another story for business? Business and consumers are uncertain of the effects of the GST, and this bill has just added a potential fine of $10 million if they get those effects wrong. 
This bill does not address the concerns of business. Mr Dick Warburton, the chairman of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, said so on Monday. In a media statement dated 8 May 2000, Mr Warburton said:
Finally, with the full ramifications of the ACCC's regime now becoming clear, there is an urgent need for far greater certainty and, critically, there is a need for greater legal protection against unwarranted and unproven accusations of price exploitation. The regime as it stands could be seen to infringe against fundamental principles of justice and it may leave innocent parties exposed to defamation with very little scope for redress.
The provisions in this bill are highly questionable additions to the powers of the ACCC. The ACCC already has the power to take action against corporations engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. In part V of the Trade Practices Act, including sections 52 and 53(e), the ACCC has considerable power to take action against corporations engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. The government has already relied on these powers in a number of matters, including Sydney bookshop Gleebooks. What is different in the new provisions that the government is proposing is that they come with an enormous sting in the tail—a fine of up to $10 million for a corporation or up to $500,000 for individuals.
To show the enormity of this sting, let me compare the fines with the maximum fine payable for a breach under sections 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act and for a breach of the provision under state and territory fair trading legislation. Under section 53 of the Trade Practices Act, the maximum penalty is $200,000 for a corporation and $40,000 in the case of an individual. The courts also have the discretion to award an injunction, damages or other orders under section 52. The court can order damages, an injunction or wide-ranging other orders including corrective advertising. The maximum penalty for a breach of the provision of the ACT, New South Wales, Northern Territory, South Australian or Western Australian fair trading legislation is $100,000 for a corporation and $20,000 for an individual. In Queensland, the maximum penalty allowed for a breach of part 3, division 1 of the Fair Trading Act—the equivalent of sections 51A to 60 of the Trade Practices Act—is $40,500. It goes on to Victoria and other states.
All of these penalties fade into insignificance compared with the $10 million fine proposed in this bill. This position is succinctly summarised again by Professor Pengilley. He states:
The Government says that, by these completely out of line penalties, it is ensuring that “Australian consumers are not being ripped off” ... The more cynical of us (of which this writer is one) see the proposed legislation as an attempt by the Government to harass individuals with penalty threats if they deviate from the Governmental Goods and Services Tax line at any particular time. There is no inherent difference between misleading conduct generally and misleading conduct in relation to the New Tax System. The consumer is the beneficiary of each prohibition. Equity demands that all be put on the same basis insofar as penalties are concerned.
Labor takes the protection of consumers very seriously, but the question has to be asked: why should misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the GST attract a bigger fine than other misleading and deceptive conduct? It is because the government views the world through the distorted prism of its blind obsession with the GST. It knows it is unpopular and is going through a window-dressing exercise to try to make people feel more confident that they will not be ripped off.
Let me make the point in terms of the rip-off. If the government are concerned that punters are not to be ripped off in relation to the GST, why will they not disclose the GST amount on receipts? Of course they will not. Labor will be moving an amendment to require the GST component to be printed on all receipts. If the ACCC want consumers to help them stop price exploitation, why will the government not allow a disclosure of the GST component on receipts? The answer is that they want to hide the GST. They want to hide the tax that they are so proud of. They want to stop consumers understanding what the amount of the tax is, what Peter Costello is pulling out of their other pocket every time consumers go into the supermarket or shop. The government have promised that the inflationary impact of the GST will be small. The government want the Australian public to believe that prices will go up by only 1.9 per cent because of the GST and then only after 1 July. Remember that, Senator Faulkner? Remember the famous 1.9 per cent? That is all the GST is going to put prices up by. 
—The big lie.
—Exactly. But the Australian public knows that prices are going up now and will go up further after 1 July. No-one with any credibility believes that the inflationary impact will be only 1.9 per cent. On Tuesday night, the government came clean, at least part of the way.
—Or cleaner.
—That is right, it came cleaner. The budget papers revealed that in the first quarter after the GST is introduced inflation will hit 6¾ per cent—and that is on favourable assumptions. Many market commentators have already said that this is optimistic. Even before last night expectations of inflation were already increasing. Everyone knows that prices are going to go up now. Everyone knows that excuses are being used, but everyone knows that it is because people are trying to beat the GST. Higher expectations lead to higher inflation, which leads to higher interest rates. We have already seen the evidence of this in the last few months. The Reserve Bank raised rates yet again last week. People know that higher interest rates are eating up the income tax cuts that the government sold the electorate as compensation for the GST. If there is anything left after the interest rate increases, bracket creep will get it. It was also revealed in the budget on Tuesday night that estimates of taxation revenue show that the government will recoup the income tax cuts after the first year for the financial year of 2000-01. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I rise to speak on the so-called A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. This bill lets the cat out of the bag. The real issue of the GST is that bad. It is much worse than any other matter that involves misrepresentation. The bill sets out that misrepresentations involving the new tax system should be punished much more severely than other misrepresentations. No-one is saying that misrepresentations in themselves are permissible. We are saying that if there is going to be a rule of law it should be equitable, clear, concise and uniform.
The bill would also seek to consolidate policing of trade practices matters relating to the new tax system by the ACCC so that the effectiveness of the body can then be regulated by the amount of funding in order to adequately deal with all matters—which seems, in truth, a worthwhile aim. But I do recall, from experience in a previous occupation, that the department of labour inspectorate was run down federally by a coalition government. So its effectiveness in being able to carry out its assigned duties was reduced considerably. In that instance the state, Queensland, had to eventually pick up the slack. I will come to that point a little later. But one wonders whether the state might be the better place for this type of legislation, in any event. That has been highlighted by Queensland's position. It seems that Queensland is wise to the federal government. The Queensland government may not amend its fair trading legislation to accord with the proposed code. It seems this position is predicated on two main objections: the proposed prohibited conduct is already captured by existing laws, and the Queensland Office of Fair Trading is better placed and better resourced to protect Queenslanders against misrepresentation relating to the new tax system than the ACCC.
The ACCC's GST web site already makes it plain that under the Trade Practices Act, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 and the Fair Trading Act in Queensland—and acts in other states and territories—businesses are already obliged not to make misleading or deceptive price claims about the GST. The ACCC proudly announce on their web site that they are chasing down companies for alleged misleading conduct about the GST. I am sure the chamber has already heard mentioned the examples of the Meriton Apartments and, recently, Video Ezy. In the latter instance, the ACCC relied on sections 52 and 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act. In this debate, it is worth while highlighting what those sections talk about. Section 52, `Misleading or deceptive conduct', states: 
(1) A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. 
(2) Nothing in the succeeding provisions of this Division shall be taken as limiting by implication the generality of subsection (1). 
In addition, section 53A talks about `False representations and other misleading or offensive conduct in relation to land'. To ensure that the debate is clear, it begins:
(1) A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, in connexion with the sale or grant, or the possible sale or grant, of an interest in land or in connexion with the promotion by any means of the sale or grant of an interest in land ...
I will not go on to quote the rest of the provision. It is a very detailed and lengthy provision dealing with false representation and other misleading or offensive conduct in relation to land. But these two sections can be found in the Queensland fair trading legislation. See, for example, sections 38 and 40(g). To save time, I will not point out the similarities by going to those provisions and reading them. In section 52, the principal remedy for misleading and deceptive conduct by a person under Queensland fair trading legislation is damages. There are no fines or pecuniary penalties but, for a breach of 40(g)—which is the same as section 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act—there is a fine, and I am informed that the fine is set at $40,500. This applies across the board for all misrepresentations in relation to the price of goods and services. The fine for a person is similar to that of section 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act. This is now proposed to be substantially altered—but only for the GST.
It seems a little unfair, particularly for fair trading legislation. Any legislation should be introduced on a consistent basis so that people understand the law they have to abide by. Also, it seriously puts in question cooperative legislation schemes where states practically mirror federal legislation. These schemes work by cooperation between federal and state governments, not by unilateral acts to bolster bad policies like the GST. The Queensland Office of Fair Trading explains quite rightly that the power to investigate and prosecute for misrepresentation involves unincorporated entities, and the focus of the Queensland office will be on small businesses that fall within their area of interest. The ACCC can continue to focus on large corporations. The ACCC have not demonstrated, to my mind, their capacity to be able to handle the possible complaints from both urban and regional areas in Queensland. It is very clear that the real point is to punish any evil person very harshly if they misrepresent the pricing effects of the GST—more so than people who misrepresent other goods and services. Therefore, it is a fair conclusion that the GST is very bad.
Let me turn to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It sought to be amended to prohibit conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services that falsely represent or mislead or deceive a person about the effects of the new tax system. However, the Trade Practices Act has already been amended, as I stated earlier, to do with problems that the introduction of the GST might bring. Part VB did this in two areas: prohibiting corporations from charging unreasonably high prices, which is the price exploitation legislation, for the supply of goods supplying the GST; and, secondly, giving the ACCC the power to monitor prices for a period. The idea about this legislation was to prevent profiteering on the tax changes either by failing to pass on cost reductions that result from the removal of the wholesale sales tax or by increasing the price of a good by more than the actual price effect of the GST on an item. 
The bill tries to extend the scope of the existing legislation to deal with misrepresentations about the effect of tax changes during the transition to the goods and services tax regime. It is very helpful to look at the clause to ensure that the debate covers the detail because, as many people tend to say, the devil is in the detail itself. We need to go to the actual provisions, otherwise it is easy to lose sight of the fact that we are talking about rather nebulous sounding provisions in a bill. We need to be able to look at the provisions and state accordingly that section 75AYA will be inserted as: 
... a new provision to prohibit conduct, in connection with the supply of goods or services, that falsely represents, or misleads or deceives a person about, the effect of the New Tax System changes ... such conduct is subject to penalties of up to $10 million for a body corporate, and up to $500,000 for a person other than a body corporate. 
Secondly, it seeks to ensure that: 
The ACCC will also be able to seek injunctions to restrain conduct that is, or may be, in breach of the prohibition. The ACCC will be able to accept voluntary undertakings ...
A mirroring prohibition will be inserted into the state codes that replicates the Commonwealth price exploitation provisions, with some modifications such as referring to a `person' rather than a `corporation'. The bill will also clarify:
... the operation of the access undertaking provisions in Part IIIA ... to make certain that the provisions ... fall within the Commonwealth's legislative power, and to clarify the ACCC has the ability to ... exercise powers in relation to access undertakings.  
Obviously, it is designed to deal with such things, as highlighted in some of the media, that the ACCC have been spreading about, like the Meriton Apartments matters. There the ACCC has advised us that they have instituted proceedings in the Federal Court in Sydney, alleging that Meriton Apartments and its agent misled consumers about the future value of the Summit Apartment properties in George Street, Sydney. The web site of the ACCC goes into some detail about that situation, and I refer people listening to the debate to those provisions.  
However, apparently the present powers are not enough, and Professor Fels seems to want broader powers with penalties—not penalties in the usual sense but penalties that might also apply criminal provisions. Under the proposed amendments, a contravention of the new section 75AYA will, by section 76, attract penalties of up to $10 million for a corporation and $500,000 for a person. This is a very complex piece of proposed legislation. For my part, it seems that in truth the motive for the bill is to stifle discussion about when and by how much a price is going to be affected by the GST. 
One wonders whether free speech is being trammelled under this provision. One wonders whether the effect of it will be to stifle a reasonable debate on price effects, the GST and other matters. Perhaps the minister with carriage of this piece of legislation can provide some clarity about whether or not, if you look at the raft of decisions, particularly in the High Court, which go back to the Australian Capital Television case and later decisions about free speech, it trammels on people's rights to talk about these issues. The High Court has established over some time the scope of our Constitution to allow free speech, and one wonders whether this provision would survive any challenge. I do not wish to provide any scaremongering about it. I am sure—I said I am sure, but one would hope—that in truth the government has looked at this particular area and decided that it does not unduly trespass against people's rights to talk about the GST and price effects.
The provisions I have highlighted are very harsh. The severe penalties involved seemed to be aimed at scaremongering. One wonders then whether the ACCC may offend its own proposed bill by stating amounts of penalties that some people may regard as being calculated to mislead or deceive people into believing that they will be subject to them. 
It is a very broad section, and I want to pick up a very good point that the member for Barton raised in the House of Representatives. Put briefly, the operation and the success of the provision falls partly on the states picking up the state price exploitation regime. Part II of the schedule is a template for state governments to use in order to apply the concepts in the state—and that is where the federal statute cannot go—to small business people such as the unincorporated entities that I spoke about earlier.  
But since Re Wakim and Hughes, there is, to put it mildly—I do not want to scaremonger too much amongst the corporate world—considerably less confidence in cross-vesting schemes and their operation. There is some doubt about the stretch of them—whether they can cover all situations or whether they will, a bit like tissue paper, be blown away. I do not want to scaremonger about that issue because the corporations world, as I understand it, is on tenterhooks as it is. This government has not addressed it in a meaningful way, and it still remains a matter that is out there. The government has attempted some legislative remedy but, in my view, it falls some way short.
In terms of the price exploitation matter in the state sphere, where it may be found to be an invalid exercise of Commonwealth powers, not being a lawyer I would hope that the senator with the carriage of this legislation could, firstly, put some of these questions to bed quite easily and decisively so that at least there is some certainty out there and, secondly, provide advice if at all possible about that particular area. If that senator cannot do that, this government may again be accused of being misleading with this bill. 
Price exploitation is an issue that is out there in the community. There is concern that prices will rise as a consequence of the GST by 10 per cent and more, and prior to 1 July. This government is trying to convince everyone that prices will go up by 1.9 per cent and only after 1 July 2000. I am sure I may be accused of misleading people myself if I try to convince people that the likely inflationary impact of the GST will be only 1.9 per cent. The budget papers seem to have also confirmed my view by indicating that the GST price effect will be in the order of 2.75 per cent. Clearly, it will be higher. Inflation is likely to rise and with it interest rates. If you have a look at the impact on the households now, it is not a pleasant thought to consider any further.
The government has got to be kidding if it believes that this bill will address these problems. It is trying to stifle the debate about the price effects of the GST, and part of the armoury of the ACCC is to depress these expectations that run out there. These amendments to bring about changes to the Trade Practices Act are a blunt weapon. The ACCC could not possibly have the staff. If I am wrong about that, perhaps they can inform me during this debate if they can undertake the scale of investigations that Professor Fels promises. I think the more likely answer is that the bill is simply a shocking example of the government trying to silence its critics of the GST. 
What will we see next? Will it be a blank cheque to Professor Fels to do whatever it takes to paint the GST in a positive light and stifle all debate? Then it is likely to be unlawful for me to criticise the GST. One wonders when this matter will be put to bed. In fact, just pondering that thought, the introduction of this legislation might put me in that frame. Perhaps the minister can allay my concerns about that.
One interesting matter that has arisen is mentioned in a speech to the Australian Retailers Association at their first annual retail congress on 4 April 2000 on the role and function of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In that speech, Professor Fels stated:
The changes to the tax system will result in a change in most prices.
He then went on:
... where prices do rise it should be by less than 10 per cent.
I highlight the word `should'. Professor Fels does not seem to have that much confidence that prices will accord to that. They did get an extra $15.5 million in the budget. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-05-11,"—The A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000 deals with amendments to the Trade Practices Act and it goes to a number of important issues. One of the matters that I draw the Senate's attention to is that the legislation places a new provision, section 75AYA, into the Trade Practices Act 1974 that will: 
... prohibit conduct, in connection with the supply of goods or services, that falsely represents, or misleads or deceives a person about, the effect of the New Tax System changes. 
Contravention of this new section will lead to:
... penalties of up to $10 million for a body corporate, and up to $500,000 for a person other than a body corporate.
These amendments are also related to some particular problems that the implementation of the so-called new tax system has in respect of rents, and I will come to that issue a little later.
Reference to the new tax system in reality means reference to the price effects of the goods and services tax. This legislation really does highlight the general incompetence, ineptitude and false claims that have been made surrounding the goods and services tax. I will not go over the various false claims that have been made about the GST and its impact; they are well known. The Australian Labor Party have exposed numerous examples of false claims made in relation to the goods and services tax. This legislation also highlights the general incompetence of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, and I will refer to some grossly misleading statements that he has made.
—He's made a couple of those.
—Yes, he has made a considerable number of misleading statements, as well as being generally incompetent. No-one can forget Minister Hockey's attempts over the Christmas-New Year period to explain the impact of the GST when the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was on leave. I will return to that in some detail a little later.
The legislation that we are considering has been examined by two Senate committees. The implications of increases in rent were examined on Monday, 14 February, before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and Mr Spier, who appeared on behalf of the ACCC, was questioned on the issue of residential rents. Professor Fels was not there on that occasion, and that in itself is an issue of concern to the Labor opposition. But, in response to questions from Senator Conroy and me, Mr Spier made it very clear that the ACCC does not have the power to regulate residential rents charged by landlords; he made that very clear. Certainly the Labor opposition believes that, as a consequence of that startling admission at the Senate hearings on Monday, 14 February, and in partial response, the government has introduced the amendments being considered today.
But the government has introduced this legislation also in response to claims that the price of goods and services, in some areas at least, can increase by more than 10 per cent as a consequence of the GST. There was considerable public debate about this matter earlier this year—I think it was in January—and it is highlighted by the press release issued by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, on 15 January 2000. That press release, headed `Hockey directs ACCC on GST', states:
The Minister for Financial Services Joe Hockey today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%.
Then comes a quote from the minister:
“No prices will increase by more than 10% as a result of the GST-that is our policy and that is the law.
“Any rounding that increases prices beyond the GST of 10% is unacceptable. And companies that try to profit from the introduction of the GST will face fines of up to $10 million.”
I just emphasise to the Senate: this is the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation issuing a press release to the media and to the Australian public that he has `directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10 per cent'. I will return to this press release a little later.
We now come to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing of Monday, 1 May, where this legislation was examined in considerable detail. I might say that Monday, 1 May, is an auspicious date. Why is it an auspicious date? This is the eve of 2 May. Why is 2 May an auspicious date? Well, 2 May five years ago was the day on which the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, issued a very famous press release. That press release, headed `Tax report is wrong', states: 
Suggestions in today's Australian that I have left open the possibility of a GST are completely wrong.
A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy.
Nor will it be policy at any time in the future.
It is completely off the political agenda in Australia.
Of course, this is the infamous `never ever' promise made by the Prime Minister. It is interesting that our hearing took place on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the claim by the Prime Minister `never ever' to introduce a GST in this country.
But let us get to the Senate committee hearings on Monday, 1 May. I think it is important to highlight to the Senate that the Labor opposition is moving an amendment in this place to ensure that government ministers and government bodies themselves can have action taken against them and be found guilty if they engage in misleading and deceptive conduct. This committee hearing did not get off to a particularly good start. The Labor opposition has been concerned and has requested for some time that Professor Fels himself, as head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, present himself before Senate committees on a more regular basis.
Professor Fels did write to Mr Hallahan of the Senate Economics Committee on 28 April 2000. In that letter he stated:
I regret that I will be unable to attend the supplementary estimate hearings in coming weeks because of other commitments. However I am pleased to advise, in accordance with my normal practice for many, many years, senior staff of the ACCC will be able to attend and I am confident that they will be able to answer all questions.
He goes on.
In view of comments made by some Senate estimate committee members, I can advise that I expect to be available for the budget hearings which I understand will be later in the month. I would also like to state that the appearance will be my fifth or sixth appearance before a Senate committee in the April/May period and altogether I have appeared countless times before Senate and House committees over many years.
It was this comment that Professor Fels made about his appearance before a Senate committee in the April-May period that I have to take objection to and assert is false and misleading. That comment is Professor Fels himself engaging in false and misleading conduct. We did check. We checked the record to see how many estimate hearings Professor Fels had been to since 1995. Professor Fels's letter clearly gives the impression, by referring to the April-May period, that he had been to estimates committee hearings. When we checked the records, he had not been to one estimates committee hearing since 1995 during this April-May period.
So Professor Fels himself—and we did raise this issue at the commencement of the hearings—had engaged, through writing this letter, in false and misleading conduct. No better does this as well as other examples highlight that government agencies and government ministers should be held accountable themselves for the claims they make with respect to these types of matters.
With respect to the legislation we are dealing with, we received a very important communication from the Law Council of Australia, written by Professor Pengilley, who is the Professor of Commercial Law at the University of Newcastle and, interestingly, a former commissioner of the Australian Trade Practices Commission. The letter was endorsed by the Law Council of Australia. I will not read all of the significant criticisms made, but I will refer to a couple of them. The most important is on page 5 of that correspondence where Professor Pengilley refers to the constantly purported claims by the ACCC and ministers of this government that they can enforce a price cap of 10 per cent. The letter says:
Similarly, the ACCC Guidelines say that no price may increase more than 10 per cent. This conclusion resulted from an embarrassing public debate in which Minister Hockey eventually was forced politically to give this assurance. But it is not the law and the ACCC is misleading in its Guideline in saying that it is. If a corporation's increased tax, purchase and compliance costs exceed 10 per cent, there is no reason at all, as the writer sees it, why prices cannot increase to cover these. 
Of course, we had two important admissions at the committee hearing on Monday, 1 May by Professor Fels in relation to this matter. It was under intense questioning, and I note the firm and decisive performance by my colleague Senator Conroy. With respect to the issue of increasing prices by more than 10 per cent, Professor Fels finally had to admit that it was not law. He finally fessed up that, in fact, the guidelines issued by the ACCC could not be enforced in law—it was not in the law. There was also another important admission by Professor Fels about the so-called direction made by Minister Hockey in his infamous press release of 15 January this year. I just quickly refer to the transcript when Senator Conroy said:
Mr Hockey has been quoted—and I think everyone saw it at the time in January or February—as saying that he has directed you that no price is to increase by more than 10 per cent. Professor Fels, that is not accurate, is it?
Prof. Fels—He made a statement something like that.
Senator CONROY—He put out a press statement—I have it here somewhere—that he had directed you to that effect.
Prof. Fels—I think he made a press statement to that effect, yes.
Senator CONROY—That is not correct, is it? He has not directed you that no price is to increase?
Behind a bit of mumbling, the arm shuffling in front of the mouth and the glasses being sucked, Professor Fels said:
Not in terms of a direction under the Trade Practices Act, no.
Senator CONROY—He is required to put that in writing, isn't he?
Prof. Fels—Yes.
Senator CONROY—And he has not put that in writing?
Again, it was fairly obvious that Professor Fels was very embarrassed at that meeting. Professor Fels replied no:
Senator CONROY—Has any other member of the government given you a directive that 10 per cent is the price limit?
Prof. Fels—No.
What clearer situation could we have of a minister of the Crown, Minister Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, misleading the Australian people? He has not been caught apparently misleading the parliament, but he has been caught issuing a false press release to the media and misleading the Australian public. In the press release of 15 January, Minister Hockey said:
... today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%.
These are Minister Hockey's own words from his own press release. He said he issued a directive, and we have the evidence from that hearing of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee where Professor Fels says he did not receive such a directive. I have to say I believe Professor Fels. Minister Hockey did not issue such a directive in relation to the 10 per cent, and I think we should be noting in this Senate the appalling performance of Minister Hockey in the carrying out of his duties, in misleading the Australian public in such a reprehensible manner about an important issue—the application of the 10 per cent GST cap. It is a very important issue in public policy in this place, in this country, and I cannot recall a clearer case of a minister being caught red-handed in misleading the Australian public by his own press release. It is quite appalling behaviour from Minister Hockey, on top of the general incompetence of his performance in handling GST related issues over that Christmas-January period.
The legislation before us purports to cap GST price increases to 10 per cent. I have referred to Professor Fels's performance at the committee. We hope to see him back again regularly before Senate committees being held accountable, but what particularly concerned me was some further statements made by Professor Fels in attempting damage control the next day in response to the admissions made at that Senate hearing about this price cap. Amongst a number of other claims, Professor Fels did make comment about businesses not being able to increase their prices by 10 per cent but, if there was a justified price increase in excess of 10 per cent, they could in fact claim that additional price later. 
In effect, what Professor Fels is saying is that it is not okay to increase your prices because of the GST by more than 10 per cent on 1 July, but it is okay to increase your prices by more than 10 per cent so long as you do it later in the year. Presumably, if you have a justified price increase of 11 per cent, you put your prices up by 10 per cent on 1 July and you put your prices up by a further one per cent on 2 July. That is effectively what Professor Fels was advocating the following day in his attempt at damage control in respect of this issue of the 10 per cent price cap. 
I cannot recall an instance of a piece of legislation that has so starkly highlighted the general incompetence of this government in its handling of the introduction of a 10 per cent goods and services tax. There have been numerous other examples in the media over the last few months, and time does not allow me to go into those. But we do know that a 10 per cent price cap is not enforceable in law. We do know that this government claimed it was. We do know that Minister Hockey claimed it was. We do know that Minister Hockey has made false claims about issuing a press release to that effect which Professor Fels honestly admitted he had never received and that it cannot be enforced in law. Minister Hockey should be held accountable, at least in this chamber, for his behaviour. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-05-11,"—The A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000 relates to the new tax system. `A new tax system' is government terminology to cover the introduction of the GST. In fact this bill relates to the GST. That is something which the government describes as tax reform but which most Australians see as a new tax imposing higher costs and charges on them, a flat tax that applies equally to the most wealthy person in Australia and to the poorest person in Australia and therefore is classically defined in economic textbooks as a regressive tax, not a progressive tax—it does not tax people according to their ability to pay it; it charges everyone exactly the same rate and therefore is regressive. It is a tax that increasingly Australians have begun to loathe and reject as elements of what is involved in this tax package manifest themselves more and more each day in the minds of the community as people begin to understand in greater detail what is involved.
Labor has fought valiantly in this chamber to prevent the introduction of the GST. Our policy position is to reject the GST. But in this chamber, in an unholy alliance between the government and the Australian Democrats, a vote was taken that imposes a GST. We resisted it. They had the numbers and there will be a GST by virtue of that unholy alliance between the Australian Democrats and the coalition government. Our position was, having lost the battle on the vote, that we would give the government the necessary support mechanisms and therefore vote for all the things that the government wanted that in the government's view would ensure a smooth introduction of the GST, and we did that. For that reason, we will not oppose this bill today. That means that if there is a hiccup, a problem, a significant unintended consequence or what might be called by ordinary Australians a stuff-up about the GST, it will be all the government's fault. They will not be able to say that the opposition interfered with their ability to impose this tax. We resisted it. We lost that battle, but we want to see that, if it is going to go ahead, the government's idea of how they should handle it is supported and the people of Australia can then judge whether or not this is a fairly operating tax. For those reasons, this bill will not be opposed by us. 
The government is seeking extra powers. I want to criticise those powers in a moment because I think they go close to gagging freedom of speech in Australia by trying to stop companies, despite their better judgment, from criticising the GST or debating the impact of price rises induced by the GST. But the Australian Labor Party wants to move some amendments. I know these have been foreshadowed by my colleague Senator Conroy, but let me explain what they will do. The first amendment would require that the ACCC, the watchdog organisation independent of government and charged with the responsibility of ensuring that there are no illegal price rises because of the GST, table its quarterly report in the parliament and that the chairperson of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, appear quarterly before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration to report on progress. That is a small change. It has some considerable significance. It is proposed that Professor Fels receive quarterly a report on implementational problems with the GST. As it stands, that report would remain with Professor Fels. We think that report is vital information for monitoring the impact of the GST on the Australian community, and it should be a public document open to scrutiny and analysis and open to investigation and consideration of what in fact is happening. Therefore, it should be tabled in the parliament and Professor Fels, on behalf of the ACCC, should be available to answer questions about what is really happening in Australia as opposed to what government spokespeople want us to believe is occurring. 
We are proposing another amendment to ensure that the GST be disclosed on the customer's receipt. This legislation would make it illegal for a trading entity or an individual to claim that a price rise is caused by the GST if that price rise is greater than 10 per cent. There is a hefty fine on an individual of half a million dollars and on a corporate body of $10 million if they do that. I come back to the idea of using large and outrageously huge fines in a situation like this without the policing powers to investigate and detect the problem. There is a thimble and pea trick in public perceptions being worked here by the government, and the trick is to pretend it is doing something by announcing huge fines while not having the policing mechanism to do anything about discovering whether there are any crimes and whether anyone will pay the fines. It is a piece of public relations chicanery by the government to pretend that it is actually doing something in the community when, in fact, it is manifestly quiescent in clothing itself in the necessary resources to detect fraud or contravention.
We have long argued that a basic right of Australians is to know how much tax they are paying. Any wage and salary earner in this country receives on their group certificate, and receives monthly on their pay slips from their employer, the gross amount of their income, the amount deducted from that in tax and the net amount remaining. We all know how much income tax we pay. It is a small step to say that, when you have a goods and services tax, on the customer's receipt there should be the price of the good, how much tax the individual taxpayer is paying in the purchase of that item and what the total amount is, so it is transparent and so we know what tax we pay when we purchase under this new regressive taxation system a good or a service that is subject to a tax. 
The government has resisted that; it has resisted the right of the public to know. That information would be essential when a shopper trundles their supermarket trolley down an aisle looking at new prices after 1 July wondering, as they scratch their head, how much really that item has gone up or, if the government's arguments are to be believed, gone down, and how much of the final price they are paying in taxation in real terms. The government says there are 18 million consumers out there who are safeguarding this law because they will report whether there is overcharging. How can they report it if they do not know the amount of tax they are paying and cannot therefore measure whether or not the prices are properly passing through the tax changes and properly representing the tax increases?
It is not as if this is a difficult proposition at all. I was recently in Europe: in Britain if you purchase a good, on the receipt you get at the checkout it shows you how much tax you pay; it is the same in Belgium and Switzerland; and, as I recall, it was the same in France and Germany. So why can't it be the same in Australia? In short, what has this government got to hide that it prevents, by refusing to accept an amendment from the opposition, the amount of tax a taxpayer will have to pay under the GST from being shown on the receipt the taxpayer receives at the checkout? What is so reprehensible, in terms of consumer rights, that we are not able to know—because this government keeps voting down our amendment—how much goods and services tax we pay when, as a matter of reasonable law, we all know how much tax we pay on our wages? Why is it different? So we will be moving an amendment on that matter to show on the checkout receipt the price of the good, the amount of tax and the final price a consumer must pay. 
I might say in parentheses, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is obvious why the government does not want this information to be known. It does not want this information known because, if people know how much the GST is going to cost them in real terms, it will put a lie to the oft-stated argument that many prices will in fact decline by large amounts. The people, some of whom may have supported a GST, will realise what a scam this is and what a fraud has been worked on them. There is a right for consumers to know, and this government continues to deny it.
We will also be moving an amendment which I think is rightly to be called the Joel Fitzgibbon amendment. Mr Fitzgibbon is the Labor Party shadow spokesman for small business. He has been a very active campaigner in the Australian community for the rights of small business and how those rights are being trampled in this government's rush to impose a GST and impose on small business high compliance costs to meet the costs of imposing the GST—each small business now becomes a tax collector. He has been a strong advocate for small business in getting tax rulings from the tax commissioner so that the tax commissioner can tell small business what the law is supposed to mean, so they know what it is they have to comply with, something that the tax commissioner is notoriously slow about and, in many cases, has not provided a ruling, so there is no guidance at all.
The Fitzgibbon amendment that we would move today is an amendment which facilitates protection for small business tenants from unscrupulous landlords. Professor Fels, the head of the ACCC, the watchdog body in this case that will oversee the proper implementation of the GST, told a Senate hearing—and I was present in that Senate inquiry—that the ACCC does not have the power to regulate rents. There is some necessity to provide in this bill power for the ACCC to oversee that the behaviour by landlords—particularly towards small business clients but towards individual tenants as well—is in fact properly conducted. If the ACCC does not have the power—and that is the evidence by the chairman of the ACCC itself, Professor Fels—the parliament should give it the power. The parliament should ensure that it can do its job; and we will be moving an amendment along those lines too.
Finally, if I took the sense of what Senator Sherry was saying, there ought to be an expression of censure by this chamber against the finance minister, Mr Hockey. We all know the fumbling, bumbling way in which, when he was Acting Treasurer in January this year, he tried to explain why prices would not rise by more than 10 per cent. We all know the mess he got himself into. We know that when the Treasurer came back from holidays he had to try and bail him out. We know that many people in the business community are still uncertain as to what the government's position is. We know that he actually misled the community when he talked about rounding down, in his press release and on camera in a television interview. It was an inept performance, one that adds to the massive confusion in corporate Australia as to what they are supposed to do on 1 July.
If the government cannot get it right at its most senior level, how can individual companies or individual people be expected to get it right? This is, after all, the government's legislation. This is, after all, according to the Prime Minister, the biggest tax change in Australia in the last 50 years. This is, after all, in words that will come to hang around his neck like a dead albatross, `the greatest tax reform Australia has ever seen'. Wait for the hollow laugh from Australian consumers. The point here is that, if the government cannot explain its own legislation and if not knowing is not a defence at law reasonably, how can ordinary Australians be expected to know? Won't many of them be prosecuted because they listened to Mr Hockey and were misled but will be told at the bar that not knowing is not an excuse and the law is there? That places many people in jeopardy and, rightly, Mr Hockey should be censured. 
I want to go to a couple of issues about this legislation. This legislation will impose a fine of up to half a million dollars on an individual and up to $10 million on a corporate entity if they do not comply with the provisions set out in the bill in terms of representing the impact of a GST accurately. This is an attempt at window-dressing by the government. I think that for this reason. The ACCC recently informed a Senate estimates committee that they have contractors surveying—and their word was `occasionally'—retail prices. There are, I have to say, over 350 people on contract surveying prices in 176 cities and towns. As far as petrol is concerned, there are approximately 450 people surveying 3,850 retail outlets. So there is some price surveying going on. But there are only 74 staff Australia-wide specifically assigned to the GST. In the Northern Territory there is only one; in Tasmania there is just one person as well. Queensland scores the treble—it has actually two people overseeing price changes in the GST. South Australia does not do as well—it only has one. My own state of Western Australia has two people, in the largest state in the Commonwealth. In Victoria there are 17; in New South Wales there are two; at head office here in the Australian Capital Territory there are 19; and at a call centre there are 29.
Essentially, there is not the staff available to the government to properly survey whether or not there is price fixing undertaken when the GST is introduced. If you do not have the police in the field, you do not detect the crime. If you do not detect the crime, what does it matter how large the fines are? What we have is the government stumping the country, beating its breast and saying, `We will stop people from claiming GST price rises when in fact they are not, and we will slam them with huge fines.' That sounds good but, in truth, without the infrastructure nothing much will happen—and having one person in the Northern Territory, one in Tasmania, two in Queensland, one in South Australia, two in WA, two in New South Wales and 17 in Victoria is not going to solve the problem.
What we have here is a piece of public relations window-dressing by the government: nothing real, everything sham, and nothing serious other than to try and win the public relations battle. This government is fated to lose the public relations battle. Shortly after 1 July, when the GST and the much touted tax cuts come in—which Mr Howard says will leave no Australian worse off but which we now know, from the inquiries of the Senate, will mean, at least with interest rates rises, that many Australians will in fact be a lot worse off—with all those things occurring, Australians will be able to see how much their grocery bill is and what the compensation is, and will then realise the compensation is inadequate. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I would like to speak this morning on the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. While I was considering my contribution today I thought about the complexity of this legislation and how one might—as a small businessman, in particular—negotiate that labyrinth. I am reading at the moment a book called The Surgeon of Crowthorne. I was thinking about how one might comply with this legislation, and it seemed to me pretty apt when I came across a quote in a chapter headed `The Man Who Taught Latin to Cattle'. Dr Murray, who was the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, wrote to the British Museum in 1867 seeking a job with them. He outlined, with unabashed candour, what he thought were his prime qualities for employment by the British Museum. In writing to the museum, he said:
I have to state that Philology, both Comparative and special, has been my favourite pursuit during the whole of my life, and that I possess a general acquaintance with the languages & literature of the Aryan and Syro-Arabic classes—not indeed to say that I am familiar with all or nearly all of these, but that I possess that general lexical and structural knowledge which makes the intimate knowledge only a matter of a little application. With several I have a more intimate acquaintance as with the Romance tongues, Italian, French, Catalan, Spanish, Latin, & in a less degree Portuguese, Vaudois, Provencal and various dialects. In the Teutonic branch, I am tolerably familiar with Dutch (having at my place of business correspondence to read in Dutch, German, French & occasionally other languages), Flemish, German, Danish. In Anglo-Saxon and Moeso-Gothic my studies have been much closer, I having prepared some works for publication upon these languages. I know a little of the Celtic, and am at present engaged with the Sclavonic, having obtained a useful knowledge of the Russian. In the Persian, Achaemenian Cuneiform, & Sanscrit branches, I know for the purposes of Comparative Philology. I have sufficient knowledge of Hebrew and Syriac to read at sight the Old Testament and Peshito; to a less degree I know Aramaic Arabic, Coptic and Phoenician to the point where it is left by Genesius. 
That, it seems to me, is the sort of length and breadth of knowledge in language—that Dr Murray was advertising himself as having—that you will need to negotiate the labyrinth of this GST. I point out that Dr Murray was, as I said, the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary. One of the most valuable contributors to that dictionary was the man called the Surgeon of Crowthorne, Dr W.C. Minor, a criminal lunatic who spent most of his life in the Broadmoor asylum. Maybe it is unfair to Dr Minor and Dr Murray to compare them with Professor Fels and the Treasurer. I will let you draw the conclusion as to who Dr Minor and Dr Murray might be.
As many opposition speakers have said, this is a very unfair tax and it is open to exploitation. I have had many inquiries to my office in Parramatta as to how businesses—particularly small businesses, unincorporated businesses and partnerships—will be called upon to comply with this legislation, because they are being hit from hill to dale as a result of the introduction of this new tax on 1 July. You may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell, that we were told time and time again by government spokesmen that this was to simplify the tax system. But you of all people would be well aware that this legislation that has been introduced contains the thickest, weightiest bits of paperwork that I think any of us have ever come across. This is not a simple tax system—not at all. This tax system will become more and more complex and more and more open to exploitation. You only have to see how businesses are struggling to understand how they will comply, how they will avoid putting themselves in a position where they may be fined $50,000, $500,000 or $10 million. There are a lot of honest, hardworking Australians out there who do not want to put themselves in a position where they are not complying with this legislation and find themselves the subject of an Eliot Ness type raid by Professor Fels and his crew.
I am worried about the implementation of this new tax system. As I said, a lot of businesses, particularly in Western Sydney, are concerned that not only will they have to operate with the new system but also a number of them will have to comply with government regulations that they have never had to comply with before. You may be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that under the old wholesale sales tax system only 75,000 places in Australia paid that form of taxation. But under the proposed legislation we will have a situation where anywhere between 1.4 and 1.6 million premises or sites or persons will be required to comply with the legislation that is to come out of the government. In estimates the other week we sought an explanation from taxation officers concerning in particular an area that I have some interest in—the diesel fuel rebate. Still, at this late stage, industry does not know where and when journeys will commence and where and when they will finish or where people will be able to make an application for the rebate and where they will not—and it is only a few weeks now until this brave new world in terms of taxation will be implemented. As we know, this brave new world has started to crumble; I believe this system will as well.
The government has used all sorts of language in the introduction of this new tax system. It is quite Orwellian. There is something called a `new tax system price exploitation code'. I do not know if that is meant to encourage exploitation. I would have thought they might have called it `new tax system price anti-exploitation code'. If there is a code out there with that name, one would assume it is for exploitation; one would also assume that there must be one out there against exploitation. I am sure that is not what the government sought to do—encourage people to exploit—but one would have to come to that conclusion. Maybe the brains trusts that draw up the titles for these pieces of legislation might wish to revisit it.
Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell, I know, as I said to you earlier, that this has been very unwelcome in my state of New South Wales. I am concerned about whether this can be implemented properly but also whether it can be complied with by those businesses and the ACCC itself. In November of last year—on 11 November, of all dates—Mr Nick Ellis, the Director of Compliance/Enforcement for the ACCC said this: 
The Commission receives in excess of 60,000 complaints each year. Commission staff, Australia wide, number approximately 350 persons. These limited resources and budgetary constraints mean that the Commission is unable to pursue all matters that are brought to its attention.
I will just repeat that: `the Commission is unable to pursue all matters that are brought to its attention.' So the watchdog cannot follow in all instances. Only the other night in the budget there was an additional $22 million set aside for the ACCC to pursue the compliance and enforcement of GST related matters—$15.5 million for this year and $6.5 million for the subsequent year. I wonder where that money is going to go. We heard what Senator Cook said earlier, that most of the staff of the ACCC, in this enforcement bracket area anyway, seem to be holed up here in Canberra. I wonder how much of that $22 million is going to go for some sort of media officer for Professor Fels—not that I think he needs one, but I think that, particularly after his appearances in the Senate estimates committee the other week, he may need a bit more training before he puts his head on the screen again. I am concerned that this fellow, who obviously thinks he is some sort of Eliot Ness, is trying to continue to exploit the publicity surrounding him, not his role. I think we have seen on a number of occasions over the past year where we could not seem to get Professor Fels to intervene on matters that directly affected the public but, if there is a headline there, then Headline Harry will be out there in front of it. He will have the melon stuck in front of the television advocating what he is `gunna' do. We have seen on many occasions that that is about it—`gunna' do this, and `gunna' do that. We have not seen him do anything that has assisted the consumers in this country.
As I said, I am concerned about the implementation. I am concerned about a number of those firms that are being almost threatened with bankruptcy because they do not feel that they are going to be able to comply with this new legislation. As I say, you are going from 70,000 sites or premises in this country that pay wholesale sales tax at the moment to around 1.6 million. How can those people, who have never had to comply with a taxation regime like this before, be expected to be in line trying to comply with the legislation? As I say, I think that it is an invitation to bankrupt them if they willingly—or even unwillingly—do not comply with this legislation.
We have had also in relation to this a matter concerning the watchdog. We have seen with the compliance and the enforcement another problem, and that concerns the way that the legislation has attracted some legal comment. In the Financial Review earlier this year one of the heads of the Business Council of Australia said:
Some of the companies involved— 
that is, involved in the GST situation—
have said they consider a High Court challenge to the federal government's constitutional power to impose a price control regime.
That was said by Mr Buckingham, and it was said clearly in light of the fact that there are some grave doubts about whether the Commonwealth has legislative power to enforce these regimes on small businesses, partnerships or unincorporated bodies. I wonder also whether advertisers or media outlets will be subject to the scrutiny of the ACCC if they unwittingly advertise prices that are in addition to the 10 per cent that it is going to be imposed after 1 July. I am not sure that that has been fully explained.
But what we would say to the government is that the way to solve these difficulties, rather than have this window dressing, is to have the disclosure on the receipts. That is clear: just put it on the receipts. When you go into a shop and you buy something, there is the additional 10 per cent on the receipt. I am told that in places like Italy and so on they have a separate police force, called the finance police. If you sit down a cafe in Rome—which undoubtedly you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have on occasion—you are required to hold a slip if you have bought a cafe latte. The finance police wander around with their shotguns or their machine guns and if you do not have your slip on you they take you away. That is the way the enforcement operates in Italy, I am told, and I think that is transparent and honest. 
That is not what is going to happen here. The government are seeking to impose, particularly on small business, a regime that is unfair and unworkable for them. I think that they will punish you very much next time, because I have seen what they believe about you. They believe that you have abandoned them. They think they have been abandoned by their natural party. I went to an anti GST rally about caravan parks up at Port Macquarie the other week, and I heard speaker after speaker—conservative retired men and women—get up and say, `I voted for the coalition last time, but they have let me down. They have betrayed me. They are going to take away my money that I earned.' That is what they did. You are going to get paid back badly, particularly in regional Australia.
—I just want to make the point to the Acting Deputy President that he of course supports the GST, and we would like to hear what he said to the caravan park people—
 (Senator George Campbell)—There is no point of order, Senator Kemp. That is not a point of order and you are making a mockery of this chamber.
—The only caravan park people that Senator Kemp has seen were probably on television or something like that. We have been up there talking to the people about this, we know how they feel and we know what they are going to do to you next time they get a chance to get at you.
I want to conclude on the point that I referred to earlier—that is, what I see as the possible legal difficulties the Commonwealth may have as a result of this legislation. The Commonwealth has the power to legislate with respect to corporations under section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution. Clearly the parliament can construct a legislative framework designed to govern the behaviour of corporations under this head of legislative power. But the Commonwealth does not have this power with respect to businesses, particularly small businesses—because they are not incorporated, they do not fall within the terms of the Commonwealth's legislative jurisdiction under the corporations power. Indeed one of the constitutional hurdles that the Hawke government found when it was grappling with the prices and income accord was this very lack of legislative competence with respect to the Commonwealth's capacity to impose price controls.
It would seem to me that the freedom of trade provisions also serve to constrain the Commonwealth's capacity to invoke the trade and commerce power under section 51(i) of the Constitution. Recent case law serves only to highlight the difficulties fraught with any attempt to legislate, and more particularly enforce, a regulatory regime which has effective coverage over all businesses, whether they are incorporated or not. The High Court's decision in re Wakim has necessitated a reassessment of previously accepted regimes wherein the Commonwealth had stepped into the breach in regulating areas of business conduct relying upon various legislative tools of cross-vesting. This uncertainty has only been highlighted by the recent decision handed down by the High Court over a week ago in the case of the Queen v. Hughes. The upshot of this decision is twofold: firstly, the Commonwealth may not even have the constitutional power to enact laws that give the ACCC the power to regulate and enforce anti price exploitation measures and, secondly, even if it does have that power, there are clearly a number of fundamental difficulties associated with current cross-vesting arrangements which may, by way of logistical concerns, impede the enforcement of much of this legislation. There is a fine book by the American historian Barbara Tuckman called The March of Folly. I suggest that the government read it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I rise in this debate on the new tax system out of particular concern about the legislation before us today. If one goes back, the fact was that the GST was inherently an unfair tax system, no matter what one says. 
—It shifted the tax burden from those who had the capacity to pay tax to those who did not have that capacity. I am glad to see Senator Kemp in the chamber because it is about time he woke up to some of the facts of life. There are real people out there who are going to be affected by this regime when it is put into place from 1 July this year. Of course there are many traders out there—there are many people—who are looking at this as being a window of opportunity to have the people of Australia pay more than they otherwise could or should under any other regime. That is the clear reality of what is going to happen. No matter what the government say they have put in place to survey the price changes that will take place under the GST, whatever is being done is inadequate indeed—totally inadequate.
We have a simple tax system which the government sold to the Australian people via a massive advertising campaign, the Community Education Information Program, in the lead-up to the last federal election. The people were sucked in—they bought it—and of course now find that they have a lemon, that lemon being the GST. People know in their heart of hearts that they are going to be subject to exploitation by those people who have the power to exploit them: the business people in Australia. Some of those business people will disguise it very well and others will not. The fundamental problem I have with this legislation is that, if people want to speak out about the exploitation, this legislation takes that opportunity away from them in effect because of the penalties that are envisaged within the act. When I saw this legislation on the table I particularly looked at what had taken place before the Senate committee. When I looked further I saw a very good submission there from Professor Pengilley. I know that prior to me speaking today some of my colleagues have quoted bits out of Professor Pengilley's submission to the Senate inquiry. I want to look specifically at some of the statements that were made by Professor Pengilley in his submission to that inquiry because I think they get to the real nub of the problem—that is, that ordinary people in Australia are going to be exploited by the imposition of this taxation system. Professor Pengilley said:
Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits conduct in trade or commerce which misleads or deceives or is likely to mislead or deceive. It is a section worded in general terms and thus it was thought inappropriate to enforce it by way of criminal penalties. The section is enforced by the sanctions of damages, injunction or wide ranging `other orders', including corrective advertising, which can made under the Trade Practices Act.
He is outlining in the submission the recourse that people have. He goes on:
The above will apply, it seems, unless you ... say naughty things about the Government's New Tax System.
That is what this is about. It is about the fear that people are going to say naughty things about the government's new tax system. It is about the fact that they feel they are being exploited and the fact that they feel the tax system is wrong. They have hanging over them a sword of Damocles which will impose a severe financial penalty upon them. In his submission Professor Pengilley goes on to say:
Perhaps such a provision can be tolerated to the extent that it is consistent with other provisions of the Trade Practices Act and in particular s.52 noted above.
That is why I quoted section 52. He rightly says that if it were consistent then maybe one could tolerate it. He also states:
Where it is not consistent with other provisions is that, uniquely in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct, the enforcement procedures are all of those set out above in relation to s.52 plus a maximum pecuniary per offence of $10 million in the case of a corporation and $500,000 in the case of an individual. No other misleading or deceptive conduct has any pecuniary penalty, let alone a $10 million one.
So why do we have this? As I said, we have a system which is inherently unfair, which shifts the tax burden and which people have not woken up to yet. They have been seduced by the advertising that has been put in place to sell it. When they wake up to what is going on, their recourse will be limited indeed. People who want to speak out against this will find that they face major pecuniary costs per offence in accordance with this legislation. If that is not the intention of this, the government should withdraw it. As Professor Pengilley properly points out, there is no other misleading or deceptive conduct that has any similar pecuniary penalty. So why are we faced with this today? What have the government to fear? He then goes on: 
Maximum penalties under s.53 are $200,000 for a corporation and $40,000 in the case of an individual plus injunction, damages and “other orders”. However, the new Bill will extract $10 million and $500,000 respectively if you say naughty things about the effect, or likely effect, of the Government's New Tax System.
He reinforces:
In no other part of the Trade Practices Act does the penalty for false representations exceed $200,000.
So what are the government about? Professor Pengilley says:
The penalties for error in relation to the Government's New Tax System and the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) are thus totally out of line with everything else in the Act.
He goes on:
The Government says that, by these completely out of line penalties, it is ensuring that—
then he quotes the House of Representatives Hansard—
“Australian consumers are not being ripped off” ... The more cynical of us (of which this writer is one) see the proposed legislation as an attempt by the Government to harass individuals with penalty threats if they deviate from the Governmental Goods and Services Tax line at any particular time.
He lays it very clearly and succinctly before the committee and now properly before the parliament that people who are subject to exploitation and speak out against that exploitation suffer the real situation that they could face massive penalties for speaking out against a government initiative. If that is not the intention of the government, then why is this here when it is in no other part of the Trade Practices Act, as Professor Pengilley has rightly pointed out? One can only attribute some very devious motives to this on the part of the government. Whilst we have heard the government laud the introduction of their GST, we became aware the other night that there is a questionable surplus in the budget. It is a smoke and mirrors surplus, as people would no doubt have described it.
—It is a phoney surplus.
—It is a phoney surplus, as Senator Campbell interjects. If that is the case and this government are working with smokes and mirrors—they are the conjurers—what are we looking at in the outyears? What will their recourse be? Their recourse will be to up the GST. There are phoney revenues—
—It is not our decision. We do not up it. The states up it.
—You are struggling.
—I am not struggling at all, Senator Kemp. You know that your budget is predicated on a phoney surplus. You know that your recourse in years to come will be to up the GST. That will be the only recourse. We are not getting openness from the government. Openness and transparency are not there. Senator Conroy has acknowledged in the Senate that he will move an amendment to this bill seeking that the government include on receipts the amount of the GST. Let it be open. Let it be disclosed. Let it be there. But of course the government have rejected this before, and complicit in that have been the Democrats. They have been in it up to their eyeballs. Let the cost of the GST go on the receipt. It is a simple request that has been put time and time again by Labor in this debate. Let it be transparent. Let it be open.
—If it's not there, how do you determine it?
—That is right! The government's criticism of the wholesale sales tax over a long time was purely and simply that the wholesale sales tax was not a transparent tax—that you could not identify what the tax was worth and that it was hidden. Here we are, moving to a new regime, and we have a bill before us today which will effectively put the brakes on people speaking openly and freely about GST exploitation. So what are we to expect? If the government are sincere about this, let them accept the Labor amendment to include the GST component of a good or a service on the receipt so that it is there for everyone to understand exactly what they are being charged. Let it be open; let it be transparent. 
—You're struggling, Hoggy.
—No, I am not struggling at all. You have rejected this on a number of occasions. You have imposed an unfair tax on the Australian people. They have the right to see that they are not being exploited under the new tax that you will introduce from 1 July. If your criticism of the wholesale sales tax was that it was not transparent and that it was a hidden tax, you should not allow the GST to be a hidden tax so that people are not able to assess its full impact on their lives. That is one of the things that the government are sincerely hoping for—that people will not be able to accurately assess the impact of the GST on their day-to-day living in the short term. They do not want it to happen. If it does happen, people who have to pay the tax—that is, lower income people in particular—will clearly come to the conclusion that the tax burden has been shifted to them. That is the unfair element of the GST: it has shifted the tax burden. People have not woken up to that yet, but they will undoubtedly come to that conclusion if people can challenge the fact that they are being exploited under the GST. What Professor Pengilley said nails this issue down. He said:
The more cynical of us ... see the proposed legislation as an attempt by the Government to harass individuals with penalty threats if they deviate from the Governmental Goods and Services Tax line at any particular time.
It is an attempt to quash free speech, and that is the other fundamental concern that I have with this issue. 
The penalty regime does no service to the government in convincing the public that they are not being ripped off with the introduction of the GST. I understand Senator Conroy has foreshadowed that he will be moving an amendment requiring the ACCC to table a report in parliament, on a quarterly basis, on price exploitation so that it is openly and transparently before the parliament of Australia, which has the responsibility to oversee legislation and its introduction in this country, so that there can be proper scrutiny. That seems to me to be an eminently fair proposition on the part of Senator Conroy—that this parliament have the right to scrutinise whatever efforts are being made by the ACCC.
The ACCC is under resourced. In my state of Queensland, I understand the ACCC has two people contracted to look at the exploitation of prices, and there are 17 people in Victoria. The mind boggles! There are two people for the whole of the state of Queensland. They would not track anything down. It is a thinly veiled attempt to cover up the fact that something is not being done to assure the public at large that no exploitation is taking place.
—So what's your policy?
—Our policy is quite clear: bring the legislation back. We will deal with it. But you have been complicit in this, Senator McGauran. This is something that I welcome. It will be touted loud and clear in my state that the National Party were complicit, along with the Democrats, in delivering the GST to the government. So one should clearly wear the hat if it fits, Senator McGauran. We are saying that there is no doubt that this legislation will curb people's rights. People who wish to speak out against the exploitation that will occur under the GST legislation will feel threatened. There is no reason why this should be before us today. There should be openness; there should be transparency. You should pick up the recommendation of Senator Conroy's amendment, firstly, requiring the ACCC to report to parliament and, secondly, picking up the very important issue of the disclosure of the GST on receipts. If you are sincere in saying that the Australian populace is not to be exploited, you do not need to bring in draconian legislation that is out of sync with the rest of the Trade Practices Act. You do not need to introduce it at all. The only thing you have not brought back is something akin to the Spanish Inquisition to punish those people.
—Oh, Hoggy, you're struggling!
—That is the only thing you have not done, Senator Kemp. 
—Even Senator Sherry would be better than this.
—Senator Kemp, if you are sincere in this—and we know you have difficulties on some occasions—pick up the issue of disclosure of GST on receipts. Let the Australian people have some faith in what you are doing. I am not struggling at all, Senator Kemp. You have imposed this, and you have to take the responsibility. You should redress the issue now, not by bringing in this horrendous piece of legislation—which threatens people who speak their minds on exploitation—but by absorbing the excellent amendments foreshadowed by my colleague Senator Conroy. That is indeed imperative.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-05-11,"—Ned Kelly was a great Victorian and indeed a great Australian folk hero. 
—Who was? 
—Ned Kelly. He was born in Beveridge in Victoria and carried out his operations mainly in the north-east of Victoria. His parents were married in the St Francis church in Melbourne—a very eminent church down there. But he was hung on 11 November 1880 and, according to Manning Clark, Alfred Deakin was present as a reporter. Barry Jones says that is not correct and that Manning Clark was wrong on that. But, in any event, Alfred Deakin went on to become a very eminent Victorian, a very eminent Australian and a very eminent Prime Minister. When he was Prime Minister, he introduced, as everybody knows, the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1907. That was the first act that was introduced, as far as I can see, that dealt with trade practices. Of course, there was a lot of precedent in America. 
—What has this got to do with Ned Kelly?
—Didn't you follow all that? 
—I am lost.
—Stay lost; it is a safe position for you to be in. The idea behind Alfred Deakin's legislation is the same idea that has been behind all legislation of a similar nature since then—that is, to arrange things so that people can operate in the market in a fair way and so that people do not, through power, whether economic power or any other power, suppress those with less power, so things are fair and everybody gets a fair go, as we would say in Australia. Sir Alfred Deakin had that very much in mind when he attempted to obtain that situation very early on in the history of Australia. Unfortunately, the High Court said that section 51(xx) of the Constitution did not support that particular legislation, so the idea of a trade practices act went out of people's thinking for a while. 
Sir Garfield Barwick brought it back as an idea when he became a member of parliament. He tried very hard to get a trade practices act up; he could not, but Mr Billy Snedden did. He got up the Trade Practices Act, which was then overruled by the Rocla Concrete Pipes case in 1971 mainly on technical grounds. But the decision in that encouraged the McMahon government to bring in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971. In the end, the person who got the present Trade Practices Act under way and got the present system going was Lionel Murphy, and a lot of credit in this area must go to him. In fact, that act was challenged but the High Court upheld it—with the dissension of the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick. It was very interesting to see that the man who brought trade practices back as an idea in the 1950s and 1960s was the one judge that held out against the legislation that was introduced and passed under the guidance of Mr Lionel Murphy. That is the interesting background to this area. 
What I want to illustrate is that the traditions and the history of the legislation we are considering today, the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000, go to those issues of preserving the market as it should be preserved, ensuring that people do not use economic power in an oppressive way and ensuring that everyone who wants to can set up in business and can go forward without oppression. Given that, this present legislation is quite awkward. I think that the Trade Practices Act should deal with that idea of trade being conducted in a fair and free way. It is for that reason that I think provisions—this is an issue that has often been raised in this chamber from this side—dealing with secondary boycotts and dealing with actions against unions should certainly not be in this act because it deals with other matters; it does not deal with trade practices as they are understood. This is an even greater example of how the act has been amended in a way that does not fit in with the history of this legislation, from the first decade of Federation on, in various ways, and particularly since the 1950s. This does not deal with oppressive conduct, and it does not deal with keeping the marketplace free and open; it deals specifically with an issue that is to operate for only two years, as I understand it. Why is that done? 
This is clearly a wrong use of this piece of legislation. It is done in a way that does not conform to history. It is aimed at limiting prices in a particular set of circumstances. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, in 1973 there was a referendum conducted in this area in which the Whitlam government sought power over prices and wages. That was rejected. What has been said since, or even indeed before that time, by people on the conservative side of politics is that competition is the way to keep prices in order. If that is so, why do we have a piece of legislation here which is quite draconian in the way it operates? 
I simply want to make the point—and perhaps we will return to this in the committee stage—that these are amendments that are very hard to understand, except in the terms that have been put forward already. The government is very apprehensive of how the goods and services tax will impact on the community and it wants to ensure that the blame, if there is to be any blame, goes elsewhere. This piece of legislation is aimed at deflecting criticism rather than at arranging things so that the marketplace operates as it should and so that people do not suffer oppression, as they should not. There has been a great struggle for people over the years, which culminated in Mr Lionel Murphy's legislation which in the end brought forward a good way of dealing with things. If we as legislators introduce this sort of legislation into an act that has served a great purpose, we are devaluing the legislation that should operate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I do not wish to take up much of the time of the chamber in the second reading debate on the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. I will reserve the comments that I have on the bill for the debate in the committee stage. However, on behalf of the opposition, I do want to move the following second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “and that the Senate notes:
	(a)	the claim by the Minister for Financial Services (Mr Hockey) in press release number FSR/003, headed “Hockey directs ACCC on GST”, dated 15 January 2000, that “The Minister for Financial Services, Joe Hockey today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%;
	(b)	the further statement in the same press release that “No price will increase by more than 10% as a result of the GST. That is our policy and that is the law;
	(c)	the clear admission by the Chair of the ACCC (Professor Fels) to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on Monday, 1 May 2000, that neither Minister Hockey, nor any other government Minister had issued such a direction and that a 10% price cap is not set out in legislation; and
	(d)	that, Minister Hockey has grossly misled the Australian public and is accordingly censured by the Senate”.
I want to make a couple of brief points in relation to this matter. This press release was issued on 15 January. Minister Hockey was asked a number of questions on the matter in the other house on Monday during question time. At no stage did the minister take the opportunity during that period to explain why he made those comments or why he put out the press release. At no time has he endeavoured over that four-month period to explain why he made such compelling statements in that press release of 15 January and, more importantly, why this government has been complicit in that deception since that date. 
Not only has Minister Hockey not attempted to explain his actions of 15 January; neither has any other government minister from the Prime Minister down. Knowing full well that the information contained in the press release was incorrect, not one minister from the Prime Minister down sought at any stage over that period to rebuke Minister Hockey for those statements or in fact to expose the deception that had been practised on the Australian community by the issuing of that press release. It is appropriate that this Senate express its views in respect to that matter in particular.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-11,"—The A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000 is about misrepresentations in relation to the effect of tax changes under the new tax system. Last year this parliament passed amendments to the Trade Practices Act, inserting a new part VB into that act which, firstly, prohibits corporations charging unreasonably high prices for the supply of goods having regard to the new tax system changes and, secondly, empowers the ACCC to monitor prices for a period of one year before and two years after the implementation of the GST.
The legislation also introduced the new tax system price exploitation code. Because of constitutional limitations, all states and territories, except the ACT, have implemented a uniform new tax system price exploitation code. That state legislation essentially gives the ACCC the same powers and functions as those in part VB, but in respect of individuals rather than corporations. Clearly, the intention of that legislation is to prevent profiteering on the tax changes either by failing to pass on cost reductions that result from the removal of wholesale sales tax and other taxes or by increasing the price of a good by more than the actual price effect of the GST on an item. Most public attention has been on price but cost reductions are as important an issue.
I will turn to this bill, the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. The bill seeks to extend the scope of the regulatory regime in part VB to cover misrepresentation about the effect of tax changes during the transition to the new tax system. The sorts of conduct which are the subject of concern and which the bill seeks to outlaw are claims that a consumer is required to pay an amount for the GST when, in fact, the obligation does not take effect until 1 July 2000 or advertisements which encourage consumers to buy goods or services now in order to beat the GST when prices may fall rather than rise under the new tax system. Under the amendments, a contravention of the new provision will attract a pecuniary penalty of up to $10 million for a corporation and up to $500,000 for an individual. These penalties are consistent with the existing penalties for price exploitation under part VB which, as I have said, have been agreed to by the states—Labor and coalition alike.
In the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearings into this bill, the issue which arose was the size of the maximum penalties which could be imposed for a breach of the new provision. Professor Warren Pengilley from the University of Newcastle raised serious concerns about the inconsistency in penalties for ordinary misleading and deceptive conduct and misleading conduct in relation to the new tax system—and `ordinary' is the word he used. He suggested, `Equity demands that all be put on the same basis in so far as penalties are concerned.'
The ACCC's response in relation to the extent of the penalties was that it had `always argued that the current penalties are too low and should be increased'. The representative of Treasury conceded that there is an issue in respect of the consistency of penalty levels. On that basis, the Democrats think it is appropriate for the government to give consideration to the current maximum penalties applying for breaches of section 53 of the act and to determine whether those penalties are adequate or whether they ought to be brought into line with the penalties which apply for a contravention of the provisions of this bill. In other words, the argument should not be to drop the penalties that are proposed by the bill but, in fact, to increase the penalties that are in existence in the act. That is a far more important focus for the Senate, in my belief, which would give the ACCC increased clout and which has been conceded by Treasury and advocated by the ACCC. 
The penalties set out in the Trade Practices Act are maximum penalties. The precise penalty that applies to each particular contravention is adjudged by a court based on, among other things, the gravity of the offence. You cannot argue in one bill that the courts should have the ability to determine these things on a reasonable basis and with judgment and discretion and then, when you reach this bill, argue that the courts will not be able to do that properly and effectively. Consistency demands that we should accept that courts would be able to adjudicate what is a reasonable mistake, what is reasonable to be considered under these provisions and whether the maximum penalty or some lesser penalty applies.
The nature and size of corporations and the types of conduct in which they can engage, particularly multinational corporations, mean that penalties must be sufficiently substantial to have a deterrent effect. It should not be the case that a very large corporation can decide to deliberately engage in unlawful conduct because it knows that, even if the maximum penalty is applied for the breach, the revenue it has derived as a result of the breach will exceed the amount of that maximum penalty. As an aside, it is my understanding that that is the reason why penalties were recently increased fivefold for aircraft departing Sydney airport during the curfew period. Penalties must be high enough to have a deterrent effect, and that is plainly the case with this bill. 
I will just comment briefly on Labor's amendments—and I will deal with them at a greater level during the debate. Labor's separate itemisation of the GST on receipts approach is a rehash of previous amendments that it has put up, and I will comment on that yet again when we deal with it later. Legislating that the Chairman of the ACCC will appear before a House of Representatives standing committee is simply not necessary. Both houses have the right to subpoena. Both houses, if they wish, can make people appear before them. There is no reason whatsoever that we should have legislation for Professor Fels, members of the commission or its staff that enacts something which both houses already have the power to insist on. We do not support limiting the prohibition on misrepresentations to misrepresentations that occur for price exploitation alone, and we will comment on that. Also, we will be amending Labor's amendment relating to applying these provisions to the government.
The other amendment that was read out by Senator George Campbell, which is a second reading amendment, attracted my attention until I heard the last phrase. Frankly, if the Labor Party were asking the government to ensure that it complies with the press release put out by Minister Hockey and saying that it should give a direction, if that were missing, to the ACCC, then the Australian Democrats would support that. But a motion of censure on that basis is just not sensible. Surely the question is really whether the ACCC have been given direction or not. Therefore, we think that Labor's amendment is misfocused. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill and we look forward to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-05-11,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. The government is particularly keen to have this legislation passed today. Clearly, the government, with the support of the Australian Democrats in this regard, is very, very keen to ensure that the legislative and regulatory framework that surrounds the introduction of the new tax system, particularly in relation to the provisions under the Trade Practices Act which relate to the introduction of the GST, sends a very loud signal to people that, if they seek to avoid or contravene the act, they will have very severe penalties applied to them. We make no apology whatsoever for bringing in very clear and increased penalties under this regime, and we believe it is very much in the interests of Australia and the smooth introduction of a new tax system that this legislation be passed today. 
We have had private discussions with the Australian Labor Party, who have made it clear that that will not happen, which we clearly regard as less than desirable. We have had another indication today that a part of the Australian Labor Party—that is, the CPSU—are taking action again within a section of the tax office to again try to stick a spanner in the wheel of a smooth introduction of the tax act, which I know would appal you more than most in this place, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson. So here again the Labor Party, the Labor movement generally, will do whatever it takes. They will ignore the interests of consumers. They will ignore the interests of small business people who want to get on with lodging their applications for Australian business numbers. They will do whatever it takes for their narrow, pathetic, political interests.
The further thing they have done is totally unprecedented in this place, on the advice I have been able to get in the short time since this pathetic, puerile and pious second reading amendment has been distributed and moved by Senator George Campbell. It is the first time in Australian Senate history that they have tried to censure a minister by way of a second reading amendment. That is on the advice I have been able to get today, and I am happy to stand corrected. This is a sad and sorry opposition who have no policies, who are effectively a one-trick pony—all they can do is bash the GST day in and day out. They tried bashing the surplus this week. They tried to change their political tack, they tried a new concept, and bashed the surplus. In fact, Mr Crean was so keen on bashing the surplus that he said he would spend it. These guys are so good at deficits and, after seeing a surplus, what did Mr Crean say on television the other night? In answer to the question, `What would you do with a surplus?' he said, `We'd spend it.' He was not sure what he would spend it on, but he said he would look around and see if he could find something to spend it on. He said, `We'll invest it in the future of the nation.' That's a beauty! That is what Labor say when they see a surplus, `Let's spend it as quick as we can and let's get back into deficit. Let's get those interest rates racking up.'
What have they done today? To delay, to confuse and to stop the trade practices amendments going in which will add to the protections for consumers in Australia, they have said, `Let's censure Mr Hockey.' Normally when you censure a minister—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you have been here through a number of censure motions in your time—you allow there to be a proper debate on the censure, a structured debate where the minister can have his position defended. You would normally have discussions with the opposition parties, the government parties and the other parties in this place about how many speakers you might have. There would be arrangements put in place by the whip, but today we have come in here and, with about three minutes notice, they have said that we are going to have a censure motion. They will do anything to stop this coming through, including tagging on a censure motion to a pious second reading amendment. I do not know who is running the tactics on the other side, but whoever he is should be cross-examined, if not have their head examined, by more senior and more sensible people in the opposition.
To pull on a censure of a minister with less than 50 minutes to go in the time allocated for debate is one of the most gross violations of proper procedure. It is totally unprecedented in Senate history, as far as our records show. It absolutely shows how bereft the Australian Labor Party are not only of policy but also of tactical implementation of a debate. We want this bill through this place today. We want to ensure that consumers get the benefit of these significant protections, but the Australian Labor Party have made it clear now privately, and probably in a few minutes time publicly, that they do not want it through for the next three weeks. We would like it in place. We would like this scheme up and running. It could be today, if we could get it passed before a quarter to one, but these wreckers, these anarchists, on the other side of the chamber have made it clear that that will not take place. We will be opposing this stupid, pious, pathetic, puerile amendment, and we will be supporting the second reading, of course.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-05-11,"—by leave—If I can respond to a couple of Senator Ian Campbell's earlier comments, it is no surprise to see this government so sensitive on this issue when it was so badly exposed last week. The government has tried to argue that states require two months before 1 July to implement this. But on the Treasurer's own words we are only 53 days from 1 July—probably 52 or 50 days by now. So in actual fact we are inside the two months right now. The states have the power, which this government acknowledges, to vary the implementation date. So for this government to argue that we must have this because we have to get it in before the two months to give the states two months is a furphy. We are already inside the two months. 
The opposition and the Democrats have cooperated with the government to rush through a Senate inquiry so that we could have the Senate committee report last Tuesday so we could begin the debate today. Notwithstanding the fact that we have cooperated at every stage of this bill, more and more evidence is coming forward about this bill and the difficulties inherent in this bill. For this government to be trying to suggest that we are trying to stop the passage of this bill is a complete and utter furphy and should be exposed as one. We are prepared to vote for this bill; we are not prepared to participate in a whitewash. We are prepared to legitimately examine this bill, and we have a series of amendments and a string of questions that this government has to answer. The revelations that came out in the Senate inquiry where Mr Fels exposed Minister Hockey, where Mr Fels exposed the government for being engaged in a propaganda exercise, deserve the time of this chamber. They deserve legitimate scrutiny. 
We will not be bullied by this government. We will not be bullied into a whitewash. We will not be bullied into agreeing to not go through legitimate process and legitimate scrutiny of this bill. I am looking forward to the committee stage because I have a series of questions to put to this government which we hope that this government will give us answers to. So for all the rantings and ravings from Senator Campbell on the other side of the chamber— 
—He didn't defend Hockey. 
—Thank you, Senator Sherry. He did not defend Minister Hockey. 
—Not one word. 
—You withdrew the censure motion, you fool. 
 (Senator Watson)—Order! 
—Thank you for taking charge there, Senator Watson. I appreciate that. We will not be bullied and intimidated by this government, which is desperate to cover the political lies that were exposed last week. This Senate will go through the committee process. We will go through the legitimate processes of this parliament, and we will examine the testimony of Mr Fels. 
—Professor Fels.  
—I stand corrected, Senator Lightfoot—Professor Fels. Thank you for that. We will legitimately scrutinise Professor Fels's testimony and we will reconcile it with the government's position. The suggestion that this is being deliberately delayed is a complete and utter further gag and further misleading of the Australian public. You should be ashamed of yourselves for continuing the thuggish tactics that you have been engaged in in trying to push this through and the thuggish tactics that you are engaged in today.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-05-11,"—It is pleasing to note that this bill obviously enjoys the support of the Senate. While this bill makes a number of changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, it inserts new offences for the importation, manufacture, exportation and supply of counterfeit therapeutic goods; clarifies the operation of an existing offence in section 21 of the act; and inserts an additional ground for cancelling therapeutic goods from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. The effect of this cancellation is to remove a sponsor's right to import, export, manufacture and supply therapeutic goods for use by humans. These are important provisions, and I am pleased to note the support of the Senate.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-05-11,"—This bill provides for an exemption from the Medicare levy for low income individuals and families. An exemption from liability for the Medicare levy surcharge is also provided by reference to the low income threshold. The bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 and provide for increases in the thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents. For example, the threshold for individuals is to be increased from $13,389 to $13,550 and the threshold for couples with no children is to be increased from $22,594 to $22,865. As a result of the increases in the thresholds, the bill will also increase the upper level of shading-in of the Medicare levy for individuals. The increases are in line with the increases in the consumer price index. I extend my appreciation to members of the opposition, the Democrats and the Independents. In discussions outside of the chamber they have indicated that they will support this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

—What a wimp!
—Yes, I know. Why should we ask this guy a question when we will not get an answer? But we will give it another go. Can the minister confirm that residents of apartments with strata titles who contribute levies which amount to more than $50,000 a year will have to pay an additional 10 per cent on their levies, while residents in smaller apartment blocks, where the total levies amount to less than $50,000, will not have to pay the additional 10 per cent? Can the minister confirm that? Why is the government discriminating against people living in buildings with many apartments?

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-05-11,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I was pleased to hear, during the minister's attempt at an answer, that Senator Knowles is compiling a list of questions. She is no doubt practising for the day when she is in opposition. Minister, where is the fairness in taxing residents of apartment blocks in accordance with the number of apartments in the blocks? Does the minister agree that this is a totally arbitrary distinction to make?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-11,"—I always try to help the Labor Party with answers to questions. They never listen. One of the astonishing things is that the Labor Party stand up and try to attack the GST in the chamber. It may come as a surprise to some of the public to know that the Labor Party have signed on to the GST. Mr Beazley has confirmed that the Labor Party will be going to the next election with the GST as part of their package. So an issue which we can easily debate after question time in relation to the good senator's question is: does he propose to change the current arrangements for strata titles? The senator is trying to make a political point and pretending to people that somehow the Labor Party have not signed on to this system lock, stock and barrel. They have. So we are going to listen. My colleague Senator Knowles is keeping a massive list on this issue of the areas for roll-back where Labor senators have stood up and queried aspects of the GST. We may well put this down on the roll-back.
—So Senator Knowles has already conceded we're going to win the next election!
—The senator calls out, `We're are going to win!' We heard that last time, Senator, and we happen to be over here and you are over there. In relation to the specifics of the question, individuals, partnerships, companies, trusts and other entities undertaking an enterprise are required to register in the GST system if their annual turnover is $50,000 or more. An entity with an annual turnover below this threshold does not have to register but can choose to register—in fact, may well choose to register. If such an entity elects not to register, it does not have to charge GST on its supplies, and it will not be entitled to claim input credits. Whether owners of strata titled units rented out will be considered as carrying on an enterprise may well have to be determined on a case by case basis. The point of the matter is that the general principle for the registration level is $50,000. If the Labor Party has a different registration level, this is big news. Let me say to this chamber that, if the Labor Party proposes to change the registration level, this is big news. Senator Forshaw, if you get up and ask a supplementary question, I think the public would be very interested to know whether, under the ALP GST policy, you propose to change the registration level.

"PRESIDENT,The",N/A,2000-05-11,"—Senator Gibson, the Deputy Chair of the Economics References Committee, by letter dated 6 April 2000, has raised a matter of privilege under standing order 81. The matter is an unauthorised disclosure of evidence taken in camera by the committee. Press reports indicate that Senator Murphy, a member of the committee, disclosed that a particular witness gave evidence to the committee in camera. Senator Gibson's letter indicates that Senator Murphy has confirmed that he made such a disclosure. Senator Murphy, by letter dated 11 April 2000, has set out the circumstances of the disclosure.
The resolution of the Senate of 20 June 1996, adopting recommendations of the Privileges Committee, requires committees to take certain steps in relation to unauthorised disclosures of committee evidence or documents. The committee has substantially, but not completely, conformed with these requirements. The Senate's resolution also provides that nothing in the resolution affects the right of a senator to raise a matter of privilege under standing order 81. I therefore regard the matter as having been duly raised.
I am required to determine, having regard to certain criteria, whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence. Past decisions of the Senate and the Privileges Committee indicate that the disclosure of in camera committee evidence is a matter which is always taken extremely seriously and which meets the criteria which I am required to consider. It may be thought that there is no point in referring the matter to the Privileges Committee because there is nothing for the committee to inquire into, in that a senator has conceded that he made the unauthorised disclosure. The Senate may well consider, however, that the Privileges Committee should be called upon formally to find the fact and the circumstances of the unauthorised disclosure and to advise the Senate on what action, if any, should be taken. I therefore give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. It will be for the Senate to determine whether the referral should occur. I table the letters from Senator Gibson and Senator Murphy.
Because the Senate will adjourn today for a period of more than one week, under standing order 81(7) Senator Gibson may now move a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee.
Motion (by Senator Calvert, at the request of Senator Gibson)— proposed: 
That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges:
Having regard to the material presented to the Senate by the President on 11 May 2000, whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of in camera proceedings of the Economics References Committee, and, if so, whether any contempt was committed and whether any action should be taken by the Senate in consequence.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Privilege</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-05-11,"—This is a response to the motion proposed by Senator Gibson. The issue that arose related to the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the operations of the Australian Taxation Office. What happened at the time was that we did take a lot of in camera evidence, and there were some reports in the media with regard to the arrest of one witness that actually appeared before the committee. The circumstances were that the journalist that I spoke to was writing a story which was inaccurate and would have reflected on a particular public officer in a very serious and incorrect way. What I said to the journalist that led to the identification of some in camera evidence—and I have acknowledged that in my letter to you, Madam President—was to prevent that possible reflection on that very senior public servant.
Having said that, I would also like to say that Senator Gibson, other government members and the Democrat member of the committee subsequently asked me to put out a statement with regard to events that took place and evidence that was received in camera. That statement was to identify in camera evidence, and its purpose was to to correct a position that had been, in the view of the committee, incorrectly stated. That in camera evidence is contained in a statement which was issued—I am sorry I cannot say the date, but not that long ago—and which in effect identified further in camera evidence.
I am not quite sure what Senator Gibson's intentions are, but I found it interesting that, when the government felt that a public officer, a senior public servant, had been misrepresented in the press, they saw fit to encourage me to put out a statement that disclosed in camera evidence. I did so because I felt it appropriate, and I would do so again.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-11,"—by leave—I appreciate the courtesy of the Senate in allowing me to make a short statement about my loud no in the vote on the motion. Very briefly, the committee, of which I was a member—and I must declare that interest—had known about the Petroulias affair, as it now is, way before it became a public issue. I think we first heard about it in the last quarter of last year. I must say that with my experience of Senate committees I was gratified to discover there was at least one committee where the Labor members, the coalition members and the Democrat member kept their mouths shut. However, this matter did appear in the media, and the chair was forced to react to questions to him. I was obviously not present during the discourse, but in my experience his actions thereafter have been at all times to protect the integrity of the committee, the integrity of the committee members and the integrity of the tax officer, without interfering with the natural justice required for the former tax officer. In this instance, my judgment is that the chair affected should not be asked to go the Privileges Committee. He has confirmed—
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I am reluctant to intervene, but Senator Murray simply asked for leave to speak to his loud no, which I took to mean he wanted to make some procedural point. What he is now doing is speaking to the motion. He could have done that; he chose not to. The purpose of referring the matter to the Privileges Committee—in line with your ruling, Madam President—was so that the matter can be properly considered there. I understand why Senator Murray might want to put some things on the record at this point, but he will have an opportunity, and so will all others at that later stage. So I ask you, Madam President, to rule that Senator Murray is out of order, because he is going well beyond the basis on which he was granted leave to speak.
—Madam President, on the point of order, my view has been pretty consistent on these issues: that at the end of the day these matters are better dealt with in committees than in the Senate at this point. That is why I did not vote no on the motion standing in the name of Senator Gibson which was before the chair. I might say, Madam President, I was not aware that you were going to make a statement. I do not believe anyone in the opposition was made aware that a matter of privilege would be raised after question time today. That is another matter. 
—Senator Murphy was.
—I do not believe Senator Murphy was aware. But that is another issue. In this instance the opposition—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators should not be calling out to each other across the chamber.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—That is not a substantive point. That is not the point I making. I just make clear that the opposition—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators will come to order.
—On the point of order raised by Senator Alston, the opposition did not oppose the reference of this matter to the Privileges Committee. I happen to believe it is the proper function of the Privileges Committee to deal with such matters. I also believe it is proper for the Senate to examine this issue on receipt of a report from the Privileges Committee. And although I think it is competent for Senator Murray, if he is given leave, to make a statement in the chamber, I think those general principles which the opposition applied in this instance by not voting against the referral are worthy of serious consideration by all senators.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.
The fact of the matter is that I referred this question to the minister's office earlier today. Given that the answer is almost 12 months overdue, I regard it as being incumbent on the minister to have some form of explanation for not having answered the question. That question was about a very important matter. It was about the findings of SANE Australia's national survey of services for older Australians with a mental illness. My question was:
(1)	What, if any, action is the Government taking to address the following findings of Sane Australia's National Survey of Services for Older Australians with a Mental Illness 1999: (a) negative attitudes towards older people with a mental illness, particularly those found within some mental health services; (b) the lack of policy and funding aimed at the special needs of people growing older with a mental illness, as distinct from those with dementia; (c) the urgent need for improved community and in-patient mental health services targeted at people growing older with a mental illness including improved liaison with psychogeriatric, dual disability and other specialists, general aged care services, general practitioners and staff at hospitals and nursing homes; (d) medication issues for older Australians with mental illness including the prescription of traditional antipsychotic medications at high doses which are infrequently reviewed; (e) too few disability support services available for older Australians with mental illness; (f) large numbers of older people with mental illness who are inappropriately `warehoused' in hostel and boarding houses; (g) the lack of decent supported accommodation for older people with a mental illness; (h) the lack of support and training for general practitioners who are the main providers of clinical care for older people with a mental illness; (i) home and community care services which do not have the resources to meet the needs of older people with a mental illness; and (j) inadequate training for staff in general aged care services, hostels and nursing homes working with people growing older with mental illness. 
Will the Government work towards extending those successful existing programs which focus on supporting older people with a mental illness in the community.
These are urgent matters, and it was incumbent on the minister to respond to that question a long time ago—in fact, in September of last year. Instead of that we are now in May and the question is still not answered. In spite of my giving notice, the minister has come to the chamber without any sort of explanation as to why the question has not been answered.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1252</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I wish to make a few remarks on the issue that Senator Allison has raised to support her concerns about the delays from the office of the Minister for Aged Care in responding to questions on notice. This is not an isolated case. In my office we have had a number of questions on notice that have experienced the same sorts of delays as Senator Allison has raised. This is an important issue being raised in the Senate today, because it is interesting that generally the slowness of the response is related to the political sensitivity of the question. I think it is appalling that the minister has failed to respond to questions on notice and to questions asked at estimates. The delay has been months and months. The most classic example of this is the question that we asked on notice about surprise inspections of nursing homes. It took us months and months to get an answer to a question about whether or not surprise inspections had been carried out in nursing homes. Finally, the evidence came forward that in fact there had been no surprise inspections, contrary to what the minister had been saying in the House of Representatives.
I want to put it on record that Senator Herron has in general been very good at assisting in trying to get answers. I also want to put it on record that in terms of the questions that I have pursued at estimates the department has indicated that on most occasions the answers have in fact been provided to the minister's office in reasonable time and have not been processed through the minister's office and delivered to senators. So the delay seems to be in the office of the Minister for Aged Care—or the Minister for Age, as she is sometimes known these days. It is a very serious problem. Although Senator Herron has to answer for it in this chamber, I think the delay is in the minister's office—in Minister Bishop's reluctance to answer questions placed on notice or asked at estimates that highlight her inadequacies in the portfolio. That is not acceptable. I think we need to get a better response. I felt it important that I support Senator Allison's concerns because, as I know Senator Herron will vouch, I have had to raise with him on a number of occasions the lateness of responses given. We need to try to address that. We pursued this at estimates quite strongly, and I recommend that you look at the Hansard, Senator Allison, in terms of the answers from the department about where the delays are and when they have returned questions to the minister's office. It makes interesting reading, and I think it highlights the problem. I therefore want to join Senator Allison in making my concerns known and in suggesting that we have to get a much better performance out of the Minister for Aged Care in responding to these questions.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1252</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-05-11,"—I thank Senator Evans and Senator Allison for their statements. I think it is important to note that there are reasons behind certain delays. By way of illustration, I know in my own portfolio that to produce an accurate answer to a question—because the answers have to be accurate as they are on the public record and there can be no fudging of the responses to the questions—the detail has to be gone into very carefully. For example, in my portfolio, if a question is asked about a particular community organisation, it goes through the local regional council, then to the state office and finally to the national office. It then has to go through that chain while the veracity of the answer is checked before again going back through that chain. Ultimately the answer is then provided to the question. Often that process takes weeks, if not months. That is one reason for delay.
The second reason for delay is that sometimes the detail required to answer questions is quite extensive and there are often a number of questions asked, so again that takes an inordinate amount of time. In many cases these questions affect different departments and different portfolios, so that is a further cause for delay. The final point I would make is that sometimes the number of questions directed to a particular portfolio results in a delay. I speak more particularly here of the health portfolio rather than the aged care portfolio—although aged care, as Senator Allison and Senator Evans recognise, has been under public scrutiny for most of this year, if not for a lot of last year. So I think there are reasons for this occurring. All ministers like to get these questions out of the way and responded to, because it is the entitlement of the opposition and the Australian public to get answers to those questions as expeditiously as possible. 
In relation to the question that Senator Allison brought up, one of the reasons that I was unable to bring the answer forward to the Senate this afternoon—and as I understand it, Senator Allison kindly faxed a copy of this particular question to the minister's office asking if she could have an answer to it and pointing out that an answer had been months in forthcoming—is that the minister and the department did not have time to produce it by this afternoon, but they will address the question as expeditiously as possible. That is why I responded in the way that I did. I will get back to the Senate as soon as the minister can provide that answer.
I accept finally that the opposition should look at the mote in their own eye. I had the unkind privilege of being in opposition for six years, and we repeatedly brought out this point about the Labor Party and the delays that we were experiencing in getting answers to questions. This is not new.
—You should get it after 30 days.
—What Senator O'Brien said is true. It is true that there is a time limit on this, but I am pointing out that we are not the only ones who have transgressed in this regard. I am trying to explain why delays occur. We will do what we can. I approached the minister in relation to Senator Evans's questions, and we provided those. I will get back to Senator Allison as soon as possible in response to the question that she has just raised.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Conroy today, relating to the 2001-01 budget and Telstra.
We have the unedifying spectacle of the Treasurer delivering his fifth budget after 10 years of sustained growth doing his level best to destroy his own budget and incidentally attack and harm a company 51 per cent owned by the government and 49 per cent owned by various private interests. The budget surplus, as we know, is phoney enough when based upon the sale of licences related to the use of thin air, when only a month ago the government refused to disclose figures for non-asset sales on the grounds that it might affect auction results if indicative figures were disclosed.
To avoid criticism of that backdown, the Treasurer deliberately and with malevolence attacked a leading telco capitalised at $50 billion or $60 billion on the Australian Stock Exchange. This attack comes in the public knowledge that the government has partially privatised Telstra on two occasions and has given an undertaking to further privatise Telstra only after a full public inquiry into service levels. In that context, the Australian Treasurer attacked Telstra by shooting off some comments about Telstra's dividend payout capacity and next year's expected dividends. Immediately, the markets reacted by slashing capitalisation by $1 billion and more than $500 million each from the government share and that of private sector interests.
Look at what the budget papers say on this issue. The budget papers refer to lower Commonwealth dividend receipts from some government business enterprises and lower dividends from the Reserve Bank—nothing else. There is no specific mention of Telstra, no oblique reference to Telstra and no implied criticism of Telstra. In fact, it is clear that the Treasurer and the government have had knowledge of advanced dividends and special dividend payments because it has been in previous budget papers and on the public record for the last 2½ years.
The Treasurer, behaving grossly unfairly in attempting to distract attention from his phoney spectrum sale surplus by attacking Telstra, then refuses to take calls from Telstra executives, ostensibly on the grounds it would be pre-budget comment. The Treasurer refuses to talk to Telstra and encourages the market to wreck and lower the price of an asset owned by some two million Australians. In the final analysis, the Treasurer attacks Telstra, harms the assets of two million Australians and reduces the value of long-term investments held by institutions, both domestic and foreign. Telstra has to defend its own company in the marketplace by going public. Telstra denies it delivered any bad news at all to the government. It was Mr Costello who told reporters that Telstra had delivered `very bad news' on future dividend payments. What was Telstra's public response? Telstra said, and I quote the Australian Financial Review:
[His comments] were not helpful from the perspective they could be construed that the company was performing badly ... We didn't give Costello bad news at all.
So there we have the facts in full. We have a phoney budget surplus from the Treasurer. We have an attack by the press, who understood this immediately, on the government. The strategy of the Treasurer is to deflect the tension by creating an alternative news story. That alternative story misrepresents the facts and harms the government asset and two million Australians. Telstra immediately attempts to gain a retraction. The Treasurer, for reasons unknown, refuses to take the calls from the relevant executives of Telstra. Telstra then denies giving any bad news to the government. What a weird and wonderful exercise we have been subject to this week for no apparent reason. We have a real sale, in due course, giving us a current phoney budget, the government gets attacked on that and the Treasurer, to deflect this criticism from his own actions, makes up the story that Telstra has given him bad news.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-05-11,"—I am a bit disappointed. I would not have expected Senator Bishop to go over the top in the way that he has. I suppose he is under instructions from his WA colleague, and he has to get in there and show solidarity. But it is a very grubby attack. It is not one that he would for a moment contemplate making outside the parliament, because he knows where he would end up.
—Oh, come on!
—If you do not believe me, just try it. The facts are that Mr Costello acted with absolute propriety at all stages, had no inside information and did not accuse Telstra of anything at all. The suggestion is that somehow something that was said caused him to wreck the market price of Telstra. If you look at what happened yesterday, the share price of Telstra fell 9c—it has fallen for seven consecutive days—the share price of Optus fell 35c and Hutchison went down 38c. Are you going to blame the Treasurer for that? Of course not. It is an absolute nonsense. So let us look at the facts. The Treasurer's comments that the Commonwealth dividend would be lower for the financial year ending 2001 are attributable to the fact that no special dividend has been planned for the next financial year, and the Commonwealth shareholding has decreased from 66.6 per cent to 50.1 per cent—and we all know why that is and why it ought to go further. Mr Costello, with the responsibility to maximise non-tax revenue, was simply pointing out that he was disappointed that he would not get as much money as he would like from the RBA and Telstra. Fortunately, we have what you choose to characterise as `thin air' revenue.
—I know where you get that term from. It comes from a book written by one of Tony Blair's advisers. Presumably, Mr Beazley believes most of what Mr Blair says. He ought to at least take a bit of advice from him and not roll over to the unions every day of the week. But just to be perfectly clear, as far as Mr Stanhope is concerned, my understanding is that no attempt was made to contact the Treasurer. The remarks attributed to Mr Stanhope in the paper this morning are therefore incorrect. It is quite wrong to say that Mr Costello's remarks were not helpful. I read other reports indicating that fund managers had had it explained to them by Telstra that there may have been some misunderstanding but the facts were that Mr Costello thought it was bad news for the budget that he was not going to get the special dividend he got last year.
—Are you saying that Stanhope lied?
—I am simply saying that the press report suggesting that the Treasurer refused to take calls from Mr Stanhope is absolutely incorrect.
—That's what it says in the paper.
—No, it is not in the paper. It does not say that at all.
—Page 1, Australian Financial Review.
—No, it did not say that he had refused to take calls. It said something like, `Mr Stanhope claimed that he had been unable to see the Treasurer.'
—It says `attempts to discuss the matter with the Treasurer yesterday morning had been fruitless'. 
—Yes, that is right. That is not refusing to take calls. Either of those constructions is wrong. If Mr Stanhope was talking to someone at the office, so be it. But he certainly was not attempting to speak to Mr Costello. Mr Costello had no knowledge of Mr Stanhope wanting to contact him. But why should Mr Stanhope be wanting to contact him? There is no basis at all. Other Telstra executives understood the facts of life. You want to wilfully misrepresent those facts. The facts are that he was simply expressing understandable disappointment that we were not going to get the special dividend this year. If you really want to know what might be affecting Telstra's performance, just look at what Moody's and Standard and Poor's had to say. They pointed the finger right at you lot, and this is going to be a massive credibility issue for you come the next election.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Market Value</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,speech
"Conroy, Senator Stephen",ALP,2000-05-11,"—That was absolutely pathetic from the government. Senator Alston has to stand up in here and continue the smokescreen. What happened in that budget lockup was that the government were in panic: their surplus, their strategy, was in tatters and the Treasurer needed some cover. What did he decide to do with no regard whatsoever for the ordinary shareholders in Telstra? He decides to trash the Telstra management. We have had Mr Stanhope quoted as saying in the papers today:
I don't know what the Treasurer was thinking. All I know is that the words used could be construed as saying that the business was not performing well. 
We have seen the front-page headline of the Financial Review: `Telstra takes on Costello'. We have the Australian headed `Telstra in damage control' and we have Mr Westfield's article headed `Costello shoots from lip at telco' which stated: 
Peter Costello's Budget night gaffe suggesting Telstra's dividend outlook was “bad news, very bad news” has only compounded the selling pressure ...
We have a government in panic that is prepared to do and say anything to cover up its budget strategy that is in tatters. We have had calls for urgent strategy talks. Institutional investors are pushing for urgent talks with Telstra on the back of the incompetence and deceit of this Treasurer. I would like to be able to stand before you today and tell you that it is not the first time that this Treasurer has sent stock markets running. We only have to go back a couple of years when Peter Costello, in his newly appointed position as Treasurer—
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order.
—My God, he is on his feet—a round of applause for Senator Heffernan. 
—Order! Senator Conroy and Senator Carr and anybody else who is interjecting, please cease.  
—Madam Deputy President, I ask Senator Conroy to withdraw the remarks about the deceit of the Treasurer.
—If you said that the Treasurer was deceitful, Senator Conroy, you should withdraw, please.
—I withdraw. 
—Show a bit of respect. 
—Senator Ferguson, you know interjecting is disorderly and it is even more so when you are not in your place. I will have some silence from you and your colleague. If you wish to speak, put your name on the speakers list.
—I think Senator Heffernan should issue a statement that that is the fourth time in two to three years he has stood on his feet and spoken in parliament. It deserves a birthday cake and a press release.
—He is speaking; he has the call. Order! Senator Calvert, I am aware of frivolous points of order and I would urge caution.
—As I was saying before I was so eloquently interrupted by Senator Heffernan, it is not the first time that this Treasurer has displayed extraordinary indiscretions by making revealing comments that have sent markets spinning. A couple of years ago he was over in the US and had his first briefing with Dr Greenspan, one of the most influential and powerful bankers in the world. What did Mr Costello do? He came out of his private briefing, where he was given confidential information about the economy, the views of the Reserve Bank equivalent in America, and he said in a press conference: 
He—
that is Dr Greenspan—
indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track ... I don't think there is any expectation at the moment that rates are going to rise.
This was at a time of extraordinary sensitivity. What happened on the back of Mr Costello's injudicious leaking and grandstanding on the world stage? The US stock market surged to record levels and the Japanese bond market surged to record levels. 
So it is not the first time that the Treasurer has been prepared to use his position, use his influence, to cause havoc on the markets. Telstra are suffering because of this government's attempts to cover up and mislead ordinary Australians about the state of the budget. This is a government that has been prepared to engage in shonky accounting practices to try to pretend it is still in surplus and to try to cover up for the fact that this budget is in deficit, and the government knows it. While government senators on the other side sit there laughing, they are supporting a man that is prepared to do anything he needs to do to cover for his own embarrassment. 
The Treasurer was caught out when the PM leaked the Timor story and he was lamenting on the radio: `I just wish it had still been a story we could have used, because it would have surprised and been sexy for the markets.' Who leaked it to cover it up? He is pointing the finger at the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister that has left the Treasurer with no clothes on budget night. What does the Treasurer do to try to cover for that? He trashes the Telstra stock price, which is worth a billion dollars to ordinary Australian mums and dads.

"Chapman, Senator Grant",LP,2000-05-11,"—The Australian people certainly know from bitter experience two things about Labor: firstly, you cannot trust them with the nation's finances; and, secondly, you cannot trust Labor on tax. That has certainly been reinforced by the limp attack we have seen from the Labor opposition on this year's Liberal-National Party government budget, which again has been engendered in this chamber today. We have just heard Senator Conroy and earlier we heard opposition senators talking about the so-called phoney surplus in this year's budget. 
—It was Senator Mark Bishop. 
—That is right; it was Senator Bishop—the forgettable Senator Bishop, obviously, because I could not remember his name for a moment. This simply reinforces the fact that you cannot trust Labor with the nation's finances. It reinforces the fact that they do not understand basic accounting principles.
The mobile phone radio spectrum, which Labor refers to as being part of this so-called phoney budget and phoney surplus, is being licensed by the federal government. It is not being sold; it is being licensed. Through that licence, it will provide a source of revenue to the government which in effect is a repeatable source of revenue because the licence goes only for a certain number of years and then the licence has to be renewed and the licence fee is paid again. So this is a repeatable source of revenue for years into the future. Under proper accounting principles, as has been well established by the Treasurer, it should be part of the budget revenue and go into the budget bottom line.
We need only compare that with the way in which the Labor Party in government treated other items which certainly should not have gone into the bottom line of the budget. I refer particularly to their sale of assets as distinct from their licensing of radio spectrum. They put the proceeds of the sale of those assets, like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, into the budget bottom line and then proceeded to spend what they gained from the sale of those assets in that particular budget in the year of receipt of the funds. What happened was that, once spent, that capital was gone forever and the next year, to keep up that level of spending, the Labor government had to borrow extensively. That is why we saw, in Labor's period in office, the government's indebtedness go from $16 billion to $96 billion. There was an increase of $80 billion in the debt during the life of the Labor government, purely because they did not understand financial management and proper accounting principles and, therefore, they treated receipts from assets as annual revenue rather than as a capital item. They did not use it to pay off the debt. In fact, they used it as annual revenue and, as a result of that, we had this massive increase in debt during the life of the Labor government. Of course, most of it was wasted spending which did not generate any benefit for the Australian community. 
As I said, in contrast to that, the radio spectrum is a renewable source of revenue. Of this government's activities with regard to the sale of assets, I will cite the issue of Telstra. All of the money from Telstra has been used for capital purposes, principally to pay off a large swag of that massive debt inherited from the Labor government but also for the capital purpose of rehabilitating our environment. So that is quite a dramatic contrast between this government and the Labor government—that is, the sale of assets as distinct from licensing of radio spectrum.
The other attack we heard from the two senators this afternoon was with regard to the damage to Telstra that they allege had been done because of comments by the Treasurer. As Minister Alston showed a few moments ago, the decline in Telstra's price has been consistent in recent days—it was not simply as a consequence of a one-off comment by the Treasurer—and it also is consistent with the fall in price of other telecommunications service providers over the same period, such as Optus.
Anyone who knows the situation with regard to Telstra knows that the major damage that is being done to Telstra is again being done by the Labor opposition because of their refusal to accept the full privatisation of Telstra and their refusal to allow the Australian people to have direct ownership of the remaining 50.1 per cent of Telstra which would benefit Telstra's future and the future of all Australians. Telstra is hamstrung most by that decision of the Labor opposition.

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,2000-05-11,"—I think I ought to start by pointing out to Senator Chapman that the Australian people already own Telstra. It is not a case of selling it to them. It is not a case of saying, `We're going to flog it off to them at whatever price we can get for it.' They actually already own it: I correct myself, they used to own it but they do not any more. In fact, they own only 50.1 per cent.
—Order! Senator Chapman, you have had your chance to speak.
—Senator Chapman is a well-known rude individual. I sat patiently listening to his drivel for five minutes and I suggest he do the same for me. But if he wants to interject, that is fine and we will deal with him as it goes. 
Normally I would start this speech today by not correcting Senator Chapman, because I have got only five minutes. I would actually start by taking a moment's silence. I would take a moment's silence for all of those poor punters out there who believed this crowd when they said, `This is the road to El Dorado; what you do is you buy the next tranche of Telstra. We baited the hook very well with the first tranche, but the next tranche is where the real money is. Go and get in there, then we will sell you some more.' 
What has happened, unfortunately, is that that asset owned by 18.6 million people in this country became an asset increasingly owned by fewer and fewer and fewer. Sadly, because of the Treasurer, they got burnt yesterday—and they got burnt very badly. That is what the moment of silence is about, because those mums and dads that those on the other side trumpet about who bought Telstra believed all the hype—and what happened? They bought the asset, and it is going down and down.  
Just to make sure of it, the Treasurer gave us one of his specials, because this man has lots of form on this. When he was the new Treasurer, off he toddled to the United States and he was feted over there. In fact, he got an appointment to see Alan Greenspan. I bet Dr Greenspan was somewhat sorry that happened afterwards, because, when the Treasurer came out of the meeting, he blurted all the sensitive private information that was given to him, and that caused all sorts of problems. In fact, he did the same yesterday. Just so there is no argument about this, I want to quote exactly what the Treasurer said. This is what came out at the press conference as reported in the paper: 
“When I'm doing a Budget,” Mr Costello said, “I write out to Telstra and I say, `What is the dividend going to be?' I write out to the Reserve Bank and ask, `What is the dividend going to be?' 
“When the message came back from the Reserve Bank and Telstra, it was bad news, very bad news.”
I do not know what the argument is about here today from the other side. That is a quote straight from the Treasurer. I heard a comment made over the floor of the Senate that perhaps if people were to go outside and make these sorts of statements, they would be sued. I am waiting for the writs to turn up to all of those reporters who wrote this stuff in the media, because this looks straight up and down here. Obviously Mr Costello must not have said it. If he did not say it, why aren't the writs being served? We all know that Mr Costello did say it. We have plenty of witnesses to the fact that he did say it.
The other issue that has come up here this afternoon is about Telstra. We have been told that Telstra basically oscillated between certain states, one of which was incompetent management—and that is the real reason why the shares are going down. We had Senator Alston here making some comments about Telstra management. I would say to Senator Alston that he also should not go outside and say that. I just want to quote from what Mr Stanhope from Telstra said. I think this will make it pretty crystal clear. The journalist asked Mr Stanhope:
You do not need these complications from your key shareholder though, do you?
In answer, Mr Stanhope said:
Well the words, as they were reported, were not helpful, no. But that's why we were quick to respond by lodging a statement at the Stock Exchange to reaffirm our business performance position.
I think that speaks for itself. (Time expired)

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2000-05-11,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled Going for gold: Immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION'S REPORT ON IMMIGRATION ENTRY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES - “GOING FOR GOLD” 
JSCM RECOMMENDATION GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 

1. DIMA should ensure that special arrangements made for the Olympic Family are extended to the Paralympic Family.
Agreed. DIMA is ensuring that special arrangements apply equally to both Olympic and Paralympic Family Members.SOCOG are handling entry and accreditation arrangements on behalf of SPOC for the Paralympic Games and Paralympic Family Members will receive the same level of service from DIMA as their Olympic counterparts.
2.  The Committee recommends that the MOU be finalised as a matter of urgency.
Agreed. The MOU was signed on 7 December 1999.
3. The Committee recommends that the finalised MOU be sent to the Committee for further assessment. 
Agreed. The MOU was sent to the JSCM on 24 December 1999.
4 The Committee recommends that SOCOG promote the advantages to accredited Family Members of the early submission of applications, and encourages Family Members to submit their applications for accreditation early.
Agreed.SOCOG advises that it supports the Committee's recommendations and is working closely with the Commonwealth's border control agencies to ensure that arrival, processing and exit arrangements ensure the smooth and timely movement of Olympic and Paralympic Family Members.DIMA is using its overseas network to work with National Olympic and Paralympic Committees to educate them and to assist the smooth travel of Family Members.
5. The Committee recommends that the proposed Entry Response Team (ERT) be formed as a matter of urgency to enable full and proper training and testing, to ensure that the ERT will be able to perform its duties efficiently.
Agreed. Training of Immigration Inspectors, including ERT members, is underway.
6 The Committee recommends that consideration be given to allowing airlines carrying large numbers of Family Members access to the Village on day of departure.
Agreed.SOCOG advises that it supports the Committee's recommendations and is working closely with the Commonwealth's border control agencies to ensure that arrival, processing and exit arrangements ensure the smooth and timely movement of Olympic and Paralympic Family Members.
7 .The Committee recommends that consideration be given by the border control authorities to the provision of dedicated border clearance arrangements for Family Members, possibly through off-site processing. 
Agreed. The Australian Customs Service (Customs) supports the Committee's recommendation and advises that dedicated Olympic and Paralympic Family processing lanes will be established at the Outwards Control points at Sydney Airport.  Consideration is being given to processing OFMs, travelling on dedicated charter flights, at off-site locations including the Athletes Village and certain hotels and floating hotels.  Consideration is also being given to dedicated processing arrangements for Athletes Village residents.  SACL advises that it supports the recommendation and that it will also examine temporary dedicated OPFM (Olympic and Paralympic Family Member) processing points in the Terminal Building with discrete airside access.
8. The Committee recommends that DIMA as the Coordinator of the VIC web-site:·	include translations of the abridged booklet on the website as they become available, and·	consult with SOCOG with a view to reviving the hyperlink from the official Games site to the relevant government sites.
Agreed.Translations into French, Spanish and German have been available on the site for some time and other languages will be added as they become available.The hyperlink has been restored.
9. The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, DFAT examine the potential embarrassment if a large number of visa applications from any country is refused, and work with DIMA on reducing this potential. 
Agreed.DFAT and DIMA support this recommendation. DFAT is working closely with DIMA to manage the efficient processing of visa applications, especially in countries where refusal rates are currently higher than average.  Should there be evidence at an early stage of an unusually high rate of refusal for any country, DFAT and DIMA would manage these on a case by case basis, taking into account the reasons for rejection. Many of Australia's overseas posts are pursuing a strategy of working with National Olympic and Paralympic committees, tour operators and other interested parties to raise awareness of entry and visa procedures and to encourage early lodgement of applications where this is appropriate.
10. The Committee recommends that an independent review analyse the effect of the visa application fee on applications and the effect on Australia's image as a potential tourist destination.
Disagreed.DIMA is not aware of any empirical evidence to substantiate the claim that the visa application fee has any effect on Australia's potential as a tourist destination.  Over 85% of all tourists enter Australia on a free ETA and growth in non-ETA markets has remained strong over the past two years. Visa application fees for visitors from non-ETA countries are broadly in line with those charged by most of our tourism competitors.
11. The Committee recommends that the number of countries eligible for ETA be expanded.
Agreed in principle.ETA arrangements which were introduced in Singapore in September 1996 are now available to passport holders from 31 countries and locations including the majority of Australia's high volume, low risk tourist source areas: Japan, USA, UK, several Western European countries, Hong Kong and Taiwan. More than 5 million ETAs have been issued to date and they are widely available. Over 70 airlines participate in the ETA system and ETAs are available from more than 50,000 external service providers. Holders of ETA-eligible passports are not required to apply for ETAs in their country of citizenship.Over 85% of all visitors and short term business travellers to Australia choose to obtain an ETA rather than a traditional label visa.  In countries where the national passport is an ETA-eligible passport over 95% of travellers obtain an ETA rather than a label visa.ETA now covers all high volume tourist markets, and is now in its consolidation phase.  Other tourist markets may become suitable for ETA in the future.
12. The Committee recommends that DIMA monitor the current practice among agents issuing ETAs to determine the proportion charging and the amounts charged by the various agencies.
Disagreed.Fees for ETA processing charged by external service providers are not subject to Australian Government regulation or control and any attempt by Government to “monitor” agents would be seen by the industry as an unwelcome intrusion into their business.Access to the Electronic Travel Authority System is provided free of charge by the Australian Government to ETA external service providers (which include airlines and travel agents worldwide).  Over 22,500 external service providers use the ETA system. 
13. The Committee recommends that, prior to and during the Games, DIMA and DFAT publicise their willingness to assist the unaccredited media.
Agreed.DIMA is committed to providing a high level of service to all media outlets including the unaccredited media and  is:·	Working closely with the whole-of-Government media strategy being implemented by PM&C·	Allowing unaccredited media representatives to enter under business ETA or business visa arrangements;·	Providing Posts with information to meet the needs of unaccredited media.DFAT advises that it recognises the importance of providing high quality information, efficient advice and services to all overseas media interests in Australia for the Games.  To service increased media interest in Australia DFAT has introduced several new services, including:Expansion of DFAT's International Media Centre in Sydney to service the increasing number of overseas media visitors with program support and information.A dedicated Internet website to service media interest in Australia with on-line information about major policy areas including indigenous issues, economic settings and social cohesiveness within cultural diversity.Establishment of a joint venture Sydney Media Centre for overseas reporters not accredited by SOCOG providing a centralised service for non-game issues.Promotion of services to media visitors through DFAT's overseas posts networks using Sydney 2000 countdown events and directly servicing key media contacts with information on available services.SACL plan to establish welcome desks for unaccredited media, one in each international arrivals pier at Sydney Airport. 
14. The Committee recommends that, with respect to API, DIMA and ACS:·	assess the level of its use prior to the Games period;·	pursue expanded access by airlines to simplify and further streamline passenger processing;·	and liaise with the relevant airlines for more extensive promotion of the API system, awareness of the “Express” card, and its relevance to the arrivals streaming.
Agreed. Border agencies received API for 35% of all passengers arriving in Australia for the 12 months to 30 June 1999.  The figure for departing passengers for the same period was 6.4%.A steering committee chaired by DIMA and including Customs has been established to achieve maximum uptake and implementation of APP/API thereby providing a greater level of Advance Passenger Information to the border agencies. Currently four airlines provide API data.  Customs and DIMA are vigorously marketing the APP system to all major airlines and have developed mutually beneficial agreements for airlines to consider - which include the requirement for the carriers to promote the use of the “express” card and its benefits to arrivals processing.The Australian Government has approached over 50 major international airlines to establish formal agreements (in the from of a Memorandum of Understanding) around the implementation of APP to assist achievement of the mutual goal of border integrity and passenger facilitation.
15. The Committee recommends that border authorities  undertake specific early testing of computer performance in situations approaching predicted levels and duration of demand.
Agreed.The Australian Customs Service advise that prior to implementation of the new Customs' Passenger Analysis Clearance and Evaluation System (PACE), production load testing was run in a simulated environment. During this time the system was subjected to predicted Olympic volume loads without any significant degradation in performance. In addition the system was tested at 10% and 20% above the predicted Olympic volumes with the same results. With the PACE system implemented, capacity planning is being undertaken based on recorded production loads and utilisation to confirm the results found during the pre-production testing.DIMA's Electronic Travel Authority System (ETAS), implemented in 1996, is designed to handle at least nine million visitors a year - double the number of international tourists expected to visit Australia in 2000 and would be able to process the additional visitors to Australia over the Olympic period.
16. The Committee recommends that, to provide a surge capacity for the Games period, the border authorities consider offering short-term employment to appropriately qualified and/or experienced former officers.
Agreed.Border agencies have commenced training programs and are putting other strategies in place which will provide adequate staffing to cover all contingencies during the period of the Games.  This may involve some redeployment of existing resources. Contingency planning will take into account the likely need to consider using former officers.
17. The Committee recommends that assistance to non-English speaking visitors be enhanced with increased multilingual and graphic signage.
Agreed.The Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd (SACL) supports the recommendation. SACL advise that as part of the Sydney Airport 2000 International Terminal redevelopment project all directional, regulatory and international signage is being upgraded or replaced. This will include the extensive use of internationally accepted pictograms and enhanced use of dynamic signage.An airport signage master plan has been prepared and will provide a logical migration of signage from the car park through to the aircraft and from the aircraft to ground transportation. Multilingual signage can be displayed on the dynamic signage monitors.At Games time this signage will be supplemented with SOCOG's way finding signage in the official International Olympic Committee languages for the Sydney 2000 Games, English and French.  SACL's Gold Ambassadors providing hospitality services within the International Terminal's controlled areas will be able to offer a range of linguist services. They will also be backed up by SOCOG's telephone multilingual services.
18. The Committee recommends that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as the coordinator of Olympic and Paralympic responsibilities, pursue the issue of minimising land-side congestion at Sydney.
Disagreed.PM&C advise that responsibility for landside congestion at Sydney Airport rests with SACL and the New South Wales Government.  The Committee's recommendation has been conveyed to SACL.   SACL comments that significant infrastructure improvements at Sydney Airport will enhance the flow of people in all areas at Games time. “Meet and greet” arrangements for Family members will be done in such a way as not to impede the flow of non-Games traffic.
19. The Committee recommends that the border authorities consider the implementation of all methods to ease congestion at the departure checking lines, such as a single line/multiple queuing system for departing passengers.
Agreed.Border agencies, SACL and Games organising committees are considering several initiatives designed to ease congestion at the departure point.  These include off-airport processing and check-in in particular circumstances; outwards processing at airside bus lounges; and various options designed to streamline processing at the outwards control point - including dedicated Olympic passenger lanes and consideration of alternatives to the current queuing arrangements
20. The Committee recommends that there should be 24-hour on-site coverage by Australian ALOs at the hub airports of Bangkok and Singapore.
Disagreed.At present there is no need for 24 hour coverage by an Australian ALO at either of these airports since the Australian bound traffic does not operate from these airports evenly over the 24 hour period.In recognition of the importance of both Singapore and Bangkok airports, an additional ALO has been placed at both airports to maximise the period of coverage for Australian bound flights.  The additional resources were as a result of the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Coastal Surveillance Task Force.  Whilst there are now two ALOs at both airports (and also Kuala Lumpur), these resources do not provide for 24 hour, seven days a week coverage.  However, as outlined above this is not required given current flight departure patterns.
21. The Committee recommends that DIMA should not, as a matter of policy, rely on the assistance of ALOs from other countries to monitor travellers to Australia and assist check-in staff. Prior to the Games, DIMA should ensure that it has adequate migration coverage at key hub overseas airports.
Disagreed. International people smuggling impacts on several countries including Australia, Canada, the United States, United Kingdom and several European and Scandinavian countries.  In order to combat people smuggling, there is a high degree of international, inter-agency cooperation and information sharing.  A means of maximising the effectiveness of resources at airports across the globe is to work in close cooperation with ALOs from other countries and this allows coverage of Australian flights where there is insufficient justification for a full time Australian ALO.  Australia also performs interception work relating to improperly documented travellers on behalf of other countries and Australian ALOs intercept many such passengers flying to destinations other than Australia.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2000-05-11,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled Going for gold: Immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION'S REPORT ON IMMIGRATION ENTRY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES - “GOING FOR GOLD” 
JSCM RECOMMENDATION GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 

1. DIMA should ensure that special arrangements made for the Olympic Family are extended to the Paralympic Family.
Agreed. DIMA is ensuring that special arrangements apply equally to both Olympic and Paralympic Family Members.SOCOG are handling entry and accreditation arrangements on behalf of SPOC for the Paralympic Games and Paralympic Family Members will receive the same level of service from DIMA as their Olympic counterparts.
2.  The Committee recommends that the MOU be finalised as a matter of urgency.
Agreed. The MOU was signed on 7 December 1999.
3. The Committee recommends that the finalised MOU be sent to the Committee for further assessment. 
Agreed. The MOU was sent to the JSCM on 24 December 1999.
4 The Committee recommends that SOCOG promote the advantages to accredited Family Members of the early submission of applications, and encourages Family Members to submit their applications for accreditation early.
Agreed.SOCOG advises that it supports the Committee's recommendations and is working closely with the Commonwealth's border control agencies to ensure that arrival, processing and exit arrangements ensure the smooth and timely movement of Olympic and Paralympic Family Members.DIMA is using its overseas network to work with National Olympic and Paralympic Committees to educate them and to assist the smooth travel of Family Members.
5. The Committee recommends that the proposed Entry Response Team (ERT) be formed as a matter of urgency to enable full and proper training and testing, to ensure that the ERT will be able to perform its duties efficiently.
Agreed. Training of Immigration Inspectors, including ERT members, is underway.
6 The Committee recommends that consideration be given to allowing airlines carrying large numbers of Family Members access to the Village on day of departure.
Agreed.SOCOG advises that it supports the Committee's recommendations and is working closely with the Commonwealth's border control agencies to ensure that arrival, processing and exit arrangements ensure the smooth and timely movement of Olympic and Paralympic Family Members.
7 .The Committee recommends that consideration be given by the border control authorities to the provision of dedicated border clearance arrangements for Family Members, possibly through off-site processing. 
Agreed. The Australian Customs Service (Customs) supports the Committee's recommendation and advises that dedicated Olympic and Paralympic Family processing lanes will be established at the Outwards Control points at Sydney Airport.  Consideration is being given to processing OFMs, travelling on dedicated charter flights, at off-site locations including the Athletes Village and certain hotels and floating hotels.  Consideration is also being given to dedicated processing arrangements for Athletes Village residents.  SACL advises that it supports the recommendation and that it will also examine temporary dedicated OPFM (Olympic and Paralympic Family Member) processing points in the Terminal Building with discrete airside access.
8. The Committee recommends that DIMA as the Coordinator of the VIC web-site:·	include translations of the abridged booklet on the website as they become available, and·	consult with SOCOG with a view to reviving the hyperlink from the official Games site to the relevant government sites.
Agreed.Translations into French, Spanish and German have been available on the site for some time and other languages will be added as they become available.The hyperlink has been restored.
9. The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, DFAT examine the potential embarrassment if a large number of visa applications from any country is refused, and work with DIMA on reducing this potential. 
Agreed.DFAT and DIMA support this recommendation. DFAT is working closely with DIMA to manage the efficient processing of visa applications, especially in countries where refusal rates are currently higher than average.  Should there be evidence at an early stage of an unusually high rate of refusal for any country, DFAT and DIMA would manage these on a case by case basis, taking into account the reasons for rejection. Many of Australia's overseas posts are pursuing a strategy of working with National Olympic and Paralympic committees, tour operators and other interested parties to raise awareness of entry and visa procedures and to encourage early lodgement of applications where this is appropriate.
10. The Committee recommends that an independent review analyse the effect of the visa application fee on applications and the effect on Australia's image as a potential tourist destination.
Disagreed.DIMA is not aware of any empirical evidence to substantiate the claim that the visa application fee has any effect on Australia's potential as a tourist destination.  Over 85% of all tourists enter Australia on a free ETA and growth in non-ETA markets has remained strong over the past two years. Visa application fees for visitors from non-ETA countries are broadly in line with those charged by most of our tourism competitors.
11. The Committee recommends that the number of countries eligible for ETA be expanded.
Agreed in principle.ETA arrangements which were introduced in Singapore in September 1996 are now available to passport holders from 31 countries and locations including the majority of Australia's high volume, low risk tourist source areas: Japan, USA, UK, several Western European countries, Hong Kong and Taiwan. More than 5 million ETAs have been issued to date and they are widely available. Over 70 airlines participate in the ETA system and ETAs are available from more than 50,000 external service providers. Holders of ETA-eligible passports are not required to apply for ETAs in their country of citizenship.Over 85% of all visitors and short term business travellers to Australia choose to obtain an ETA rather than a traditional label visa.  In countries where the national passport is an ETA-eligible passport over 95% of travellers obtain an ETA rather than a label visa.ETA now covers all high volume tourist markets, and is now in its consolidation phase.  Other tourist markets may become suitable for ETA in the future.
12. The Committee recommends that DIMA monitor the current practice among agents issuing ETAs to determine the proportion charging and the amounts charged by the various agencies.
Disagreed.Fees for ETA processing charged by external service providers are not subject to Australian Government regulation or control and any attempt by Government to “monitor” agents would be seen by the industry as an unwelcome intrusion into their business.Access to the Electronic Travel Authority System is provided free of charge by the Australian Government to ETA external service providers (which include airlines and travel agents worldwide).  Over 22,500 external service providers use the ETA system. 
13. The Committee recommends that, prior to and during the Games, DIMA and DFAT publicise their willingness to assist the unaccredited media.
Agreed.DIMA is committed to providing a high level of service to all media outlets including the unaccredited media and  is:·	Working closely with the whole-of-Government media strategy being implemented by PM&C·	Allowing unaccredited media representatives to enter under business ETA or business visa arrangements;·	Providing Posts with information to meet the needs of unaccredited media.DFAT advises that it recognises the importance of providing high quality information, efficient advice and services to all overseas media interests in Australia for the Games.  To service increased media interest in Australia DFAT has introduced several new services, including:Expansion of DFAT's International Media Centre in Sydney to service the increasing number of overseas media visitors with program support and information.A dedicated Internet website to service media interest in Australia with on-line information about major policy areas including indigenous issues, economic settings and social cohesiveness within cultural diversity.Establishment of a joint venture Sydney Media Centre for overseas reporters not accredited by SOCOG providing a centralised service for non-game issues.Promotion of services to media visitors through DFAT's overseas posts networks using Sydney 2000 countdown events and directly servicing key media contacts with information on available services.SACL plan to establish welcome desks for unaccredited media, one in each international arrivals pier at Sydney Airport. 
14. The Committee recommends that, with respect to API, DIMA and ACS:·	assess the level of its use prior to the Games period;·	pursue expanded access by airlines to simplify and further streamline passenger processing;·	and liaise with the relevant airlines for more extensive promotion of the API system, awareness of the “Express” card, and its relevance to the arrivals streaming.
Agreed. Border agencies received API for 35% of all passengers arriving in Australia for the 12 months to 30 June 1999.  The figure for departing passengers for the same period was 6.4%.A steering committee chaired by DIMA and including Customs has been established to achieve maximum uptake and implementation of APP/API thereby providing a greater level of Advance Passenger Information to the border agencies. Currently four airlines provide API data.  Customs and DIMA are vigorously marketing the APP system to all major airlines and have developed mutually beneficial agreements for airlines to consider - which include the requirement for the carriers to promote the use of the “express” card and its benefits to arrivals processing.The Australian Government has approached over 50 major international airlines to establish formal agreements (in the from of a Memorandum of Understanding) around the implementation of APP to assist achievement of the mutual goal of border integrity and passenger facilitation.
15. The Committee recommends that border authorities  undertake specific early testing of computer performance in situations approaching predicted levels and duration of demand.
Agreed.The Australian Customs Service advise that prior to implementation of the new Customs' Passenger Analysis Clearance and Evaluation System (PACE), production load testing was run in a simulated environment. During this time the system was subjected to predicted Olympic volume loads without any significant degradation in performance. In addition the system was tested at 10% and 20% above the predicted Olympic volumes with the same results. With the PACE system implemented, capacity planning is being undertaken based on recorded production loads and utilisation to confirm the results found during the pre-production testing.DIMA's Electronic Travel Authority System (ETAS), implemented in 1996, is designed to handle at least nine million visitors a year - double the number of international tourists expected to visit Australia in 2000 and would be able to process the additional visitors to Australia over the Olympic period.
16. The Committee recommends that, to provide a surge capacity for the Games period, the border authorities consider offering short-term employment to appropriately qualified and/or experienced former officers.
Agreed.Border agencies have commenced training programs and are putting other strategies in place which will provide adequate staffing to cover all contingencies during the period of the Games.  This may involve some redeployment of existing resources. Contingency planning will take into account the likely need to consider using former officers.
17. The Committee recommends that assistance to non-English speaking visitors be enhanced with increased multilingual and graphic signage.
Agreed.The Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd (SACL) supports the recommendation. SACL advise that as part of the Sydney Airport 2000 International Terminal redevelopment project all directional, regulatory and international signage is being upgraded or replaced. This will include the extensive use of internationally accepted pictograms and enhanced use of dynamic signage.An airport signage master plan has been prepared and will provide a logical migration of signage from the car park through to the aircraft and from the aircraft to ground transportation. Multilingual signage can be displayed on the dynamic signage monitors.At Games time this signage will be supplemented with SOCOG's way finding signage in the official International Olympic Committee languages for the Sydney 2000 Games, English and French.  SACL's Gold Ambassadors providing hospitality services within the International Terminal's controlled areas will be able to offer a range of linguist services. They will also be backed up by SOCOG's telephone multilingual services.
18. The Committee recommends that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as the coordinator of Olympic and Paralympic responsibilities, pursue the issue of minimising land-side congestion at Sydney.
Disagreed.PM&C advise that responsibility for landside congestion at Sydney Airport rests with SACL and the New South Wales Government.  The Committee's recommendation has been conveyed to SACL.   SACL comments that significant infrastructure improvements at Sydney Airport will enhance the flow of people in all areas at Games time. “Meet and greet” arrangements for Family members will be done in such a way as not to impede the flow of non-Games traffic.
19. The Committee recommends that the border authorities consider the implementation of all methods to ease congestion at the departure checking lines, such as a single line/multiple queuing system for departing passengers.
Agreed.Border agencies, SACL and Games organising committees are considering several initiatives designed to ease congestion at the departure point.  These include off-airport processing and check-in in particular circumstances; outwards processing at airside bus lounges; and various options designed to streamline processing at the outwards control point - including dedicated Olympic passenger lanes and consideration of alternatives to the current queuing arrangements
20. The Committee recommends that there should be 24-hour on-site coverage by Australian ALOs at the hub airports of Bangkok and Singapore.
Disagreed.At present there is no need for 24 hour coverage by an Australian ALO at either of these airports since the Australian bound traffic does not operate from these airports evenly over the 24 hour period.In recognition of the importance of both Singapore and Bangkok airports, an additional ALO has been placed at both airports to maximise the period of coverage for Australian bound flights.  The additional resources were as a result of the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Coastal Surveillance Task Force.  Whilst there are now two ALOs at both airports (and also Kuala Lumpur), these resources do not provide for 24 hour, seven days a week coverage.  However, as outlined above this is not required given current flight departure patterns.
21. The Committee recommends that DIMA should not, as a matter of policy, rely on the assistance of ALOs from other countries to monitor travellers to Australia and assist check-in staff. Prior to the Games, DIMA should ensure that it has adequate migration coverage at key hub overseas airports.
Disagreed. International people smuggling impacts on several countries including Australia, Canada, the United States, United Kingdom and several European and Scandinavian countries.  In order to combat people smuggling, there is a high degree of international, inter-agency cooperation and information sharing.  A means of maximising the effectiveness of resources at airports across the globe is to work in close cooperation with ALOs from other countries and this allows coverage of Australian flights where there is insufficient justification for a full time Australian ALO.  Australia also performs interception work relating to improperly documented travellers on behalf of other countries and Australian ALOs intercept many such passengers flying to destinations other than Australia.  The number of Australia bound interceptions may determine the requirement for the presence of an ALO, but when an ALO is present at an airport, airlines tend to take advantage of their expertise and experience for all flights.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,21,2,speech

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-05-11,"—As Kim Beazley has travelled around this country over the last 12 months, wherever he has gone he has heard the same questions. People ask him, `If the economy is supposed to be going so well, why are things so tough for me and my family?' They are asking why, when the government says the economic good times are rolling, their local public hospital is overcrowded and cannot cope with more than the most urgent cases. They ask him why the local public school is run down, the computers broken and the classrooms overcrowded. And they ask why they are getting hit almost every month now with another rate rise on their mortgage. And they are asking why, when things are supposed to be going so well, the society they live in is getting harsher, less caring and more divisive.
These people who have asked these questions over the last 12 months would have found no answers on Tuesday night from this budget. Indeed, all that Australian families would have found in this budget would have been higher taxes, higher prices and more pressure on interest rates. Even more importantly, they would have seen this budget on Tuesday night for what it is: a budget of lost opportunities—lost opportunities as the government squanders its bottom line, gleaned from cutting programs in education and health and regional services, to spend on what? Nothing but the GST. For all the big talk in the budget about doing the hard yards and all the talk about historic reforms and strong prospects, it is all invested in just one thing—the GST.
At the core of this budget, after nine successive years of growth, we find nothing to comfort Australians, to reassure them the government believes in a future for this country. After the billions of dollars in cuts made to government services in its first term, this government has been forced, beyond all the limits of prudence in a growth economy, to spend all the proceeds, and then some. The Treasurer knows he is stuck with this budget to bring in the GST. But he knows it is the wrong budget to ensure a sound economy at this stage of the economic cycle. When he should have been assisting the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low, the Treasurer instead has been forced to accept a tax he once described as snake oil—John Howard's GST. And he has been forced to accept the huge spending bill to try to compensate people for its effects. 
The amazing thing is that, with all that spending—$6 billion in this budget alone—they have still managed to leave substantial numbers of Australians without any form of compensation. Remember, this is the government which has cut $5 billion from social services since coming to power—much of it directed at families. Now it is imposing a $30 billion GST which will principally be borne by families; a tax which means that every time you have a child you effectively go up into a new tax bracket. The fact is, as most Australians know, mortgage rises are already chewing up the so-called GST compensation for families with children on an average income and on an average mortgage. Their tax cuts are already gone before they arrive, and the full GST is only 51 days away.
Even more vulnerable is a family like John and Wendy, from the government's own GST TV ads. If John and Wendy are expecting a child in December this year and John has an annual income of $30,000 and Wendy $28,000, they will, under the new tax system, when Wendy stops work, lose $67 a fortnight in the existing parenting payment. Even the government admits this leaves John and Wendy only $12 a fortnight to pay the GST. And the latest analysis shows that they will be $16 a fortnight worse off after the GST. 
We had a look in the budget on Tuesday night and actually found $15 million to set up an office to look at cases like John and Wendy's. But there was no money in the budget to pay them any compensation. So we have the farcical situation where the government will spend $15 million to discover that John and Wendy are worse off, but will not spend a single cent to help them.
To further confound and confuse Australian families, we had the spectacle last night of the Treasurer, in a fit of pique over the budget's poor reception, saying the promised tax cuts were not meant as compensation to people for the GST. `Income taxes had to be cut anyway', he said. This is exactly what Labor has always argued—that you can have tax reform without a GST. What the Treasurer is telling families is that the inadequate compensation package for the GST is actually no compensation at all. It was owed to people for the effects of inflation since the Howard government came to office. But that is this government all over. It is like someone who comes along and pinches $1,000 out of your back pocket, returns four years later with a $50 note and expects you to fall on your knees in gratitude.
The one piece of news in this budget was the $2.8 billion surplus, yet almost immediately that was shown to be a giant con trick. Nine years into economic recovery, we find in reality there is no surplus at all. The $2.8 billion was conjured up literally out of thin air—out of the sale of communications spectrum for an estimated $2.6 billion. The Treasurer himself has told us asset sales should not be included in the budget bottom line. A business could not get away with that, but the Treasurer thinks he can. Take away this fiddle, and the budget would be in surplus by a paltry $200 million.
Today the situation became dramatically more serious. The parliament learned that because of the false classification of a major payment to the states the budget is actually in deficit. Combined with other fiddles, the outcome of this budget is really a $2.1 billion deficit. It has taken all of three years for this Treasurer to turn a $10.7 billion projected surplus into an effective $2.1 billion deficit, and this at a time of strong economic growth and huge growth in revenue. According to the measure used by prominent economics forecaster Access Economics, the true structural deficit is actually more than $5 billion. Is it any wonder then that this has been, of all their budgets, the most critically received by the economic commentators?  
In the past four budgets we have seen Peter Costello smirking his way through his budget speech as he went around trying to convince the markets and the commentators the pain would be good for us and the gains would soon be here. But on Tuesday night the smirk had gone, and all that remained were thin lips and a hushed backbench. What this week has done—make no mistake—is finally expose what we on the floor of this parliament have known all along: the Treasurer has a glass jaw. He has had it easy in his short political career, but as soon as the heat is turned up he starts to go to pieces. We were trying to recall when we had last seen him look so uncomfortable. Was it when he verballed Alan Greenspan and single-handedly moved the US bond market? Was it when he did the macarena with Kerri-Anne Kennerley? No, it was when he suffered the ultimate humiliation of being made Alexander Downer's deputy.
I have said this is a budget of lost opportunities. And this is because of what was not in it—no plan for the future, no vision for Australia and no ideas. It is a tragedy for this country that at such a time of change—with new communications transforming the workplace, innovations coming thick and fast—we have a government as backward-looking as this one. Like most other Australians, members of the Australian Labor Party have been debating how our education, training and communications networks will measure up to the challenges of the future and how we can and must invest in new ideas. Do we see any evidence of this debate in the government ranks? People look to their government at times like these to provide leadership. The tragedy is that, at the very time we need it most, we face a government without inspiration, ideas or vision. This budget reveals that in spite of the enormous challenges we face in this country to become a knowledge nation this government under Prime Minister John Howard can only focus on a 1960s European socialist tax idea, the GST. 
Australians are already paying the GST. They know that prices are already going up—in the supermarket, in the department store, on their car and home insurance and in so many other ways. Let us briefly examine some of the things we know of this tax and what it will do. We know it will take $30 billion out of the pockets of ordinary Australians each year—a figure, by the way, you will labour in vain to find in the government's budget speech, although they do finally admit to it when you read the fine print. This tax, we now learn, will lead to immediate price rises of a staggering 6¾ per cent, a figure you never heard mentioned by the Howard government in any of their GST propaganda up until now. Before the election we were told prices would go up by only 1.9 per cent. So we will have this big increase in prices which, as we all know, will hurt the most vulnerable in our community—the elderly, new parents, students, self-funded retirees, pensioners and others. Economists are predicting more interest rate rises for home buyers as a result of this budget. Already we have seen four rate rises since last November. And if you think the surplus is disappearing, just wait until you see the tax cuts disappear. 
We now know the government does not think the tax cuts compensate people for the GST adequately. But even if somehow families did see them as some form of compensation, their effect, according to the government's own budget papers, is snatched back after just one year. The total tax take from individual taxpayers bounces right back to their levels of this year after only 12 months. And a year later, taxpayers are on average $600 a year worse off. So these tax cuts are a mirage. The other great neglected story of this tax is the huge burden of paperwork it will add to owners of small and medium businesses around this country. We know the struggle they are going through right now trying to install new software, wrestling with complex regulations, trying to gear up to become government's tax collectors all around this country. These businesses are in fact spending $4 billion on that process.
Let me state very clearly, and let me state very clearly for you, Senator Kemp: a future Labor government will be committed to rolling back the Howard government's GST to make it fairer and simpler. While we will roll it back, we know that the Howard government's agenda is to roll the GST forward. Everyone knows that this government want a GST on all food—they wish there was one on food now. Likewise, everyone knows that under the Howard government the GST rate of 10 per cent will inevitably rise. To roll it back we need to know how this tax operates over the next 12 to 18 months. We need to know who is hit hardest and what its surprises are, and we need to know how much money is available to roll it back responsibly, while attending to our other priorities.Even the government, as is amply clear from its vanished budget surplus, does not know what the budget will look like at the next election.  
For our part, we will not make any promises that we cannot afford, unlike the Prime Minister with his core and non-core promises in the 1996 poll. We will tell the Australian people our plans before the next election—an election that should be at the end of next year, after another Howard budget. For the moment, we can assure them that our priorities will be fairness to the weakest and most vulnerable in society, including charities; lifting the burden on small business, especially the administrative complexity; lifting the burden on education and health; and lessening the impact on jobs. At the next election the Australian people will know fully what we intend, and they can decide between a Beazley Labor government that will roll the GST back or a Howard government that they know will roll it forward.
Perhaps the greatest cost of all of the GST is the way that it robs the future to pay for the past—the way that it takes more than $25 billion out of future budget surpluses to pay for a tax instead of going towards the knowledge nation to position us to take advantage of the huge scientific and technological changes we are facing. There are far more important issues for this country to debate than issues of taxation, like how to develop a highly paid, highly skilled work force using the best technology to improve the production of goods and services. Yet this is an agenda that this government publicly deride. They simply do not understand that these ideas are no longer optional extras for governments. They are a new economic reform agenda for modern nations around the world. We all now largely agree on the old agenda: the need for fiscal discipline, an independent monetary policy, deregulation of financial markets, the floating of the dollar, low inflation and a more open economy. The agenda is moving on but not the Howard government.
There are many dimensions to the knowledge nation, and I want to spend just a little time on a few of them. I begin with what was meant to be the focus of this budget: regional development. Regional policy is about investing in modern infrastructure. It is about making the regions part of a vibrant national economy and part of a successful knowledge nation. Without this vision we face an ever-diminishing and ageing rural and regional population. Labor has higher aspirations for country Australia than this. We know what problems many of our regions are confronting—population decline, young people moving away, jobs drying up and country towns disappearing. Some of our regional communities have shown that it does not have to be this way. They have answers. They know what regional Australia needs—investment in information technology so that they can create new industries and new jobs. They know that it means better funded regional universities and TAFE colleges to bring in new skills and new measures to tackle the salinity crisis to protect the land and give agricultural industries a secure future. But they need the Commonwealth government to give them the resources so that they can get on with the job. The Howard government has totally failed to invest in the future of our regional communities. There is no new infrastructure spending, no new money for country roads, no new money to improve access to communications bandwidth and no new money to help sort out mobile phone problems. 
The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said that his political mission was to `meet the reasonable expectations of country people'. With this budget he has well and truly failed. While I am on the subject of his failure, let me talk about his failure to stand up to his Liberal counterparts on perhaps the most important asset rural and regional Australia has to connect itself to the new economy, and that is Telstra—his failure to stand up to the Liberal Party on Telstra. No Labor government will sell Telstra. This is not ideology; this is commonsense. We need Telstra to make sure it meets our national priorities. I note from this morning's Financial Review that Telstra has finally found out who its true enemies are—not those of us in the Labor Party who want to see it prosper and thrive. Its enemies are those in the government who have been talking down its value for their own ideological reasons. 
The second knowledge nation area I want to tackle is the vital one of education. Our education system is a vital national asset. We must develop it or see our stocks as a nation fall. Yet the Treasurer's speech on Tuesday night contained just two paragraphs on education—two paragraphs on what is without doubt the most important responsibility the government has. Every leading competitor nation of ours is investing its wealth in human capital. In the United States Al Gore has pledged to increase investment in education by 50 per cent by 2010, if he is elected President. Just a few months ago the Singapore government announced a 20 per cent increase in education spending. On Tuesday night Peter Costello announced new education initiatives of just $62 million over four years. That is 86c per Australian, per year—the price of a cheap ballpoint pen, like this one I am holding. What is more, it is barely one-sixth of the $360 million that this government is spending on its GST ad campaign—propaganda for a tax no-one wants versus investment in the skills everyone needs. Those are priorities for you!
The government took up one of our good ideas in the bonded scholarship for doctors to go to regional Australia. How about picking up one or two of our education ideas as well, like our teacher development contracts to assist teachers to go back to university to gain specialist knowledge or our teacher excellence scholarships to attract to the profession high achieving school leavers in fields such as maths, science and information technology? Every parent knows instinctively what the latest research confirms—that well-trained and motivated teachers are the best chance their child has got to succeed at school and in life. Yet this country under this government is going the other way. We are unique among developed nations in reducing our public commitment to education.
Five years ago, Commonwealth spending on education was at 2.2 per cent of GDP. This year it will be at 1.8 per cent. In another four years, if this government is not thrown out, it will be at 1.7 per cent and Australia's chance of becoming the knowledge nation will be ruined. Just today the science and technology budget statement revealed a further fall in Commonwealth support for science and innovation. This budget proves beyond doubt that the Howard government has given up on the elements we need to become part of the new economy.
While I welcome the government's move to assist some regional non-government hospitals, I believe the government still does not understand the number one issue in health: the state of our public hospital system. Across Australia the main issues are the absence of public hospital beds, the waiting times for certain procedures and, sadly, the poor quality of care now available. If Australians cannot have confidence in their public hospitals, what sort of country have we become? We are all affected, yet the Howard government refuses to provide greater hospital funding. The government has a report from an independent expert which says that over the next four years the system needs an extra $620 million just to provide the existing level of services to our growing and ageing population. A good government is willing to invest in community infrastructure, such as quality hospitals. Just imagine, if the $360 million this government is spending on its GST ad campaign were invested in public hospitals you could fund an extra 1,200 new hospital beds.
What is really needed right now is a driving, active, nation building government—one that has the will to forge real change in this country. Governments must provide leadership to create the climate in which our best minds can work together to bring about new knowledge and translate ideas into economic growth. This is not politics. This is the future. It is not about the next election or who wins and loses. It is about what sort of country we really want for our kids, because we have a chance to shape this nation. The role of government is to provide an excellent education system and the best incentives for science and technological research, underpinned by a first-class communications network. That is what the Labor Party promises. 
Finally, let me say that the lack of vision in this budget is not surprising from a government in love with the past and at war with the future. We have seen it on the republic, on Aboriginal reconciliation, on foreign policy. We are now seeing it all through our domestic economy. One thing that has amazed me is that in the selling of this budget so much of the government effort has been aimed at attacking us, the Labor Party. Since the poor reception of this budget has unfolded and as the government has become more sensitive to public fury over the GST, its need for a deceitful and personal political strategy has become evident.
When you cannot defend your own budget, you demand that the opposition produce its 2002 budget right now. When this does not work, you attack the Leader of the Opposition. If that does not work, you demand the right to one more victory over Paul Keating. My advice to my fellow Australians is: when you hear any of this reach for your wallet. You will find it minus your share of the $360 million GST ad campaign. Recognise this strategy for what it is—a lushly funded smokescreen over a judgment seat they hope you will never sit in.
On Tuesday night, the Treasurer delivered his budget speech. It was a very telling document. The first 11 pages were predictable, stodgy and uninspiring, but the last five pages tell the tale. They are all blank. These are the pages the government could have used, and the pages that will be used under Labor, to set us on the road to the knowledge nation. These pages should have told us how our kids would be better educated to face the great challenges of the new economy. These pages should have set down the way in which this country can establish a better health system. These pages should have been used to restore the welfare of families, who are at the centre of our society. Labor will fill these pages. We will fill them in a way that answers those questions we are so often asked by Australians—questions about how to achieve economic growth with fairness. Fairness for Australian families—that is the Australian way.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 2000-01</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-05-11,"—I rise tonight to respond to this budget on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Budget 2000 is the budget which marks the completion of Mr Costello's slow metamorphosis into a latter-day Mr Keating. Not content with adopting Mr Keating's style and economic policies, in his determination to pull a surplus laden rabbit out of a hat, Mr Costello delved into Mr Keating's dusty old bottom drawer full of phoney accounting techniques and heroic economic forecasts. Indeed, as I read through Mr Costello's economic forecasts—the figures that have to be positive for this budget not to plunge into deficit this year—I kept thinking that if this budget were a song it would be the Monty Python song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I do hope Mr Costello gets us down to the 6¼ per cent unemployment rate. But with job advertisement growth slowing, with interest rates hitting business and consumer sentiment and with no new initiatives in this budget to promote jobs growth, I have my doubts as to whether we will get there.
The forecasts of nine per cent business investment growth, of moderate wage growth and of a falling current account deficit and even the key 3¾ per cent economic growth forecast all lean well away from a balanced view towards a distinctly optimistic one. I hope these forecasts are realised. But, with forecasters like BIS Shrapnel predicting growth falling to just 1.1 per cent next year, I wonder if this is the right budget for the times. To paraphrase Graham Chapman in Monty Python's The Life of Brian: Mr Costello is not the economic Messiah; he is just a very haughty boy. The Treasurer is prepared to cut social spending more than is economically or socially justified to appease the gods of the financial markets—gods who are notoriously fickle, gods who have short memories and gods who are, more often than not, not interested in Australia in the first place. Fran Kelly on Radio National, the morning after the budget, closed her interview with Mr Costello by saying, `I feel a mantra coming on.' I know exactly what she meant. Five years on, Mr Costello has had only one economic refrain: debt reduction, debt reduction, debt reduction. That is despite Australia having the fourth lowest public sector debt in the OECD and despite our private sector liabilities—foreign debt and investment—rising sharply over recent years. 
The Costello budgets have been similarly single-minded. It is The Life of Brian again: five budgets, five crucifixions. So let us do some casting. I thought the currency traders could adopt the role of the suicide squad from the Judean People's Front, marking the dollar down over half a cent before the Treasurer had even finished his speech on Tuesday night. But, on reflection, Mr Beazley and the Labor Party make a much better suicide squad. Their assertion that Mr Costello had contrived a budget based on phoney accounting was a classic case of shooting themselves in the foot. I well recall Mr Beazley's last budget as Minister for Finance in 1995, when he claimed a $700 million surplus. But, when asset sales and net advances were taken into account, the real result was a $7.2 billion deficit. To play the role of the indecisive People's Front of Judea, spending their time passing motions that something should be done but doing nothing, the National Party is perfect. This was supposed to be the budget for the bush—the budget that pulled regional and rural Australia out of the economic doldrums. The Prime Minister, in Quorn in my home state of South Australia, promised a big boost for infrastructure in the bush. It failed to turn up in the budget, a point not missed by the National Farmers Federation. But the Nationals, having threatened, fumed and fussed for months, all lined up politely to applaud this budget that failed to address the inequity of economic opportunity between metropolitan and regional Australia.
Unemployment in regional Australia is now running at twice—and in some places, like northern Tasmania, three times—the unemployment rate in Sydney. This should have been the budget to even up the speed of growth on both tracks of our two-track economy. But that would have meant Mr Costello abandoning his obsession with debt reduction. This, in my view, would not have been a bad thing. Nine years into an economic upturn, I certainly do not believe that Australia should be spending its way into deficit to fund normal government expenditure. But modest borrowing for capital investment, public investment in infrastructure—for example, regional transport, communications or human capital like university education, our public school system and research and development—is perfectly justifiable.
I repeat again: Australia has the fourth lowest level of debt in the OECD. Indeed, in yesterday's Press Club speech Mr Costello said other countries could not understand that the Australian government was not borrowing more. This is because most OECD countries regard obsessive debt reduction as a stupid strategy, and it is. If the Australian government were a company, the markets would be marking our shares down for not having sufficient gearing. A poor gearing ratio—or low borrowings, in other words—suggests that a company is not employing capital to best effect and investing. That is exactly what this government is doing. Government non-financial assets are scheduled to rise by just 0.4 of one per cent this year, with a rise in value of non-military infrastructure of just $77 million. That is hardly the stuff of a far-sighted investment strategy to secure Australia's economic future.
Education and research remain the government's biggest failings as the OECD warned in its most recent Employment Outlook:
It is only by directing attention to the critical need to develop long-run policies to increase the skills and competencies of the less skilled, and to encourage the businesses where they work to invest in this human capital, that further sustained progress on improving the standards of living of disadvantaged groups in OECD countries will be possible.
Yet under this government investment in education has fallen from 5.2 per cent of GDP to just 4.4 per cent of GDP. Funding for targeted higher education research fell by 5½ per cent in real terms, and funding for other higher education research and development fell by 2.3 per cent during the same period from 1997-98 to 1999-2000. I can well imagine that Minister Kemp's favourite song might be Pink Floyd's `We don't need no education', a self-evident falsehood if ever there was one. By contrast, there have been substantial boosts to R&D funding over the past two years in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Canada, the US—and the list goes on. In fact, this year Mr Clinton aims to boost funding for university based research by eight per cent. The Irish Prime Minister, who has recently established a $1 billion `Technology Foresight Fund', said in Melbourne during his March visit: 
It is clear from the Irish experience that research and development in higher education has been absolutely crucial in our efforts to attract knowledge-based industries to invest in our economy.
Mr Howard could not have been listening because his government has cut $1 billion a year from education funding for universities, vocational education and student assistance.
Mr Beazley now says he will reverse this trend and make Australia the knowledge nation. Well, I would like to know how. I want to remind people, especially Labor Party senators, that in the last election he failed to actually tell us. The self-styled `education Prime Minister to be' pledged to put back just $170 million of the $1 billion that Mr Howard took out of education. This amounts to less than 20 cents in the dollar. In 1998 Mr Beazley failed the biggest test of his leadership as he did not explain how he would repair the damage done to Australia's education system—his plan was more hot air and rhetoric than real hard cash. Most telling of all, he has raged against the very tax reform which will guarantee a solid revenue base to underpin increased expenditure. 
Back to The Life of Brian. I said that this budget, were it a song, would be `Always Look on the Bright Side of Life'. Let us take a look at the bright side of this budget. There is about $2 billion for new initiatives that the government has agreed to since the last budget and, in many instances, these initiatives reflect the persistence of the Democrats in pursuing social and environmental policy outcomes. Indeed, the two biggest new spending initiatives since the last budget, aside from East Timor, were the $750 million increase, in real terms, we won for pensioners and social security beneficiaries and the $230 million a year in new environment programs we won also in negotiations on the tax package.
I want to talk about the fiscal effect of the agreement we won as part of our negotiations on the GST last year and make two points. Firstly, contrary to some ill-informed comment, the Democrats did not use the surplus to fund the $3 billion to $4 billion cost of GST changes, particularly in making food GST free. The cost of these revenue changes was fully met, as we always said they should be, by revenue items— reduced income tax cuts, increased diesel excises and the retention of some state taxes. 
Secondly, we did agree to fund the social security and environment programs by drawing on the surplus and that, we believe, is entirely appropriate and we do not resile from that one bit. The 1996 budget comprised cuts of over $1 billion from social security and income support. Those cuts left the most disadvantaged in our society—the poor, the aged, the sick and the unemployed—shouldering more than their fair share of the burden of deficit reduction. As the budget moved into surplus, we always argued that those who had endured the pain involved in creating the surplus should be the first to benefit from the gains. 
Our $750 million a year social security increases, in real terms, combined with the cost of GST-free food, effectively cancel out most, if not all, of the $1 billion of cuts to the social security payments. The disadvantaged paid the price of creating the surplus and they should reap the benefits. I might add here that Labor went to the last election offering no increase in social security payment or pensions. The Democrats have delivered far more to the three million Australians relying on social security than Labor ever would have done. I note as an aside that in 1993, when the ALP put up the wholesale sales tax rates, there was no long-term compensation for low income earners either in the tax system or in the social security system. Clearly, it is the Democrats—not Labor—that is the party of social responsibility.
On to environment programs: this government, like the previous Labor government, has failed to effectively address the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This government's failure tracks right back to the crazy 1996 budget decision to abolish the Energy Research and Development Corporation. The new funding the Democrats won for energy efficiency, renewable energy and greenhouse gas abatement programs has trebled government funding on greenhouse issues. This is well in excess of anything Labor promised to do in its 1998 election policy. On the environment, the Democrats have always been miles ahead of the Labor Party.  
This budget reflects many other new programs that the Democrats have worked long and hard for. The $560 million rural health program contains many measures that have long been Democrat policy and that we have pushed and pushed the government to adopt. However, we are very disappointed that, yet again, they have failed to deliver on dental death. 
The $46 million for additional legal aid funding was very much a result of continuous lobbying of the Attorney-General by the Democrats and an agreement with him, although it falls short of the government's original commitment of $63 million of new funding. It seems that somehow $20 million of this was excised from the cash-strapped legal aid system to fund the political fix diversionary schemes that the Prime Minister negotiated for the Northern Territory to soften its mandatory sentencing.
The $132 million to ease the assets test for farm families for youth allowance has been Democrat policy for over 10 years, and in fact there is an amendment passed by the Senate waiting to put this into operation. We have moved again and again that same set of amendments in the Senate, and now we finally have the funding to fund it. The $240 million compensation for hospitals for a reduction of FBT salary packaging concessions is a major win for us and also, in particular, for our public hospital system. Related to this is the $535 million of changes to FBT treatment for charities we negotiated, raising the FBT exemption for charities from the $17,000 promised by the coalition and Labor at the last election to $30,000. 
The $13 million for a new childhood nutrition program was a direct result of our tax negotiations. The $100 million in development aid for East Timor represents a small down payment on the Democrats' longstanding call for Australia to invest heavily in repairing the infrastructure of that country. It is nowhere near enough but it is a start. It is very disappointing that the overall overseas aid budget has now fallen to just a quarter of one per cent of GNP, barely a third of the level recommended by the UN. The strategic importance of aid is lost when compared with the $228 million increase in defence spending. Indeed, had a good defence management plan been in place, one-off defence payments would not be necessary.
The $240 million books industry plan represents funding won by us, with most of it going to the textbook subsidy scheme. The remainder is allocated to the establishment of a much sought after education lending rights scheme for Australian authors, an assistance package for the Australian printing industry and a program to increase holdings of Australian books in school libraries.
Finally, the government have also responded to the Democrats' announcement that we did not support its proposal to increase beer excise prices on 1 July by effectively owning up to the fact that they have had their hand in the till to the tune of at least $150 million a year. That measure is a step in the right direction, and we are yet to process all the numbers to determine whether the $150 million is in fact enough to deliver on the government's pre-election commitments regarding the price of ordinary beer.
In short, the Democrats have been very influential in winning real gains in social policy and environmental policy across a wide range of portfolios over the past year. We have achieved those gains by persistent public campaigning, by working with industry and with community groups and through specific negotiations with government. 
I have a few other comments to make on specific portfolios. Firstly, schools: I cannot understand why funding to government schools will increase by only 21 per cent over this four-year period—about where the CPI is expected to go—while funding for non-government schools will increase by 40 per cent. This appears to reflect Dr Kemp's ideological prejudice against public provision of a well-resourced education system. The Democrats welcome the $240 million stronger families and community strategy, particularly the additional subsidies for in-home care for rural and remote families living too far away from child-care centres. However, these initiatives will not fix the child-care industry's problems caused by earlier funding cuts and rule changes. 
In the rest of the social security portfolio, the government continues its obsession with throwing people out of the social security net by the introduction of more and more cumbersome and onerous requirements. We are very sceptical about the $60 million savings from the introduction of preparing for work agreements for all new claimants of unemployment benefits. Basically, when you add the figures up, this government is hell-bent on making the system too complex for another 7,000 Australians—so off they will go to the charities. We also question the introduction of pilot programs to increase mutual obligation conditions for mature age unemployed, long-term unemployed and unemployed parents of school age children, especially when the government's own welfare review is yet to give its final report.
On the savings side, the Democrats welcome the inclusion of family trusts and private companies in the means test for income support. In the environment portfolio, there are virtually no new measures or funding other than the greenhouse measures won by the Democrats. On the one hand, we have a Prime Minister who acknowledges that salinity is a huge challenge for this country—echoing the findings of his own Science, Engineering and Innovation Council; on the other hand, we have a Treasurer ripping $62 million out of programs designed to tackle this enormous and growing problem. Also, the forward estimates provide no clue as to what will happen when the Natural Heritage Trust money runs out in 2002. It reads as if environment spending simply disappears after that, and we believe very strongly that the environment spending should be funded from core government revenue. It is far too important to continually rely on asset sales. Eventually, they too will run out.
On immigration, the Democrats believe that this government is about to waste $116 million on the minister's obsession with boat people, including $52 million to build more detention centres. Yet there is no new money to help people who have come here or to improve processing services for people who want to come here—tourists and business people, as well as migrants. Indeed, language and literacy training for migrants is being cut.
The government's attack on public broadcasting continues with the refusal to grant the ABC and SBS any additional funds for new content for digital television or even to use the full capacity by multichannelling, even though digital is scheduled to begin in less than a year. 
This brings me to revenue. Given the needs in our health and education system, I think it was irresponsible not to proceed with the East Timor levy. This would have meant the East Timor commitment could be met from the levy and the general revenue used for our public hospitals and schools. Of course, the big news on the revenue side is the tax cuts and the GST, both taking effect from 1 July. It is not apparent in the figures in this budget, but the new tax system and all the changes will actually increase revenue collection in this country. Treasury's conservative estimate of additional revenue is about $2 billion a year in 2000-01. However, as Ross Gittins points out in today's Sydney Morning Herald, the revenue increase is likely to be larger than that, as the ABN system is certain to bring in much revenue from the black economy. As well, the GST as a growth tax is almost certain to raise more than was originally predicted for the states.
I emphasise yet again that repairing the revenue base is why the Democrats went into tax reform in the first place. The income tax cuts refunding the bracket creep occurring since 1993, the GST replacing the less efficient indirect tax system, the huge crackdown on tax avoidance—particularly by trusts and businesses—and the business tax reform all add up to a tax system that has far more capacity to fund the social expenditure Australians increasingly want from government. By signing on to tax reform, the Democrats have also shown themselves to be more economically responsible than Labor. Labor wants the revenue from tax reform but does not have the bottle either to reform the tax system itself or to now say it will repeal the tax. Labor will not repeal the tax and is saying so very clearly, but it still rails against it. What a terrific strategy! With a repaired revenue stream, government will no longer have to rely on creative accounting practices to deliver real surpluses and real spending increases, as Mr Costello has been caught doing in this budget with the spectrum asset sales proceeds, the timing of grants to the states and the Reserve Bank dividends. 
Coincidentally, today is the 10th anniversary of my first speech in this place. I have now the rather dubious honour of being the longest serving Democrat senator ever. It amazes me how much things change yet stay the same. Ten years ago, the 1990 budget was Mr Keating's last as Treasurer. The 1990 budget painted a picture of an economy that would slow gradually under rising interest rates, delivering a surplus of $8 billion—there were pages and pages of positive forecasts. But not a single forecast was met. Growth, instead of being the forecasted two per cent, crashed to minus 0.9 per cent as the `recession we had to have' arrived. Unemployment shot up. After taking out all the dodgy accounting, the budget surplus disappeared and re-emerged as a net borrowing requirement of some $700 million. Mr Keating ended up Prime Minister.
Ten years later we have another budget delivered in a climate of rising interest rates, replete with heroic assumptions and a soft surplus forecast—and I hope history does not repeat itself. I wish this government had more of a sense of where it wants to take this country in the difficult times ahead. I wish it were not obsessed with debt in purely economic terms, while ignoring the enormous social and environmental debts that are building up as our education system crumbles and the Murray-Darling Basin is clogged with salt. I wish this government had more of a sense of how this country will position itself to take advantage of the new knowledge based economy. I wish this government had, as a priority, the sharing of the benefits of economic growth with the disadvantaged. After all, we must surely judge a society by how it cares for those who are least able to cope on their own and, in particular in the current climate, those who are not coping with rapid change. Those elements are missing from this budget. This is a budget that hopes things will be rosy and bright. For Australia's sake, I really do hope that the forecasts in this budget are met. Unfortunately, hoping is not a sound strategy.
Debate (on motion by Senator Patterson) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 2000-01</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-05-11,"—I rise tonight on the adjournment to continue comments that I made on the last occasion the Senate sat: comments in relation to an inquiry, which took two years, that was conducted by the Senate into indigenous education. We did come up with something unique in recent times in the Senate, and that was a unanimous report of that Senate committee. It is very pleasing to see that the government, through other mechanisms, is now moving along the tracks that were suggested in the major recommendations of this committee's report. There was, however, a major cloud over the proceedings of the inquiry because of a matter of privilege that developed. I did report, in part, on that matter of privilege during the last time I spoke. I want to update the Senate on what is happening in this continuing saga.
The problem at issue was that a witness appeared before the Senate committee in the town of Brewarrina in western New South Wales. You would call Tony Wiltshire, the witness who appeared, a classic whistleblower. He did see the problems in the Aboriginal community in Brewarrina; he did see that the local authorities, particularly the local shire council, were not dealing with those problems properly. Indeed, many of the decisions of the council in what it was doing under its general manager, Peter Felsch, were actually damaging to relations in the town and the conditions in the town in terms of the hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal community; these things were getting worse. As one of the Aboriginal people in the area said, `We really just wish we could get a decent go.' I want to report tonight on how, since that inquiry, that decent go certainly is not there. Indeed, the petitions that have been sent to me and the letters that have been sent to me from the Aboriginal community do indicate that things are getting worse, and I want to outline tonight to the Senate what is happening in that regard. 
But, first of all, I will deal briefly with the latest developments in relation to the whistleblower in this case, Tony Wiltshire. We do have a Privileges Committee and it did consider this matter and it did find the General Manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council, Peter Felsch, guilty in regard to the intimidation of a witness, Tony Wiltshire. The very sad thing since that event is the effect it has had on Mr Wiltshire's career and his life. As a matter of fact, he had a very good career in the field of welfare and had done an enormous amount of good work over many years.
That career has now been destroyed. Mr Wiltshire enjoyed his job. He was very committed to the local people in Brewarrina. He lost his land in Brewarrina. He also lost many close friends in the area because he has now moved away from there. He has resigned from the council; he has resigned because, he said, he is not going to put up with any further mistreatment. This shows the very serious effects of whistleblowing and the fact that we do not seem to have the measures right in this country. There have been many cases of whistleblowing over many years and, for the people who do have the courage to stand up and indicate what is wrong, the outcomes, the effects on their lives in subsequent times, have often been very bad—and this is yet another case.
Tony was a man of courage to actually do what he did. It exposed what was happening in a small country town that the rest of the world had not particularly noticed. We are in a process at this time, particularly with the Aboriginal people, of reconciliation, and these small country towns are really a very good place to start. One of the reasons we did go to the town of Brewarrina was that this process of reconciliation at the ground level seemed to be breaking down. This applied particularly in the areas of education and training and employment. We saw evidence of it at the local school. Sadly, what has happened over the years is that the white children have been sent by their parents to the local Catholic school and the indigenous population at the local public school has been 97 per cent. This happened and evolved over the years, but there are no measures or any attempts to actually change and address this situation.
Another issue of great concern in a related area has been in the area of training. The problem being faced in Brewarrina, as the Aboriginal person said to us, is that they are not really getting a fair go. This concerns a training project which had been funded by the federal government, had been implemented through the state Department of Aboriginal Affairs and involved the Weilmoringle road project. It is a multimillion dollar project, involves the construction of an all-weather surface and was to go over four years. One of the purposes of the agreements that were made by all the stakeholders was to maximise Aboriginal employment and training. Two Aboriginal men were vital to the project, Tom and Noel Powell. They had a family history dating back a long way of working in road construction in the area. It went back 25 years to their father, Noel Powell Sr, who worked as a contractor for the Brewarrina Shire Council.
The plan for employing Aboriginal trainees came from a program written by Tom Powell, and he designed the plan as a program development officer with the Department of Juvenile Justice. The plan provides employment and training for young Aboriginal people. It is very good idea. It is a remote area and an area of very high unemployment. The plan was designed by the Aboriginal community and met the needs of the Aboriginal community. It was discussed by various members of the Brewarrina community; members and employees of the council, including Peter Felsch, the general manager; the New South Wales Department of Aboriginal Affairs; the Goodooga Working Party; ATSIC; and the Darling Murray Alliance. They all gave support to this plan. The opportunity to implement the plan in the Weilmoringle road project fitted into the funding criteria of the Aboriginal community development program under the New South Wales Department of Public Works and Services. 
From the beginning, the Aboriginal community believed there would be an Aboriginal mentor to guide the trainees and an Aboriginal contractor to train the trainees on the project site. It was very clear who would perform these roles: Tom Powell would act as the mentor and Noel Powell would provide grader equipment and instruction to trainees. The plan sold so well under this guise to all parties that funding came through from the New South Wales Department of Aboriginal Affairs—$2.2 million over four years. Once funding was approved, the story takes a downward dive.
Noel Powell was officially informed by the Brewarrina Shire Council in a letter dated 8 July 1999 that he would be hired to provide contract grader services and instruction to trainees once funding was approved. Funding was approved. Another letter, dated 25 November 1999, stated the original offer was withdrawn. The letter provided no explanation as to why Noel Powell had been dismissed from the project. Five months later, there is still no sufficient answer. 
Let us turn to the issue of the mentor for the trainees. This position was funded by the Barwon Darling Alliance. It was the impression of all involved that the mentor would be used to help trainees during the course. But, under a revised contract by the general manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council, the position was cut in the initial six months of the project. Again, there was a lack of reasons for why this position was abolished.
The major concern is that there is a lack of consultation between the general manager of the council and the local Aboriginal community. The Aboriginal community in Brewarrina wants answers. How is it that Brewarrina Shire Council became the sole project manager? Many groups were involved in the development of this project. The sole project manager allowed council to sign off on the project agreement without consulting other parties involved. This incident has undermined the principle of the Aboriginal community development program. The funding was given, in part, to this project because it met certain criteria, but the dismissal of the two Aboriginal contractors, who were perfectly placed to train indigenous people, is a mystery and goes completely against the program's objectives. 
This incident has created great disquiet in the town of Brewarrina. We have contrasting programs in Moree that are working very successfully and are a good sign of reconciliation. But this project in Brewarrina is a very disturbing sign that, at a local level, this sort of reconciliation is breaking down, and it should be investigated.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-05-11," asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 19 November 1999:
	Is it the case that the location and telephone numbers of individual licensed post offices no longer appear under the `Australia Post' heading in the Melbourne Telstra White Pages; if so: (a) is this omission the result of action taken by Australia Post; if so, why has Australia Post taken that action; (b) what consultation did Australia Post undertake prior to taking that action; and (c) will or does this omission occur in respect of the details of licensed post offices in any other State.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australia Post: Listing of Post Offices</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,28,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-05-11,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
	Based on advice received from Australia Post.
It is the case that location and telephone numbers of individual licensed post offices no longer appear under the heading for Australia Post in the Melbourne Telstra White Pages.
(a) Australia Post decided to remove the former block listing of individual corporate and Licensed Post Offices (LP0s) from the 1999 edition of the Melbourne Telstra White Pages and replace it with a centralised telephone inquiry point for its Customer Care Centre.
Australia Post advise that the benefit of listing a single inquiry point is that post office staff are not unnecessarily diverted from serving customers to answer routine telephone calls. Customer Care Centre staff are able to provide customers with advice or switch their call to the appropriate postal facility such as a corporate post office, Licensed Post Office or a delivery centre.
(b) Unfortunately, Australia Post did not undertake any consultation with licensees prior to making the change. Furthermore, when Australia Post requested the change, it also failed to make the appropriate arrangements with Telstra to reinstate individual listings of LPOs.
Australia Post advises me that it regrets the lack of consultation with licensees and this subsequent oversight.
In an effort to rectify the situation, on 1 October 1999 Australia Post sent a free listing pro forma from Pacific Access, the owners of the White Pages, to all licensees in Victoria requesting that they complete and return the pro forma to enable an entry to be included in the 2000 edition of the Melbourne White Pages.
(c) South Australia and Western Australia list all corporate post offices and LP0s, however, many LPOs have elected to have the single Customer Care Centre inquiry number listed rather than their particular office number.
Tasmania list all corporate post offices with the single Customer Care Centre inquiry number and all LPOs with their particular office number.
New South Wales and Queensland list all corporate and LPOs and are in the process of introducing a central Customer Care Centre inquiry number. These States will consult with the licensees' representative body before making any changes to the listing of individual LPOs.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australia Post: Listing of Post Offices</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,28,1,answer
