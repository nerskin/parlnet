"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-06-30,—I present the explanatory memorandum relating to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999] .,SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I would have liked to have seen the replacement explanatory memorandum; nonetheless, I will press on. This morning we are dealing with two extremes in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999] . The first is that the bill has been around for some three years and, when it was introduced, in a slightly different form, it was said to be urgent. Yet it lay on the Notice Paper  and was not passed in the last parliament. It has been reintroduced and it was subject to a report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—again as a matter of some urgency—earlier in the year. The committee reported in April. Yet here we are on the last day of this session of the parliament being restricted in the time allowed to debate the very important matters contained in the bill. On the one hand there was no hurry and, on the other, there was a tremendous hurry.
There is a report which remains secret—and the arrogance of the government is unforgivable—which we understand was delivered to the Prime Minister some time last week by the secretary to his department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, on the matter of people smuggling. The report has not been released publicly, it has not been given to the parliament, and the minister and the Prime Minister have 
 not had the decency to show it to the opposition. Yet we are expected to support the recommendations that, we are told, emanate from that.
We are asked to give bipartisan support to the very important matter of protecting Australia's borders. Despite the insults, the opposition is prepared to give that bipartisan support. We know what is involved in this, we know the urgency that is involved and we make no bones about the fact that we are going to support the very necessary amendments that will be made with the passage of these amendments to the Migration Act. We would have appreciated being taken into the confidence of the minister and being given the trust of seeing what was in Mr Max Moore-Wilton's report. We welcome the report and the government's actions, although they are very late.
The matter of people smuggling is not something that is new to Australia. It is not something that has just happened. It was a matter that was addressed by previous Labor governments in their terms of office. They took steps to try to curtail the problem. However, the problem is almost out of control. In the last financial year, and today is the last day of that financial year, some 40 boats have come onto our shores illegally, many at the behest of people smugglers—people who are profiteering from trafficking human beings around the world and to Australia. There was a recent episode in Western Australia where a number of people were left on Ashmore Reef. That is a particularly isolated and desolate part of the world and those people were left to provide for themselves. It is just not good enough. The government is taking some action through the amendments in this bill, and heavy penalties will be imposed upon those who are caught and convicted of people smuggling.
I mentioned that people smuggling is not something that is new. As a matter of fact, on 22 June last year I spoke in this place about people smuggling and mentioned one of the downsides of people who are convicted of people smuggling—those who, in some cases, make a profit from it. Not only do they make a profit by trafficking the people to Australia 
 but also, whilst they are in prison, they still make money. A magistrate in Broome made mention of the fact that internment was not in itself a hindrance to those who wanted to engage in that awful trade. While some persons were interned in prisons in Western Australia—that is effectively where I was talking about—they were paid a daily rate. That daily rate equated to the rates that people might have been paid back in their home country. They were provided with a bed, accommodation and food and there was little expenditure. Therefore, they were able to transfer that money into goods and take the goods back to their home country.
I am not sure whether we are addressing all of those matters in the provisions of this bill, but nonetheless we welcome what the government belatedly is proposing to do in the area of people smuggling. We recognise that it is not something that is going to be solved merely by the passage of these amendments. Vigilance will be required. Hopefully, some of the other provisions that were announced last Sunday by the Prime Minister will go a long way towards ensuring that that vigilance is enhanced and increased. But it could have been done many months ago. The shadow minister for immigration, Mr Sciacca, has already made many public announcements of what was required. It did not require three months of investigations by a person we are told is exceptionally busy, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to come up with suggestions. It could have been done with bipartisan support earlier in the piece, but the government chose its own pathway to do it.
I want to move back to the main provisions of the other bill and talk in some little detail about that. I am very aware of the time and the fact that we are on the last day of sitting of the Senate. I am uncomfortable about that, but nonetheless there are a few markers that ought to be put down on a matter that has been around now for some three years. It relates to the handing over of a letter to persons who were held in detention in Port Hedland. There was a number of legal actions in the Federal Court of Australia and indeed 
 in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in regard to that matter.
What is not known, though, is that a behind-the-scenes—not necessarily secret—arrangement was entered into between the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs—although it was not a signed, legally binding document—about how this matter could be handled pending the result of the court case and pending the passage of the bill. I raise this because the opposition have been criticised for their stance on the bill. We have been criticised because we are supporting what the government is doing in the bill. I argue that the protocol that was entered into between the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, even though it was not a signed, sealed and delivered protocol, is doing very much the same thing as the bill is doing. While it suits HREOC—and I think it was a HREOC document—to agree informally about how problems in the area of communicating with detainees could be handled, there is nonetheless a need for legislation to ensure that everybody knows the rules in handling matters where communication is needed with individuals.
I do not want to get into the hyperbole of saying that lawyers were soliciting for clients in the delivery of mail, but the matter cannot be avoided. The first HREOC letter that was sent to the person from the boat Teal did in fact include the name and telephone number of a lawyer. HREOC later removed the name of the lawyer, but in the first instance it did include that. The person who tried to make the first approach to the detainees from the Teal was a lawyer who was working for the RACS people, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, from Victoria.
We believe that the bill could and should have been passed in 1996. It should not have been allowed to lie on the Notice Paper for a further two years after that. It should have been debated very early in this session of parliament. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee did report in April of this year. It should not have been left 
 until the last day of the session in order to deal with it in this place. Although we are in agreement with it, we would have liked more time to explore those matters that are contained in the bill and the abounding issues that arise from it.
We are happy to give bipartisan support to the government in its attempt to halt that dreadful trade of people smuggling. We wish the measures that are going to be put in place well. We hope that it will stop that dreadful trade, or certainly limit it, and that next year when we stand in this place at this time we will not see the same percentage of boats coming into Australia that has come in over the last 12 months. I am going to finish my remarks now. I would have liked to use my full time, indeed I could have used the full time, but I am anxious to let other honourable senators participate in the debate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-30,"—The purpose of this legislation, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999] , is to amend the Migration Act to ensure that there is no obligation on the minister or any officer to provide a person in immigration detention with an application form for a visa unless the detainee specifically requests one, and to ensure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Ombudsman are prevented from delivering sealed envelopes to new arrivals unless they are specifically requested to do so by the detainees. The bill we are considering today is virtually the same as Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which was allowed to lapse before it was fully debated by the parliament. In 1996 the Democrats said that they would oppose that bill and we are opposing this one today.
The purpose of the bill today, as with the previous one, is to amend the Migration Act in response to the decision of the Federal Court in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission v. Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs case back in 1996. This case centred around the department's refusal to give the Refugee Advice and Casework Service access to the unauthorised arrivals on the basis that none of the detainees had specifically requested it. As 
 a result, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which found that the department may have been in breach of a section of article 9 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission subsequently forwarded a sealed letter to the department requesting that it be forwarded to the detainees, pursuant to paragraph 26(b) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, suggesting that they might want to seek legal advice. The department refused to pass on the letter, however, on advice from the Attorney-General's Department that the provision did not require them to do so. An application was filed in the matter and the judgment was handed down on 7 June 1996. According to the minister, it is necessary to clarify the rights of certain people who are in immigration detention in response to this case because the ruling has encouraged refugee advice services to attempt to access all detainees or all boat people in order to engage them in unwarranted, lengthy and expensive processing. Clearly such an approach is, in the minister's assessment, unacceptable.
The minister said that section 189 of the Migration Act makes it quite clear that non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa must be detained. He also noted in his second reading speech that the onus is on unlawful citizens who arrive without a visa to advise officials as to why they have come to Australia and if they wish to seek legal advice. Section 256 of the Migration Act makes provision for access to legal advice by persons in immigration detention, but only where the persons in detention actually request legal advice. The amendments in this bill are designed to ensure that the interpretation I have just outlined actually prevails.
As I have stated, the Democrats are opposing this bill today because there is strong and widespread opposition to its adoption, and the Democrats as a party have objections to the principle that the bill tries to enforce and entrench in the legislation. The main concerns which have been raised, both within the 
 Senate committee inquiry into this bill and outside it, include the lack of knowledge that many newly arrived persons have about Australia's legal system and about the existence of human rights organisations such as HREOC and the Ombudsman. We are also concerned about the removal of HREOC's and the Ombudsman's power to communicate with detainees unless they are complainants and the possibility that measures contained in this bill are in breach of Australia's international human rights obligations.
Many organisations working with newly arrived detainees have explained how the effect of requiring these people to specifically request legal advice from human rights bodies such as HREOC and the Ombudsman is to deny detainees access to these services and organisations altogether. That is the practical effect of the measure that is to be implemented here. This is because of the barriers most new arrivals face as a result of the inhumane practices they have experienced in their countries of origin and the fact that they often speak little or no English. Few detainees seeking refugee status would be aware that the legal and human rights organisations exist at all, let alone be in a position to consider exercising their right to access these services. In light of current policy and practice in this area, the Democrats have to question this government's commitment to justice and human rights when it comes to immigration related detainees. Surely any system which offers legal advice and access to human rights bodies but withholds information on the existence of these services is in reality potentially offering nothing. I urge the government to reform current policy and practice to ensure that all newly arrived detainees are fully informed of the legal and human rights services which are available to them and are informed in a language which they understand and in a manner which is accessible.
The government is also moving a number of amendments today to this bill to address the incidence of people smuggling, which has gained some media attention in recent times. These amendments are designed to increase the penalties for those involved in people smuggling and to allow police investigating 
 people smuggling to intercept telecommunications. The government wants to increase the existing penalties to serve as a greater deterrent to those involved in trafficking in people. The current penalty for those prosecuted for assisting with people smuggling is a maximum of two years imprisonment. The proposed amendments increase the penalties to between 10 and 20 years, depending on the offence. They also allow police to obtain warrants to intercept telecommunications to investigate people who are suspected of people trafficking.
The Democrats note, and welcome, the minister's assurances that these amendments do not in effect introduce any new offences; they simply increase the penalty for those offences which already exist. We acknowledge that the minister has said that the higher penalties will be aimed squarely at the profiteers from people trafficking, while people who are the subjects, or in many cases the victims, of this practice almost without exception will continue to be simply removed back to the country they came from without being prosecuted; presuming, of course, that they do not meet any of the requirements under the refugee and humanitarian program to enable them to stay here in Australia.
The Democrats share the government's concerns and the community's concerns in relation to the practice of people smuggling, and we are quite willing to support these amendments that the government is bringing forward today, despite the Democrats' overall opposition to the bill which the amendments are being attached to. We hope these amendments will go some way towards reducing the pain of those who have been exploited and smuggled into Australia only to find themselves promptly returned to their country of origin. Hopefully the amendments will serve to reduce the incidence of this practice and send a message to those who are involved in organising it that it is not a profitable activity and not an activity that is likely to be of worth to them.
It is an area of concern in relation to the refugee and humanitarian program, and the immigration program more broadly, and it is one where the Democrats are willing to assist 
 in a parliamentary sense in ensuring that measures are taken to address the practice. The danger, of course, is in linking the practice to wider issues relating to the humanitarian program, and I do express some concern about the practice in recent times of trying to link the incidence of people smuggling to broader issues relating to the refugee and humanitarian program, and particularly trying to link it to other actions of the government in relation to the judicial review bill. That bill seeks to limit people's access to the legal system and to ensure that their legal rights are able to be protected through the legal system.
The Democrats' concerns about that measure remain. We do not believe that there is a particularly strong link between the people smuggling issue and the government's efforts in relation to the judicial review measure, which the Democrats continue to oppose. The fundamental issue in relation to the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999]  that we are debating today is the basic principle of ensuring that people are able to access their legal rights and know what rights they actually have. The Democrats support the amendments attached to the bill that have been brought forward fairly recently to try to address the problem of people smuggling, but we continue to oppose the broader purpose of the bill.
We have quite a strong degree of concern about the principle and the effect of this bill, particularly the fundamental message that it sends and the fundamental impact of the legislation. It is quite an absurd approach to suggest that people have legal rights when they are in Australia but that they can only access them if they actually know that they have them and realise that they can ask for them. The core principle that is being put forward in this legislation is not quite the same as suggesting that people have to know the magic words, the passwords or some hidden code before they can get access to legal assistance, but it is not far off it in many cases, particularly for people who have no knowledge of Australia's legal system or of their legal rights, and speak little or no English. 
In those circumstances, this bill is setting up a situation in which people are in detention in Australia and have legal rights but are not able to find out about those legal rights unless they realise that they have them and know that they can ask for assistance in relation to them. It is a bizarre and circular approach. The government is trying to implement in legislation a catch-22 situation. Whilst that may reflect current practice in many cases, that does not make it acceptable, in the Democrats' view.
It is important to emphasise that many people in this situation have been through a lot of hardship and are in an extremely difficult personal situation, and one which I am sure none of us would like to be in. It is probably now appropriate to shift from the legal and technical aspects of the legislation and look at the reality of what it means for people. These people are in difficult situations. They are in detention in Australia—in a strange country—and most probably in a situation that they did not expect to be in. Basically, an extra barrier is being put in their way in terms of finding out what their rights are.
In any circumstance, it is a dangerous practice to try to make it more difficult for people to find out what their legal rights are, but when individuals are in a circumstance which is obviously much more dire than the circumstances that the average person is in anywhere in the world, let alone in Australia, it is all the more reprehensible to make it harder for them to find out what their legal rights are and to access those legal rights. It is a curious and very dangerous principle. From the Democrats' perspective, we do not see why a principle such as that should be applied in migration legislation or in legislation that impacts on people in detention in Australia and not on other people in the community—whether in Australia or throughout the world.
People have basic legal rights within Australia. That is something that, as a society and as a parliament, we try to ensure. As a country and as a society, we have signed on to, recognise and, I presume, support basic human rights principles and international legal 
 obligations, not just through international covenants but through the understanding that, as a society, we support basic principles such as people having access to information about their legal rights. In the Democrats' view, putting in a legal impediment, as this legislation seeks to do, to prevent people from finding out what their legal rights are—unless they know that they have them, know that they can ask for them and know whom to ask to find out about them—is quite unacceptable and is a dangerous precedent and practice.
I wish to put on the record quite strongly the Democrats' concerns about, and opposition to, the principle contained in this legislation. It may well be that, following the passage of this legislation, the practice that applies to people in detention in Australia is not greatly different from the practice that operates now because of the protocols, agreements and procedures that were put in place following the court case in 1996. To that extent, I suppose it is simply entrenching in law a practice that the government is keen to ensure happens anyway. From the point of view of a legal principle and a principle of civil rights, it is a very inappropriate move. From the Democrats' point of view, it would be more desirable if we sought to change the practice that operates at the moment rather than entrench it in law.
During the Senate committee hearings into this legislation earlier this year, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission expressed great concern about and great annoyance—I think it would be fair to say—at the fact that this legislation is being proceeded with. Administrative measures can be modified much more easily over time to deal with the reality and to ensure that basic commitments and basic principles are met. It is a different matter altogether to entrench in legislation a principle such as this, and this is quite a sad day for our overall migration law.
The area of migration law and our humanitarian program is difficult. I do not seek to sound purist about the whole thing or to suggest that the issue of illegal non-citizens and our onshore humanitarian program is a simple one. It is difficult and it is for that reason that I, on behalf of the Democrats, 
 sought to have that whole issue examined more broadly by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. From my perspective, as a person involved in that inquiry, I am very keen to approach that with an open mind and keen to work constructively with people from all sides of this Senate to try to look for ways to improve the operation of our program and to recognise the difficult issues that the government and the department have to deal with in relation to the refugee and humanitarian program.
It is not simple. Difficult decisions have to be made. Despite acknowledging that, to take measures such as this that, in the Democrats' view, really do, firstly, send a bad message and, secondly, put in place quite a dangerous and inappropriate legal principle is not the way to go. I reiterate the Democrats' opposition to the overall bill while once again emphasising that we support the very recent amendments that have been brought in. The bill has been around for three years or so, while the amendments have been around for perhaps three days or a week. We certainly support the amendments as a measure to try to address the people smuggling issue. However, we continue to be opposed to the legislation to which the amendments are attached. We express our disappointment that other parties in this chamber have seen fit to support it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-30,"—There is a certain sense of deja vu today. We are dealing with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999] , which has one aim: to remove the statutory right of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, or HREOC, and the Ombudsman to deliver sealed envelopes to people held in immigration detention. The reason for the sense of deja vu is that, almost exactly three years ago in almost exactly the same circumstances, my former colleague ex-Senator Chamarette spoke to very similar legislation. It was on the last day of the last sitting of that Senate in 1996. I will get back to that later.
The Migration Act states that a person in immigration detention does not have the right to be informed of their legal rights. This is in 
 section 192. It says in section 256  that a detainee must first request legal advice before the department is obliged to provide it. The department also typically prevents lawyers and others from informing detainees of their legal rights. A loophole is that both the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Ombudsman Act allow for statutory bodies to deliver sealed envelopes to persons in detention. It is assumed that in some way this correspondence will inform detainees of their legal rights.
In 1996 the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, or RACS, sought to inform boat people in Port Hedland about their legal rights. The department refused to deliver the letter since the detainees had not requested legal advice. RACS made a complaint to the commission, who subsequently wrote to the detainees. The department refused to deliver this letter also. The commission commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against the department, seeking to compel the department to deliver the letter. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission won the case. So not only did they have the right to do it but it was believed they had an obligation to do it. The bill seeks to close this loophole. HREOC and the Ombudsman will not be able to deliver sealed envelopes to detainees, unless detainees have initiated the contact, if this bill goes through.
Let us look at the history of the bill. On 20 June 1996, less than two weeks after the Federal Court's decision, the government introduced Migrant Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 into the Senate. It is funny that, when we talk about Aboriginal rights, if we ever get them at all it takes forever for governments to think about them. But if we have a situation where we want to take away the rights of immigrants or refugees, we can get it just like that. This is one of those occasions. Two weeks—boy, it must have been some sort of record.
On 28 June 1996 the government was successful in having this bill and the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 exempted from the cut-off motion. So not only did they have a bill produced very quickly but they also organised it, with the 
 assistance of the opposition, so that the community and the parliament did not have the ability to properly scrutinise the bill. The bill went in within two weeks and was exempted from cut-off. On 28 June 1996 several senators gave second reading debate speeches, but the debate was interrupted by the Senate rising. That was on a Friday. I believe the Senate was sitting an extra day to fit in the government's legislation program of the day. That sounds familiar as well. We cannot of course sit an extra day after today because constitutionally we will turn back into pumpkins—at least, people like me will.
—It might be an improvement for some.
—Yes, I think so. Let us look at the history of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999] . On 3 December 1998 the bill was reintroduced into the Senate. On 9 December 1998 it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. On 21 April 1999 the committee report was tabled, and there was a Greens and Democrats minority report to that committee report. The Australian Democrats have indicated they will be voting against this bill outright and do not intend to move amendments. We have, of course, heard of the government's amendments in relation to trafficking in people, and as this is an issue which is not about punishing refugees—it is about punishing those people who would seek to profit from the heartbreak of potential refugees—we have no objection to this. Senator McKiernan has spoken and I notice that Senator Cooney is on the list as well, but Labor has indicated that it will be voting in favour of the bill. One reason, I guess, could be that the abovementioned Federal Court case was commenced under the Labor government.
—No, it was not. The letter was delivered after the election.
—Senator McKiernan indicates that the letter was delivered after the election. I want to talk about some of the issues involved here. We have so clearly seen examples that knowledge is power. With a lack of knowledge, potential asylum seekers are put in a position of powerlessness before 
 the Australian legal system. `A right about which people are ignorant is meaningless. A door without a key is a wall.' That is an opinion from Desmond Manderson, from Macquarie University, which was mentioned in the Age  on 28 June 1996.
These people cannot be expected to know either their rights under the Australian law or how to exercise these rights. How could they be expected to know? They may have very little English language comprehension. They may very understandably have a distrust of authorities. They may have no prior knowledge of Australia's legal system, let alone the Migration Act. They may be isolated from the wider community—they are isolated from drop-in community centres, friends and even from other well-seasoned asylum seekers. They may have cultural differences and could be suffering from the effects of trauma, confusion or depression. Now the government wants to legislate against even the commission and the Ombudsman giving even a hint of assistance. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission concluded from their study of detained asylum seekers:
A large proportion of detainees, particularly those from the People's Republic of China, did not have a clear understanding of the role of lawyers in democratic societies. Detainees were confused about what rights they had and what they had to do to make an application to stay . . . In almost every case we know that these people [immigration detainees] have no knowledge of Australia's legal and political system, much less of HREOC's existence or powers or the existence of their own human rights.
International law would insist that exactly the opposite be done. Rather than removing any possibilities for legal advice before a request is made, it should be a matter of course that all detainees are informed of their legal rights. Currently—and even more so under this bill—detained asylum seekers are treated worse before the law than an untried prisoner charged with a criminal offence in that they are not informed of their right to legal advice.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report recommends to the federal government that the Migration Act, the migration series and all local procedures of the detention service provider should be 
 amended to require that, where a person is in immigration detention under the act, the person responsible for the detention shall advise him or her of the right to have access to legal assistance. The report says elsewhere that this access should not be dependent on the detainee initiating a request for assistance. One can only wonder, if governments continue to ignore the advice of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, what standing Australia will have in terms of having that commission if the advice is not heeded.
The Scrutiny of Bills Committee had concerns about the 1996 bill. It continues to have these same concerns in 1999. It said:
In the committee's view, it is contrary both to international standards (as expressed in article 26 of the ICCPR) and to the fundamental values of common law to entrench a discriminatory rule which effectively precludes a person from finding out what rights they might have under the law.
Do we want to see more complaints against Australia's laws in the United Nations Human Rights Committee? I know some people do not care. Some people wear it as a badge of honour, and that is a shame. I think it is a crying shame for Australia's international reputation.
The bill comes at a time when there are numerous and increasing complaints to the commission and the Ombudsman. I will give particular reference to Port Hedland. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has received 23 complaints from or on behalf of detainees since 1995. Of these, 70 per cent have been in relation to the issue of legal advice. This was regarded by the commission as a very high level of complaints, and of course it would be—70 per cent is enormous.
The motivation for the bill is to prevent illegal immigrants from accessing Australia's legal system—therefore, creating a cost for the government—that is, to save money at any human cost. We were told back in 1996 when this legislation was first introduced that the protection of rights ought not to be governed by a cost benefit analysis. Ha! But the government has the mind-set that we can save money by not telling detainees about the legal 
 system: `We can stop these illegal immigrants from being accepted as refugees. Simple—don't tell them about our refugee system. Too bad if it means some of them may be persecuted when they are sent home.' The government has described the situation as a loophole which allows boat people too much access to lawyers and the courts. How much access is too much access? In this case it seems any access may be too much access.
If we are going to sign international instruments, we have to count the cost. Yes, access to legal advice and assistance can be costly, it can be a little inconvenient, and the determination of genuine cases may invoke lengthy and expensive processing. I think we have to accept this reality and responsibility, because efficiency and cost effectiveness are no substitute for legal justice, and they never were.
Prompt return to their country of origin within several weeks becomes the consequence for detainees in many cases. The rapid turnaround may sound good from an efficiency point of view—that's the dollars again—and may even placate a largely hostile public when you think about some tabloid media when it comes to boat people, but at what expense has this efficiency and cost saving measure occurred?
Let us look at the arrivals on the Cockatoo. This boat arrived in Australia in November 1994. In January 1995, arrangements were made to deport all 84 members of the group back to China. Legal assistance was received at the last minute, and 32 people from this boat were found to be refugees. Under our stringent rules in relation to refugees in Australia, if 32 people from that boat were found to be refugees, what would the implications have been if we had sent all 32 of those people back? Potentially, there were implications for their lives, their freedom or their families. It almost defies belief that we could be doing this on the basis of efficiency or some odd idea of justice. In other words, around 40 per cent of those people who have now been granted refugee status in Australia would have been deported. This comes from page 28 of a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report done in 1998 which 
 is called For those who've come across the seas: detention of unauthorised arrivals.
The draft protocol of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is a far more measured and targeted response to the department's concerns. Since 1996, the commission has been voluntarily operating according to the joint protocol which HREOC drafted as an alternative to this bill. This protocol offers a middle way. HREOC will not inform detainees of their legal rights but neither will they be categorically denied the ability to investigate complaints from a third party. The work of HREOC is, for the most part, not compromised and, as far as I understand it, the protocol has served its purpose well for the past 2½ years. So the irony is that the bill may not even be necessary.
In the event of a detainee's human rights being contravened, that person has a right of access to a remedy, which, in Australia's case, is both the commission and the Ombudsman. To effect a remedy, these bodies need access to the detainee, whether by their own initiative or that of a third party. It is bad enough that the government is taking away the human rights of detainees, but it is doing this at the cost of the very bodies that are intended to monitor human rights. Where is the hope in this situation for detainees? I am quite horrified that HREOC could have been put in a situation where they had to trade off some of their responsibilities in order to be able to continue to conduct other parts of their important duties.
It needs to be put on the record that even if this bill is passed, there is no legal prohibition on third parties informing detainees of their legal rights. There is no obligation on departmental officers to inform detainees, but similarly there is no prohibition on departmental officers,  lawyers or even friends informing detainees. Up until late 1994, it seems that departmental officers were exercising their discretion to do so. The law therefore leaves to administrative discretion whether or not to advise, or allow third parties to advise, asylum seekers of their right to legal advice. I think the department would like us to forget this, but basically we are being discriminatory. Somebody is picking, off the 
 top of their head, who gets their rights and who does not. I can just imagine the next step is to stop that from happening altogether. It is just mind-blowing.
The assumption by the government is that only genuine refugees will request legal advice and, if legal advice is not requested, it is because the detainee does not want or need legal advice. Oh, come now! Any offer of information about legal advice amounts, therefore, in the government's eyes, to encouraging a detainee `to engage in unwarranted, lengthy or expensive processing'. The bottom line is: if people are not requesting legal advice, is it because they have no desire to or is it because they have no knowledge of how to obtain it? I put it to you that, if there is any chance at all that the second statement is true, then we have an obligation as a parliament to make sure that they obtain it. We cannot take a chance on the lives of people in these kinds of situations.
I mentioned a sense of deja vu, that we have been through this before, and that one of the last duties of my former colleague ex-Senator Chamarette was to speak on a similar piece of legislation—or she certainly felt it was duty, because she stood up so strongly for human rights on so many occasions in this place. There is certainly nobody in this parliament who spoke more fervently or more often about the rights of refugees and refugee law. Senator Chamarette at the time said:
The government and the opposition are supporting a government department's attempt to block the hole it perceives in our courts. That hole is the Federal Court's determination that the immigration department has a duty to deliver a sealed letter from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to some detainees in Port Hedland informing them of their rights.
Later on she said:
As I said, one reason this matter is urgent is that the parliament wants to do something that is presently illegal.
Yes, the court found that there was the ability to do those things, and the government ran to try to block up the hole. That quote was from a motion in relation to the cut-off at that time.
I think you would have to say that conditions are very traumatic for a lot of people. Perhaps what we are saying is that people 
 who are asylum seekers—those people who escape from a country where they are being persecuted—have somehow to know, and maybe it is by ESP, that they have to be experts in the law, they have to be experts in Australian immigration law, and they have to know how to access their rights before they become refugees.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-06-30,"—The opposition's position on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999]  has been put very well by Senator McKiernan. I want to say a few words, mainly about the second reading speech. The point I want to make is this: when legislation is brought before any chamber, arguments have to be put forward to explain why the change has been made. In this case, the law is being changed, but the material put forward in the second reading speech needs to be answered because there are inferences which, in my view, denigrate some quite outstanding people in this community.
Other people have spoken well about the trust of this legislation and about where it takes us. Some have supported it and others have rejected it. I want to speak about the process by which matters are argued before this chamber. The second reading speech contains, in my view, inferences about people that need to be answered. There is not much time because things are under pressure on this last day of sittings, but I will go through the second reading speech. It starts off by saying:
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Migration Act to clarify—
it uses the word `clarify'—
the rights of certain people who are in immigration detention.
The fourth paragraph says:
Section 256 of the Migration Act makes provision for access to legal advice by persons in immigration detention but only where the person in detention requests legal advice. This approach is clearly intended by the Migration Act and has been upheld by the courts in a number of cases.
The inference you must take from that is that, prior to the decision given by Mr Justice Lindgren in the Teal  case, there was no right for people to know about the law unless they 
 asked for it. In the last full paragraph on the first page it says:
Encouraged by the Federal Court's ruling, RACS—
that is the Refugee Advice and Casework Services—
then sought access to all the boat people who arrived around that period.
The inferences from this are that the Federal Court—Justice Lindgren—did not apply the law and that there were laws that were quite specific which it did not take into account. That comes from the sentence I read earlier:
This approach is clearly intended by the Migration Act and has been upheld by the courts in a number of cases.
We are short of time, and I do not want to take too much time during the committee stage. I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary what those laws were which Mr Justice Lindgren ignored. I hope you are listening to this, Parliamentary Secretary.
—She is indeed.
—Senator O'Chee, you may be able to tell her what those cases were that Justice Lindgren ignored, because in my view he has not ignored any. He made the law; his law was quite clear. This bill does not clarify rights; it changes the law. The law as it was before this was that set out by Justice Lindgren, and he has not acted in any way other than as a very competent, a very honourable and a very learned judge with a great record in the law.
The fifth paragraph of the second reading speech says:
Against this background, in March 1996 the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in Victoria (now known as the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre) sought access to people who had arrived on a boat named the ""Teal"" to provide legal advice.
On the next page it says:
Certain interest groups have always argued that all unlawful non-citizens should, on arrival in Australia, immediately be offered access to legal advice, even where they do not request it.
There has been a campaign—and I use the word advisedly—suggesting that the legal profession is trying to pervert the law and the immigration system for profit and that that is all that is on their mind. Again I ask the 
 parliamentary secretary whether people like Matthew Beckman, whom she would know, or Ross McDougall are the sorts of people who look for large sums of money or whether they are people who are dedicated to trying to help people through the legal maze, whether it be pursuant to migration legislation or any other sort of legislation.
These are people who live very frugally on very little money. I challenge the government to establish that the community legal centres and the refugee and immigration legal centres are places where money is made in big terms. They are people who are dedicated, whether you agree with them or not, to upholding the law and the rule of law in the community. They are, if you like, the Gandhis of the legal profession rather than anything else, and I think it is quite wrong—almost obscene—that a case should be put up that these sorts of people are profiting from this system, because they are not. That ought to be made quite clear. The second reading speech goes on:
RACS complained to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who then sought to have delivered to the captain, crew and passengers of the ""Teal"" a confidential letter, in reliance on the Commission's power under paragraph 20(6)(b) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act . The effect of that action would have been to ensure access to legal advice, despite the fact that none had been given.
That is a direct attack on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and a direct attack on Chris Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner. Both attacks are most unjustified and both should be corrected here. It is true the commissioner was carrying out the dictates of a complaint made by a third party and not by people who were held in a detention centre—it is conceded that it was not in response to that. Nevertheless, he was carrying out a duty and he had a right, according to law, to do that.
To put a sentence in a second reading speech that `the effect of this action would have been to ensure access to legal advice, despite the fact that none had been requested', implies that the Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Sidoti, tried to pervert the system. That is a most ungenerous suggestion, a wrong sugges 
 tion and a suggestion I want to correct here now. The Human Rights Commission is an organisation of the highest standing and Chris Sidoti, as the Human Rights Commissioner, is a person of the highest standing. Not only I but also people across the chamber and from every walk of life in the community would say that. I cannot quite gather why a second reading speech should have been set out in this way.
The department's refusal to deliver the lawful letter sent by the Human Rights Commission was in contradiction to the law, against the law. Why not come in with a second reading speech that says, `We have not got the power to refuse this letter but we want to change that. We want to switch it around. The Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Commissioner were right. RACS is an honourable organisation. The judge is an honourable person. Nevertheless, we find, as a matter of administration, we cannot go on as we're going and we want to change it.'? Why not come in with that sort of argument rather than with an argument that denigrates a lot of people with high reputations in this community?
To continue on that theme, this legislation not only stops the Human Rights Commission and Human Rights Commissioner, who sent the letter—and you can understand them wanting to say, `This is person who sent the letter, we want to stop that and make sure he does not do it again'—but it also excludes the Ombudsman. It implies that in some way the Ombudsman is going to be irresponsible—this is Mr Ron McLeod who has never even attempted to write a letter to any detainees. Why is he there and why should he be excluded when he has never done a thing? The inference there is that somehow, unless he is restrained, he is going to act irresponsibly.
So the Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights Commissioner and the Ombudsman are going to be irresponsible. There is no evidence to justify that at all. Why not, as I say, simply put the case as it should be put—that is, if this goes on, the government will find it difficult to administer the law and will therefore need to change it? Why not put it that way? That is an argument that can be 
 comprehended but, no, the government must go into this exercise in denigration.
The first full paragraph of the second page of the second reading speech says that certain interest groups have always argued that unlawful non-citizens should, on arrival in Australia, be offered legal advice. The inference there is that `certain interest groups' are interested financially, and I think there are those interest groups. But the interest groups here, as I said before—whether it be RACS or some other community legal centre, or whether it be Matthew Beckman or Ross McDougall or some other person—have an interest, whether you agree with it or not, in seeing justice done and the law carried out. Why should they be condemned for that? I think that ought to be corrected and I hope it is. The second paragraph goes on:
This Bill ensures that Parliament's intention in relation to the management of unauthorised arrivals in immigration detention, as reflected by section 256 of the Migration Act, cannot be subverted through the use of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986  or the Ombudsman Act 1976 .
Why use a word like `subverted'? If the parliamentary secretary is going to reply to this, I would like to know why that word was used, why it could be said that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Human Rights Commissioner, who a court has said acted correctly, can be described as subverting section 256 of the Migration Act. I do not know why that was said. I am at a loss to understand why it is necessary to denigrate good people.
On the amendments, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is going to be extended further by adding immigration offences to the list of offences in respect of which telephone lines can be tapped. Telephone tapping has become the order of the day. I refer the parliamentary secretary to section 7 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act which says:
A person shall not:
(a) intercept
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . .. a communication passing over a telecommunication system. 

The general philosophy is that the integrity of people's phones should be preserved; they should not be tapped. This is yet another exception. I understand the basis on which it is put. I just ask the parliamentary secretary, who has always been avid—and I used that word advisedly—in these issues of civil rights, in these issues of protecting people's privacy, how far the central part of the Telecommunications Interception Act is going to be more and more compromised. I can understand what she will say—that these are serious offences, which they are, and it is necessary for this to happen. Nevertheless, it is the legislative creep which she herself used to quite properly and I thought quite courageously criticise.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-06-30,"—The Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, introduced the budget on 11 May but, as everybody knew at the time, it was not the real budget. As we said at the time, it was based on three shaky assumptions: the full sale of Telstra; the passing of the GST without any change to the original ANTS package; and the maintenance of high levels of consumption. Since then, we have seen the chances of the full sale of Telstra going through, either before or after 1 July, disappear. The best the government have been able to achieve is 49 per cent, not the 100 per cent. The government and the Democrats have raided the surplus by another $3 billion. Opinion polling shows that people strongly oppose the GST, and there is every likelihood that they will continue to do so.
Within three days of the budget being brought down it was discredited by Senator Brian Harradine, who announced on Friday 14 May that he could not support the GST. The Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, did not expect this from Senator Harradine. He expected—and it is reflected in the budget—that the GST would be passed without any further compensation. The fact is that the reaction by Senator Harradine blew the budget out of the water. Senator Harradine rejected the GST on the grounds that it was unfair, discriminates against low income earners and is not capable of being reformed. Senator Harradine said that the GST is by its nature so regressive it cannot ever be made fair.
When Treasury appeared before the Senate inquiry they confirmed that the compensation package offered by the Prime Minister to pensioners during the election campaign was `nonadditive'. What Treasury said at the Senate estimates was that the 1.5 per cent compensation package would rise in line with CPI movements at about three-quarters per cent per year while the pension would move in line with increases in average weekly earnings for males at about four per cent per annum. The effect would be that the 1.5 per cent promise would run out after three years. Pensions would continue to rise in line with 25 per cent of average weekly earnings but 
 the compensation package would have been absorbed within the pension and cease to exist. These were the assumptions that underpinned this year's budget. This meant that pensioners would be no better off than before the GST, despite the promises that they would be compensated.
The validity of this concession by Treasury is confirmed by the decision of the Prime Minister to increase the pension to 26 per cent of average male weekly earnings. The Prime Minister knows that the compensation to pensioners should have been at least 26½ per cent of average male weekly earnings. The offer of 26 per cent was subsequently withdrawn in the negotiations with the Democrats. Senator Harradine sat through more than four months of deliberation by the Senate committee of inquiry into the GST and found that the government position was indefensible. The government compounded the inequity of the tax arrangements by agreeing to a secret amendment to the bill relating to the GST on high rollers and for our casinos. By the time of the Harradine announcement, the budget was in disarray, but worse was to come.
On 28 May, the government entered into a deal with the Democrats which is not only the worst of all possible results but it is the result which was neither supported or anticipated by the Treasurer nor reflected in his budget. The Howard-Democrat deal fails all the economic and social tests for tax reform. Tax reform should aid economic growth and employment and meet the tests of efficiency, equity and simplicity. On all of these criteria, the Howard-Democrat deal has failed. The result is that consumers, low income Australians and small businesses will bear the brunt of the new tax system.
The deal was done on Friday 28 May between Howard and the Democrats and it is a dog's breakfast of a deal. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, the number one ticket holder in the GST debate, stated when he wrote to ALP senators on 3 June 1999:
. . . the new tax package agreed to with the Democrats will impose substantial compliance administration costs on small business. 

Many small businesses which sell food . . . will find that they are unable to afford the necessary hardware and software to comply with the delineation required by the omission of `basic food' from the GST net.
Jeff Kennett predicted small businesses would close down because of this deal. He continued:
Moreover, it is almost impossible for many of these businesses to have systems in place to deal with the `basic food' definitions by July next year, when the GST is schedule to be introduced.
This new package which is now going to be reflected in the budget delivers the lion's share of the tax cuts to the top 20 per cent of income earners. The financial institutions duty will last for another six months. The banking administration duty will last until at least 2005. Compliance costs will increase for small businesses and over one million small businesses will become tax collectors for the first time. They are going ahead with abolishing the share transaction tax as predicted. On the one hand, if you are a pensioner with an account at the Commonwealth Bank, you are still going to pay all of those regressive indirect taxes which the government talked about, but if you trade shares, the share fee is going straight away. You get to stick with the five years of FIDs and BADs but if you trade shares you get that tax free move straight away—another example of the inequities of the revised package.
Senator Harradine rejected a five per cent increase linked to wages and other measures worth $1.5 to $2 billion. The Democrats have settled for a four per cent pension increase. Education is not GST free. The GST will still apply to books, uniforms, private tuition, some school excursions and sports equipment. Under the new arrangement with the Democrats we will all be worse off. Senator Brian Harradine has demonstrated that the GST is inequitable and cannot be fixed.
The Democrats' proposal does not change the fact that the GST is inequitable for low income earners and will remain so even if food is exempt. With the new compensation package being offered by the Prime Minister, first to Senator Harradine and now to the Democrats, it is clear that the 1999 budget was based on false assumptions—it is based 
 on the assumption of the full implementation of the ANTS package with no extra compensation. There is a new compensation package, which renders the budget redundant. It was pronounced dead on 28 May, barely two weeks after it was given birth on 11 May.
The 1999 budget was also based on the assumption of the 100 per cent sale of Telstra, despite the fact that the coalition promised it would not sell more than 49 per cent of Telstra without an independent inquiry. As we have seen already, the government passed a bill last week which only delivers 49 per cent. Many of the government's spending initiatives, especially the regional spending initiatives, rely on funding from 100 per cent sale of Telstra. The 1999 budget is based on the assumption that consumer spending will hold up. This will and cannot occur, and I will talk about this later.
Opinion polling shows that people are strongly opposed to the new package. In a recent Herald Sun poll, 230 people phoned in in supported the GST deal. By coincidence, in a poll the next day 640 people phoned in in support of the Ku Klux Klan. So three times as many people were prepared to say they supported the Ku Klux Klan than those who supported the GST deal.
No-one believes the compensation will last, no-one believes the rate will not go up and no-one believes the food exemption will last. We have the Premier of Victoria campaigning and saying, `To fix the dog's breakfast, what we need is the GST on food.' That is Jeff Kennett, the number one ticket holder. He dragged the Prime Minister and the Treasurer screaming and kicking into the GST debate in the first place and his is still committed to putting a GST on food. The government was already raiding the surplus by $5 to $7.5 billion per annum to buy a GST before the new package. The raid on the surplus amounted to some $17 billion over three years.
The deal with the Democrats, as I have already said, reduces this by a further $3 billion. And what is this for? Is it to stimulate innovation? No. It is not to boost our intellectual capital. It is not to invest in an information economy. It is not to build regional infrastructure. It was loosened to buy a new 
 unfair tax. The government has claimed consistently that the tax system is `broke', but without the GST we would have a surplus of $12 billion in 2000-01, $10 billion the next year and $19 billion the year after that. As Alan Kohler said recently:
The budget papers .. . show surpluses stretching forward as far as the eye can see.
No erosion of the tax base is projected in the budget. The GST package is fundamentally anti-family. Respected academic Professor Peter McDonald has pointed out the absurdity of the government's assumption that having a child will cost families only an additional 30 cents per week in GST. It took a Senate inquiry to prove that this contention is false and that the GST is unfair.
During the last election, what did the Prime Minister claim about it? He said there would be no losers, no job losses, that there was adequate compensation, that a 1.9 per cent inflation impact was expected and that there will be no increase in the city-country petrol price differential. All of it was refuted in evidence to the Senate committees. The Prime Minister did forget to mention during the election campaign that the pensioner compensation would erode to zero in the ANTS package, that renters living in hostels and caravan parks would face GST on their rent, that non-prescription medicines would be included in the GST, that the cost of educating our children would rise and that charities will have to wind back their services.
Fortunately, some of those issues were taken up by the Democrats in their total sell-out and some of those issues were addressed subsequently, but all of those things were there as part of the budget projections and the Prime Minister during the election campaign maintained the fictions that he continues to try to maintain even as recently as last night and this morning. It has also become clear that consumption spending is unlikely to remain at the current high levels. Page 225 of Budget Paper No. 1, says:
Some uncertainty remains around the extent to which the recent strength in household consumption expenditure will be sustained once the effects of recent increases in household wealth have run their course. A related area of uncertainty is the apparent downward trend in the household saving ratio and 
 rising household debt. If households move to stabilise or increase their saving rates from recent levels and to rein in the growth in household debt, household consumption expenditure could be weaker than forecast.
That is Treasury speak. I grew up in Canberra, so I have become used to dealing with Treasury and a bit of Treasury speak over the years. That is a red flashing warning light about the level of consumption—that the economy is being driven by consumption. The economy is living off bankcards and consumer debt is up. Credit growth has been running at around 11.5 per cent on an annual basis while non-household credit grew 15.3 per cent in the 12 months to March 1999. The budget papers reveal that in 1997-98 the household savings rate was three per cent. This is estimated to have fallen to 1.25 per cent in 1998-99 and is forecast to fall to one per cent in 1999-2000.
On Tuesday, 18 May, and repeated and reinforced since that date, Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Bank in the US announced that the bank was preparing to increase interest rates. This was a consequence of inflation expectations jumping sharply in April. Any rise in interest rates would have negative implications for Wall Street and the Australian market. An Australian Bureau of Statistics report released on Monday, 28 June, showed that Australian household debt had grown by $10.8 billion in the March quarter of this year, mainly in new loans. Each Australian owed, on average, $20,556 in the March quarter, an increase of more than $5,000 from three years ago.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants spokesman, Mr Peter Macks, was reported in the Courier Mail on 29 June as saying that when household savings fall and there are warnings of interest rate rises people should reduce their level of debt. How can the Treasurer possibly maintain that consumption levels are going to continue to rise when he knows that if people do not voluntarily reduce their level of debt and consumption, the Reserve Bank will have to increase interest rates? Turning to the current account in Australia today, as Terry McCrann said on 1 June, Australia ran up a record trade deficit of $4.5 billion in the March quarter. In April, 
 Australia posted its biggest ever trade deficit of $1.9 billion.
The current account deficit will soon pass six per cent of GDP, yet the government has taken no action in the budget to correct the situation. The current account deficit is the most serious issue facing the country while Treasury officials are consumed by the issue of cooked chickens. The growing trade deficit increases the likelihood of an interest rate rise notwithstanding the assurances of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr McFarlane, that it may be possible to avoid an interest rate increase this year. The government appears to be saying that if the federal budget is in surplus, its responsibilities to the trade deficit are nil. This is despite the fact that in 1996 the Treasurer said that the trade deficit was the biggest issue facing the country and he would fix it. The Treasurer paraded a debt truck around the country in the 1996 election showing Australia $190 billion in hock to foreigners. What is the figure today? Is it lower? No. It is $240 billion. Is that his idea of fixing the problem?
According to Budget Paper No. 1, page 225:
There continues to be great uncertainty surrounding the international economic outlook and with that the outlook for Australia's export industries and the terms of trade.
The government is fudging the figures on the current account deficit. It is seeking to make light of the problem, if not ignore it completely. The Treasurer simply does not understand that the key to the current account is improving our savings effort, gaining continuous improvement in productivity arising from economic reforms and increasing investment. We said at the last election that this government does not have a plan for this country, it just has a plan for a new tax. Where is the plan for the unemployed? The government in the budget papers appears happy with attempting to freeze unemployment at 7.5 per cent. What happened to the five per cent target that the Treasurer promised earlier this year? Where has that gone in the budget? There is no mention of the five per cent target. It is just steady as she goes— 
 unemployment can stay at 7.5 per cent; it does not matter.
Business investment has slumped to a 15year low. Business investment is forecast to be negative. Do you see the Prime Minister going on the telly to say, `The GST is great—it is going to fix the economy—but by the way business investment is negative'? According to the latest capital expenditure intentions provided by the Bureau of Statistics, the best case scenario suggests that investment next financial year will be 10 per cent lower than for 1998-99. The budget proves that we do not need a GST. It is also relevant to note that over these two years wholesale sales tax will grow faster than GDP is estimated to grow. This is from a system that the Treasurer claims was broken. Labor supports tax reform. The significant tax reform of the eighties and nineties introduced by Labor underpins the budget. In the period 1990 to 1995, PAYE receipts rose by $7 billion to $48 billion, or 16 per cent, because of the substantial tax cuts as part of the One Nation package.
This was tax reform, but without a GST. Similarly, Labor today acknowledges the need for further tax reform, but again tax reform without a GST. This budget confirmed that it could be done. Last year's budget papers stated:
The projected surpluses are not predicated on higher growth in revenues. Revenues as a share of GDP are projected to remain relatively stable through the forward estimates period and are little different from their 1995-96 levels of around 25% of GDP.
This year's budget demonstrated that last year's projections were correct; the current tax system was delivering enough revenue in a fair manner to meet the nation's needs; there was room for significant fair tax reductions for low and middle income families; and Australia did not need a GST. The results over the last decade speak for themselves. We do not need an unfair, job destroying change to our tax system. What did the Australian Industry Group say about the budget in those few days after it came down? They said:
In relation to business the R&D industry remains frustrated at the lack of clarification of the future of the R&D tax concession. On latest figures 
 Australia ranks 16th in the OECD in terms of business R&D spend and expenditure is falling not rising. We need to address this. Restoring the Tax Concession to 150%, and, in fact, increasing it, is way overdue.
That is what the Australian Industry Group said. Even after adding in all the government's research initiatives in this budget, government spending on science and innovation in 1999-2000 is still below that spent in Labor's last year. More disturbing, government investment in science and innovation as a proportion of GDP has declined from 0.78 per cent in 1995-96 to around 0.63 per cent in 1999-2000—one of the lowest figures ever recorded since they started keeping records. This is projected to fall further in subsequent years.
According to my colleague the shadow minister for industry and technology, Bob McMullan, business expenditure on research and development has decreased from $4,300 million in 1995-96 to $3,700 million in 1998-99. This decline is a direct result of the Howard government's 1996 decision to cut the research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. Our capacity to restore the R&D concessions and grants to science is threatened if a GST is introduced. Australia cannot afford the GST. The numbers do not add up.
If the government had any idea what to do, it would have had a budget that introduced capital gains relief for new venture capital, increased funding for education to ensure all members of our community improve their ability to gain employment, improved the infrastructure in regional Australia—especially for rail—and restored R&D tax breaks to their 1996 levels. Moreover, if there is a deterioration in the economy over the next few years, the budget will be in deficit on top of the worst trade figures that we have seen.
The budget introduced on 11 May has constrained the government because of the cost of introducing the GST and the tax cuts for those least in need. In 1995, the now Treasurer said that the greatest problem facing this country was the trade deficit. It has got worse and continues to do so, and the government does not care. We needed a budget that secured the surplus, returned the bracket creep 
 to taxpayers, addressed business tax reform and made a stronger commitment to education and training. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"MacGibbon, Sen David",LP,1999-06-30,"—This group of bills formally states where the government proposes to spend money throughout the next 12 months—money that has been raised from the Australian community. Therefore, it is the taxpayers' money—not an act of benevolence by a benign, generous or caring government. A civilised society must have two essential attributes: it must have a rule of law which codifies its behaviour; it also must have trust within the community. Trust is particularly important in the financial area.
The collection of money through taxes and other means, while backed up by the force of law, is in the main a voluntary activity in Australia, although we have to recognise that, particularly with respect to the collection of taxes, it might be an obligation that is somewhat grudgingly undertaken. Nevertheless, in the main, it is a voluntary activity. In return for that, the community trusts the government to spend the money so raised—if not wisely, at least in an open way—and be publicly accountable for those expenditures. The appropriation bills that come before the parliament and the Senate estimates committees—which have the power to investigate to the very last cent the expenditure proposed by the government, if they had the time to do so—form a very essential part in this accountability process.
On the subject of money, I wish to discuss the matter of  charitable trusts. As part of my interest in charitable organisations and the role of charity in Australia, I have been pursuing justice in relation to the legislation covering charitable trusts for more than two years now, and I want to raise the matter in public. There are many types of trusts. For the purpose of this debate, I exclude every type of trust except charitable trusts.
Charitable trusts are those trusts set up by a benefactor to distribute benefits in perpetuity to deserving individuals or groups. Charitable trusts are a legal entity. Someone contributes a sum of money and decrees that the income from that sum of money be distributed 
 to a designated worthy cause. The trust is administered by trustees who carry out the wishes of the donor and manage the investment of the sum of money in a prudent manner.
Since charitable trusts are set up in perpetuity, usually the family or friends of the donor do not survive long enough to manage the trusts in the long haul and the administration of those trusts is carried out by professional commercial companies which specialise in this work. Only companies of high repute were engaged in this task because of the responsibilities they have. Furthermore, those companies that were professional trustee companies respected the generosity of the benefactor and his or her wish to support a charitable cause and charged appropriate fees—covering their outlays and making a moderate profit. They never got into the field to exploit the trust.
Legislation covering the costs of charitable trusts is in the province of the state governments. Historically, the great majority of charitable trusts are based in Victoria and, therefore, are covered by legislation of the Victorian parliament. The next largest group is in New South Wales. The current charges provided for under legislation are about 5¼ per cent of the income of the trust in New South Wales and six per cent in Victoria. That scale of charges represents broadly the level of expenditure, going back at least 50 years, required to operate a trust.
Sadly, in the last decade we have seen a very marked change in attitude in the management of trustee companies such as Perpetual Trustees and Permanent Trustees. From a position where they sought moderate returns for the work they did, they now seek to maximise their returns. This change is not driven by a need to cover increased costs. The present scale of charges of between five and six per cent for the administration returns a very handsome profit for the administration of the trusts, particularly the large trusts, because there is not that much work involved.
It is true that, for small trusts—and I am talking about trusts below $500,000—the administrative costs might well break even with the five or six per cent figure and, for 
 smaller sums of money, the administrative costs could exceed the five or six per cent figure. But it has to be pointed out that those small trusts are very much in the minority and, in the overall position, the present trustee companies do very well.
The trustee companies in Australia form part of an association known as the Trustee Corporation Association. They devised a strategy to conceal their objective of extracting more in management fees and they induced both the Victorian and the New South Wales governments to change their legislation. They did this covertly and without public scrutiny. What they did was very simple and very deceiving. They proposed that there be a change from five or six per cent of the income earned by the trusts to a figure of one per cent of capital value. The apparent generosity of moving from a figure of five or six per cent to a figure of one per cent masks a very great change in the returns to the companies. In fact, there is a more than fourfold increase in the profits coming from this.
The mathematics of it are very simple. Over the long haul a trust will earn on average five per cent of its capital income. For the sake of argument, let us assume that a trust earns $5 million per annum. If it is showing five per cent in the long haul there is a capital sum of $100 million involved. A management fee of five per cent of income on an income of $5 million is $250,000—a figure which more than adequately covers the cost of administration. However, if you move to a one per cent of capital value, that $250,000 becomes $1 million just with the stroke of a pen. There is a huge difference. In fact the five per cent of income, which was the former charge, becomes 20 per cent of income. The only way that money can be paid is by reducing the benefit to the recipients.
In a very furtive, underhand way the Trustee Corporation Association of Australia induced both the Victorian and the New South Wales state governments to pass the appropriate legislation. That legislation was passed in New South Wales, and when the government was challenged about it, it passed an amending bill excluding charitable trusts 
 in 1997. Thanks to the intervention of the Trustee Corporation Association, that bill has never been given royal assent. It has never been proclaimed into law, so the original act covering it stands. The management of the trustee companies are motivated by pure greed. They do not see their role, as they did in former years, as providing a public service while covering their outlays and making a moderate profit. They are in there purely to maximise the profit for their companies and to build their stock prices up.
I will refer to the performance of Perpetual Trustees on the stock market. On 31 December 1995 the shares of Perpetual Trustees were selling for $4.60. At the end of 1997 they were selling for $10.70. On 31 May this year they were selling for $23.50. Certainly the stock market has had a very good run, but the performance of Perpetual Trustees far outstrips the average movement in the market. While the public are quite rightly outraged at the charges and the performance of the four major Australian banks, the stock prices of the banks have not moved as much as the price of Perpetual Trustees' shares has.
I am a marketeer; I have no objection to companies making a profit. That is what business is all about. But what we are looking at here is a gross abuse of power. Men and women set up these trusts in the past to help those less fortunate than themselves in society. The terms under which they set up their trusts are now enshrined in a legal form. The benefactors in most cases are dead; they have no flexibility at all. They cannot rewrite the terms of their trust. They cannot go on the market and go for competitive bids with other trustee companies. They are simply denied the opportunity to reorder their affairs. When they set their trusts up they believed that, in light of what had been legislated in the past, they could expect a management fee of about five per cent, which meant that 95 per cent of the profit of their trusts would go to people who were deserving. They now face a fourfold increase in the management fee, which means a dramatic decline in the funds dispersed. It should be noted that there is no reason why those charges cannot be increased further in 
 the years ahead by the same stratagem, because greed feeds on greed.
In light of the active interest by the Prime Minister in charitable institutions in Australia, the Federal Attorney-General should counsel his state counterparts to rescind this legislation where it covers charitable trusts, except those trusts for which it can be clearly shown that their management costs are unprofitable at a five or six per cent figure. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am talking about charitable trusts. All the other trusts that exist in Australia are run by people who are alive and engaged in business and who have the opportunity to put alternative arrangements in place. The point about the charitable trusts is that the founders of those trusts have no flexibility at all.
In the opening passage of my speech I talked about the essential need for trust in, and accountability of, government in the expenditure of public funds. How those funds are spent is not the issue. We have all got different ideas about how government should spend money, and the community has the opportunity through regular elections—and this is one advantage of the three-year electoral cycle—to change the government if it does not approve of the way the government of the day is spending money. The important issue, though, is that the government be quite open as to where the money is spent. In a general sense there are no criticisms that can be levelled at Australian federal governments of any persuasion with respect to accountability. The accountability is very good and the processes are quite transparent, except in relation to one area which has been a concern of mine over a number of years. It relates to the security and intelligence agencies in this country.
We are presented with a one-line entry for each of the five intelligence agencies that exist in this country. Traditionally, no minister will ever take any question at a Senate estimates hearing as to how that expenditure takes place. That is fair enough. You cannot divulge the operations of the security and intelligence gathering organisations in this country. But the issue goes further than that. The parliament accepts 
 responsibility for those agencies. When we pass these appropriation bills, we will approve a sum in aggregate for the five agencies in excess of $445 million for the next 12 months. No-one in this chamber can stand up and say to the public, `We can assure you that that money has been properly and effectively spent.' That matter demands to be addressed.
It cannot be addressed in a public forum. We are talking here about organisations which are and which must remain secret in their operation. That means that any parliamentary oversight of them similarly must be by people who maintain secrecy about their activities. It does mean that the whole of the parliament cannot know what goes on, but it is possible for the parliament to delegate that authority to senior, responsible senators and members of integrity to do it on their behalf.
Different countries have different approaches to the way they go about this. The American congress works on the basis that congress must know and, while the whole of the congress does not know what is going on in their agencies, certainly the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is briefed on a daily basis, down to the names of the personnel involved, on operations. I personally do not think it is necessary from the point of view of being able to be fully accountable, but different countries have different ways. The important thing for Australia is that we simply have no parliamentary oversight of our intelligence bodies at all. We vest that oversight in the ministers, but the ministers responsible—the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General—have the busiest portfolios in the parliament. With the best will in the world, they do not have the time to effectively oversee the operations of those bodies, even though they accept responsibility for them.
We have a parliamentary committee, the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, and it is absolutely futile. Part VA of the act, which was amended in 1987, provides that the parliamentary committee cannot look at anything relating to foreign nationals or any matters that relate to foreign intelligence. It cannot look at any organisational matter of 
 the organisation and it cannot look at complaints about the organisation. Effectively, it is powerless. In 1995, when we had a crisis, we had the Samuels inquiry into the operations of ASIS. The Labor government of the day accepted that there should be a joint committee set up for oversight of both ASIO and ASIS, and five years later nothing has happened. We effectively have no oversight at all, and in that we stand out, alone, from all other democracies. However inefficient their processes might be, other countries do far more in the way of oversight than we do. My belief is that the parliamentary process must develop a system of accountability for that.
The legality of the organisations is covered by the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence. Basically what the Inspector-General does is see that these organisations conform to Australian law, and there does not seem to be much doubt that that does occur all the time. But it would be good to have a parliamentary committee overseeing them to provide an independent view of the operations of these organisations with respect to their conformation to the law. There are ways that this can be done. The method I propose is that a committee be set up of parliamentarians—not a parliamentary committee, because I think we need an assurance of the integrity of the people on that committee. My proposal would be that a small committee of five senior senators and members, selected by the Prime Minister of the day in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, be appointed to operate as an oversight committee. The committee should not be restricted to the field operators, ASIO and ASIS. There is quite a reaction in the bureaucracy against involving the other organisations, the analytical organisations like RNA, DIO and DSD, in any parliamentary oversight. That is absolutely illogical. Clearly parliamentary oversight would be greater on the field operators, where lives are at stake and where the opportunities to breach the law are greater. Bodies like ASIO and ASIS are the two in that category. But logically there should be oversight of all organisations.
The British parliament have resolved this issue. It is interesting that the British, right up 
 to Mrs Thatcher's time, strenuously denied the existence of any intelligence agencies, despite all the stories over the years from James Fleming and going back to John Buchan and The 39 Steps. Through the Thatcher years there was the celebrated argument within the bureaucracy in Whitehall which was known as the debate on avowal—whether they avowed the existence of these agencies. In the end the avowalists won, and it is a matter of history that Stella Rimington, the head of one of the organisations, became a figure of great public exposure in Britain, always appearing on television and the rest of it. The British government now avow the existence of their intelligence agencies.
Most importantly, they set up a committee of senior parliamentarians and charged them with the responsibility of looking at the expenditure, administration and policy of all their agencies. Those words are very good because they exclude from the parliamentary committee involvement in operational details and thereby maintain the security of the organisation. I think that is very important. But it allows the parliament, through a small group, to have oversight of the operations of those agencies and thereby provide an assurance for the public that they are being properly and effectively run.
That is the recommendation I leave with this parliament: that we do need to pick up on the accountability of our intelligence agencies. I believe it can be done. It must be done in a way that is very different from looking at the oversight of the health department, the defence department, welfare or anything like that. But the public do demand accountability from us and in turn we must demand accountability from the Public Service. The days are long gone in Australia when the intelligence agencies were seen as an instrument of persecution of one section of the community or another. The community now do accept the need for timely, relevant and accurate intelligence, and they want the assurance that the process by which that is derived is properly done.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-06-30,"—Madam Acting Deputy President, I am advised that this is your last scheduled stint 
 in the chair. Can I say on behalf of my colleagues that we all value the work you have done not only in this capacity but also in all capacities in your parliamentary career. I seek to put those remarks on the record.
—Thank you.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, if I can be disorderly and associate myself with those remarks, I will do so.
—Thank you for being disorderly.
—I think we can excuse that latitude in this case, Madam Acting Deputy President. In terms of my contribution to this debate, in recent conversation about the performance of members of the Howard ministry, it was suggested that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, seemed to be doing a reasonable job. The response from a long-time Liberal Party watcher was swift. He said that the reason Alexander Downer seemed to be doing a reasonable job was simple: everyone thought he was going to be an absolute disaster but he has turned out to be barely competent.
The same cannot be said for the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. Everyone thought that Senator Ian Macdonald was going to be an absolute disaster—and he is. The evidence of his failure is to be found in hundreds of pages of the Hansard of estimates committees. As you are aware, the estimates committee is a forum that enables senior bureaucrats to assess the ability of less senior bureaucrats. If a committee is doing its job properly, it will effectively scrutinise the details of each program in a portfolio and the abilities of the public servants who administer those programs. The estimates process also provides a very useful forum for assessing the quality of various ministers. This is very much the case when the minister at the table has direct responsibility for the programs being scrutinised. In those circumstances, ministers have an opportunity to show their grasp of their portfolio. They also have a chance to explain the policy merit of programs they administer.
My view of Senator Ian Macdonald was confirmed by his performance in the February estimates hearings of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. I asked him for some general information about the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and the results of the review undertaken by a former Liberal minister, Mr Peter Nixon. I asked what recommendations the government had accepted and what would therefore receive funding in the upcoming budget. The minister said that he was directly responsible for administering the scheme, but he could not answer the question—he said that he would have to take it on notice. He said that he had not yet briefed himself on the key recommendations.
The government won the last election on 3 October 1998 and I was putting these questions to Senator Ian Macdonald on 8 February 1999. He had no idea, even in the most general terms, about a key regional program for which he had direct  responsibility. Even though he had a number of senior departmental officers at the table with him, he was still unable to respond to the most basic questions. And things did not improve much in the next round of hearings. I asked Senator Ian Macdonald about the proposal that Bass Strait be made part of the national highway system. I was confident that he knew the details of this matter as he had met with the committee promoting this proposal only a month before and had been quoted extensively in the press on it.
Senator Ian Macdonald said that he had requested a submission from the committee but had not received one. In fact, his department had received the material but it had not yet been referred to him. Even though he had asked for a submission from this group and the submission was subsequently provided, and even though he was yet to see the submission or consider advice from his department about its merits or otherwise, he ruled out the proposal. He did not bother to read the submission. He did not seek advice. He just killed it off.
The estimates hearings considering the details of the 1999-2000 budget took place between 31 May and 3 June. These hearings 
 presented a chance for Senator Ian Macdonald to recover some much needed lost ground. They offered him an opportunity to stamp his authority on local government and regional development and to gain some important breathing space from keen, if somewhat untalented, backbenchers who were already eyeing off his spot. He failed. The disturbing indicators of his lack of ability and application to the task, which were seen in the hearings in February and early May, were well and truly confirmed.
At the hearings on 31 May, I asked Senator Ian Macdonald some questions about running costs. He said that he could not tell the committee how some $79 million might be spent in the upcoming financial year. I wanted to know how this sum of money might be allocated. He could not answer this question. Senator Mackay then asked the minister if he could give the committee ballpark figures on how this money might be spent by the various divisions—a question seeking the most general information, and information which was contained in earlier budget papers but which did not appear in those relating to the 1999-2000 budget.
An officer at the table, Mr Martin, said that the department had looked at the matter but deferred to the minister and the chair—and that is at page 36 of the Hansard. Senator Mackay asked:
I am asking what the ball-park figure is for each of the divisions in your department for this budget which we are debating now, and you are refusing to give me that information. Is that correct?
Senator Ian Macdonald said that the divisions were operating `under sufficient money to achieve what the government wants them to achieve'. Senator Mackay then asked what the tentative budget was for each of the divisions of the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The minister said, `We have not done it. We do not have them.' Senator Mackay asked, `So you do not know?' and the minister replied, `No.'
However, a short time later in the same hearings, Senator Carr asked the minister about the administration of the Norfolk Island Act. Specifically, he asked what resources had been allocated to provide advice on Green 
 wich University. Senator Ian Macdonald said that he did not think that any money had been allocated for that purpose. Senator Carr then asked, `You have allocated no officers' time?' and Senator Ian Macdonald replied, `I would not imagine so, no.' Senator Ian Macdonald is directly responsible for the administration of the Norfolk Island Act 1979. On page 54 of the portfolio budget statement for 1999-2000, under the heading `Activity', it states `Administration of the Norfolk Island Act 1979'.
Under the performance indicators for the administration of the act—on the same page—it states that the quality measure is the accurate, appropriate and comprehensive advice to the minister's satisfaction. The latest annual report of the Department of Transport and Regional Services says that the role of the department is to provide advice to the minister—Senator Ian Macdonald—on developing, implementing and evaluating Commonwealth policies and programs for Norfolk Island. That is at page 134. Clearly, funding is allocated to this issue in the 1999-2000 budget. If it is not, the performance indicators in the budget statements will not be met and the latest annual report is misleading. So Senator Ian Macdonald misled the committee on this point. Frankly, his error was through incompetence; it was not deliberate.
Senator Carr then asked the following question in relation to the estimates process:
Do you think that questions that relate to the expenditure of money for running costs would be appropriate?
Senator Ian Macdonald replied:
For the running costs of the department, yes.
Senator Ian Macdonald then proceeded to detail the running costs associated with the administration of matters relating to Norfolk Island. He said the cost was around $440,000. One minute there was no money for advice on Norfolk Island, the next minute there was $440,000. One minute the minister could not give the most general information about the allocation of running costs by division for the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the next minute we got a breakdown of the running costs for a group of five officers who manage the Norfolk Island desk.
In relation to the issue of the new arrangements for the diesel fuel rebate, which differentiate between the city and the bush, I asked the minister how we defined regional and non-regional. Senator Ian Macdonald had in fact put out a media release on this very matter some days earlier. He told the committee he wrote it himself in his office at midnight on the previous Friday. I wanted to know what local governments would fall within the definition of regional and what local governments would be outside it. He said he was not aware that such information was available.
Senator Ian Macdonald said it was a matter for Treasury and, anyway, it was not relevant to the 1999-2000 budget. But of course his own portfolio budget statement again contradicted him. The budget statement for 1999-2000, on page 53, under the `Activity' heading, says:
. . . assistance in relation to necessary implementation costs incurred in complying with the requirements of the GST legislation.
That statement seemed very clear to everyone except Senator Ian Macdonald. I did pursue the matter further and was told by Senator Ian Macdonald that he did not know whether or not he was actually asked for that advice. He said he did not know whether or not any work had been done on that matter. Prompted by his officials, he then said advice was provided by his department on this matter. Clearly that was the first he had heard of it. Senator Ian MacDonald then tried to explain his embarrassment away. He said he would not necessarily be told if his department was providing advice to another department. Remember, we are talking about key policy advice here.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This is your last time in the chair in this chamber and I think that should be brought to the attention of the Senate. On behalf of the government, I thank you for the role that you have carried out in that capacity.
—Thank you, Minister.
—I was talking about Senator Ian Macdonald explaining his embarrassment away and the fact that he said he 
 would not necessarily be told if his department was providing advice to another department. He then agreed that it would be okay for Mr Anderson to ask officers about a local government issue and to get that advice without any reference to him.
Frankly, if Senator Ian Macdonald knew what was going on in his office, he would find that he is supplied with a copy of all briefings for Mr Anderson that are directly in his area of responsibility. He is also provided with copies of briefs in areas that are directly a matter for Mr Anderson but have some relevance to his ministry. So he should keep a better eye on his in-tray. I suppose he might say that that is not the case, but if he is not being provided with copies of this material as a matter of course, he has a major problem—that is, even his own department is ignoring him.
Mr Acting Deputy President, at this point it is important that I remind you that I am quoting a minister of the federal government giving evidence at an estimates hearing. I am quoting a minister of the Crown giving evidence to a Senate committee about his administration of his own department. During the last estimates hearing, when we were attempting to find out how over $79 million in running costs might be allocated between the various transport modes, information which is readily available in last year's budget statement but is now not available, at the direction of the minister, the minister told the committee he had no idea what advice he might seek, therefore he could not say how this money might be spent. He said:
I have got no idea what I might ask them next month to advise me on. It might be something you raise. It might be a good suggestion I have never heard of. I will ask for some advice then.
For the minister's sake, I have some suggestions, and I would appreciate the minister seeking some advice on the merits of these proposals.
I think it would be good to use some of the $79 million to have a look at the merits of providing an additional $120,000 to the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. This funding could be used to finance a feasibility study into the construction of a 
 hydrodynamics facility at the AMC. If the feasibility study produced a positive outcome, the facility could be constructed at a cost of around $15.3 million. The hydrodynamics facility would enable the AMC to undertake modelling of the ocean environment, in particular deep water, wind and wave action. It would enable the Australian marine engineering industry to capture the benefits of the research. That would seem to me to be a good investment of part of the $79 million that the minister is yet to commit because he does not know what he might ask next month.
The minister could also allocate an additional $10,000 for legal expenses to meet the costs of enshrining the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme in legislation. The money would be allocated to the budget item 650-2-03, `Compensation and legal expenses'. The effort would be to protect the scheme from the annual attack of the evil forces of the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet. Changes to the scheme would require a decision of parliament then, not just of the Minister for Finance and Administration. It would make life much easier for Senator Ian Macdonald.
Senator Ian Macdonald might also like to increase the funding for the Remote Air Service Subsidy by $100,000. This would restore funding for the Remote Air Services Scheme to 1997-98 levels and provide an increase in the level of subsidy to enable service providers to better meet licensing requirements being imposed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The minister may not be aware of it—even though there is a specific reference to it in the budget papers and it is a key regional program—but this scheme is currently the subject of a review. It currently provides essential services to more than 200 remote locations and directly assists some 9,000 people. Additional funding may be required depending on the outcome of the review.
Just one more funding change the minister might like to consider is making financial provisions for former employees of Australian National to continue to access travel concessions. Funding of about $85,000 is all that would be required. On that matter, the sale of 
 Australian National was completed in November 1997. Travel concessions were made available to eligible former employees until 31 March 1999, when responsibility for concessions was transferred to the Department of Family and Community Services. At that time, the concessions were withdrawn because there was no `legal requirement' to pay them. I use the term `legal requirement' because I am quoting from correspondence from the government on the matter. While there was no technical legal obligation for the continued provision of the concessions, there was clearly a moral obligation—an obligation the government felt it should honour for some 16 months. When the government found it had no legal obligation, it stopped the program. Senator Ian Macdonald has a reputation for being mean-spirited. He could go some way towards addressing that problem by reinstating funding to ensure that these elderly retired AN workers enjoy a small but important entitlement.
The real victims, unfortunately, of the poor performance of any federal minister are his or her constituents. Unfortunately, Senator Ian Macdonald's constituency is regional Australia. This section of the community has been doing it tough for some time. One only has to go back to a speech delivered by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Anderson, at the National Press Club in February. Mr Anderson told the Press Club that `the sense of alienation, of being left behind and of no longer being recognised and respected for the contribution being made to the nation is deep and palpable in much of rural and regional Australia'. The appointment and, more importantly, the performance of Senator Ian Macdonald to this important portfolio have, in my view, only added to these concerns.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-30,"—I support the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1999-2000  and related legislation. I take this opportunity to make a contribution about the current situation in politics in Australia and about one particular person who has contributed mightily to positive politics in this country. We have in the last couple of weeks seen a sea change—some might put it as the earth 
 moving—in the political configuration in this country. Of course, it is being played out here in the Senate. I have for some time thought that we might see a move by the Democrats on issues to do with business, taxation and society. We certainly have. They have leapfrogged Labor in the political spectrum in a very permanent fashion to be very much now to the right of centre next to the coalition parties, with One Nation—shortly to be represented in this Senate, I believe—out there further still to the right.
There are, through the tenor of the public, Senate and political debates of the last couple of weeks in particular, clear indications that this is going to be a permanent change and that a decision has been made by the Democrats to ensure that over the next two years, while jousting no doubt with the government on some issues, they will take part in a consultative process which allows government designs for legislation a better passage through the Senate.
The thing that did astonish many people in the environment movement, me included, was that the Democrats picked up the bundle of environmental policies, which had grounded the Democrats on the side of Australia's environment over the last two decades, and took it with them as they leapfrogged Labor. They now find themselves captive to a degree to the Howard government's designs on the environment over the next two years. If we look at the last three years, we can see that the delivery for the environment is going to be measured in terms of dollars and cents, which is the poorest measure possible for environmental outcomes.
The measurement of environmental excellence has to be in environmental indices themselves. Whether you look at global warming, the destruction of forests or the wellbeing of cities—the lifestyle of the people, the air we breathe and the water we drink—the indices are not improving in Australia. That is because this is not a government that has environmental teeth or that will legislate to ensure that those people who are creating environmental detriment, by law, are stopped. The experience right round the world is that you need that public educa 
 tion. Putting out volumes of coloured brochures will influence the good—the people who do the right thing—but will not influence those who are motivated by things other than environmental excellence. The Democrats have now joined that line of political action, and I think it is going to be found very much wanting in the coming two years.
It is interesting to look at what the make-up of the Senate will be as at midnight tonight, and certainly when we return in early August. The government will then simply require the Democrats to get legislation through the parliament. In fact, no other numbers will do, except for those basic matters like this appropriations bill where the Labor opposition and the government will line up necessarily the same way. Most pieces of legislation, of course, go through parliament with support all round, but I am talking about where contention comes in, like the big pieces of legislation we have dealt with in the last few days in the Senate. In that situation, where the Labor Party opposes what the government is doing, the government can look to the Democrats—the nine of them—or it can look to the other three components in the Senate: me as a Green, Senator Harradine as an Independent and, presumably, a One Nation senator. The three of us combined cannot give the government the numbers it requires. Its only way of getting legislation through is with the numbers that the Democrats provide.
When you look at those numbers, it is all the more remarkable that the Democrats got so little change and gave in so much to the government on the GST and the diesel fuel rebate legislation, and then caved in almost totally on the environment legislation, when they had such enormous leverage to get so much more as we move into the new Senate. They forwent the opportunity to get changes which would have been much more consistent with their past performance, presumably because they did not want to be faced with the turmoil that comes of a party consistently blocking the government on big ticket items where the government might threaten a double dissolution. I do not know what the Democrats' reasoning is, but I do know that we are seeing a permanent change in politics 
 and in the relationship between the Democrats and the government, which is going to be fascinating to watch in the next two years.
I suspect that, time and again, the Democrats are going to give the government the numbers to put legislation through and then—as with the GST and the environment legislation—when that legislation is found wanting, when it hurts people like small businesses and there is reaction against it in the coming years, the government is going to turn around and say to its new friends, `You are to blame. If you hadn't changed the legislation, this wouldn't be happening.' That puts the Democrats in a somewhat invidious position, but they have taken that on of their own volition.
It is also interesting to see the make-up on this side of the Senate. The Labor Party will also need the Democrats to get motions or amendments through the Senate, plus one other. That could be me, it could be Senator Harradine or it could be One Nation. It may be that I will look more kindly upon some of the social justice and environmental moves that will be made there. We have yet to see. But it has escaped the notice of quite a few observers that the numbers, with the Democrats and the Labor Party plus one, are here to see legislative changes, disallowances of regulations and motions put through the Senate. I have seen, for example, quite a bit of speculation that the Labor Party and the Democrats are going to establish an inquiry concerning Justice Callinan when the Senate resumes. The analysts need to look further, because another vote is required to support such a matter. It is a very complex issue and it is not in the hands of the Democrats and the Labor Party alone; it will depend on one of the three other senators being convinced that that is a good course of action to take. So far nobody has approached me about that matter.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to pay tribute to your immediate predecessor in the chair, Senator Reynolds. Senator Reynolds is a remarkably warm-hearted, thoughtful and caring person who has been a positive contributor to this Senate for many years. Her departure will be a loss to the national parliament, although I suspect that Senator 
 Reynolds is going to be a great contributor to public life in the years to come. I am delighted to know that she is, at least in part, returning to Tasmania where she is going to be an asset for the Tasmanian community, not least to the people of Launceston when she is there.
I now want to turn to the main component of my thoughts today, and that is to my very dear colleague, Dee Margetts, who is also having her last day in the Senate. The other night in the corridor, after her terrific speech to the Senate, Dee Margetts was described to me by another senator as perhaps the one true legislator, in the fullest meaning of that word, in the Senate. We have had in Dee Margetts a person of enormous application to the whole complexity of the passage of legislation and therefore to the welfare of the people of Australia. I do not think anybody is going to countermand me when I say that Dee Margetts's contribution has gone far beyond her own light comment that it may mean that she has talked the most in here. It has never been without great concern for the welfare of Australia—not least Western Australians—that Dee Margetts has been on her feet in this place, fighting for the philosophy that she believes in. That philosophy can be summed up by her own inaugural speech back in 1993. Dee Margetts said:
. . . I would like to bring a green perspective to a wide range of issues debated in this place and in the public arena . . . green politics does not encompass only environmental integrity; it also stands on the principles of social justice, peace and disarmament, and community participation in decision making.
Six years later, we have an accredited senator who has carried out, in the fullest sense, that plan of hers in her contribution to the Senate.
Dee followed Jo Vallentine and Christabel Chamarette from Western Australia into this place. All of them have made a very strong contribution to the life of the Senate and to the welfare of Australians—three wise women from the west bringing frank commonsense to the nation's wellbeing and an impact which is going to be felt long after Dee, as the last of them, leaves this place.
Looking at Dee's CV for the last six years, it is far too great for me to go through point 
 by point, but I want to pick out a few points. Dee, with her good humour, referred to the fruit loop appellation the other night. That was applied way back in the early days to Dee and to former Senator Christabel Chamarette. What they were doing—and Dee made a particular feature of this even after Senator Chamarette had left this place—was fighting the ramifications of the laissez-faire free-trade globalisation of everything that is to do with profits, with GATT then becoming the World Trade Organisation.
Most people do not know that, long before One Nation was a twinkling in the eye of whoever was going to give it the great impetus it has had in recent years, Dee, with her green philosophy, recognised that this was not only disempowering Australians politically—because successive Labor and Liberal governments were transferring the obligation of responsible government from the parliament to the Stock Exchange and through the Stock Exchange to multinational corporations, the de facto world government—but was hurting people because it also involved a redistribution of wealth upwards. The trickle-down effect was bunkum. The trickle-up effect—and it was almost a cascade upward—occurred not least because of the World Trade Organisation's coming into being and removing tariffs willy-nilly and Australian governments wanting to do this ahead of other governments, thereby opening people's jobs and their wellbeing to competition, which meant that many Australians have unnecessarily suffered unemployment, poverty and disempowerment.
The fruit loop appellation has gone because Dee Margetts, the warrior of that debate on the World Trade Organisation and legislation making Australia an early promoter of it, has been vindicated by time. She was the person who, point by point, argued out that legislation. As I remember it, Mr Acting Deputy President, it was totally unreported. But how right she was. If there is one thing that is a mark of a sterling parliamentarian it is that they will battle for issues before their time and set the foundations for the fight-back for the public good.
Dee proposed the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling, and she ended up with a dissenting report on that. Again, she is ahead of the field. She represented her community and her own background very strongly in that matter. She will be shown to have been justified through that dissenting report as the nuclear issue continues to grow in public debate as Australia opens up to the question of whether we will be the world dumping ground for nuclear waste in the years ahead with the loopholes in the environment legislation which passed this place last week with the support of the Democrats.
Dee took a formidable role in the elimination of landmines and getting Australia to sign an international protocol to get this scourge of humanity reduced and on the path to elimination from the world. She has been a fighter for the environment, not least the Western Australian environment. If I remember rightly, as far back as 1997 she passed a successful motion in this place to put a halt to the logging of the Giblet block, a fantastic part of the magnificent tall forests of Western Australia. That was before the real furore in Western Australia, which has seen political turmoil because nine out of 10 Western Australians supported the position that Dee brought to this Senate on behalf of her constituents two or three years ago, and certainly since she came into this place in 1993.
It is on native title, however, that I remember Dee most. I sat in this seat, Mr Acting Deputy President, and watched her in full flight. You will remember it as well. So will many people on the other side of this parliament. Let me summarise it by saying that Dee Margetts took on for the indigenous people of this country the most strident role in defending their interests in a fairly hostile climate of rollback. It will not be easy to measure this, but I do know that the legislation that passed this parliament was the better for the contribution of this individual—this fighter with a sense of justice for the original Australians like nobody else's.
When people in the coming century read about the passage of the Wik and native title legislation and wonder why it was so short of 
 the mark, it will at least warm their hearts to know that she stood here and said it as it should have been said. She set a benchmark for decency and hauled the parliament back at least a little through her knowledge, her intelligence and her feeling for the original Australians, something which I am very proud to have been associated with.
I want to thank Alan, Liz, Stuart, Amanda and Carol and previous staff members who have been part of Dee's team. I wish this remarkable Australian a terrific and long career. There has been talk about academia. I think that will be brief; she will be changing academia, not the other way round. I hope she comes back into politics. I know there is going to be further Western Australian representation. All I can say is that with the forests issue, the GST and the environment legislation, were the election held now, Dee Margetts would romp back into this place.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I wonder if I could abuse the point of order process just long enough to say that, as a fellow Western Australian and a member of the Labor Party, I acknowledge the services, the good work and the conscientiousness that Senator Margetts has given to this chamber. I do not want to argue the political issues, because we argue them all the time, but I think it is beyond argument that she is indeed a dedicated senator and has done a sterling job on behalf of her party.
—As you would be aware, there is no point of order!",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-06-30,"—I also rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000 , Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1999-2000  and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1999-2000 . These appropriation bills give members of parliament an opportunity to speak on a wide variety of subjects relating to the government's budget. I would like to address, ever so briefly, the issue of the government's tough on drugs policy. I understand that Australian families are under many pressures in this fast moving society, seemingly more so than generations before us. One of their major concerns is without doubt the drug 
 issue, that their children may be susceptible to being drawn into the web of drug taking, and into the murky world of drug pushers, leading to addiction and often worse. It can affect any family, large or small, rich or poor. Moreover, the temptation can draw any member of the family, male or female—it has no rules. The consequences for a family are devastating and cruel. No-one wants it, yet no-one seems to have the answers to stop it. The answer may be that we may never stop it completely. In fact, I think we have to concede that we can never stop it completely.
A measure of our success can be in how we stem the tide, how we reduce addiction, help addicts and make pushers pay at all levels. In raw statistics, in 1997, 631 Australians died from heroin overdoses and now, in 1999, those figures have greatly increased. Up to four in every five property crimes are now committed by someone with a drug dependency, without a doubt, heroin. There were 84,000 drug arrests across Australia in the year to July 1998, including over 10,000 arrests relating to heroin. We can single out heroin as being the major drug of addiction and the major concern that we have in society. I know there are many other varieties and cocktails of drugs, fashionable drugs, but heroin seems to be the absolute destroyer. Individuals and society pay a very high emotional price in respect of these raw statistics on drugs.
There are three ways we can tackle the drug problem: education, treatment and law enforcement. The government, indeed all sides of parliament, places a very high priority upon the treatment of those directly affected by the drug problem and we are now well on the way to establishing a national drug treatment network across our cities and rural centres. The aim of this network is to bring treatment, education and support services within the reach of those who most need it. It is in this area that private and charitable organisations play a very important role in caring for those afflicted with a drug addiction. We have also provided communities with funding under the Community Partnerships Initiative to increase community awareness of the drug problem. The two arms are 
 the rehabilitation centres, which are critical and are carried out predominantly by private charities and organisations, and the education projects, which include training schemes and peer education, which is definitely important. Through my experience, it is the peer pressure groups that lead many people into taking drugs. Who is part of the peer group is of great importance and great influence. Who the role models are is of great importance and has a great influence upon drug takers in the early years. Education projects also include information kits and the establishment of local resource centres. Funding has also been provided to church groups, parent associations, schools, the police, community centres and local businesses who have formed partnerships to provide local prevention services. You cannot get a more grassroots, and so it should be, attempt at prevention. It cannot exist without a grassroots education and treatment program for all of those areas I have mentioned—the parents, the police, the church groups, the business groups and the community centres. It has to be developed at that level. It is an integrated three-pronged approach which educates our children about the unacceptability and extreme danger of any level of illicit drug use, provides treatment to those who become dependent on illicit drugs and rehabilitation towards a drug free lifestyle and strengthens our law enforcement agencies to effectively fight the drug war.
The area of law enforcement is where I have the most interest, being a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. To me, it is an area that needs double the effort because we want to make the drug pushers, at all levels, pay for their crime. For all the resources we put in, I think the return is highly successful. Only last week there was a huge drug bust in Victoria. If you were able to list—which I am unable to do today—the drug busts that have been carried out by the state police and the National Crime Authority, you would see that they are hugely successful for the dollars put in, if you want to put it that way, and for greatly influencing the supply of heroin in this country. I would like to see an extra focus on that area from the government and the parliament because I 
 happen to think you are paid back for the efforts you put into it.
To that end, the raw statistics in the budget indicate that the government has dedicated an additional $170 million to the crime-fighting area. As I said before and I stress again, this is an area that needs particular interest. I know that if you could get education right, you would not need to go any further than that, but that does not always work. I know rehabilitation is very important to prevent people going back and taking up that addiction again, but the law enforcement area with the NCA on the job not only has been successful but can be more successful if given the extra resources. However, we have already given $50 million over three years to establish a national crime information system. We have given $35 million over four years to the Australian Customs Service for increased search capacity and the purchase of X-ray technology to enhance the capacity for drug detection at the nation's borders. That basically says it all. That is where you are going to prevent the infiltration of heroin and cocaine into this country—at the national borders, not just at the airports. We know that they are brought in by ships not just through the ports but onto lonely and isolated beaches.
Under the government's Tough on Drugs strategy, $24.2 million over four years is being given to the Australian Federal Police for four mobile strike teams. This is another very important and expensive area. Law enforcement against the drug trade is a very expensive area and it is a very big ask to constantly pour money into it when so many other people look at the other areas of education and treatment. Surveillance is a highly successful area. It is also very expensive, as you can imagine, with surveillance over 24 hours which could go on for over six or 12 months—sometimes two years. It is not just following; it is also tapping, using endless tapes. It is very expensive but very effective. Most drug busts come about by surveillance. It is long, it is excruciating—a lot of tape is run off before you get the evidence or the information you need—but it is a most important area. We have tipped more money 
 into that area, at the request of the National Crime Authority.
The sum of $21.4 million over four years will be provided for the government's Building Safer Communities program to develop new approaches to crime prevention. Fifteen million dollars over three years has also been allocated for additional family counselling and mediation dispute resolution services. Finally, I point out that $3.6 million has been allocated to extend access to justice for disadvantaged people in the rural and regional areas.
I have raised this issue to highlight the fact that the government has increased its budget allocation for this important area of social concern. If you were to list the social concerns of our society and of a family, they would put unemployment and the drug problem as No. 1 and No. 2 or No. 2 and No. 1. Whatever order, they seem to be the two most serious concerns that cut deep into family harmony. We have increased the budget allocation to it and we do have a strategy. I would like to particularly focus on the law enforcement area and would be pushing hard for yet more funds, particularly for surveillance, in the next budget.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-30,"—Before I comment on the appropriation bills, I would like to place on record my thanks to my colleague Senator Brown for his very kind words today. It is a bit like being at your funeral in some ways. I am very grateful for those kind words of acknowledgment and also for the additional statement by Senator Cook and others who have spoken so kindly about my work in the Senate.
In the time available it is not going to be possible to give the appropriations bills the degree of attention they deserve. What I intend to do is make some comments on matters arising out of the estimates hearings. The first point to be made is that the estimates process had its share of frustrations. It often does and the last estimates hearings were no exception. There are some officers who appear at estimates who recognise that senators are entitled to full disclosure and who provide assistance to senators in the way they provide information. But there are others 
 who take a defensive, even—dare I say—retentive attitude, and it leads one to wonder what they are trying to hide.
That attitude was epitomised in the responses of Dr Helen Garnett in responding to questions on Lucas Heights. In some ways, I guess she was a bit better than on some previous occasions. It is a sensitive topic that the local community and many of us outside the area have genuine concerns about. Every aspect of the process of moving towards the proposed new reactor for Lucas Heights has raised new questions. My problem was epitomised by the response to the question of Y2K compliance for the ANSTO supercomputer. The response—that ANSTO does not have a supercomputer—might have been true. I do not know. But it was a smart alec answer designed to derail a line of questions and it had that effect.
Had I been misinformed in my briefing notes? We obviously had to find out. It was not till later that I checked up and, yes, ANSTO did acquire a supercomputer in the early 1990s. In fact, there was an Australian Audit Office report which was highly critical of ANSTO's process for acquiring the computer. So what happened to it? I do not know. I do know that a lot of money was spent on it only a few years ago. I would have been interested in hearing if it had paid its way, and whether it was Y2K compliant. But that is the kind of information which should be offered when a senator asks a question like the one I did. I might have to leave the supercomputer to others in this place to follow up.
I did want to place on record my concern about the openness of officers at estimates. Sometimes something like 20 questions have to be asked. It has sometimes been like that with Defence, too—very specific technicalities are used to avoid answering a question. If we do ever corner Professor Garnett, she may end up saying, `Oh, that supercomputer', and then give some responses. But it is hardly the kind of thing that could go missing. If it is no longer used, I guess it would have been useful to say, `Oh, look, we did have that in the early 1990s but we no longer use it.' But no such response was proffered.
The other concern I want to mention is in relation to questions I put on notice at estimates. As a senator whose term ends today, I would have thought it was fairly obvious that answers would be required in time for use in the appropriations debate taking place today—by the time we are debating this bill. When the current opposition was in government, there were a number of very robust debates about the timing for providing answers. As I recall, the turnaround time for answering questions taken on notice at Senate estimates was around eight or nine days, with the acknowledgment that after Senate estimates you would need the answers before you debated appropriations because estimates are supposed to replace an appropriations committee stage. In most cases they do. However, I believe the current opposition has dropped the ball.
I guess the opposition are assuming that they will one day be in government themselves and that they may not want to have an opposition which demands answers before we debate the bills. I think that is perfectly reasonable. If there are some questions where it is totally not possible, then there are usually indications given that such answers are not possible. It is unfortunate that the government have been allowed to get away with this. I would like to see it tightened up, but I cannot see that happening in the near future.
Those answers still to come are obviously still going to be available. I am certain my colleague Senator Bob Brown would like to see the answers. He is going to have an enormous load on his shoulders now that he is the only senator representing a Greens party in Australia, especially now that the Democrats have had such doubt cast on their credentials on environment and social justice issues. It may well be that those groups who would normally go to the Democrats—who do not always attend estimates; not everyone does—may be looking for other people to ask those questions for them.
One of the issues Senator Bob Brown may need to keep a close eye on is the attempted clean-up operation at Maralinga. We have made various efforts to keep this issue before the Senate. It has significant ramifications for 
 the local Maralinga Tjarutja who wish to be able to return to the area. It is an issue that Senators Campbell and O'Chee were prepared to pursue when they were in opposition, but they seem to have gone quiet on this issue in more recent times. I have pursued the issue with some vigour over the past few months with questions on notice and without notice, and I have sought to follow those up at estimates. The questions follow the suspension of in situ vitrification of the radioactive debris in the wake of an explosion in one of the pits at Maralinga.
I have concerns about any process that puts a massive electric current through undifferentiated debris, effectively melting it and letting it solidify into a comparatively stable block. The explosion brought those concerns to a head. However, the subsequent developments, including information provided at estimates, leads me to question further. At estimates I was told that the in situ vitrification was  unlikely to continue and any further clean-up would be by a hybrid process of separating the debris, burying some of it and vitrifying the rest.
If this is the way it goes, I would have two concerns. One is that the process involves excavating the pits which contain, as has been admitted, radioactive plutonium and goodness knows what else. That is not to be undertaken lightly. I would want the ARPANSA licensing process to be an open, public and accountable one as a minimum requirement before this goes ahead. The other concern is that the burial of some of the radioactive debris under five metres of soil is totally inadequate. How does that compare with the requirements at the proposed nuclear waste repository? To go back to the five metres of soil, the answer given at estimates was that this is cheaper. One has to wonder: `Okay, there are problems with the in situ vitrification. There is a cheaper option. Whoopee! Let's go for that.' That is not what they said—it is my interpretation—but it is very worrying.
Let us look at the comparison with the requirements for the proposed nuclear waste repository. Why is it not planned to move the debris to a properly constructed long-term repository if it is not to be vitrified? Is burial 
 under five metres of dirt enough to satisfy the traditional owners, who are supposed to be consulted on these matters? And just how well are they being consulted? Perhaps the minister could tell us what changes there would be to the costings for the clean-up if this is the way it goes.
To return to estimates: how much trust can we put in the advice provided at estimates? I wish I could say total trust. I asked Mr Harris of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources about the causes of the explosion. I said:
We have been contacted by a nuclear veteran who claims he told the royal commission about all sorts of explosives, ammunition, fuel tanks and other dangerous stuff that was in those pits. Why therefore do we hear of surprise when one of these pits explodes during the in-situ vitrification process?
The answer from Mr Harris was this:
On the question of explosives, the advice from the British government was there would be a negligible chance of explosives being in that area. They were not used in those particular trials; they were used in other areas on the Maralinga test site as target response items, and we have a report from the British government about those.
That was on 7 June. Yet over a month earlier Mr Harris had received a letter from the office of the Assistant Chief Scientific Adviser (Nuclear) at the Ministry of Defence in London. After preliminary remarks expressing regret `that you have had this unpleasant event', A.R. Wilson goes on to say:
It is clear that the team at Maralinga were very lucky not to have had any injuries.
That is very different from the assurances we have been given all along that nobody was at risk. But on the specific issue of there being `a negligible chance of explosives' the British have a different view from that ascribed to them by Mr Harris. The letter says:
It is the current view that given the nature of these experiments incomplete detonation of the charges is a distinct possibility . . . There can be no guarantees that there are not small amounts of explosive residues in the pits. The probability would be greatest for the pits located at a pad site.
The letter goes on to refer to the particular explosives used in the area of the Vixen B trials, which is the area of the current clean-up. It contains other information which casts 
 doubt on the publicly stated position of the government—information which could have significant implications for the budget allocation for the clean-up. It does not need an explosive. Sometimes all it needs is a gas tank. Those blow up too when you put massive currents through the soil for days on end. In particular it says that the exhumation of pits containing explosives would need to be undertaken by `EOD specialists from the Army RLC'. If we are going to the hybrid process of exhume and separate, is the Australian Army going to do it? Where is the appropriation for that?
As I have said, the response on the public record is that the hybrid option is now favoured. From other sources, however, I have been getting the indication that vitrification may be abandoned altogether in favour of a plan to simply bury the debris. This is an even more frightening prospect and flies in the face of the recommendations of the report by the Technical Assessment Group on the Rehabilitation of former nuclear test sites in Australia. For how long would five metres of soil protect the people and the environment of Maralinga? I would certainly like the minister to explain the discrepancies in the information provided to us on the record and in the information provided from other sources.
I would like the minister to table the letter to Mr Harris from the British Ministry for Defence. Most importantly, it is not just about the issues—although they are extremely important. It is about whether or not, by a process of inaccurate information or of leaving out the information that can lead to the correct answers, we are in fact deceived at estimates. I leave the chamber without being able to deal with this further, but it is very important. Sometimes I notice that, if I am the only person asking a question in a particular field, maybe the officers at the table think they are safe to make broad statements because I may not get any backup from other people on that committee. That should not be the case and perhaps I am casting aspersions. But we should not be deceived at estimates and we should receive the full and frank advice of the officers at the table. When we find out later on that other information is 
 quite different from that which we received, there should be a consequence. Otherwise, the accountability in this process is at risk.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I would like to join with other colleagues here in wishing Senator Margetts all the best. I think, as Senator Brown said, you are one of the best legislators in the Senate and you will be sorely and genuinely missed, certainly from my perspective and from a number of other people's perspectives, as a very caring person with a very strong sense of justice. I have a lot of admiration for you and I wish you well in the future. Hopefully, you might at some stage come back. Good luck and thank you very much.
The budget delivered very little real benefit to regional Australia. It effectively delivered cuts to local government and nothing to Australia's territories. For regional services, territories and local government, the budget contained more bluster than real money and real strategy. The coalition yet again empirically proved in this budget that there is no strategic approach to regional Australia. This is something which has not gone beyond the notice of people in regional Australia, who are talking about the lack of vision. The budget contained little more than a mishmash of promises reliant on the further 16 per cent sell down of Telstra and a number of small short-term programs.
The great bulk of the coalition's so-called Regional Australia Strategy relied heavily on the further sale of Telstra. It consisted of Telstra bribes to try to make the further sale palatable to regional Australia, which is set up to be the bigger loser in the long term as a result of the sale. We all know, of course, what the government's real agenda is; it is not a secret. The Prime Minister has said that the government will proceed to the next stage and sell all of Telstra. I do not think members of the National Party, particularly in Queensland, are going to be particularly happy with this, given the National Party's policy in relation to the full sale of Telstra. I know some consternation on that matter within the National Party in Queensland is on the public record. 
Let me come back to the programs. What happens when the money runs out in terms of the one-off capital injection? What will be left for regional Australia? In public policy terms, I think we have not only a bad public policy but also a very clumsy one. Most of the programs in terms of the 16 per cent sale of Telstra are predicated on dividing the figure by six, which is the number of states, and giving the remainder to the territories. I do not think that is equitable and it certainly does not take into account states like Queensland and Western Australia and a territory like the Northern Territory which, by the tyranny of distance, have major difficulties with telecommunications. I think a lot more thought could have gone into apportioning the actual funds that the government announced, separate from the specific arrangement for Tasmania.
The Rural Transaction Centres Program, a flagship program for the government, is—with the exception of a very small kick-start, which will come out of the recurrent expenditure from the relevant department—almost entirely reliant on the 16 per cent sell down. This program has funding for only five years and after that there will be no money available. While, superficially and conceptually, it sounds reasonably innocuous and quite a reasonable proposition, the devil as always is in the detail. In estimates, the minister confirmed that this program is essentially predicated on the 16 per cent sale of Telstra. If the sale had not gone ahead, there would be no Rural Transaction Centres Program. That is not a vision for rural and regional Australians—that is quite simply a sop to rural and regional Australians.
In estimates, the minister also made it clear that the program may extend to the provision of a number of government services, including Centrelink, the Job Network, tax, veterans' affairs, immigration and Australia Post. This is all very interesting to us and obviously we will be pursuing this assiduously in future estimates. Any such extension of the scope of RTCs, along the lines that the minister advised in estimates, potentially enables the government to abrogate its responsibility for the provision of basic services 
 to small communities. We suspect, and we hope that we are wrong, that it could see further closures and privatisation potentially of Australia Post—which is linked into the deregulation agenda that the government has already flagged—Centrelink and so on. This also raises a whole lot of issues in relation to privacy and we will be traversing those again.
Whilst the coalition has left the door open for the provision of government services by RTCs, it has made it explicitly clear that there will be no funding after five years. Many communities may only get one-off funding. It may be in the nature of kick-start capital injection with some potential for recurrent funding but, at the end of the five years, if the RTC itself is not self-sustaining, it will receive no further government assistance. This is clearly a difficulty which I think the government is going to have to face in terms of ensuring that these services, once they are off the ground and happening in regional and rural Australia, do not fall over because of lack of infrastructure or lack of assistance. The guidelines are very loose—this is no surprise in terms of this portfolio—and are open to interpretation by the advisory panel, which includes two former coalition members of parliament and the minister. The government can be assured that we will be following this assiduously in estimates.
A large number of rural and regional programs do not have any more money after the next two years. What happens, we ask, to rural communities after the next two years? Where is that vision? Where is the ongoing funding? Everybody in this chamber knows—whether they are prepared to say it here or not—that what people in rural and regional Australia require is an ongoing commitment in relation to funding and a cohesive, integrated government agenda. The rural women's domestic violence strategy continues to do very little. Now in its third year, almost no money has been spent and all that is expected for the next year is a workshop to talk about domestic violence in rural Australia. I urge the government to get a move on with this program because it is very critical.
There are commitments that the government has not delivered on. The coalition promised 
 $91.5 million for a regional skills program but came up with only $51 million; the coalition promised to spend $30 million expanding Medicare Easyclaim but came up with only $19 million—a $50 million shortfall. Where has that money gone, and where is the commitment? The massive cuts to regional Australia have already been traversed in previous appropriations debates. They include the regional development program of $150 million, which was axed; the cuts to ABC services to regional Australia; the axing of the Working Nation program, which was generally very well supported by regional Australia; the cuts to government services to regional Australia; and so on.
There is no joy for local government in this budget either. The coalition sought to rid itself of responsibility for local government in the tax package despite the strenuous objections of local government. The Democrat-coalition deal forced a begrudging coalition and a very begrudging minister to maintain Commonwealth responsibility for local government funding. The minister made his feelings about the continued existence of his own portfolio and responsibility for local government very clear when he claimed, in estimates, that local government was furious with the Democrat-government deal and, bizarrely, he said that he would not like to be a Labor member in Queensland. This was in relation to the local government deal. Madam Acting Deputy President, it was very odd because, as you well know, it was not our deal: it was a deal between the coalition and the Democrats. I am not sure where the minister was coming from there, but that is not unusual.
I think what the minister was saying was that, through the strenuous efforts of the Labor Party in attempting to ensure that the Commonwealth retained responsibility for local government, we were successful. We are prepared, very graciously, to accept the credit for that and thank the minister for his backhanded compliment. Even though local government funding will now remain with the Commonwealth, councils are still likely to be hit hard with the costs of administering and complying with the GST. The communities 
 they serve are likely to face a GST on top of the nominal fees that councils charge for the provision of basic community services and facilities—not commercial services; community services.
The GST bills have been rammed through the Senate. We still have no idea what the impact of the GST will be on the local government sector. The minister made it clear in question time only the other day that he still did not know, or was not prepared to let on, when he told the Senate—and I quote from Hansard:
I have said to local government that, as the legislation is passed and as we know exactly what the situation is and what the system will be for local government, then I would sit down with them . . . 
It is a bit difficult once the old horse has bolted. We are talking about the application of the GST in local government. We are talking about a sphere of government that is elected, that has to budget, that is very concerned about the impact of the GST in terms of its rates base, that is concerned about the potential truncation of services and so on. It is extraordinary that, on the day the Senate passed the ANTS bill, the minister was still unable to enlighten us in any way whatsoever as to how his own portfolio would be affected by the GST.
We still do not have a clue whether local government will be forced to charge a GST on a raft of community services and facilities, including the local seniors centres, school holiday activities, community bus services, exercise classes for the aged and even photocopying for school projects at the local library. There are not enough people in the parliament generally—I obviously exclude you from this, Madam Acting Deputy President—who understand the plethora of services that local government provides. I think it depends which state you come from. If you come from Queensland, Victoria or New South Wales you are only too aware of the services, but there are differences in the way that local government operates. In some states it provides a huge range of services. In Queensland, for example, one of the local councils runs an aged care facility, which is something that simply would not happen in 
 my state of Tasmania at this point—it may well happen in the future.
What we do know is that local government faces large set-up and compliance costs as it effectively becomes a tax collector for the federal government. The Local Government Association of Queensland has commissioned KPMG to estimate the start-up and ongoing compliance costs for councils in Queensland. The report shows initial GST compliance costs of up to $200,000 and ongoing compliance costs of up to $15,000 per council, plus a cash flow effect of up to $400,000 for councils in Queensland—something I noticed, interestingly, the minister did not demur from when I asked a question the other day in that respect.
Despite the large GST compliance costs likely to be borne by local government, there is not much in this budget for local government. There is the pitiful amount of money in the Local Government Incentive Program, with the Local Government Development Program being abolished. The LGIP is simply there to help councils with the administration costs of the GST. The guidelines are quite explicit. That is fine, but what sort of quantum are we looking at here? There will be $7 million over two years for 710 councils to see them through the implementation of a GST. After that they get nothing.
That works out to $10,000 a council over 10 years. That is not going to help them very much in relation to the implementation of the GST. It is not really money for local government to improve service delivery for local communities or to build the capacity of local councils; it is just a bit of short-term money to try to assuage some of the concerns that have been raised by local government in relation to the cost of GST implementation. It is a very pale imitation indeed of Labor's original $48 million Local Government Development Program.
In estimates the minister made it clear that the LGIP was pretty much policy on the run and that there were no formal guidelines or processes in place to allocate the funding, even though the GST is, to say the least, imminent in terms of prospective planning. The LGIP provides us with a true glimpse of 
 the lack of vision—in fact no vision whatsoever—that this government has for local government and its lack of understanding about the role that local government plays in communities as a genuine partner with the federal government and state governments.
Whilst the lack of vision for regional Australia and for local government permeates the government benches, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government actually epitomises, from our perspective, the lack of vision. From our perspective he is visionless and uninspiring. The opposition in fact is questioning his competence. Senator O'Brien gave a very forensic and excellent speech previously which dissected the minister's performance at estimates. In fact, on this side of the chamber he is fast becoming known as a bit of a Basil Fawlty in terms of the way he operates, his continual challenges to the President in terms of his lack of understanding of standing orders—
—Abusing journalists.
—That is correct, Senator Sherry. When the Sydney Morning Herald  on 10 February this year commented on the lack of original thought amongst government frontbenchers, Minister Macdonald was one of the three government ministers identified as a `dullard'. After only four months in the job, this minister has managed to distinguish himself by his—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I would ask that the word `dullard' be withdrawn. I do believe that is unparliamentary.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, I am not sure that the minister understands. I am actually quoting from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald .
—I am advised, Senator Mackay, that even if you are quoting—as I think you are—it does not change the nature of it being unparliamentary. That is my advice.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, just to clarify: even if I am 
 quoting from an article that casts aspersions on a minister it is still unparliamentary?
—That is my advice, Senator. If you like, I will refer the matter to Madam President, because I do understand that you are quoting.
—On the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: if you are to refer it to Madam President, could I point out that it may lead to a ridiculous situation where the rest of the public—the community—has information put before it but that information cannot be tendered into this parliament. That inconsistency is something that we should be addressing.
—On the point of order, I agree that there are sometimes issues in the standing orders and in the practice of this place that need to be rethought. That is why I am referring it to Madam President. Please continue, Senator Mackay.
—In relation to estimates, we have had a very hard row indeed to hoe with Senator Ian Macdonald. He has distinguished himself as being very obstructive in the way he has behaved, and at times he has bordered on being petulant. Time and time again in estimates committees we have seen him as a minister who basically has not moved out of opposition, and that is the problem. He seeks to big-note himself by being uncooperative, repeatedly refusing to answer reasonable questions and repeatedly preventing departmental officials from answering questions themselves—much to their embarrassment.
I would like to draw particular attention to the minister's behaviour in the last round of estimates. This is the subject of a minority report from the estimates committee, which has been tabled today. Minister Macdonald's behaviour in estimates was so extraordinarily poor that the chair, Senator Crane, who under very difficult circumstances acquitted himself well, was forced to produce an addendum to the estimates committee report, and the opposition had to go to the trouble of writing a minority report to the addendum. Obviously Senator Crane had two ways to go: he could either let the cat out of the bag and say that 
 the minister's behaviour was unacceptable in estimates, or he could go on the offensive and say that perhaps there is a problem with the estimates process. Our view is that there is no problem with the estimates process. Why put the Senate to all that trouble when we are dealing with one recalcitrant minister?
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee estimates dragged out for 52 hours as the committee sought answers to very straightforward questions. This is a minister who, through sheer intransigence, forced the committee to go into suspension three times to consider his behaviour, putting his own colleagues and Senator Crane in an extremely difficult position. Senator Crane said at the end of one tortuously long day that it was the worst day of estimates that he had ever experienced. I do not think he was talking about us; I think he was vocalising the frustrations he was feeling from attempting to chair the estimates committee.
We got very little information from Senator Ian Macdonald. On the very day that the Prime Minister exhorted the coalition to go out and sell the tax package, he simply refused to answer any questions at all on the GST on the spurious basis that he would only answer questions on the 1999-2000 budget, not on the out years. Bizarre! But on the Rural Transaction Centres Program he was able to wax lyrical—a program which was predicated on the 16 per cent sale of Telstra, the legislation for which had not even gone through the Senate at that stage. So there are some clear inconsistencies there. We find that extraordinary. Even yesterday when he attempted to apologise to the people who produce Inside Canberra he managed to give them another swipe. For goodness sake, if you are going to apologise there is some capacity to be gracious. In his apology he said:
The way some of the comments are written, I can understand why people would suggest that the line followed in the newsletter is similar to the Labor Party line . . .
Inside Canberra  have had a go at me over the years, and that is fair enough.
In conclusion, I would just like to say to this minister that it is not personal, it is business. What we are trying to do is get 
 information legitimately. It is not about him, it is about the portfolio. We would urge this minister to grow up. We would urge him to get out of his opposition mode, try and be a bit more professional in the estimates process and not put his own colleagues through the kind of torture that they had to go through during the estimates process. Basically it is not about you, Minister, if you happen to be listening; it is about being professional and it is about being up-front. And it is business, it is not about you. In terms of the future running of the estimates, we would urge Senator Ian Macdonald to take a more mature attitude, and I think then we would have a much more pacific row to hoe in relation to the process.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1999-06-30,"—Twenty years ago next month, a group of Australian farmers made an historic decision to maximise their political impact by creating a single unified body to more effectively represent them in their dealings with Federal, state and local governments. They formed the National Farmers Federation as a new peak body to replace more than 20 individual farm groups which had previously been acting as state and national commodity representatives. On 20 July 1979 this far-sighted group of farmers met at the old Industry House in Barton, just a kilometre or so from here, to formally establish Australia's new peak farm body. That meeting quite sensibly ended years of very counterproductive activity, rivalry and conflict which had allowed political parties of all colours to negotiate with whichever group suited them best at the time. That divide and rule policy certainly did not help advance the arguments of our primary producers.
The structure of the National Farmers Federation has changed very little since those early days. It was a small group of highly professional men and women with a clear focus and more than a modicum of courage who could fearlessly present what were sometimes quite unpopular policy positions. I am very proud to say that for five years during the 1980s I was a member of that organisation, at a time when primary producers achieved significant milestones, using 
 powerful and unbeatable combinations of courage, clear argument and strategic planning. My personal highlight during those special years was when more than 40,000 farmers and their families came from all over Australia to Canberra on 1 July 1985 to argue their case for tax reform and for the removal of the industrial obstacles that then shackled their highly productive properties. Interestingly enough, it is 14 years ago tomorrow since that incredible day outside Old Parliament House.
How interesting it is to recall that it was a national taxation summit on tax reform, being chaired by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that attracted the nation's primary producers to our national capital. It is also fascinating to recall that the policy proposition unsuccessfully being put to the tax summit on that crisp winter's day by then Treasurer Keating was for a goods and services tax. I think he called it option C. But, as he said, the wheels fell off the cart—assisted, as I recall, by very strong opposition from ACOSS. So it continues. Perhaps, though, if the opposition had gone to their dusty party archives, they may have found that the arguments that Paul Keating used that day are still as relevant as ever, and in fact they have been heard in this chamber over the last few days, before this government successfully passed its historic tax reform legislation.
The National Farmers Federation of those days concentrated on the policy issues that were of concern to farmers. The committee structure at that time reflected those very clear priorities: economic, industrial, machinery, shipping and energy. How little has changed in those policy priorities over those twenty years; and how much has been delivered, particularly since this government came to power in 1996. How excited the members of that economic committee would be to see that this government, led by Prime Minister John Howard, has delivered to all families, particularly farm families and small business families, the lowest interest rates in 30 years. What a benefit to all Australian families trying to reduce their debts and what a benefit to our farm families trying to reduce that crippling farm debt brought about by the 
 obscene high interest rates from 13 years under the Labor government.
The original members of the NFF's industrial relations committee would also find their landscape fundamentally changed from those days of 1979. Our government has dramatically changed the way farm businesses are able to operate and in particular the way in which employers and employees are able to sit down and negotiate together, free from coercion and free from compulsion. Of course, two of the great industrial relations milestones delivered by the farmers were during my time with the National Farmers Federation. The wide combs dispute gave shearers the right to choose their own shearing comb and improve their own productivity in the shearing sheds, and the Mudginberri meat dispute challenged the archaic union tally system. Both of these industrial relations milestones were absolutely fundamental along that path to industrial freedom.
The farm machinery committee, which I understand no longer exists, would also find great delight in the taxation changes we put through this chamber in just the last week. Our tax reform package has delivered dramatic improvements in the way farmers are able to import farm machinery. Of course, productivity gains through the use of new machinery not even dreamed of twenty years ago have enhanced the ability of farmers to become more efficient.
Perhaps the greatest achievement in the 20-year history of this great organisation has come more recently. After the Mudginberri meat dispute, which extracted $1.7 million in damages from the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union for its part in the fight which disrupted a small Northern Territory abattoir for months, there was little debate within the NFF about what should be the next target to feel the warm wind of reform by farmers. Quite simply, there was no argument: it had to be the docks. Without doubt, the waterfront—with its chronic inefficiencies, years of sabotage of our farm products, and the continuing disruption to trade by quite disgraceful trade union standover men—was determined as the next target for reform, as it 
 had been when that very first conference was held just a kilometre away from here.
However, this proved to be a more difficult mountain to climb, and it has taken another 11 years and some people with vision, courage and the personal tenacity to hold the line when the going got tough. The results have been absolutely spectacular. There have been dramatic increases in productivity, increased reliability, up to 400 per cent lifts in productivity per man in some ports and—fancy this!—a new pride in work performance. There have been major changes in pay rates, with bonuses for performance replacing overtime, so that individuals are taking home more money. They now feel, not surprisingly, a great sense of achievement because their work has improved, their involvement in their work has improved and they are free from the coercion that characterised the old waterfront. The days when the waterfront was run by a small group of standover men have gone.
The other day it was said that if there were stevedoring olympics, the Australian waterfront would be in the finals. I say: if our waterfront were in the finals, farmers would undoubtedly award the gold medal to Chris Corrigan, who courageously delivered to this nation a waterfront that importers and exporters, including primary produces, can be proud of. My information is that many of the thousands of people working on the waterfront are now going home a good deal richer and a good deal more satisfied with their day's work than they were before.
The last of these policy committees of the NFF of 20 years ago concerned energy and fuel—a fundamental cost on all farms. How proud the members of that committee of 1979 would have been if they were sitting in the gallery of this chamber just yesterday as our government delivered savings in diesel costs worth millions of dollars to our primary producers, and a massive annual saving of $2.8 billion a year in all fuel costs—on road, off road and rail. How proud the founding fathers of the National Farmers Federation would be of their organisation today.
In particular, I would like to mention the founding president, Sir Donald Eckersley, now a grand old man in his 80s who lives 
 with Lady Eckersley in Western Australia. He was the federation's first president and he made a distinguished contribution in those days. I had the pleasure of meeting him again when I was in Longreach for the recent anniversary conference. Of course, the National Farmers Federation has changed over those 20 years. All the lobby groups that operate in the national capital have changed. The federation now has its own building. In the days when I worked with the National Farmers Federation, it was in a suite of offices above the Press Club. Subsequently, the organisation built its own building.
I remember very well when the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, officially opened that building. The opportunity was taken by the then president, Mr McLachlan, to present Mr Hawke with an Akubra. There was some debate about whether he should have an Akubra which was called `Boss of the Plains', but I think it was decided in the end that he should have one called `The Rover'. Interestingly enough, the one we bought fitted him perfectly. It was a great and very exciting day for all of us, and I remember it with a great deal of pleasure.
As the National Farmers Federation has changed over those years and its staff has grown, so has the range of issues covered and so has the complexity of the global trading market, which has sharpened our international focus. However, primary production remains one of our most significant export sectors. The gross value of farm production last year reached almost $28 billion. It is perhaps an appropriate coincidence that this morning a former distinguished NFF president, Mr Ian McLachlan, released a document which examines the future direction of the wool industry—a once great primary industry which is now, sadly, in serious economic difficulties.
As Mr McLachlan said at his press conference in this building just an hour ago, the wool industry has no magic puddings and there are no messiahs. The path back for the wool industry will be a difficult one. It may be that the wool industry will never again be one of our major export industries. That is something that those of us who have been involved with primary industry for much of 
 our lives find very difficult to believe. It is a tragedy, and I think it can be traced back to the propping up and collapse of the spectacularly unsuccessful Reserve Price Scheme. The future for the wool industry lies with market niches, improved research and development and, of course, improved technology—which, in turn, will produce a product for the very demanding export markets that are now looking to fine micron wool rather than, as we call it in South Australia, the bread-and-butter wools that South Australia historically has produced.
I for one wish the wool industry well. I have no doubt that the report which I have just received and have not yet had time to read will prove to be a very important contribution to the wool industry debate in this country. It is, interestingly enough, the 55th report on the wool industry that has been produced in recent years, and I hope that we will not need any more. It is also interesting to know that, since 1937, wool growers in this country have contributed over $12 billion in levies and taxes to their industry and to the government, and it is a great tragedy—and one that I am sure is shared by many people in this chamber—that the wool industry now finds itself in such great economic difficulties.
Twenty years ago a group of farmers realised that unity is strength. They combined to form one of this nation's most powerful and successful lobby groups—a group in which I was very proud to serve and which has now come of age. Long may it continue to serve the farmers of Australia.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-06-30,"—Seeing that the government deputy whip is over there, I might start today on his superannuation. I read in this morning's paper an article by a journalist that said that Senator O'Chee was entitled to take a $700,000 lump sum. I am not sure any MP, no matter how long they have been here and how high their office is, could ever get that amount of income. What the journalist has done is amortised out Senator O'Chee's claim presuming that he lives forever, got it at $1.4 million and then halved it because you can take half as a lump sum. What absolute 
 nonsense! I hope I do not embarrass you here, Senator O'Chee, but this is absolute nonsense.
Senator O'Chee did not leave here voluntarily. He was a victim—which any one of us could be—of electoral misfortune. So his claiming of any superannuation is done at behest of the Queensland voters in a proportional representational system in which the fluke of preferences and quotas—the way they are struck—means that he missed out. He could have stood in an election before this and got half the votes he got now and actually got up. It was simply because One Nation got exactly the quota that Senator O'Chee missed out. Otherwise, had they been substantially below quota—even by 0.1 per cent of a quota—I think Senator O'Chee would have remained here, because the rest of the preferences flowed through.
But how can a newspaper let that sort of article run with that sort of inanity and stupidity and miscalculation in it? They can do it because it is a good way of denigrating politicians. The fact is that, at the very best, Senator O'Chee could take a nominal $225,000 lump sum, before tax, and all of it in Senator O'Chee's case would have been subject to the 1983 rules changes and beyond. That sort of article picking on one individual is bad enough—which has happened in the last few months—but because they finally get it so wrong the editor of that newspaper should do something about it. They are very quick to criticise us. And I am very quick to say that, in that sense, I hope that Senator O'Chee will not be regarded according to the terms of that article.
However, I want to comment today on the behaviour of some ministers in this government, and the debate on the appropriation bills is about the only opportunity you have other than on the adjournment. I first of all want to follow up the remarks of a couple of colleagues on Senator Ian Macdonald's behaviour at estimates committees. I have watched estimates committees from both sides of the table for 18 years, and I have said—even though I am not a Senate chauvinist; probably the reverse of it—that the Senate estimates committee is what distinguishes this chamber from almost any other chamber in 
 the world. People in state politics look to it and people overseas look to it.
The estimates process—for all its faults and despite some of the inanities of the questions and some of the turgidness of the cross-examination—is the one set of committees that keeps government more honest than any other, along of course with the Ombudsman and the Auditor-General. This is the one area where governments cannot hide. This is the one area where they face consistent cross-examination. Question time does not do that—a minister can get up and answer any way he likes. No matter how many supplementary or follow-through questions, a skilled minister can avoid answering the question. It is much harder at an estimates committee.
In the main, you would have to say that this government has approached estimates committees like the previous one—with a certain resignation to their fate and to having to spend days there answering questions. But I read the last set of estimates—having been to the previous one in Senator Ian Macdonald's committee—and, frankly, I am disgusted. The constant refusal to answer questions or give a good reason for not answering the questions is apparent right through the transcripts. One wonders what the motive for that is. Is it that he cannot hack it? Is it that he does not want to risk his arm and actually get caught out through lack of knowledge or inconsistency?
This does not happen with the rest of the ministers. Senator Herron has never been highly rated on this side of the chamber as being massively on top of his portfolio, but there he is at estimates flashing outside the off stump, occasionally getting a snick and occasionally surviving. And we have Senator Hill at estimates, who occasionally tells witnesses to answer questions when they have not fully done so. Then we have Senator Newman at estimates. She rarely answers a question but rarely inhibits the departmental secretary in answering questions of administration or policy on her behalf. Yet we get to this one committee and time and time again in the transcript you see, `I refuse to answer questions.' Let me give you an example: `I'm not going to answer any questions on GST,' says Senator Ian Macdonald. Yet there is 
 funding directly within those estimates showing how his own department is going to deal with the GST over the next year in its preparation. He refused to answer any questions on that.
Had we had more time, we would have had to invoke, for the first time since we have been in opposition, an amendment to the appropriations bills to bring Senator Ian Macdonald down to this chamber to answer the questions he refused to answer. But he has been protected from that course of action—one that we would take only with the greatest regret—by the guillotine at the moment because these bills must be passed today, being 30 June. But, really, I think it is up to Senator Hill and his colleagues to say to Senator Ian Macdonald, `You've taken the step up, you've become a minister; you actually have to fulfil your responsibilities under that, not only to the government but also to this chamber.'
I express a similar disappointment with some recent actions by Senator Newman. This is in regard to making press clippings available to shadow ministers. No government has an impeccable record on this. Every now and then some minister, for whatever reason, decides not to provide these clippings. Remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, the marginal on-cost is very, very small. You would hear that argument from the Treasury over the pulping of the ANTS package. The marginal cost of providing those clippings is very small. But on 11 June, Dr David Rosalky, the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services, wrote the following letter:
Dear Mr Swan
Earlier this week you asked that my department provide you with electronic transcripts of media interviews related to yourself and Senator Newman.
I consulted with Senator Newman's office to follow up your request, and wish to advise that we will not be providing you with electronic transcripts. In the course of our discussions, Senator Newman's Chief of Staff instructed that the department also stop providing copies of departmental press clips to members of the opposition.
Consequently, I am writing to advise that we have asked Media Monitors to stop delivering press clips to your office. 

Note the words by the department secretary: `I've been instructed.' I am not going to complain about the non-provision of electronic transcripts; there is no tradition in this parliament to do so. But I do think that this letter, the instruction from Senator Newman's office, shows that Mr Swan is doing his job very effectively—so effectively he has to be punished by not having the Department of Family and Community Services clips given to his office.
As I said, no government has an unblemished track record in this regard, but I was a minister for nine years, and I never once refused the provision of the clips to my shadow ministers. It was hard to keep track of them when I was defence minister. After all, I had as parliamentary shadows Senator Durack—I finished him off—and then I had Mr Downer, Senator Hill, Mr Reith and Senator Newman. I had five of them over that time. Prior to that, I had two shadow ministers for immigration and one when I was home affairs minister. So over that time I had eight shadow ministers in nine years. I am sorry I did not get one a year. But the fact is that I never once refused any of those people newspaper clippings, briefings or base visits and always made sure when in immigration that they in opposition got a speaking spot on the platform.
But let us come to Senator Newman's actions here. When she was shadow minister for defence, she used to receive the newspaper clips. However, she complained to my office that they did not arrive on time in the morning. So I instructed my office to photocopy the newspaper clips the moment they got to my office and walk them around to Senator Newman's office. Often she got to read the clips before I did because I was inevitably caught up in cabinet subcommittees. So what a mean-spirited action by Senator Newman in not providing the newspaper clips when we took every step possible to extend those courtesies to her in government. A stop should be put to this pettiness. It is always possible that Senator Newman is not fully aware of this, that it was her chief of staff that did this particular thing without reference to it, but I would be surprised. But 
 she should countermand the order. She has had her petty revenge for a couple of weeks. Why not establish and reciprocate the courtesy shown to her when she was shadow minister for defence?
We often have a saying in this chamber, `What comes around goes around.' I was watching the World Cup final—I admit it—in my office with Senator Faulkner the other night, and when the cameras zoomed in on the special guests box, we saw Bob Hawke there and then we saw Alexander Downer there. Both John Faulkner and I said, `Oh, isn't it good that he could go and see the cricket. It's good that he can get there; that Australia is represented.' Then a few criticisms came out that maybe he should have been spending more time trying to resolve the Serbian imprisonment of CARE workers, and we dismissed them. But when you go back and have a look at the explanation about when the tickets were bought for Mr Downer or when the arrangements were made, everything has been fogged over. So we do not know whether that was an arrangement made on the day he came back to London or before. But I think it would be a bit churlish for me to suggest that he cut short his Belgrade visit—as some may have inferred—and went to the cricket. I do not believe that. If he was in London and had hours to kill, why not go to the cricket? Any one of us would have, let's face it.
But what makes it a bit galling is to go back and read the Hansards of 1997 showing Mr Downer, in response to a set-up dorothy dix question, attacking other Labor ministers for going to Lords, just to make a cheap political shot—ending his answer with `Oh dear, oh dear!' Well, Mr Downer, oh dear, oh dear, the words you said then come back to haunt you now. But it not just those words that come back to haunt Mr Downer. When he was shadow foreign affairs spokesman he was constantly critical of the then government for their treating of issues when Australian citizens were taken as hostages. He said, `These are all solvable. These could all be fixed up; it is just that Senator Gareth Evans is not willing to do so.' Doesn't it change a bit when you get into government?  Why 
 can't Mr Downer flick his fingers and solve the imprisonment of the CARE workers? Because life is more complex than that. It is not as simple as the platitudes and the opportunistic interventions you make in opposition.
I think the greatest thing he focused on was the unfortunate Wilson situation. Yet here he is now as Minister for Foreign Affairs having a crack at the Wilson family for being `ungrateful'. The iron law of government is that, when families affected by bereavement attack you for incompetence, you wear the lumps, as Senator Gareth Evans did and many other ministers have done in the past. You do not have a crack back at the family, and that is exactly what he did. So what were going to be fairytale solutions in opposition now are confronted with realities. We should not condemn Mr Downer for not being able to release the CARE workers. These are complex issues. We should give him time to work on it—the very time he would never extend to any Labor ministers at the time.
While we are talking on churlish matters and ministerial behaviour, can you imagine a more churlish decision than that made by Mr Ruddock just a few weeks ago? Everyone in the Australian parliament supported the government on the Kosovar refugees. Indeed, colleagues failed to get up in this place and discuss the matters simply so we could get the legislation through. Some of those colleagues wanted to point out that some of the potential venues for the Kosovar refugees were not necessarily suitable, but they all curtailed their own rights and we pushed the bill through so that it could be done in time for the Kosovar refugees coming to Australia.
What is Mr Ruddock's reaction? He will appoint goodwill officers. He will appoint liaison officers, patrons, to this particular thing. That is fair enough. It will be good to get a bit of parliamentary input into this. And guess what? All seven were members of the Liberal-National coalition. That is not a bipartisan approach. That is to do with petty, political point-scoring in this country. It is not something that Mr Ruddock normally does.
I know he had a major disappointment in announcing on AM that no Kosovar refugees would come to this country, only to have 
 cabinet take a 180-degree turn three hours later. I know that he has now finally rectified that situation by trying to embrace all elements of the Australian parliament. I wonder what Senator Tierney thought when the acid got dropped on him. He would have loved to have a co-patron at that stage to assist him at Singleton. The whole idea of plotting this for political exploitation backfired very rapidly.
Moving on to the next minister, Senator Vanstone: have we ever had a more political Justice Minister than Senator Vanstone? Most of us always cut just a little more slack to Mr Williams, because he is the first law officer in the land. We know that most of the decisions he makes will not be political ones. They will be based on the law or on as good an interpretation of the law as you can find. This does not apply to Senator Vanstone. She was up here day after day, politicising the drugs debate—how low can you get?—just for the New South Wales election, by attacking the police commissioner and the New South Wales government and producing one set of distorted statistics after another.
I know there is immense disappointment in Senator Vanstone that she has been axed out of cabinet, axed out of a real job and been given the Justice thing. But constantly at question time or anywhere else, Senator Vanstone is in there for the political angle—not for the proper administration of the portfolio and not the supervision of the agencies that are within the portfolio area, but constantly trying to exploit any political angle.
We can all remember her, of course, going on at great length at how a previous Labor government had granted Christopher Skase a passport. Have we heard her once get up in this chamber and mention that the Australian government recently granted a new passport to an Australian citizen charged with a serious drug offence in Thailand? Where is the consistency in this particular approach? This Australian government issued that wanted person, who is already on Interpol's 10 most wanted list, with a passport. Doesn't anyone see the parallel between this and Skase? In the end, we have had thousands of words on Christopher Skase in the chamber from 
 Senator Vanstone. He is no nearer to returning to Australia now than I think he was five or seven years ago when Mr Lavarch pursued his extradition within the courts.
Summing up what I have been saying today, none of these issues amount to a hanging offence, but it does start to get the grubby flavour of some of these ministerial things. Senator Macdonald's defiance of the estimates tradition and history, Senator Newman's pettiness over the clippings, Mr Downer's double standards—as they turn out—over attending cricket at Lords and his previous views on hostage situations compared with his current ones, Mr Ruddock's very poor form in appointing only coalition members to be patrons of the Kosovar refugees in Australia and Senator Vanstone's politicising of the portfolio all fit a pattern of sleaziness and pettiness that is unnecessary in most of these things.
I am not saying, and I never would say, that there were not acts of pettiness in previous Labor governments. There are always examples of that. What you do is make your own decision about that and try to set higher standards. Most of these ministers refuse to do so, and I think they should be held publicly accountable where they do express double standards or where they do act in a petty and biased manner.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-06-30,"—Firstly, I take this opportunity to thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to acknowledge your contribution as a senator and the contribution you have made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and the electors of Queensland, and to wish you all the best. This is your last day here. I note that you will be spending a considerable amount of time in my home state of Tasmania; and so all the best.
—Thank you.
—I would like today to deal with some economic issues relating to retirement savings, saving levels in general and the current account deficit. We have now had four budgets delivered by Mr Costello on behalf of the Liberal government, and I would like to go back over some pertinent history 
 relating to the matters that I intend to focus on.
Going back to the first Costello budget of 1996, we can look at the forward estimates in respect of what is known as Labor's superannuation co-contribution. Of course, Mr Costello has often referred to this as the l-a-w law tax cuts, but he should suffer the same sort of embarrassment that he seeks to heap on us on this issue—and I will get to that a little later. The forward estimates that Mr Costello in that budget confirmed for the co-contribution, the government contribution to Australian workers' superannuation, provided in 1998-99 for a one per cent contribution, totalling about $1,080 million; in 1999-2000, for $2.4 billion or two per cent; and in 2000-01, just short of $4 billion or three per cent of wages. In that budget statement, on page 14, it says:
The government will review the mechanism for the delivery of this contribution to ensure it is a paid in an equitable and effective way. The government reserves the right to deliver this assistance to superannuation or like savings.
Of course, this was confirming the promise given by Mr Costello in the lead-up to the 1996 election. As an important side issue, this was the budget which introduced the now infamous superannuation surcharge or tax. It was forecast that in 1997-98 and following years it would raise just over $½ billion and close on $600 million in the year in 1999-2000. Of course, that is money effectively taken from future superannuation or retirement incomes.
It is also interesting to note that the budget statement says, `Private consumption growth is expected to moderate to three per cent in 1996-97, an outcome slightly below the average of the past 20 years.' Amongst the forecasts, it indicated that household saving would remain reasonably constant through to 1997 at about 2.5 per cent and that the current account deficit would decrease from $27.6 billion in 1994-95 down to a forecast $20 billion in 1996-97.
Moving to the second Costello budget in May of 1997, of course the centrepiece of this budget was the now infamous savings rebate. It was the reshaped superannuation contribu 
 tions that Mr Costello had said that he would deliver. He reshaped this in the form of a savings rebate, which was to apply to superannuation contributions made by employees or the self-employed from post-tax income and/or from net personal income from savings and investment up to an annual cap of $3,000. It went on:
These measures will encourage private saving and enhance Australia's retirement income. Australia must increase its national saving to reduce its reliance on borrowings from overseas. There is also a clear need to increase private saving and household saving in particular if we are to achieve a better balance between domestic saving and investment and allow the economy to grow faster.
Importantly—
and I stress this—
with the ageing of our population, there is a need to ensure that Australians save for their own retirement through superannuation. This government is committed to a retirement income policy that provides encouragement for individuals to achieve a higher standard of living in retirement than would be possible from the age pension above.
It is also interesting to note that the moneys that were to be put aside in the forward estimates for this savings rebate were only half of the moneys that were contained in the first Costello budget in the forward estimates for the retirement savings superannuation proposal of Labor.
Of course, as I have said, this savings rebate was the centrepiece of the Liberal budget of May 1997. It was politically quickly destroyed through criticisms from the head of Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, who in question time at estimates referred to it as being a risky strategy. I have no quotation from him, but he referred to it being very risky. Later on, of course, it was totally destroyed by none other than the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who declared that he did not want to collect his savings rebate.
It was rightly criticised by Labor on a number of grounds. Firstly, it largely rewarded existing saving, which is often short-term, and did not reward longer-term saving. Secondly, it was regressive in that it is higher income earners who have a propensity to save, because they have a higher disposable income. Thirdly, it only delivered half of the 
 moneys that were in the forward estimates as Labor's co-contribution.
I now move to the third Costello budget, the 1998 budget. Just to touch on the forecasts, it is here that Treasury started to identify particular problems in respect of household saving and the current account. Household saving in 1997-98 was 3.25 per cent. That followed a forecast in the previous year of 4.5 per cent, and so household saving clearly had declined significantly. The forecast for 1998-99 was 2.75 per cent. Of course, the current account forecast started to change, as well. In 1997-98, the outcome was minus $25 billion, when it had been projected to be only minus $21 billion in the previous budget: 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product, as compared with a forecast of four per cent. Clearly, problems are starting to emerge in the 1998 budget in these areas.
Moving to the last Costello budget, the 1999 budget: it appears, when we examine the graph on page 1.16, that national saving—which has been in a long-term downward trend over the past 20 years but which, not insignificantly, had been increasing since 1992—is now starting to dip again. Interestingly, public sector saving is increasing—both state and federal government public sector saving—and Mr Costello is often trumpeting the fact that the budget is in surplus. But, at the same time that public sector saving is increasing, private sector saving has declined in direct proportion to the increase in public saving. So we have, at the moment, a forecast decline in national saving over the next few years.
But, of course, we now get a change in the language and the approach of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and of the head of Treasury, Mr Ted Evans—and, indeed, of the Liberal government more generally. Their comments in the 1999 budget, at paragraph 1-8, are:
The increase in the current account deficit reflects private saving and investment decisions rather than government borrowing. With the budget now in surplus, the Commonwealth is no longer drawing on available private saving. Instead it has become a net lender, adding to the pool of saving available to fund private investment. International evidence suggests that the higher public saving tends to raise national saving. 

When Mr Evans, the head of Treasury, was questioned about these issues at estimates, he appeared to be relatively relaxed and unconcerned, effectively saying, `Well, it is not the government's fault. The public sector is not drawing on savings. If there is a problem, it is a problem of the private sector.'
One of the points the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has made is that the Commonwealth budget has moved into substantial surplus. But how has that been achieved? In not unsubstantial part, that saving in the Commonwealth budget debt has been achieved at the cost of direct private saving. If we add together the moneys that were to go into the superannuation contribution together with the so-called superannuation surcharge or tax and then look at the figures, in 1998-99, $1.6 billion, in 1999-2000, $2.9 billion, and in 2000-01, $4.5 billion has effectively been redirected from private superannuation saving back to reduce the government deficit. These are not insubstantial sums. There has been a direct switch from private saving to the Commonwealth budget surplus.
What has been the purpose of this? In the short term it has been to assist the government have a budget surplus and, in turn, that is being used to fund its GST package to provide compensation for the introduction of the goods and services tax through tax cuts. These income tax cuts, when they occur on 1 July next year, will have in very significant part been funded by running down future private savings in this country, in reducing future private savings in this country. You would not find an economist who has a knowledge in this area who would predict that the income tax cuts will be transferred into savings. In large part they will not. The income tax cuts will be spent. People would argue that is the choice of individuals, and I do not take exception to that argument. I do point out, however, that a large proportion of those tax cuts has effectively been provided at the cost of long-term retirement savings through superannuation. Of course, it is the long-term impact that is particularly serious.
Hundreds of billions of dollars have been switched from superannuation savings for retirement, savings that will be required to 
 assist in underwriting the real increase in the costs of health, accommodation, care and retirement incomes for our ageing population. At the moment, that ageing population as a proportion of our population is just over 12 per cent. It will almost double by the year 2050 to close on 22 per cent. That is why it is so imperative we have longer-term retirement income savings. All of this is allegedly in the name of real tax reform—the GST. It has been traded off for real long-term retirement income security to sustain our ageing population, in order to at least underwrite, in significant part, highly questionable tax reform. The Liberal government and its ministers are fond of shrouding these changes with the rhetoric of choice. But I put to the Senate: what choices will our population have in 25 or 30 years if they have a much reduced income to live on and at the same time have rapidly increasing costs? This is a real short-term approach.
I have referred to Treasury's relaxed and blithe acceptance of this particular problem. But I do note that Mr Macfarlane, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, in his Melbourne statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, did at least allude to the problems we have with private saving in this country. He outlined three particular problems. He said:
The first possible problem is if inadequate household saving persists it could mean inadequate provision for retirement. This, in turn, would put increased demands on future taxpayers. This is an issue of intergenerational equity. I do not want to suggest that this is not a problem—it may well be a big one—
Well, I would submit to the Senate we know it is going to be a big problem. And he went on:
but the solution to it would be found in improvements to our policies regarding retirement income.
Unfortunately, not many in the media picked this up. This is quite a clear and direct criticism of the Liberal government's approach to retirement incomes. He then went on to speak of the problems of saving and the current account deficit. Then he went on thirdly to the problem of indebtedness in respect of the household sector.
We need to be very careful about the current account deficit—it is now touching six per cent of gross domestic product—because our level of private saving is almost at zero. Whilst Treasury, the Treasurer and this government appear to be very relaxed about this as an economic issue in the short term, and certainly do not particularly care in the long term in terms of retirement incomes, what is the outcome of a current account deficit that cannot be funded by savings in Australia?
A number of potential problems are emerging. Firstly, there is the problem that one day the international money markets will look at Australia's current account debt and say that it is not sustainable. If it continues to grow worse—Australia has low declining levels of national saving, almost zero private saving, and despite public saving which is being run down to fund the bribes to get the Australian community to accept a GST—they may well say that they are not going to provide the capital anymore to underpin Australia's current account deficit. That will cause significant economic dislocation. We have only got to look at the problems in Asia to see some of the potential problems that can emerge.
Secondly, whilst we can borrow overseas to fund our current account deficit—and we clearly are at the present time—effectively that means a transfer of Australia's economic sovereignty. It means an increase in the net level of the Australian economy by companies that are located overseas and we gradually lose control of our economic destiny.
Thirdly, it means that we pay a premium for this imported capital. These are the sorts of potential problems that could emerge. We need to look very closely at the United States; their private savings level is now negative. I am pleased to note that there have been a number of articles by journalists Henderson, McGuire and Price and in the Financial Review by Mr Sean Aylmer on these particular issues. The implications are very serious. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-06-30,"—I want to add my good wishes to those colleagues who will be leaving this 
 place tonight and whose terms expire at midnight when they turn into pumpkins or something like that. Many praiseworthy words have been said over the last couple of days about each of our colleagues. On a personal note, I just wanted to add a couple of observations about them. I will remember Bill O'Chee because, as the Chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, he has made a most distinguished contribution to this place. Since I have been added to that committee and am about to assume what in very many ways are very big shoes—despite Senator O'Chee's small stature, he is very big when it comes to stature in regulations and ordinances—as the incoming chair of that committee, I am very much obliged to him for his generosity in filling me in on some of the bits and pieces that are necessary.
I turn now to David MacGibbon. I sat next to David in the chamber for some time and I am sure he will not mind me referring to him as an old dog who taught a new dog some tricks—certainly, some new tricks. I learned more about defence than I could have ever expected I would know and he personally equipped me to make a contribution to a Public Accounts and Audit inquiry into the Collins class submarine.
Sandy Macdonald, of course, is perhaps one of our most urbane and gregarious senators. I very much enjoyed his company on the odd occasion when we have been travelling backwards and forwards from Sydney. You will all be sorely missed.
Margaret Reynolds has had a very long and most distinguished career in this place. She has a particular commitment to women that I think will be well appreciated for many years beyond her leaving. No-one could doubt that Dee Margetts has made a sincere and sustained contribution according to her beliefs to this place. And Mal Colston, despite more recent public criticism, is still respected by his colleagues for the many years of work that he has put in. I know that some of that work was also as a distinguished Chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which is, in fact, the oldest Senate committee. Our thoughts will be with you all as you leave this place tonight.
As my contribution to the appropriations debate I want to spend just a few minutes giving consideration to what has been—and indeed still is—a contentious issue, that is, Australia's refugee and humanitarian program. The topic of refugees points up a fracture in the Australian psyche about refugees. On the one hand, we are moved to compassion and even tears at the plight of the Kosovar refugees. I can attest to this personally because I represented the minister, Mr Ruddock, on one occasion to welcome a recent plane load of refugees. In reply to Senator Ray's earlier comment about the lack of bipartisan contribution in this process, I was also accompanied on that occasion by Mr Daryl Melham, the member for Banks. It was most certainly a bipartisan occasion. This was out at East Hills.
It was a very sobering occasion. Lasting impressions were of the haunted faces, the look of despair and the knowledge that the lives of these people had been shattered by war and, above all, the triumph of spirit and the great cheer that went up when I said through an interpreter that the war was coming to an end and that they would soon be going home. Despite one or two disaffected people, the vast majority are grateful for the safe haven and hospitality that Australians have offered. In my view, it has been, at least to date, a most effective response to a humanitarian disaster of enormous proportions.
We might contrast this with the response to the boat people, those illegal immigrants who are often the victims of people smugglers, who have come to Australia in increasing waves and who are detained on arrival or on interception in Australian waters. The first observation that must be made is that not all illegal immigrants coming to Australia have the same circumstances. To start with, many more come by air than by boat.
I do not think anyone doubts that the economic conditions from which the poorest of these illegal immigrants flee are severe. On the other hand, the recent thwarting of a load of some 2,000 Somalis who had paid some $3,500 just for the chance to join in the passage to a new life suggests more relative wealth. The average amount for such a jour 
 ney is in the order of $A26,000, which must be an absolute fortune for most. We all would know that economic hardship, of itself, is not an eligible criterion on which to establish refugee status under the convention, and that makes the whole business of people trafficking not only reprehensible but particularly heartless and exploitative. To hold out to people in those conditions the promise of being able to deliver is particularly harsh.
According to the International Organisation for Migration, people trafficking is now a major global scam, pulling in an amount of the order of $US7 billion—$A10.6 billion—and handling four million people a year. It is a staggering number world wide. What is alarming, at least for Australia, is that Australia, the United States and Canada are desirable and targeted destinations. The reason the increasing number of illegal immigrants requires a strategic response is not only that their personal safety is put at risk, usually in rusty, unseaworthy boats, but that trafficking poses a threat to Australia's security, public health and quarantine—with our $13 billion agriculture industry at stake—and may increase drug smuggling and other criminal operations.
In short, it must be said that illegal immigration and an appropriate response to it raise serious political and economic questions. At present, each illegal arrival in Australia costs some $50,000 just in processing costs, and this does not include the cost of pursuing matters through the court. This chamber is in the course of debating measures designed to limit judicial review in such cases and I do not propose to comment about that any further, but it does require a response and a most effective approach to intervening in what has become a national problem. We must not underestimate the challenge once illegals are on the seas or in the air. With some 37,000 kilometres of coastline to survey, it is a difficult problem. Even if illegal immigrants have no hope of remaining permanently, how they are treated in Australia and how they are identified and returned to their country of origin depends on a speedy and a fair process that also minimises abuse of the 
 process. We all would acknowledge that there have been some serious abuses of the process.
A couple of days ago the Prime Minister and the minister announced some significant measures, with the expenditure of some $124 million over four years, to step up the fight against illegal immigration, to provide much more surveillance and, most importantly, to look at Australia's capacity to detect and deter illegal immigration from source and transit countries. Australia has a well-run immigration program and it would be a great pity if that program were to be judged by anomalies instead of what is in the national interest.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-06-30,"—On 26 May, Senator Harradine asked me for details of the funding allocations in relation to the government's response to the Bringing them home  report.
Senator Patterson interjecting—
—That's what we always do. I thought you would have learned, you dope.
—Senator Faulkner, you are shouting across the chamber and you are behaving in a disorderly fashion.
—On 27 May, I provided information on the various elements of the packages of measures constituting the response which involves four different agencies across three portfolios. I also undertook to seek from the agencies involved detailed progress reports. I now have this information. There is a lot of detail here which I will make available for the information of the Senate.
In this context, I also have some additional information to an answer I gave to a question from Senator Carr yesterday about the government's response to Bringing them home. In my answer I indicated that ATSIC was coordinating the government's response 
 to the report. I was, of course, referring to the coordination of the family tracing part of the program—the Link-up program—which is the central plan of the $64 million Commonwealth response. Senator Carr asked why Victoria was coordinating the response. Victoria is chairing a MCATSIA committee overseeing the response not just of the Commonwealth but of the states and territories as well.
The Commonwealth takes responsibility for the implementation of its own response separately from the activities of the states. This is evident from the information I will table today. In fact, the majority of the recommendations of the Bringing them home report were not directed at the Commonwealth but at the states, territories and non-government bodies such as churches. It is perfectly normal for MCATSIA activities to be chaired by different states. In fact, the chairmanship of MCATSIA is undertaken by the states and territories in turn. The next MCATSIA meeting will be in the Northern Territory and it is being coordinated by the Northern Territory government. As to the question of why there have been no meetings of officials to date, I am advised it is because they were waiting for responses from all the states and territories. I can advise Senator Carr that they were awaiting a response from his namesake in New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr. New South Wales only recently provided a response.

Senator Marise Payne
Chair
Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
24 June 1999
Dear Senator Payne
I refer to the Committee's report on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998 and the complementary Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 which was tabled in the Senate on 19 February 1999. 

I am pleased to note that the majority of the Committee consider that the Bills should be passed without amendment.
I set out below the Government's response to the other recommendations in the Committee's Report.
Recommendation 1
The committee concludes that in the course of the preceding inquiries and reviews, considerable opportunity has been provided for consultation on the proposed changes. The committee considers it important, however, that all parties involved have adequate opportunity to see the results of this process, and for this reason recommends that in the interest of transparency, the Ernst & Young and the KPMG reports should be publicly available.
The Government has no objection to making the Ernst and Young Review publicly available. A copy has already been supplied to the Opposition parties and Independents in the Senate as well as the Opposition spokesperson on Attorney-General's matters.
As it is primarily of interest to the clients of the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) I have requested my Department to make the Review available to all organisations that made submissions to the Review (and which are identified in it) as well as to the bodies who gave evidence at the Committee's hearing on the Bills but who did not contribute to the Review. Further copies can be obtained from Ms Jill Baillie in my Department (telephone 02 6250 5930).
The KPMG review referred to is ongoing and relates to the internal operations of the OFLC and no final report is yet available for public release. OFLC has advised that on commencement of the review KPMG sought industry input and that a report will be published on completion.
Recommendation 2
The committee recommends that in view of the broad concerns raised in the hearing and the submissions, the government examine in detail the issue of burden sharing between the film and television industries with a view to ensuring that the tax burden for classification services is shared equitably.
The Government does not support this recommendation.
As a matter of Government policy, a self-regulatory scheme applies to material broadcast on free-to-air television and Pay TV (which for convenience, I shall refer to as television) within the confines of a comprehensive over-arching legislative structure. The OFLC has not classified television programs since 1986.
Classification of television programs is a matter for the individual stations in accordance with the 
 classification scheme applied by the OFLC. All television programs are classified and different rules apply depending on the time-slot to be occupied by the program concerned.
This involves a cost to the stations themselves which are also the first port of call for complaints from the public on content issues.
While the data-base of classification decisions maintained by the OFLC is available to television classifiers, and no doubt assists with their decision-making, the responsibility for classification decisions for television programs remains on the classifiers and their stations. For example, material classified by the Classification Board may well require modification depending on the scheduling of it by the stations.
Thus, while the Classification Board's classifications may provide a useful guide to television classifiers they are not, in many cases, automatically transferable to the medium of television.
In the contrast to television, the material classified by the Classification Board covers a much broader range of material (cinema films, videos, computer games and publications) with a wider range of classifications and which is distributed and exhibited in a quite different market environment.
In this respect it does not automatically follow, as appears to have been suggested by some witnesses who appeared before the Committee, that material that first appears on television would automatically receive the same classification if subsequently released for cinema or video purposes. This would depend on the nature of the material and whether it had been modified for television purposes. It must also be said that the collective opinion of the Classification Board in fulfilling its legislative requirements in making classification decisions may legitimately differ from the decision of an individual television classifier in making his or her decision for the broadcast medium. While the Board may confirm television classification for some children's programs, for example Bananas in Pyjamas, this is not always the case, for example episodes of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series received a G classification for television broadcast but were classified PG by the Board for release on video.
Recommendation 3
The committee recommends that the issue of waivers and exemptions form part of the charter of the industry consultative body that will be established in the near future. It is considered that this body is the most appropriate forum for discussion of a detailed policy, as it will contain the expert knowledge of the industry itself.
The Government supports the recommendation that a detailed policy regarding the issue of waivers and exemptions be discussed with industry although the 
 exercise of the waiver power under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 will, of course, remain with the Director.
Indeed, consultations are to occur in the near future with all sectors of the Industry that use the services of the OFLC about proposed amendments to the Commonwealth, State and Territory co-operative legislative scheme. These consultations will include issues relating to waivers and exemptions.
Recommendation 4
To ensure the effectiveness of this proposed industry consultative body, it is recommended that it be chaired by an industry representative, and report directly to the Attorney-General as the responsible minister, ensuring that industry has an effective avenue for maintaining the performance of the OFLC.
The Government supports this recommendation except as it relates to the chair of the proposed industry consultative body.
There is also a question about the structure of the industry consultative mechanism. For example, whether it should comprise a single consultative group or whether it should take the form of separate consultative groups for enforcement agencies and each of the industry sectors (cinema, video, computer games, and publications) serviced by the OFLC. This question raises a number of issues which require further consultation.
As far as the chairing of the consultative group or groups is concerned, users of OFLC services have a legitimate role in ensuring that such services are provided in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner. However, this interest must not be allowed to interfere with the independence of the Classification Board in making classification decisions that reflect the standards generally accepted by the community.
For this reason and in order to ensure that an appropriate overview can be maintained, I consider that the proposed consultative group or groups should be chaired by a Deputy Secretary in my Department in Canberra. This will also ensure that an appropriate separation is maintained between the interests of industry groups and those relating to the independence of the Classification Board and the public interest in the operations of the OFLC.
Recommendation 5
The committee concludes that within the context of the policy decision to recover the full cost of running the OFLC, it is inevitable that costs to the industry will rise, as is acknowledged in the Explanatory Memorandum. Evidence provided as to the relative cost of Australian classification services, under either the existing or proposed scale of fees, is inconclusive. Nevertheless, the committee recognises that this is an important 
 issue, and one which should form part of the ongoing consultations between the industry and the OFLC. The committee recommends that this form one of the mandated tasks of the consultative body discussed above.
The Government supports this recommendation.
By way of observation, however, I should point out that it is not necessarily inevitable that costs to the industry will rise. The Schedule to the Charges Bill does, of course, increase the costs to the industry. As far as future increases are concerned, the costs associated with running the OFLC have remained fairly constant over recent years and, in fact, are estimated to fall slightly in the coming financial year. This trend is expected to continue. However, the difficulty is that there is no assurance as to the revenue to be generated from classification services in any one year. A small organisation like the OFLC has very limited capacity to reduce its cost base at short notice to accommodate reductions in workload. Any rise in future costs to industry is therefore expected to result primarily from a drop in revenue rather than from an increase in the operating costs of the OFLC.
Yours sincerely

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT OF THE SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT:
`The Incidence of Ovine Johne's Disease in the Australian Sheep Flock—First Report'

Preamble
The Government has considered the first report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on  `The Incidence of Ovine Johne's Disease in the Australian Sheep Flock—First Report' and is pleased to provide the following response. The Government would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Committee in preparing a concise and clear first report which seeks to address a range of issues relating to the  `The Incidence of Ovine Johne's Disease in the Australian Sheep Flock'. The Committee's recommendations are addressed in turn below. The Government notes that the Committee intends to continue their enquiry in 1999.
Recommendation 1
1)	  The Commonwealth must ensure that adequate funds are made available to ensure an ongoing and effective OJD research effort can be maintained.
The Government notes this recommendation of the Committee and advises that it has in place arrangements which provide funds for industry-nominated research projects on a matching dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5% of the Gross Value of Production (GVP) of the particular livestock sector annually. These arrangements are administered by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation (AWRAP). Additionally, the Government is funding related research being undertaken by CSIRO at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL).
Recommendation 2
2)	  The Commonwealth considers any application for exceptional circumstances assistance arising from the effect of OJD as part of a regional assistance package.
At this stage, it is considered premature to refer an Exceptional Circumstances application to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council (RASAC) for consideration.
Commonwealth and State agriculture Ministers agreed, at the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) in July 1998, to progress a national joint government-industry approach to dealing with OJD, based on a Business Plan developed by the Australian Animal Health Council (AAHC). The strategy is to control the spread of OJD, while obtaining enough research to evaluate the feasibility of national eradication.
A range of complex issues needs to be settled to effectively deal with OJD on a national basis, including Business Plan details regarding the strategy parameters, implementation mechanisms and associated financial arrangements.
Until the national strategy is settled and some results become available from the research activities, especially on the issues of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of eradication, it is not possible for RASAC to be able to sensibly advise on the matter.
Recommendation 3
The Commonwealth, the state governments in Victoria and New South Wales and relevant local government authorities develop regional assistance packages based on the Rural Partnership program model for regions affected by OJD.
Available funding for the Rural Partnership Program (RPP) is already committed to the twelve pilot projects now underway. RPP projects are designed to facilitate a holistic approach to a range of economic, natural resource management, environmental and social issues in a defined region. Strengths of the approach are its capacity to achieve broad based community commitment, 
 cooperation between governments and the regional community and regional coordination of government programs to achieve agreed strategic outcomes. It is unclear that the broadly based RPP model could be successfully applied to the management of a single issue. OJD is not currently a major issue in existing RPP areas.
Apart from the RPP (which is fully committed), the only program within the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio that could support work on Ovine Johne's Disease is the Rural Plan initiative. The Rural Plan initiative is designed to support regional or industry groups to develop planning approaches to their future development. Rural Plan funding is allocated on a competitive basis and applications which have an overall strategic approach within a region or industry are favoured.
Under new machinery of government arrangements, Rural Plan will be administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Community and industry groups wishing to undertake a strategic planning process to complement the National Ovine Johne's Disease Control and Evaluation Program can prepare a proposal using the Rural Plan Guidelines and application form. Applications can be submitted any time up to March 2001 and are for a maximum of $200,000 over three years.
Recommendation 4
The Victorian government review the level of compensation paid to growers who were required to destock their properties in 1997 in the light of the economic analysis prepared by Mr Andrew Patterson from the Victorian department of Natural Resources and Environment"".
The Victorian Minister for Agriculture and Resources has advised the Commonwealth that he announced in early September 1998 an increase in compensation rates of approximately 80%. In making this increase, the Minister followed the recommendations of the Sheep and Goat Compensation Advisory Committee's review of the Victorian OJD Control Program and the economic analysis prepared for the Committee by Mr Andrew Paterson. The Minister also considered a joint submission from the VFF Pastoral Group and the Victorian OJD Action Group (of affected producers).
The new levels of compensation apply retrospectively to all producers who have participated in the Victorian OJD control program since its establishment in 1996. In order to fund the increase in compensation the Victorian Government has agreed to an arrangement which limits an increase in stamp duty and allows the Sheep and Goat Compensation Fund to borrow from Treasury and repay over a period of 10 years.

THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE REPORT

""IMPROVING BUT . . . . AUSTRALIA'S REGIONAL DIALOGUE ON HUMAN RIGHTS""
Introduction
The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to comment on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's regional dialogue on human rights. The Committee's work has generated a valuable debate on questions which lie at the core of so many pressing problems in the region. It has also raised awareness of the range of ways by which the Government seeks to advance the cause of human rights. The Committee has correctly observed that there is a place for quiet diplomacy, at times, just as there are requirements occasionally for a more public stance by government as it promotes and protects human rights.
The Government's emphasis on dialogue and its preference for practical policies that will make a real difference to the lives of individuals means that human rights activities are, by their nature, not always very visible on the domestic scene. Public discussion and scrutiny of its human rights policies and activities is thus particularly welcome. The response to the recommendations demonstrates that the Government is continuing to explore ways of translating its commitment to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the major human rights instruments into practical outcomes, including by improving the effectiveness of its regional dialogue.
Recommendation 1
The Australian Government give consideration to acceptance of the draft Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, provided that the final document is seen to complement the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and not derogate from it.
The drafting of a Declaration of Human Responsibilities by a group of former heads of government, including Mr Malcolm Fraser, was the result of an ambitious undertaking to identify universally applicable human responsibilities.
It appears that, at least in its present form, the draft Declaration has not attracted the degree of support which would be required to put it before the relevant organs of the United Nations (UN) for possible endorsement by the international community. No member country has submitted the draft Declaration to the UN and unless or until that occurs, the question of formal government acceptance does not arise. 

Recommendation 2
The Australian Government establish formal coordination mechanisms between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and the new Centre for Democratic Institutions.
The Australian National University (ANU) is contracted to AusAID to deliver the work of the Centre for Democratic Institutions (CDI). The CDI is working closely with and through AusAID and DFAT (including posts) to carry out its work. There is regular operational contact with officers of DFAT, AusAID and the CDI.
A Consultative Group for the CDI has been appointed. It comprises approximately thirteen members who will provide overall guidance and advice to the CDI on broad policy and strategic directions. The Group, comprising eminent people from academic, business and civil society, will also include senior AusAID and DFAT representatives.
Recommendation 3
The Australian Government develop a Centre for Dialogue and Cooperation to be established outside traditional government and academic structures.
Current priorities outlined elsewhere in this response take precedence over such a concept and the Government has no present plans to fund a Centre for Dialogue and Cooperation. Government effort in this area has focused on establishing and consolidating the Centre for Democratic Institutions (CDI), which will be working through bodies outside of government and academia in fulfilling its mandate. The CDI's focus includes working with NGOs. For example, it is currently planning joint courses with the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA).
Recommendation 4
AusAID increase the emphasis on human rights in the overseas aid program by including the following measures:
(a)	 establishing a human rights policy for AusAID
(b)	 introducing human rights training for AusAID staff; and
(c)	 including the issue of human rights in policy dialogue between AusAID and aid recipients
(a) The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in the Eighth Annual Statement to Parliament on Australia's Development Cooperation Program (2 December 1998), outlined the following framework for supporting human rights through Australia's aid program:
""The framework consists of six key principles.
First, human rights are a high priority for the Government. Civil and political rights are ranked equally with economic, social and cultural rights.
Secondly, the aid program will continue to undertake activities that directly address specific 
 economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. A particular emphasis will be on the creation of durable institutional capacity to promote and protect human rights.
Thirdly, the emphasis is on the practical and the attainable. AusAID, as the Government's aid agency, will pursue practical aid activities in support of human rights. These activities complement and build on high-level dialogue on human rights. Dialogue on human rights and representations about individual human rights cases will normally be carried through diplomatic channels.
Fourthly, the aid program will develop activities primarily as a result of consultations and cooperation with partner countries on human rights initiatives. Regional and multilateral activities will also be undertaken.
Fifthly, considerable care will continue to be applied to the use of aid sanctions associated with human rights concerns. The Government will consider such sanctions on a case-by-case basis. Aid conditionality based on human rights concerns would only be used in extreme circumstances since it can jeopardise the welfare of the poorest and it may be counter-productive.
Sixthly, AusAID will continue to link closely with other arms of the Australian Government on governance and human rights issues. AusAID will also liaise with NGOs and human rights organisations in Australia.
Practical action based on these principles means that the aid program will continue to focus on its objective of assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. These principles will underpin our strong support for civil and political rights throughout our aid work. The aid program will seek to maximise the benefits for human rights in all development assistance activities.""
AusAID is currently finalising practical guidance for staff on putting these principles into operation and has consulted with relevant NGOs as part of the process.
(b) AusAID is currently undertaking a program of governance training for the agency. Human rights is a key component of the training program, focusing on issues of particular relevance to AusAID staff and supporting implementation of the six key principles. Training commenced in March 1999. AusAID staff continue to have access to the DFAT human rights course.
(c) Annual High Level Meetings between AusAID and counterpart government organisations, as well as on-going discussions involving aid staff overseas, provide avenues for offering practical assistance to improve human rights conditions on the ground in developing countries. AusAID will continue to take the opportunity provided by these 
 meetings to explore extension of the aid program's portfolio of human rights-related activities with counterpart government organisations, and to indicate the importance the Australian Government attaches to human rights.
The Government's high level policy dialogue with foreign governments on human rights generally, as well as representations about individual human rights cases, are usually carried out through diplomatic channels. This approach will continue. AusAID will continue to work closely with DFAT on practical initiatives to support this dialogue.
Recommendation 5
AusAID:
(a)	 incorporate relevant international human rights instruments into program design;
(b)	 develop a program of human rights education with aid recipient governments in the region; and
(c)	 invite contribution from NGOs and consultants to assist in developing a policy on conditionality of aid. This policy should be explained to the recipient countries before the grant of aid.
(a) Considerable work is being done by a number of aid donors to integrate development and human rights thinking. AusAID recognises the need to look carefully at the implications of international human rights instruments for development cooperation and welcomes dialogue with the NGO community on this. A clear understanding of the background to and objectives of these instruments, and of the obligations they create for States parties, is essential.
The Australian aid program's focus on governance has strengthened the integration of human rights in the aid program, through its recognition that governments play a central role in determining the extent to which citizens can realise their human rights. Much of Australia's governance assistance is focused on helping partner governments develop and maintain institutions that are capable, accountable, committed to equity and that understand their human rights obligations. Such activities help build institutions and cultures that are consistent with the enjoyment of human rights.
The aid program will continue to work towards ensuring that all development assistance activities have a positive human rights impact. Human rights considerations are taken into account in project design and implementation. As part of AusAID's regular program of sector reviews, human rights aspects of aid interventions will be assessed. Modifications to design and implementation procedures will be undertaken as necessary to enhance performance in this area. The range of international human rights instruments to which Australia is committed will provide the context for, 
 and inform and guide, aid program involvement in human rights activities. As noted in the response to Recommendation 4, AusAID is finalising practical guidance for staff to assist implementation of this policy. As part of this process, AusAID has consulted human rights organisations and examined relevant information produced by other donors.
(b) Human rights education is an important part of Australia's development assistance in the region. Technical assistance and education in the area of human rights is seen as an important tool for assisting countries to strengthen their capacity to promote and protect human rights. (c) Australia takes a cautious approach to the issue of conditionality. The primary aim of Australia's aid is to reduce poverty. Human rights abuses are an issue in some of the countries to which Australia provides aid. Some argue the level of aid should depend on respect for human rights and democracy in recipient countries. Conditionality needs to be used very carefully, since it can jeopardise the welfare of the poor and it may be counter-productive. Where serious and sustained human rights violations have occurred, Australia has withdrawn aid in concert with other donors. The Government has suspended bilateral aid to Burma given that country's poor record on human rights, but has continued assistance through non-governmental organisations to help minority peoples who have suffered under the regime. Violations are looked at on a case-by-case basis.
Recommendation 6
In respect of human rights dialogue with China:
(a)	 the Australian Government consider the inclusion of an independent human rightsexpert in any future Australian delegations to China; and
(b)	 the Australian Government liaise and coordinate, so far as practicable, with other countries engaged in bilateral dialogue with China on human rights.
(a) The Australian delegation to the 1998 round of the human rights dialogue in Canberra included an independent expert from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and the Government would be looking to maintain that representation for this year's talks in China. Similarly, the Government would be looking to ensure that its consultations with community groups on China-related human rights issues are maintained in the future.
(b) The Australian Government already liaises and coordinates with a range of other countries that are engaged in bilateral dialogue with China on human rights. Liaison ensures that there is minimal duplication of human rights technical assistance activities, and that the dialogue activities are based on the best available information about the evolving 
 Chinese human rights environment. Effective liaison and coordination will play a major role in the effort to maximise China's engagement with the international community on human rights issues and, through this engagement, to assist on-the-ground change in the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law in China.
Recommendation 7
The Australian Government examine the possibility of playing a mediating role in respect of initiating dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama.
The Government encourages dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama on terms acceptable to both sides. It has conveyed that view consistently, most recently during Mr Downer's meeting with Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in Kuala Lumpur on 14 November 1998.
The decision to commence a process of dialogue is, however, one for the parties directly involved to take. Until they reach agreement on such a process, encouragement remains the most productive contribution that others, like Australia, can make.
Recommendation 8
The Australian Government continue to pursue actively in its dealings with the new Indonesian Government its support for a solution to the difficulties in East Timor that is just, equitable and in the best interests of the people of East Timor.
Events moved quickly in Indonesia and East Timor during and after the Committee's deliberations. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, wrote to President Habibie on 23 December 1998 setting out the Government's views on the future of East Timor. The letter stated that in the Government's view, the long term prospects for reconciliation would be best served by the holding of an act of self-determination at some future time, following a substantial period of autonomy. The Government also made clear its support for the release of Xanana Gusmao on the grounds that he has an important role in the negotiations on East Timor's future. This new policy was made known publicly on 12 January 1999.
The Government has continued to work very actively to encourage a solution to the problems of East Timor, including through strong financial, logistical and other support for the UN consultation process, and ongoing dialogue with the Indonesian Government—including the Prime Minister's summit with President Habibie and Indonesian ministers in Bali on 27 April. In its dialogue with Indonesia, the Government has consistently emphasised its overriding interest in seeing a smooth and peaceful transition—whether to autonomy or independence—following the UN consultation. In its contacts both with the East Timorese and the Indonesian government, the Government has also 
 emphasised the importance of a process of reconciliation between various East Timorese factions. It has urged the Indonesian authorities to respect human rights and to take measures that build confidence on the ground in East Timor. Indonesia's responsibility to end violence in East Timor, particularly through bringing the militias under control, has been raised consistently in this context.
The Government recognises that substantial international resources will need to be made available to assist East Timor in its transition process to a new status, whether it be autonomy or independence. The Government has foreshadowed a significant commitment from Australia, including a $20 million contribution to the UN consultation process and the deployment of 50 Australian police to the UN civilian police force. Mr Downer has also encouraged other members of the international community (for example, EU countries) to respond generously. Assistance to East Timor—both in the short and long term—will continue to be a high priority for the Government for the foreseeable future. This is reflected in the establishment of an Australian Consulate in early June.
Australia supports the establishment of an office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in East Timor. Through its contribution to the Indonesian National Commission of Human Rights, Komnas HAM (see below), which has an office in Dili, it is also helping in practical ways to resolve East Timor's human rights issues.
Recommendation 9
The Australian Government consider the inclusion of conditions relating to political reform and the observance of human rights in future development assistance to Indonesia.
As noted in the response to Recommendation 5(c), Australia takes a cautious position on conditionality. The Government's approach to development aid is to target aid towards achieving particular reform goals, not make it conditional on achievement of these goals. Australia's development cooperation program funds a range of activities to promote human rights in Indonesia, both directly and indirectly. All of the economic development programs contribute to the realisation of economic and social rights, which are an integral part of human rights. In addition, Australia made an aid commitment of up to $2 million in technical assistance to support the protection and promotion of civil and political rights in Indonesia. The key activity being funded out of this contribution is a major program of technical assistance to the Indonesian National Commission of Human Rights, Komnas HAM, to strengthen its institutional capacity. The aim is to assist Komnas HAM in fulfilling its official mandate to protect and promote human rights, including following through Indonesia's National 
 Action Plan on Human Rights launched on 25 June 1998.
Other examples of assistance include assistance to Yayasan HAK, a community-based legal aid and human rights monitoring NGO in Dili; to the Dili Diocese Commission on Justice and Peace, for human rights monitoring and advocacy; and to the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (LBH) based in Jakarta. Funds for Indonesian NGOs in the broad area of good governance and civil society have also been made available through the Australia Indonesia Institute.
Recommendation 10
Consideration be given by the Australian Government to the possibility of using the human rights initiatives undertaken in Vietnam as a model for use in programs with other countries in the region.
The initiatives taken in Vietnam, particularly the forging of links between the Human Rights Research Centre at the Ho Chi Minh National Political Academy and the Centre for Asian and Pacific Law at the University of Sydney, have benefited from being non-confrontational, from drawing on non-government expertise and from focusing on institutional capacity building. These principles have broader applicability in the region, although clearly the mode of technical cooperation will differ from one partner country to another.
Partnerships with developing countries form the core of Australia's development cooperation program. Program activities are tailored specifically to the most pressing development needs of each country, via country strategies. These strategies consider Australia's development cooperation program in the broader context of each country's own development efforts and take into account the activities of other donors. The sectoral focus of the aid program (announced in ""Better Aid for a Better Future"", November 1997), which includes governance as one of five priority sectors, provides a mechanism for adapting approaches used in one country, such as Vietnam, to other countries. This will be done where Australia and the partner country in question agree that it meets the latter's particular development needs.
Recommendation 11
The Australian Government give consideration to including dialogue on human rights issues in its dialogue with Thailand, and in development assistance provided to Thailand.
While human rights issues have always been an element of the dialogue between Australia and Thailand, they have been given greater priority in recent years and now form an important part of our dialogue. Australia has expressed support for Thailand's increased participation in the international human rights system, welcoming its moves to establish a National Human Rights Commission, 
 its consideration of accession to key human rights instruments and its efforts to develop a coordinated approach to issues. (Pending the formation of a National Commission, a Committee under the direction of former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun is making policy recommendations to the Government.)
These developments will provide scope for further cooperation with Thailand, including through Australian organisations such as the Centre for Democratic Institutions and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Government looks forward to expanding the bilateral dialogue and seeking opportunities to work with Thailand to build on its strong political commitment to human rights.
In the governance sector, AusAID funds programs in selected areas to assist the Thai Government to implement its broad agenda on political and bureaucratic reform. This has included an intensive two week training program on public sector reform for senior Thai officials, run by the Public Sector and Merit Protection Commission. Other projects, related to the implementation of Thailand's new constitution, are being actively pursued.
Recommendation 12
The Australian Government raise the issue of inappropriate use of national security laws in its bilateral dialogue with countries in the region, and also at the UN Commission on Human Rights, with a view to the Commission establishing an investigation into such use and the development of guidelines setting out the circumstances in which their use would be justified.
The Australian Government raises the issue of national security laws in its bilateral dialogue with countries in the region, where we think those laws have been used inappropriately to detain people for the peaceful expression of their political views. For example, the impact of national security laws on the protection of human rights was raised during the Australia-China human rights dialogue in Canberra in August 1998. Australia also made representations to the Chinese Government concerning the arrest, trial and sentencing of China Democracy Party activists in December 1998. Those activists had been convicted of offences endangering state security. Representations are regularly made to other governments (for example, the Governments of Laos and Vietnam) about persons adopted by Amnesty International as prisoners of conscience. Australia has raised the issue of national security and human rights in multilateral forums, most recently in its statement on human rights questions to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 10 November 1998: 

""Australia is well aware of the depth of the financial crisis currently afflicting parts of the globe, especially in our own region. . . In times of economic pressure, it is vital that governments do not overlook basic rights such as freedom of religion and political expression, and that they use national security legislation in an appropriate manner.""
At the 55th session of the Commission on Human Rights, in April 1999, the Australian delegation co-sponsored a consensus resolution which deals with the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The resolution covers, inter alia, ""the need to ensure that unjustified invocation of national security to restrict the right to freedom of expression and information does not take place"" and refers to the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, as adopted by a group of experts in South Africa on 1 October 1995. The resolution expresses its concern at the number of cases in which violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression are facilitated and aggravated by several factors, including ""too vague a definition of offences against State security"".
The Government also notes the existence of a consensus resolution at the Commission on Human Rights which deals with the question of arbitrary detention, including detention imposed inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned.
Recommendation 13
The Australian Government consider including human rights considerations in the assistance it provides to countries in the region in the wake of the Asian economic crisis.
Human rights considerations are integral to the assistance the Government provides to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The economic and accompanying social crises in the region have focused attention on fundamental rights and freedoms and the necessity for effective democracy and good governance to promote their realisation. The Government's emphasis on governance and capacity-building in its regional human rights dialogues, as well as on consultations and cooperation with partner countries in its development cooperation programs in the region, responds to these needs. For example, the Government is providing up to $675,000 over 3 years to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) to assist it in providing a secretariat for the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions. The Forum aims to build and maintain a strong network between national human rights institutions in the region, and to encourage regional governments, their administrative organs, NGOs and wider civil 
 society to work in cooperation with national human rights institutions.
The Government will continue to give priority to the strengthening of civil society. In recognition of the major social impact of the regional crisis, the Government is currently considering a range of further development cooperation activities in the social sphere, including ones specifically aimed at protecting and promoting human rights in the region.
Recommendation 14
The Australian Government review the human rights implications of Australia's defence co-operation with other countries and establish guidelines which prohibit any defence co-operation which could contribute to the recipient forces internal security function.
Australia conducts a wide range of defence cooperation activities with the region which are tailored to the needs of the country concerned. These include policy talks and high level visits, combined exercises, personnel attachments and exchanges, study visits, and training programs conducted in Australia and overseas. These activities help build confidence and enhance transparency in defence planning, thereby increasing understanding of each other's strategic perceptions and intentions. Furthermore, combined military exercises, training and operational deployments improve our capacity to operate with other defence forces and promote the development of each country's defence capabilities. This, in turn, reinforces the security of the region as a whole.
The Government takes into account a number of factors when deciding the extent of cooperative defence activities with other countries. Factors include the strategic considerations outlined above, existing bilateral and multilateral commitments, economic considerations, the needs of the country concerned, as well as the country's human rights performance. The same considerations apply to defence exports. In all cases, our cooperative programs are tailored to avoid activities which may give rise to human rights concerns.
Many regional countries, and especially Pacific Island countries, have armed forces that have both internal and external security roles. In certain countries, the defence force and the police force are combined in one security organisation. A blanket prohibition on defence cooperation which could contribute to the recipient force's internal security function would render any kind of defence cooperation with these countries impossible. For example, Australia would be unable to assist the Solomon Islands Defence Force in developing their basic weapons skills because this could possibly contribute to the internal security function. 

To a lesser extent, the same is true of the armed forces of many South East Asian countries. As these nations have developed over the past decade, the focus of their security forces has been moving from internal security to external security. However, many South East Asian security forces still have at least a vestigial internal role. Although Defence will continue to focus defence cooperation activities on external security roles, to put a complete stop to any defence cooperation that could possibly contribute to an internal security function would be very restrictive. Many cooperative defence activities involve generic skills and capabilities which could in theory be applied to external or internal security situations. While the Government endeavours to constrain cooperation to areas not likely to lead to human rights abuse, this ultimately comes down to a question of judgement.
The Government believes its current policy on the provision of Defence Cooperation works well in balancing the range of our foreign policy and security interests. Where there are human rights concerns with particular regional countries, the ADF does not provide training or undertake other cooperative activities in skills designed to enhance internal security or counter-insurgency capabilities. For instance, this policy has meant that the Government is currently not planning any exercises with Indonesia's Special Forces except those concerned with counter-hijack training.
Recommendation 15
The Australian Government review the operations of its defence co-operation program with a view to providing assistance to the governments of regional countries in provision of training for the military in international human rights law.
As noted in relation to Recommendation 14, the Australian Government has taken, and will continue to take, a principled position on human rights issues. The Government will continue to review the human rights implications of all cooperative defence activities with other countries.
Technical assistance programs under defence cooperation agreements include training in international humanitarian law and its implications for defence personnel. Funding is provided for human rights training for the Indonesian defence forces.
As regional countries develop national human rights institutions and other mechanisms for the promotion of human rights, opportunities will emerge for Australia to consider ways of building on these efforts.
Recommendation 16
The Australian Government consider evaluating the capacity of ASEAN and the ARF to play a role in the promotion and protection of human rights in the region, and where appropriate, advocate the assumption of such a role by those institutions.
Thailand has in the past advocated the establishment of an ASEAN Human Rights Commission, and the Australian Government will take appropriate opportunities to encourage such a development, although it is not of course a member of ASEAN. Ultimately, that step depends on ASEAN consensus and would seem to be a longer term prospect.
Australia attends meetings of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a body created to promote regional security dialogue and cooperation. The Government will continue to raise human rights issues from time to time in the ARF, when they can be related to regional security and stability. For example, at ARF Ministerial Meetings, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, has stressed the importance of political reform in Burma and the need for a comprehensive and negotiated settlement between the Government of Burma and opposition groups. Some of the confidence building measures agreed to or being considered by the ARF, such as activities in the area of international humanitarian law and small arms, will also indirectly support the promotion and protection of human rights in the region.
The Government believes that the strengthening of regional co-operation among national human rights institutions will provide an important building block in the eventual establishment of a regional human rights mechanism. The Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, established in Darwin in 1996, is making steady progress in this regard. The Forum currently has six members, including the human rights commissions of Indonesia and the Philippines. Thailand, Fiji, the Republic of Korea and Malaysia are actively engaged in the establishment of a human rights commission and the Australian Government has encouraged Burma to establish an independent commission.
Recommendation 17
The Australian Government review the procedures in place for complying with reporting obligations under international treaties and take steps to ensure that those obligations are met in as timely and complete a manner as possible.
While fully up to date with its reporting obligations under most human rights (and ILO) treaties, there have been delays in preparing some reports in recent years. The Government is working towards meeting dead-lines in the future, but in doing so it does not want to compromise the high standards it adopts with respect to the preparation of reports. This involves extensive consultations with State and Territory governments as well as discussions with NGOs and other relevant interest groups.
Many other countries have experienced difficulties in meeting reporting deadlines. Indeed the UN has recognised that treaty-reporting obligations place 
 burdens not only on parties to the treaties but also upon the treaty committees, all of which have a considerable backlog of reports to consider. A report on the reform of the treaty body system by the Australian academic (and former Chairman of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Professor Philip Alston makes several recommendations to render the process more efficient and effective. Australia strongly supports treaty body reform, including reform of the reporting process, and Australian delegations are pursuing this objective in relevant forums.
Recommendation 18
The Australian Government examine the possibility of enacting legislation to prohibit the engagement of Australians or Australian companies in exploitative child labour in other countries, and the import into Australia of goods made by exploitative child labour.
Enacting domestic legislation to combat exploitative child labour in other countries and to control imports of goods allegedly produced by child labour is considered by the Government to be an ineffective means of tackling the problem. This view is based on the fact that these problems occur outside Australia's jurisdiction and the fear that such enactment would work to the detriment of children by driving the problem underground and forcing children into even more harmful situations. This concern is also supported by the conclusion of the ILO Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards (1995). Import bans specifically targeted towards child labour, under existing Customs regulations, are considered similarly ineffective given the scarcity of accurate and reliable information and evidence.
As noted below, (Recommendation 20) the Government has strongly supported the development by the International Labour Conference of new international labour standards addressing exploitative child labour and has been active in the negotiations on the texts. These instruments were adopted in June 1999.
The Government believes the most effective remedies for exploitative child labour practices must be focused on root causes—primarily poverty and lack of education. This is most effectively achieved through broad based bilateral development assistance complemented by multilateral efforts which the Government will continue to pursue through its overseas aid program. In the meantime, the Government welcomes and supports voluntary corporate and consumer initiatives which endeavour to increase public awareness of exploitative child labour practices.
Recommendation 19
The Australian Government review the role of APEC in respect of social and human development, 
 and Australia's participation in that role, with a view to raising in that forum the issue of human rights for workers.
Australian ministers, including the Prime Minister, raise human rights issues where appropriate in relevant bilateral discussions in the margins of the APEC meetings. However the Government does not consider APEC itself to be an appropriate forum in which to raise human rights issues. It has an economic mandate focusing on trade and investment liberalisation, business facilitation, and economic and technical cooperation.
Australia's view is that the ILO is the most appropriate forum for discussion of labour issues, and that the ILO's mandate and authority should not be diluted or duplicated in other forums. The ILO is tripartite in structure (with employer and worker representatives having equal representation and voting rights to government representatives), and thus provides a formal role in an international forum for workers.
The application of core ILO standards is already being comprehensively supervised by the ILO (the ILO actively promotes ratification of its relevant Conventions, and members are asked to report on their implementation). Employer and worker organisations are invited to contribute to this reporting process, which was enshrined by the adoption of a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up in June 1998 by the ILO. The Government strongly supported the adoption of the Declaration, and played an important role in ensuring that countries in the Asian region were able to support the proposed text.
Recommendation 20
The Australian Government review its participation in the International Labour Organisation, with a view to enhancing its support for the Organisation, particularly in its work on child labour.
The Government already strongly supports the ILO. Mr Peter Reith, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, stated in response to a question without notice in Parliament on 2 May 1996:
""The Government will, of course, retain its membership of the ILO. Australia has been a member of the ILO for many years. We have played a constructive role in the past; we will play a constructive role in the future. . . [however] against that background, the Government is grappling with a significant problem in respect of the budget.""
It was in the light of budgetary constraints that the cutbacks referred to by the ACTU (reflected in paragraph 6.71 of the JSCFADT report) were undertaken. The Government still plays an appropriately active role in the ILO, albeit a lower-key one than was previously the case. Australia pays its 
 assessed contribution to the ILO promptly, which is appreciated by the ILO. Australia's 1999 contribution was assessed at SF 4.87 million ($A5.8 million paid in January 1999), which compares to SF4.93 million ($A5.3 million) for 1998. Australia pays 1.46% of the ILO's budget, and is the 12th highest contributor.Australia meets its ILO constitutional obligations, including reporting regularly on the application and implementation of ratified conventions and unratified instruments; and tabling the texts of new instruments in Parliament together with a report on action proposed to be taken in relation to the new instruments. Also in accordance with the ILO Constitution, the Government funds a delegation of government, employer and worker representatives to attend each session of the annual International Labour Conference in Geneva. At the Conference, the Government has actively participated in the development and adoption of new international labour standards, and will continue to do so. In 1998, government delegates played an important role in obtaining support for a text which was acceptable to all parties for the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and its follow-up.
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business attended the 12th ILO Asian Regional Meeting in Bangkok from 9-11 December 1997, together with a delegation of government, employer and worker representatives. The meeting discussed ILO activities for the region for the following three to five years.
With regard to work being carried out by the ILO to develop new international labour standards addressing exploitative child labour, the annual International Labour Conference held a first discussion on the subject in June 1998 and adopted new instruments in June 1999. The Government has strongly supported the development of these new standards and has actively participated in negotiations of the texts.
Since 1992 the ILO has mounted a major offensive against child labour through its International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) by assisting member States in the implementation of national policy and programs to solve child labour problems. Following an earlier payment of US$50,000 in 1995, the Government, through AusAID, contributed a further $US50,000 to IPEC, funding a pilot project on bonded child labour in Nepal.
Recommendation 21
The Australian Government pursue the ratification of international instruments as a major objective of its human rights policy in the region and, in implementing that policy, provide relevant assistance in the form of expertise, grants and education, to those countries that seek to ratify and comply with those instruments.
The Government takes opportunities to urge regional governments to sign and ratify human rights instruments. For example, in the context of Australia's human rights dialogue with China, the Government has encouraged China to sign and ratify the two international human rights covenants. Australia is also an active participant in the annual UN-sponsored Workshops on Regional Arrangements in the Asia-Pacific which places a strong emphasis on treaty ratification.
The Government encouraged and welcomed Indonesia's publication of its National Action Plan, including its timetable for the signature and ratification of major human rights instruments. Indonesia's existing and projected treaty commitments will generate significant reporting responsibilities, and Australia has recently provided practical assistance in meeting that challenge. Two government-funded organisations, the Australia-Indonesia Institute and the Centre for Democratic Institutions cooperated in conducting a training course on treaty implementation, held in Jakarta in November/December 1998. About thirty Indonesians participated, mostly from ministries with responsibility for the process of drafting reports.
The CDI is planning similar courses in Bangkok, Manila and in the Pacific. These courses will assist countries considering ratification of treaties by providing training on international reporting requirements and domestic implementation obligations.
As part of the current focus on governance as one of five priority sectors of the development cooperation program, Australia stands ready to assist developing countries in their efforts to sign and ratify international human rights instruments. Opportunities for specific activities will be considered in the context of Australia's partnership approach to development cooperation, taking into account the specific needs of each partner country. The program is already funding activities to assist the establishment and development of national human rights institutions in the region and the work of these institutions will provide a stimulus to treaty ratification.
Recommendation 22
The Australian Government review its National Action Plan on human rights with the aims of auditing implementation of the Plan and establishing means by which Australia may assist and encourage other states in the region to draft and implement National Action Plans.
On 9 December 1998 the Government announced its intention to revise Australia's National Action Plan on Human Rights. This revision has now begun, including the process of consultations. The new Plan is being developed by relevant Commonwealth Government departments and agencies, in 
 consultation with a wide range of interest groups including State and Territory Governments; the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; and non-governmental organisations.
The Government has encouraged and will continue to encourage other countries to develop National Action Plans, as it believes that such Plans can constitute a natural first step towards national capacity development in the field of human rights, as well as a valuable ""check and balance"" list for governments. Last year, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made available resources for the implementation of a technical cooperation program for interested States in the Asia-Pacific region. Part of the program focuses on national action plans (the program was presented as a menu from which interested countries would be able to choose items of relevance to their needs). Australia will continue to encourage States in the region to make full use of the program, including in relation to the development of National Action Plans. Specific requests from developing countries in the region for assistance in drafting and/or implementing National Action Plans will be considered under Australia's development cooperation program.
Recommendation 23
The Australian Government both initiate its own proposals and give favourable consideration to outside proposals that accord with the United Nations guidelines and recommendations to mark the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
A number of special events were arranged to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) hosted a National Human Rights Conference on 8-10 December in Sydney with the theme ""Human Rights, Human Values: What do we think now?"". The Conference was addressed by both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General, as well as other Australian and foreign speakers, including Marzuki Darusman, Chairman of the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights and Sir Anthony Mason, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia.
In his speech, Mr Downer announced a series of government initiatives which will make further substantial contributions to the promotion and protection of human rights. These include guidelines to provide a clear and practical framework for supporting human rights activities through our aid contributions (see response to Recommendation 4); a revision of Australia's National Action Plan on Human Rights (see response to Recommendation 22); and a five-fold increase in the Human Rights 
 Fund for 1998-99 compared with last year. Australia also provided $50,000 for the Assisting Communities Together (ACT) project developed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to mark the occasion.
Australia Post issued a commemorative stamp on 22 October 1998 to mark the Anniversary. Displays of material about the Universal Declaration were featured in the reception areas of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department during the Anniversary week. DFAT also produced a new edition of its Human Rights Manual. The Manual (first published in 1993) aims to foster a deeper understanding of human rights among government officials, particularly those who handle human rights as a part of their daily responsibilities either in Canberra or at overseas posts. An electronic version of the Manual can be found on the Department's human rights homepage at www.dfat.gov.au/hr/.
The Government welcomes the opportunity provided by the United Nations Decade of Human Rights Education to underline the fundamental importance of human rights education as a valuable tool for protecting and promoting human rights. A contact group of government agencies, including the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, and non-governmental organisations, has been considering for some time ways for Australia to respond to the Decade, including through the establishment of a National Committee on Human Rights Education. The idea of a National Committee, to develop a ""National Plan of Action"" for Australia, was first put forward by the Australian Forum of Human Rights Organisations. The proposal was endorsed by both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General, and on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the UDHR, the Attorney-General announced the selection of Dr Eric Tan (currently the Managing Director of Medical Corporation Australasia Ltd) as chairman of the National Committee. To assist in launching the Committee, the Government also provided $10,000 as ""seed funding"". This funding will give the Committee the support it needs to undertake the promotional work necessary to attract funding from other sources, including the business sector. Dr Tan has been focusing on the membership of the Committee and institutional linkages in his initial work. As a result, a number of prominent Australians have agreed to serve on the National Committee or as Expert Advisers to it.
Consideration will also be given to proposals to mark the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education under AusAID's development education and public information program. This program aims 
 to educate Australian school children and build an Australian constituency to promote development cooperation in developing countries.
Recommendation 24
The Australian Government ensure that the mandate for the Centre for Democratic Institutions allows for the establishment and maintenance of a focus on human rights generally, and dialogue on human rights in particular.
The objective of the CDI is to assist the development and strengthening of democratic institutions in developing countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. To achieve this objective, the CDI will respond to the needs of developing countries in the field of good governance, and human rights will be addressed within that context. Many of the activities carried out or being planned by the CDI have a specific human rights focus, including a Human Rights Treaty Implementation course conducted in Jakarta and similar courses planned for Bangkok, Manila and in the Pacific.
Recommendation 25
The Australian Government give consideration to the appointment of an Ambassador for Human Rights with responsibility, among other things, for the development of policy and programs on the promotion and protection of human rights.
There are precedents for appointing Ambassadors in particular fields where an operational need has required it. In the human rights arena, the Government is satisfied that existing arrangements are working well. Australia is represented at a senior level at key multilateral meetings and our posts in Geneva and New York devote considerable attention to human rights forums and issues. Diplomatic missions around the world report extensively on human rights issues and make representations as required. Australian Heads of Mission often make use of their high level contacts and their knowledge of the country to discuss issues of particular concern with their host governments. Likewise in Canberra, including in AusAID, senior officers are closely involved in policy formation and program development and have regular liaison with NGOs. The Government does not anticipate a need to alter these arrangements for as long as they continue to work well.
Recommendation 26
The Australian Government review its relationship with non-government organisations involved in human rights, including matters such as the adequacy of funding, and the degree of consultations and participation it offers.
The Government recognises and strongly supports the role of civil society in the promotion and protection of human rights. 

Under current consultative arrangements, DFAT and AusAID officials hold twice yearly consultations with NGOs involved in human rights issues. The consultations last for one and a half days each and approximately 45 NGOs participate, discussing a range of issues with the Government and each other. As part of the consultations held in February 1999, an extra day was provided for additional discussions between NGOs and AusAID officials, to explore options for implementing the six framework principles for human rights in the aid program announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 2 December 1998 (see response to Recommendation 4).
More broadly, AusAID and relevant NGOs consult through the Committee for Development Cooperation on policy and program issues. AusAID is currently developing a Policy Statement that will provide a new framework for the working relationship between the Government and NGOs in the development cooperation field. The aim is to foster a relationship that is as beneficial as possible for both parties and facilitates and promotes the best possible human rights outcomes in developing countries. The policy will reiterate the Government's view of NGOs as valuable development partners, and the importance of NGO participation in the aid program.
A range of contacts between government officials and NGOs, including on the preparation of treaty reports, occur on an ad hoc basis and constitute valued input into government human rights activities.
Other departments also consult NGOs with an interest in human rights questions. The Attorney-General's NGO Forum is a regular meeting allowing information exchange, and discussion of domestic human rights issues and developments, including Australia's treaty reports. The Forum first met in 1996 and subsequently on four other occasions.
On the question of funding, AusAID provides grants and project funding to Australian NGOs that meet the criteria for accreditation with AusAID. Funds are provided for a wide range of activities, implemented by Australian NGOs in partnership with community-based organisations in developing countries. These include activities aimed at promoting human rights and strengthening civil society. The AusAID-NGO Cooperation Program provides accredited NGOs with considerable flexibility to identify development activities for AusAID matching funding. In 1998/99 the Program allocated around $23 million for Australian NGO activities, while total AusAID funding for Australian, international and indigenous NGOs for the same period is almost $103 million. 

Recommendation 27
The Australian Government convene discussions with NGOs and the corporate sector with a view to establishing agreement on a co-operative approach to the promotion and protection on human rights, including the developing of voluntary codes of conduct for the protection of human rights.
As noted immediately above, regular discussions between government departments and NGOs permit an exchange of views on the means to promote and protect human rights.
On the question of voluntary codes of conduct, given that they will only be as effective as business and the community are willing to make them, the Government sees its role more in terms of responding to business and community initiatives rather than driving such a process. The Government notes that there is already a forum—the International Labour Affairs Committee (a sub-committee of the National Labour Consultative Council)—for Government, employers and employees to discuss labour issues.
—In accordance with the usual practice, I table a list of parliamentary committee reports to which the government has not responded within the prescribed period. The list has been circulated to honourable senators. With the concurrence of the Senate, the list will be incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The list read as follows—
PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE SENATE ON GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OUTSTANDING TO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REPORTS AS AT 30 JUNE 1999
PREFACE
This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a list of Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.
The practice of presenting this list to the Senate follows the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government 
 in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.
The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses  to  reports  of  the  Joint  Committee of Public  
 Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.
Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be implemented through the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates or scrutiny of annual reports.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I thank the secretariat for their assistance in the compilation of the report. I also wish to thank those people who participated in the hearing, particularly Senator Cook, Senator Margetts and Senator Lightfoot, who showed a particular interest in the inquiry.
The statement read as follows—
In May 1998, India and Pakistan each conducted a series of nuclear tests.
The Senate referred the matter of the tests and the Indian and Pakistani nuclear and ballistic missile programs to the Committee for consideration of their implications for regional and international security. The Committee was also required to consider the Australian Government's role in international efforts to constrain these programs.
The Committee received 46 written submissions during the inquiry and conducted hearings in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
India had refrained from nuclear testing since 1974. Although it had been on the brink of conducting nuclear tests in recent years, the timing of the Indian 1998 tests appears to have been determined largely by domestic political considerations. Although considerable international pressure was put on Pakistan not to follow India's lead, the Pakistani Government eventually succumbed to domestic political and security considerations.
The international community condemned the tests and urged both India and Pakistan to forsake the nuclear path and join the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. Many countries, including Australia, imposed a range of sanctions on both India and Pakistan.
Australia adopted a bipartisan approach to the South Asian nuclear tests, denouncing the tests in forceful terms. The Australian Government imposed a range of sanctions on India and Pakistan, including suspension of high-level bilateral dialogue, non-humanitarian aid and various defence relationships. In late 1998, the Government decided to reinstate high-level bilateral dialogue with India and Pakistan but to maintain the other sanctions in place.
The Committee received considerable evidence supporting the reinstatement of the defence advisers appointed to India and Pakistan and the bilateral defence educational and training programs, which had been suspended by the tests. The Committee recommends their reinstatement but not, for the time being, other defence-related measures.
The Indian nuclear program was established as a result of a perceived threat from China following a border war between the two countries in 1962 and China's detonation of a nuclear device in 1964. Over the last decade, relations between India and China had been improving, notwithstanding Indian perceptions of a Chinese encirclement of India and of Chinese assistance with Pakistan's nuclear, missile and conventional weapon programs. The Indian Defence Minister's anti-Chinese rhetoric prior to the tests and the tests themselves have not provoked any particular reaction from China. The state of the bilateral relationship does not therefore 
 give rise to any particular concerns about possible armed conflict between them.
On the other hand, relations between India and Pakistan have remained tense ever since Partition in 1947. This tension has resulted in three wars between the two states. Two were fought over Kashmir. In the third, India helped East Pakistan to separate from West Pakistan to become Bangladesh.
The enmity and deep divisions that characterise relations between India and Pakistan are not going to be resolved in the short term. The bitterness and political and social differences are too entrenched for that to happen. That is not to say, however, that some amelioration in the relationship cannot be achieved, provided that both sides are prepared to work towards that end. Kashmir is by no means the extent of the differences between the two states but it is a key issue.
Unfortunately, India and Pakistan cannot even agree on the modalities for negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir problem. India maintains that the dispute is a bilateral issue and has refused to accept any attempt at mediation by third parties, including the United Nations. Pakistan, on the other hand, has sought United Nations involvement in the negotiations. This basic disagreement epitomises the difficulties of reconciling differences between the two sides, especially when both territorial and religious issues are involved.
The hardened attitudes on both sides should not deter the international community from at least encouraging them to begin taking steps that might reduce tensions. It is noteworthy that a settlement was finally achieved in Northern Ireland in 1998 after decades of sectarian violence and bitterness.
Australia has played significant roles in multilateral economic and security matters over the last decade, and it should use that experience in discussions with India and Pakistan to try to achieve some reduction in tensions in South Asia and avert a security crisis.
Australia and the international community should also continue to urge India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty cannot enter into force until 44 specified states, including India and Pakistan, have ratified it. Both countries have indicated that they support the CTBT in principle.
When tensions run high, there is always the possibility of an incident occurring that might lead to an accidental, inadvertent or miscalculated use of nuclear weapons. The lessening of tensions is therefore a key objective for the international community. High tensions combined with relatively unsophisticated command and control systems, vulnerable nuclear capabilities and short distances to potential targets do not provide any margin for 
 error. Until the political climate between the two sides improves, it is important for measures to be taken to avoid the possibility of inadvertent use.
In discussions with the Indian and Pakistani Governments, Australia and the international community should stress the importance of keeping their nuclear weapons in a non-alert state and not have them deployed. Nuclear warheads should also be kept separate from delivery vehicles. These measures should go along way to minimise the accidental or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons.
In addition to the above measures, both India and Pakistan should re-assert commitments not to strike at each other's nuclear facilities.
At the time the NPT was negotiated, five states had declared their nuclear weapon capability but many others were nuclear weapon capable states, threshold states or interested in acquiring nuclear weapons. There was a widespread view that proliferation would increase the risk of accidental, inadvertent or miscalculated use of nuclear weapons as well as the risk of such weapons or fissile material getting into the hands of terrorists or rogue states. The NPT was designed to reduce those risks by stemming proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The non-nuclear weapon states agreed to waive their rights to acquire nuclear weapons on the basis that the nuclear weapon states undertook in good faith to move towards disarmament. Under Article VI of the NPT, the nuclear weapon states are already legally obliged to eliminate their nuclear weapons. The text of Article VI provides that:
Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.
Once the constraints of the cold War were removed, it was expected that the nuclear weapon states would keep faith with their commitments under the NPT. Although some movement towards disarmament has been recorded since the end of the Cold War, it has not been enough to satisfy many non-nuclear weapon states. This disenchantment with the performance of the nuclear weapon states has coalesced in the form of the New Agenda Coalition. The main goal of the Coalition is to negotiate a disarmament treaty, which is being resisted by the nuclear weapon states.
In view of its arms control and disarmament credentials and as an ally of the United States, the Committee believes Australia is well placed to play a creative role in nuclear weapon disarmament. It could play, for example, an innovative brokering type of role between the nuclear weapon states and the New Agenda Coalition as it did in negotiations 
 for the Chemical Weapons Convention and the CTBT. The growing dissatisfaction with the recent lack of progress cannot be ignored. Unless the nuclear weapon states continue to move discernibly towards nuclear disarmament to placate the many dissatisfied non-nuclear weapon states, the NPT itself may come under pressure.
The Committee believes that the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons made such a valuable contribution to the debate on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament that its report warrants further consideration. The lack of a timetable is the key point in the Report as it does not provide an unrealistic and unachievable commitment, which the nuclear weapon states could legitimately use as a basis for not supporting it.
While the nuclear weapon states are perceived by many non-nuclear weapon states as not acting in good faith towards nuclear disarmament, India and Pakistan are given an excuse for not disbanding their nuclear weapon programs. Notwithstanding the renunciation by most states of nuclear weapons for their security, insistence on the part of the five nuclear weapon states that nuclear weapons are still necessary for their security enables India and Pakistan to mount a similar case.
The Canberra Commission Report provides a framework for universal nuclear disarmament, including possessors of nuclear weapons that are not NPT nuclear weapon states. As all members of the NPT have made a commitment to universal nuclear disarmament, the formal adoption of the recommendations of the Canberra Commission by the United Nations General Assembly and the Conference on Disarmament is in line with that commitment. It would send a clear signal to all possessors of nuclear weapons that the international community wants all of them to dismantle their arsenals.
The Committee therefore recommends that the Australian Government seek formal adoption of the recommendations of the Canberra Commission through appropriate resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Conference on Disarmament.
Finally, I should like to thank all the people who contributed to the committee's inquiry, especially those who made submissions or provided other information and those who appeared at public hearings.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title>",Committees,24,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-30,"—I rise to speak to this motion. It has been a very interesting inquiry, and it took place over some time. Honourable senators will realise that the first and second Indian nuclear tests took place followed by the Pakistan nuclear test, so in a way the 
 reasons for the inquiry gathered momentum as the concern about the arms race within the South Asia region gathered momentum.
This foreign affairs committee provided an opportunity for senators from the various participating parties to listen to information that we do not normally have access to. There have been reports written in this parliament about Australia's relationship with India, and there have been reports about situations within Asia at various stages, but they tended to be about a particular country and its bilateral relationship with Australia, mostly trade related. But here we had a situation where, as a committee, we were forced to look at strategic issues within the region of South Asia. I do not want to speak for members of the committee on this issue but, for me, it was certainly a very educative experience to hear evidence that challenged many assumptions and the information put to the committee by our own Department of Foreign Affairs about the strategic issues, their importance and where Australia fitted in. It included the issues of whether or not the main concern for India was Pakistan, or whether India's concerns were about its position within the region—with China via Pakistan—given that both of those countries share borders with India and there are traditional issues in relation to security from both of those areas.
I would like to stop here and say that I believe the report was a very well researched report. There was a lot of work put into it and, because it did take over a certain amount of time, it was perhaps one of those occasions when the secretariat got a better chance to catch up and integrate a lot of that wide experience that was given to the committee from a very wide range of sources. So we got a very good report which started off with a good historical context in which to consider the relationship between India and Pakistan; India and other countries in South Asia, including China; and where Australia fitted into that.
It would not surprise honourable senators that I feel that the position of the committee could have been even stronger. My recommendation continues that Australia should be taking a much stronger role in relieving some 
 of the security tensions within the region. In the past I have talked about trade being an issue that sometimes creates tensions, but in this particular case I believe that we must not forget that the various security issues are interconnected. It might be that, for a range of reasons, India feel that they have been ignored by the international community. My personal opinion is that India took the very difficult step during the Cold War of being one of the few unaligned nations.
Though I think it is quite possible that India at times played off the Western alliance with the Eastern bloc—and that is a very difficult position to take—with the demise of the influence of the former Soviet Union, I believe that in some cases the way India is being treated these days is a bit of a payback. There is no other superpower like the Soviet Union to back up India and I think that some of the ways that India has been treated, considering how large an economy it is, how many people it has and how important it is for people to cite India as a market, has shown a kind of payback mentality; and I was very concerned about the ramifications of that.
Some people have suggested that India perhaps conducted nuclear testing to get a seat at the international table, but I have to say that, considering the level of public debate within India, the inquiry showed it was more than that. Whether or not we or other people in Australia consider that the security concerns of India are real, we have to at least concede that the perceptions of security concerns within India are definitely real, and obviously within Pakistan as well.
But there are other issues at play. I would like to see Australia playing a positive role in finding out more about the region instead of assuming we know everything and putting back resources into peace studies and into learning about South Asia, cultural studies and even language studies, and making sure we understand them. I am glad the committee has taken up those recommendations.
I would go further and say that part of the information that I have received over time, and which was presented to the committee, indicates that Australia could play a much 
 more positive role in the international disarmament fora. I know that the role Australia plays is often talked about, but I think we have a unique opportunity to take a positive role in the new agenda coalition—that is, the exciting new prospect of working towards global disarmament. I think perhaps of more concern is that there is a very real threat that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty might fail at the next negotiations.
Part of the reason for this potential failure is that there is great concern amongst either non-nuclear states or threshold states that it is a nuclear weapons club and that those who have them have no real intention of giving them up. We are well aware of the fact that various treaties, including the START treaty, have reduced some categories of nuclear weapons but at the same time those same nations have continued with subthreshold testing, and other forms of modelling, and have continued to develop new nuclear weapons. So they are not giving up their weapons. Some of the weapons have reached their use-by date and some are less than useful in the current security environment.
Quite frankly, a lot of the rest of the world is becoming very impatient and I think this is probably one of the greatest risks. I know that India, and I note from this report countries like Indonesia, have expressed a strong desire for those positive measures to be taken. I am not sure that Pakistan would sign up, I do not think anyone is. There are a lot of people who said we could not reach a more positive role in relation to the land mines convention and yet the force of conviction of so many ordinary people throughout the world has meant that we have progressed in this instance.
I would like to think that the best and most positive measure that we have seen in some time—that is, the middle powers initiative or the new agenda coalition—should be supported by Australia and the United Nations. Australia made, I guess, one step in the right direction: we abstained last time along with NATO, and that is significant as well. It is something that really can be achieved and I would like to think that it is something positive that can happen in the future.
As for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, I think we have to rethink our position. It has been considered that we ought to be taking more seriously pushing the rest of the world to take that intermediate step—that is, to implement the recommendations of the Canberra Commission. Everyone may recall the jostling on either side, like I could not believe, when the French nuclear testing was on for each of the two major parties to declare how much more antinuclear they were than the other or, perhaps, how much more anti-French nuclear testing they were than the other. But out of that came the concept of the Canberra Commission and that gave Australia quite a lot of credibility.
What we have got to do now, if we recall how enthusiastic both parties were about those issues at the time, is follow that through and make sure that even those intermediate steps are promoted in the international fora. We should also try to save the disarmament process and not just be comfortable with presenting and fighting for the views of the major nuclear powers, because that is not giving Australia as much credibility as it is assumed within this place.
As I said, I would very much like to thank the committee secretariat for the hard work that has been put in in presenting this report. I think it is a very important report. As I say, it is not one of those issues that is widely debated within this parliament but for me it was one of the more interesting committees of inquiry that I have been involved with, and I hope that it plays some part in moving us forward in regional security.

Over the last decade, relations between India and China had been improving, notwithstanding Indian perceptions of a Chinese encirclement of India and of Chinese assistance with Pakistan's nuclear, missile and conventional weapon programs. The Indian Defence Minister's anti-Chinese rhetoric prior to the tests and the tests themselves have not provoked any particular reaction from China. The state of the bilateral relationship does not therefore 
 give rise to any particular concerns about possible armed conflict between them.
On the other hand, relations between India and Pakistan have remained tense ever since Partition in 1947. This tension has resulted in three wars between the two states. Two were fought over Kashmir. In the third, India helped East Pakistan to separate from West Pakistan to become Bangladesh.
The enmity and deep divisions that characterise relations between India and Pakistan are not going to be resolved in the short term. The bitterness and political and social differences are too entrenched for that to happen. That is not to say, however, that some amelioration in the relationship cannot be achieved, provided that both sides are prepared to work towards that end. Kashmir is by no means the extent of the differences between the two states but it is a key issue.
Unfortunately, India and Pakistan cannot even agree on the modalities for negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir problem. India maintains that the dispute is a bilateral issue and has refused to accept any attempt at mediation by third parties, including the United Nations. Pakistan, on the other hand, has sought United Nations involvement in the negotiations. This basic disagreement epitomises the difficulties of reconciling differences between the two sides, especially when both territorial and religious issues are involved.
The hardened attitudes on both sides should not deter the international community from at least encouraging them to begin taking steps that might reduce tensions. It is noteworthy that a settlement was finally achieved in Northern Ireland in 1998 after decades of sectarian violence and bitterness.
Australia has played significant roles in multilateral economic and security matters over the last decade, and it should use that experience in discussions with India and Pakistan to try to achieve some reduction in tensions in South Asia and avert a security crisis.
Australia and the international community should also continue to urge India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty cannot enter into force until 44 specified states, including India and Pakistan, have ratified it. Both countries have indicated that they support the CTBT in principle.
When tensions run high, there is always the possibility of an incident occurring that might lead to an accidental, inadvertent or miscalculated use of nuclear weapons. The lessening of tensions is therefore a key objective for the international community. High tensions combined with relatively unsophisticated command and control systems, vulnerable nuclear capabilities and short distances to potential targets do not provide any margin for 
 error. Until the political climate between the two sides improves, it is important for measures to be taken to avoid the possibility of inadvertent use.
In discussions with the Indian and Pakistani Governments, Australia and the international community should stress the importance of keeping their nuclear weapons in a non-alert state and not have them deployed. Nuclear warheads should also be kept separate from delivery vehicles. These measures should go along way to minimise the accidental or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons.
In addition to the above measures, both India and Pakistan should re-assert commitments not to strike at each other's nuclear facilities.
At the time the NPT was negotiated, five states had declared their nuclear weapon capability but many others were nuclear weapon capable states, threshold states or interested in acquiring nuclear weapons. There was a widespread view that proliferation would increase the risk of accidental, inadvertent or miscalculated use of nuclear weapons as well as the risk of such weapons or fissile material getting into the hands of terrorists or rogue states. The NPT was designed to reduce those risks by stemming proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The non-nuclear weapon states agreed to waive their rights to acquire nuclear weapons on the basis that the nuclear weapon states undertook in good faith to move towards disarmament. Under Article VI of the NPT, the nuclear weapon states are already legally obliged to eliminate their nuclear weapons. The text of Article VI provides that:
Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.
Once the constraints of the cold War were removed, it was expected that the nuclear weapon states would keep faith with their commitments under the NPT. Although some movement towards disarmament has been recorded since the end of the Cold War, it has not been enough to satisfy many non-nuclear weapon states. This disenchantment with the performance of the nuclear weapon states has coalesced in the form of the New Agenda Coalition. The main goal of the Coalition is to negotiate a disarmament treaty, which is being resisted by the nuclear weapon states.
In view of its arms control and disarmament credentials and as an ally of the United States, the Committee believes Australia is well placed to play a creative role in nuclear weapon disarmament. It could play, for example, an innovative brokering type of role between the nuclear weapon states and the New Agenda Coalition as it did in negotiations 
 for the Chemical Weapons Convention and the CTBT. The growing dissatisfaction with the recent lack of progress cannot be ignored. Unless the nuclear weapon states continue to move discernibly towards nuclear disarmament to placate the many dissatisfied non-nuclear weapon states, the NPT itself may come under pressure.
The Committee believes that the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons made such a valuable contribution to the debate on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament that its report warrants further consideration. The lack of a timetable is the key point in the Report as it does not provide an unrealistic and unachievable commitment, which the nuclear weapon states could legitimately use as a basis for not supporting it.
While the nuclear weapon states are perceived by many non-nuclear weapon states as not acting in good faith towards nuclear disarmament, India and Pakistan are given an excuse for not disbanding their nuclear weapon programs. Notwithstanding the renunciation by most states of nuclear weapons for their security, insistence on the part of the five nuclear weapon states that nuclear weapons are still necessary for their security enables India and Pakistan to mount a similar case.
The Canberra Commission Report provides a framework for universal nuclear disarmament, including possessors of nuclear weapons that are not NPT nuclear weapon states. As all members of the NPT have made a commitment to universal nuclear disarmament, the formal adoption of the recommendations of the Canberra Commission by the United Nations General Assembly and the Conference on Disarmament is in line with that commitment. It would send a clear signal to all possessors of nuclear weapons that the international community wants all of them to dismantle their arsenals.
The Committee therefore recommends that the Australian Government seek formal adoption of the recommendations of the Canberra Commission through appropriate resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Conference on Disarmament.
Finally, I should like to thank all the people who contributed to the committee's inquiry, especially those who made submissions or provided other information and those who appeared at public hearings.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,24,2
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-30,"—I rise to speak to this motion. It has been a very interesting inquiry, and it took place over some time. Honourable senators will realise that the first and second Indian nuclear tests took place followed by the Pakistan nuclear test, so in a way the 
 reasons for the inquiry gathered momentum as the concern about the arms race within the South Asia region gathered momentum.
This foreign affairs committee provided an opportunity for senators from the various participating parties to listen to information that we do not normally have access to. There have been reports written in this parliament about Australia's relationship with India, and there have been reports about situations within Asia at various stages, but they tended to be about a particular country and its bilateral relationship with Australia, mostly trade related. But here we had a situation where, as a committee, we were forced to look at strategic issues within the region of South Asia. I do not want to speak for members of the committee on this issue but, for me, it was certainly a very educative experience to hear evidence that challenged many assumptions and the information put to the committee by our own Department of Foreign Affairs about the strategic issues, their importance and where Australia fitted in. It included the issues of whether or not the main concern for India was Pakistan, or whether India's concerns were about its position within the region—with China via Pakistan—given that both of those countries share borders with India and there are traditional issues in relation to security from both of those areas.
I would like to stop here and say that I believe the report was a very well researched report. There was a lot of work put into it and, because it did take over a certain amount of time, it was perhaps one of those occasions when the secretariat got a better chance to catch up and integrate a lot of that wide experience that was given to the committee from a very wide range of sources. So we got a very good report which started off with a good historical context in which to consider the relationship between India and Pakistan; India and other countries in South Asia, including China; and where Australia fitted into that.
It would not surprise honourable senators that I feel that the position of the committee could have been even stronger. My recommendation continues that Australia should be taking a much stronger role in relieving some 
 of the security tensions within the region. In the past I have talked about trade being an issue that sometimes creates tensions, but in this particular case I believe that we must not forget that the various security issues are interconnected. It might be that, for a range of reasons, India feel that they have been ignored by the international community. My personal opinion is that India took the very difficult step during the Cold War of being one of the few unaligned nations.
Though I think it is quite possible that India at times played off the Western alliance with the Eastern bloc—and that is a very difficult position to take—with the demise of the influence of the former Soviet Union, I believe that in some cases the way India is being treated these days is a bit of a payback. There is no other superpower like the Soviet Union to back up India and I think that some of the ways that India has been treated, considering how large an economy it is, how many people it has and how important it is for people to cite India as a market, has shown a kind of payback mentality; and I was very concerned about the ramifications of that.
Some people have suggested that India perhaps conducted nuclear testing to get a seat at the international table, but I have to say that, considering the level of public debate within India, the inquiry showed it was more than that. Whether or not we or other people in Australia consider that the security concerns of India are real, we have to at least concede that the perceptions of security concerns within India are definitely real, and obviously within Pakistan as well.
But there are other issues at play. I would like to see Australia playing a positive role in finding out more about the region instead of assuming we know everything and putting back resources into peace studies and into learning about South Asia, cultural studies and even language studies, and making sure we understand them. I am glad the committee has taken up those recommendations.
I would go further and say that part of the information that I have received over time, and which was presented to the committee, indicates that Australia could play a much 
 more positive role in the international disarmament fora. I know that the role Australia plays is often talked about, but I think we have a unique opportunity to take a positive role in the new agenda coalition—that is, the exciting new prospect of working towards global disarmament. I think perhaps of more concern is that there is a very real threat that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty might fail at the next negotiations.
Part of the reason for this potential failure is that there is great concern amongst either non-nuclear states or threshold states that it is a nuclear weapons club and that those who have them have no real intention of giving them up. We are well aware of the fact that various treaties, including the START treaty, have reduced some categories of nuclear weapons but at the same time those same nations have continued with subthreshold testing, and other forms of modelling, and have continued to develop new nuclear weapons. So they are not giving up their weapons. Some of the weapons have reached their use-by date and some are less than useful in the current security environment.
Quite frankly, a lot of the rest of the world is becoming very impatient and I think this is probably one of the greatest risks. I know that India, and I note from this report countries like Indonesia, have expressed a strong desire for those positive measures to be taken. I am not sure that Pakistan would sign up, I do not think anyone is. There are a lot of people who said we could not reach a more positive role in relation to the land mines convention and yet the force of conviction of so many ordinary people throughout the world has meant that we have progressed in this instance.
I would like to think that the best and most positive measure that we have seen in some time—that is, the middle powers initiative or the new agenda coalition—should be supported by Australia and the United Nations. Australia made, I guess, one step in the right direction: we abstained last time along with NATO, and that is significant as well. It is something that really can be achieved and I would like to think that it is something positive that can happen in the future.
As for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, I think we have to rethink our position. It has been considered that we ought to be taking more seriously pushing the rest of the world to take that intermediate step—that is, to implement the recommendations of the Canberra Commission. Everyone may recall the jostling on either side, like I could not believe, when the French nuclear testing was on for each of the two major parties to declare how much more antinuclear they were than the other or, perhaps, how much more anti-French nuclear testing they were than the other. But out of that came the concept of the Canberra Commission and that gave Australia quite a lot of credibility.
What we have got to do now, if we recall how enthusiastic both parties were about those issues at the time, is follow that through and make sure that even those intermediate steps are promoted in the international fora. We should also try to save the disarmament process and not just be comfortable with presenting and fighting for the views of the major nuclear powers, because that is not giving Australia as much credibility as it is assumed within this place.
As I said, I would very much like to thank the committee secretariat for the hard work that has been put in in presenting this report. I think it is a very important report. As I say, it is not one of those issues that is widely debated within this parliament but for me it was one of the more interesting committees of inquiry that I have been involved with, and I hope that it plays some part in moving us forward in regional security.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-30,"—I join my colleague Senator Margetts in opposing this Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 [1999] . As the Senate knows from previous debate, it is legislation to remove from illegal immigrants to Australia their access to information about their legal rights. It means that even the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Ombudsman, who have been able to previously give written advice, at least, to such people on Australian soil, will be prevented by this bill from doing so. What we have here is a cheating of people's right to knowledge. Not only is it cheating people—who are, in the main, in pretty desperate individual circumstances—on Australian soil of their ability to find out what their legal rights are but also it is a blocking, by law, of anybody else who goes to their assistance. This is a deliberate attempt through legislation to say that such people are not recognised as human beings in the international community. It is a deliberate effort against international law to say that there will be people on Australian soil who are going to be deprived of a basic right: their right to know what their legal rights are.
It is an extraordinary piece of legislation. It would be very appropriate in the former Soviet Union where people were routinely denied their rights as citizens and where hapless people trespassing into the wrong territory not only were denied their rights but also were summarily convicted without having a say. That is the consequence here. Such people will be expelled even if, had they been able to assert their rights and have a say, they could have been classified, for example, as refugees. An earlier speaker, perhaps Senator Margetts, pointed to the example of the arrival of 84 Chinese people in Australia in November 1994 in a boat. They were given legal assistance at the last minute and 32 of them were found to be refugees and were given refugee status here.
What this legislation aims to do is to turn a deliberate blind eye to such people seeking asylum from where they came from. We are going to deliberately deny them the opportunity of their legal right to explain their case for not being returned. This will lead to yet more harrowing cases of people being treated badly after they leave Australian shores, not just because their case was not assessed correctly or because the facts of their case were not properly understood or even because they were not listened to, but because—through the passage of this legislation through the parliament, backed by the big parties—they were deliberately denied their legal rights to know what those rights were and to have their day before a fair arbitration system. Be that on the heads of those people who are putting this bill through here today. We can only object, and we object not just because we have some minor disagreement with this piece of legislation but because it is fundamentally wrong. It is fundamentally against those charters of rights of human beings which have been built up over the years and which are internationally recognised.
It is a sad day when we see Australia doing this for a political motive, no doubt, which even has strong popular backing. But if we do not stand for the right of law and for people's rights, whomever they might be, and for international law in this parliament, who is going to? It is not too precious a thing to ask 
 how far this process of legislators deliberately denying people access to their rights may go. Where will the line be drawn?
It is a pretty sad day for the Australian legislature when the Greens and Democrats are left here to take this legislation on and to stand up for the rights that are involved. Put the people aside for a moment, if we must—though we Greens certainly would not do that in any decision on what to do here—and let us look at the rights that are involved. Here we are legislating away a fundamental right built up over centuries of common law: the right of people to be informed of their rights and to have access to legal assistance to ensure that those rights are given a fair day in the legal system of this country. So it is not just the specific legislation I object to, it is the process. It is the erosion of rights and the failure to defend rights to the last person, which means we do not know which lot of people may be picked off next for which lot of excuses next time.
There are other ways that the approach to knocking boat people out of Australia could be made. There are other more direct and honest approaches that could be made, if that is what this legislature wants to do. But to do it by a backdoor erosion of people's rights and a denial of rights is a very dangerous thing to do. I note that Desmond Manderson of Macquarie University, in an opinion piece in the Age two years ago, said:
A right about which people are ignorant is meaningless. A door without a key is a wall.
Let me follow that up by saying that where you build a wall against the rights of a tiny minority, you are threatening to build a wall against the rights of bigger minorities, and who knows where that trend will finish. This legislation is wrong. It is a violation of the tenets of international law. It is the wrong approach to what is no doubt a problem worrying all Australians. It is the wrong way to go about it. It is covert; it is cheating through legislation. It is just a legislative cheat.
Those who are supporting this will live to rue the day they began on this course. I suspect that before long we are going to see more draconian stuff than this in this place, built upon this piece of legislation and a 
 couple of pieces which have gone before. It worries me a great deal. The people who have devised this method of dealing with boat people coming to this country ought to have thought about the ramifications of it. It is not the right way to be dealing with this problem. It is the wrong way to go.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-06-30,"—I thank Senators McKiernan, Bartlett, Margetts, Cooney and Brown for their contributions. I also want to say that I appreciate the Democrats' cooperation, because I know Senator Woodley was hoping to speak on this bill but in order to facilitate the bill he has withdrawn. I express the government's appreciation for that. I remind honourable senators that this bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in December last year and the committee tabled its report on 21 April 1999. The committee recommended that the bill stand as printed but that the government consider amending the explanatory memorandum to clarify the government's intention.
The government has responded to the committee's recommendations by appropriately amending the explanatory memorandum. The replacement explanatory memorandum was circulated to all senators by the Table Office some time ago and I tabled a copy in the chamber earlier today. I realise that Senator McKiernan thought that it had just been tabled, but I was very conscious that he was not taking the bill through at the time. I also foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments to the bill to strengthen offence provisions in the Migration Act dealing with the increasing problem of people trafficking.
Before concluding, I want to deal briefly with some of the comments and questions raised by Senator Cooney earlier today. First, Senator Cooney said that the minister's second reading speech denigrated certain people involved in the events of 1996. Senator Cooney and I mostly agree across the chamber on a lot of issues, but I think he has erred a little in reading too much into the 
 speech and has drawn inferences from certain passages in the speech which were never intended. A fair reading of the speech, much of which simply states the facts, does not support his view that it attacks the people he mentioned.
Senator Cooney also suggested that the minister's second reading speech attacked Justice Lindgren by implying that the judge failed to follow precedents set by the courts. I beg to differ with the good senator on that issue. All the paragraph to which Senator Cooney referred does is to set out the factual position on section 256. The judicial authorities to which that paragraph refers are, firstly, the full Federal Court in Wu Yu Fang v. Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 135 ALR 583, per Nicholson J, with whom Jenkinson J agreed at 627 ff, 633-634; and, secondly, Sackville J in Guo Wei Rong v. Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38, at 61.
Senator Cooney was very gracious in recognising my commitment to privacy issues over the years. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank Senator Cooney for his kind remarks and assure him that my commitment to that area remains strong. However, one always has to have balance and to balance out various rights. Senator Cooney implied that the amendment to the Telecommunications Interception Act might be another step towards some kind of Big Brother approach to law enforcement by this government. The amendments which I will shortly be moving simply reflect the serious nature of people trafficking. It has become more common. It is a relatively new phenomenon in this day and age, though it might have happened in the olden days, and a number of unscrupulous people are benefiting from those people who see themselves as in a desperate situation, often a desperate economic or social situation.
The criminal organisations behind this terrible trade are well organised. Apart from anything else, they are placing people at great risk by putting them on unseaworthy vessels and sending them to other countries, including Australia. The government acknowledge the support of the opposition in our determination 
 to give our police forces the tools they need to detect and prevent these crimes. We need to be able to pinpoint the people onshore who are facilitating these crimes and working in cooperation with the people smugglers offshore. This tool will strengthen Australia's ability to monitor and, hopefully, prevent some of the most dangerous criminal activities currently being pursued. We know that other sorts of smuggling often goes with people smuggling, including drug smuggling. For that reason, I believe this measure is appropriate. I commend the bill to the chamber.

The Prime Minister has provided an answer to the honourable Senator's question which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard .
The question of Victorian compliance with the National Agreement on Firearms was not discussed at the Premiers' Conference of 9 April.

On A Current Affair on  24 February 1999, I stated that I was interested in raising the drug problem at the Premiers' Conference but did not refer to raising firearms issues.
There has been an exchange of correspondence between the Victorian Premier and myself about the National Firearms Agreement, and it remains a matter for discussion between Victoria and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is awaiting an indication from Victoria that it will amend its firearms legislation to bring it fully into line with the National Agreement by repealing provisions widening access to semi-automatic (category C) 
 firearms. Until that is done, the Commonwealth will continue to take into account non-compliance with the National Firearms Agreement when considering requests for compensation.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Guns Buyback: Compensation</title>,Miscellaneous,33,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-06-30,"—This evening I rise to make some comments with respect to the report of the royal commission into the Longford gas plant disaster which occurred last year. As senators are aware, on 25 September last year a major explosion and fire occurred in Gas Plant 1 at the Longford gas plant. Two employees, Mr John Lowery and Mr Peter Wilson, tragically lost their lives in that disaster. Eight other employees were injured and massive disruption occurred to the lives of Victorian citizens and to businesses.
I rise to make these comments this evening because, firstly, as I am sure all senators are aware, I have a background as an official of the Australian Workers Union and as an employee of that union for over 18 years. During that time I was integrally involved in the oil industry and, on many occasions, I visited the Longford gas plant. Indeed, on a number of occasions I argued cases before the Industrial Relations Commission and negotiated with Esso over issues, including manning at that plant and at other plants including Long Island Point and the offshore installations.
Whilst we all hoped that the operations of those plants were safely carried out, there were occasions when the members of the union, the workers at those plants, expressed the view that manning levels were not adequate and that indeed the company's proposals to reduce manning could well give rise to safety concerns.
Like many Australians, I was therefore very distressed when I heard the news about the explosion at Longford. During the royal commission inquiry I refrained from making any public comment in this chamber or elsewhere because I believed that it was 
 appropriate for the royal commission to be able to conduct its inquiry free from any undue, unnecessary or improper influence. I have to say that now that the royal commission report has come down it is abundantly clear that the attitude adopted by the company, Esso, was nothing short of disgraceful. Esso's tactics were to endeavour to blame everyone else except themselves. In particular, in a most disgraceful attempt, they sought to blame one of the workers, an operator, Mr Jim Ward, for the disaster that day—a disaster that, as I said, claimed the lives of two of Mr Ward's work mates and injured eight others. They also sought to attribute some blame to another employee, a Mr Rawson.
I was pleased to be able to read this week, when the royal commission report came down, that Mr Ward has been completely exonerated. The royal commission has laid the blame squarely on Esso and, to an extent, on the Victorian government and the failures of the regulatory system to ensure an adequate safe working environment at the plant. I will quote briefly from summaries of the report contained in newspapers earlier this week, firstly from the Herald Sun:
The royal commission found Esso had not learned from a similar incident a month before the September 25 blast.
It found Esso failed to train its workers adequately, put in safe operating procedures and conduct crucial safety audits.
It said cost-cutting by Esso might have contributed to the disaster because of repeated delays to safety audits of the plant.
It goes on further:
Royal commission chairman Sir Daryl Dawson said it was design limitations of the plant, not inaction by workers, that caused the fire to worsen after the initial blast.
Then there is a direct quote from the judge, Sir Daryl Dawson:
""Their attempts to isolate the plant, rescue the injured and initiate fire suppression measures were not only wholly appropriate but, in view of the personal danger they faced, also heroic,"" he says in the report.
He states workers at the gas plant, plagued with problems on the morning of the blast, did not know of the dangers they faced. 

""Nor did those charged with the supervision of the operations have the necessary knowledge,"" the commission found.
This lack of knowledge was blamed directly on a deficiency in their training.
The royal commission concluded that the ultimate cause of the fire was the failure of Esso to equip its employees with appropriate knowledge to deal with events that occurred. It had failed to provide the necessary information in the form of appropriate operating procedures. It found that Esso breached the Occupational Health and Safety Act by failing to maintain a working environment safe and without risks to health. It found that the lack of knowledge of operators and supervisors was directly attributable to a deficiency in their initial or subsequent training. I just make the comment that, not only do plant operators in refineries and gas plants such as Longford have the duties of operating the plant, they also are the front-line fire crew in any emergency situation such as occurred at Longford on that fateful day.
I find it absolutely disgusting that any company, particularly a company such as Esso, should seek to avoid its responsibility by laying the blame for such a tragedy on its workers. Mr Ward has clearly been subjected to terrible stress during this inquiry. He stated:
To see two of your workmates get killed, to drag burnt bodies out of the fires and see those people now with their families struggling to recover and get over the physical trauma and the mental trauma . . . 
That alone was enough to try to cope with, then I had to defend myself in the royal commission from my own employer, who I've worked with for nearly 19 years.
To have them turn around and say things about me and to me that incriminated me with respect to killing my workmates and injuring my workmates—I don't know how I can describe it.
An apology would probably be a bit hollow at this stage.
It may be a bit hollow and certainly Mr Ward is entitled to feel the way he does. In their actions following this report Esso have again demonstrated their callous attitude. They are not even offering a semblance of an apology either to Mr Ward or to the many workers at 
 that plant. I conclude by saying that some years ago a book was written called The Other Price of Britain's Oil . It was written by a person called Kit Carson. He foretold in that book problems that would eventuate, particularly in the offshore oil industry in Britain, as a result of the failure by the then Thatcher government to properly allow and apply—in fact, the government prohibited them—the application of health and safety laws on the offshore platforms. In probably the worst tragedy in the history of the oil industry in the world in 1988 the Piper Alpha platform exploded in the North Sea and 167 workers lost their lives.
Clearly, there is a need for Esso and the Victorian government to apply themselves to improving the regulatory system in Victoria. It is not simply good enough to rely upon what is called the safety case system where companies themselves have a safety plan and they largely have the responsibility for implementing it. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that employers such as Esso do what they are required to do.
Finally, I pay a tribute to the Australian Workers Union and the other unions who have stood by these workers through that disaster. Particularly, I pass on my sympathy to the families of Mr Lowery and Mr Wilson, who perished in that tragedy. I acknowledge, as we all should, not only that they were innocent victims but that they indeed were heroes.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Longford Gas Plant Explosion</title>,Adjournment,34,1
