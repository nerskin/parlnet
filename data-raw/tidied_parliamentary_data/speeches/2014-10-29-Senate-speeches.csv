Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:32):  I would like to recap what is happening in this debate. Late last night, the government was ramming through laws that they say will make Australians safer. But we know that they involve a fundamental weakening of the rights and freedoms that make Australia one of the world's top democracies.


The government's approach to this bill has been rushed, and the bill is flawed. The Greens have said it, the country's top legal experts have been saying it and, as we saw yesterday, even the government-dominated Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has said it. Yesterday afternoon, Senator Smith, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, stood in this chamber and told the Senate that parts of this bill are likely to be incompatible with human rights. That was a unified position that the committee took. I am on the committee and I know that, for the committee, that is as strong as it gets: parts of this bill are likely to be incompatible with human rights. 


It is a damning review. The human rights committee has found the new declared area zones offence to be incompatible with human rights. Other parts of the bill have caused the committee to raise concerns about the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of movement, the right to freedom from arbitrary detention, the right to privacy and the right to a fair trial, as well as the right to a presumption of innocence. And yet this bill—if the government, aided by Labor and some of the crossbench, have their way—will pass this place in three short hours, by 12.30 pm today. In the committee stage of this debate, we can see there are still so many questions about how it will really affect people into the future and what the implications are.


Late last night, the Attorney-General was at pains to reassure us that the concerns raised about this bill by some of the country's top legal experts in the area of human rights and civil liberties—the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, the Law Council of Australia, the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, Human Rights Watch, Professor Ben Saul and the Human Rights Commission—should not worry us. But in the cold hard light of day, once again we have to remember and take stock of what this bill is seeking to do and, if passed, what it will do. It will change whether and where people in Australia travel; it will change the circumstances in which people can be detained and questioned by ASIO, customs and police; it will change the kind of personal information that is captured and stored at the airport; and the kind of public commentary or reflection on controversial issues that is legal. As we saw with the first tranche of national security legislation, it is simply too late to ponder the consequences and, in some cases, to rue them, once the legislation has been passed. I know that if this law is to be passed in haste we will regret it at leisure. Over time we will come to fully realise the freedoms we have traded away for a situation that many say will not actually make us safer.


Coming to the offence of advocating terrorism, this is a new offence where a person will be guilty of the offence if they intentionally counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence and the person is reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. It is a serious offence; it carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The Australian Greens' first amendment, item (12) on the sheet, substitutes 'an intention'—a fault element of intention—to commit the act for 'recklessness'. The Australian Greens say that this amendment is necessary because the offence of advocating terrorism in this bill duplicates and unnecessarily expands what are already-existing criminal offences which capture conduct or speech that advocates the commission of terrorist acts. For instance, there is already an offence on Australia's statute books to urge another person to engage in intergroup violence or violence against members of groups. There is already an offence to recruit others to join terrorist organisations or organisations engaging in hostile activities against foreign governments. There are already incitement offences which cover a person who urges the commission of an offence, such as a terrorist-related offence. It is already an offence to be a member of, or provide support to, a terrorist organisation. This Greens amendment seeks to tighten the scope of this new proposed offence to ensure that it will only apply to those who intend to cause another to engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. This amendment is needed because this serious criminal offence, as it is currently drafted, only requires a person to be reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence.


The legal commentators from whom we have sought advice, and whose position is similar to the position that the Australian Greens are taking in relation to this, are the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, the Law Council of Australia and Human Rights Watch. I have a question to put to the Attorney-General. It has been suggested that the new offence of advocating terrorism duplicates and unnecessarily expands existing criminal offence provisions, and contains terms that are so broadly defined that they will pose problems for prosecutors, as well as potentially encroaching on freedom of speech. Attorney-General, can you please explain, in clear terms, what the term 'promotes means in the context of this offence?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (09:39):  Let me respond to a few of the observations that have come from Senator Wright. First of all, Senator Wright, I wish you would not falsely claim that this legislation was rammed through the chamber last night. Each of the amendments—government, opposition, Green and Senator Leyonhjelm's—were dealt with by the chamber in an orthodox parliamentary debate, subject to no time limitation. There are time limitations in place later in the day, but last night's debate was not limited or circumscribed or foreshortened in anyway. You know that, Senator Wright, so why you would choose to say it was rammed through the chamber when in fact it proceeded in a routine, regular and orthodox parliamentary way I have no idea. Perhaps it is because you do not want to come to terms with the substance of the legislation that you make remarks like that.


Senator Wright, it is still not clear to me what your concern is. You seem to be saying in one breath that the problem with this new provision is that it duplicates existing law and therefore is unnecessary, and then in the very next breath you say it unnecessarily expands existing law and therefore takes the law beyond where it ought to be. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on the one hand that the provision is otiose because it merely restates what is already in the law and then in the next breath say the provision is dangerous because it takes the law too far beyond where it already is. It is not clear to me what your complaint is but, as I say, you cannot have it both ways.


The lacuna in the law that this provision seeks to fill is where the advocacy of terrorism is not caught by the existing law relating to the incitement of violence. That is the answer to your question. That is not merely my opinion; it is also the unanimous opinion of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which in its review of this bill observed—I am quoting from its report:


… the current incitement offence is not appropriate to capture the range of activity being encountered and investigated …


Senator Wright, I think you are a lawyer, are you not?




Senator Wright:
  I think you know I am, yes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I thought you were. So you would be aware that the existing criminal law of incitement to violence requires a very direct correlation between the words that constitute the incitement and the violent act. But when we are dealing with the advocacy of terrorism—terrorism, as you know, is a defined term in the act—the immediacy of that correlation which the existing criminal offence requires is not always there. It is not necessarily there. This legislation seeks to address that area where the existing offence of incitement of violence is not available to prosecutors. It does that by saying:


(1) A person commits an offence if:


(a) the person advocates:


   (i) the doing of a terrorist act; or


   (ii) the commission of a terrorism offence … and


(b) the person engages in that conduct reckless as to whether another person will:


   (i) engage in a terrorist act; or


   (ii) commit a terrorism offence …


A terrorism offence is one of the existing terrorism offences set in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code. 'Advocates' is a defined term. 'Advocates' is not a term of art. It is not a term with a particular technical legal meaning, so it is defined by subclause 2 of the proposed section in these terms:


… a person advocates the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence if the person counsels, promotes, encourages or urges the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence.


What those words, those synonyms, seek to capture is the essence of advocacy, the essence of advocacy being an attempt by language or other verbal forms to persuade someone to do something. The relevant event being caught here is 'the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence'. Now, Senator Wright, if you and your colleagues from the Greens party want to go out into the public space of Australia and say it should not be against the law to advocate the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence, you go right ahead, Senator Wright. But the government believe, the opposition believe as well and most of the crossbench senators to whom I have spoken also believe that it should not be lawful in this country to advocate the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence.


Lastly, Senator Wright, let me address what you said about freedom of speech. The Australian Greens having led the campaign against freedom of speech in the early part of this year, it seems to me, Senator Wright, that it is beyond bizarre that you would now be posing as a champion of freedom of speech. But, that being said, there is all the difference in the world between advocating the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence, and expressing an opinion, bearing in mind that terrorism is defined in terms of violence or causing fear, on the one hand, and expressing a point of view, on the other hand. There is not a word in this bill—not a word—that impinges upon or restricts freedom of opinion. If a person wants to express radical views, if they want to promote or proselytise a radical view of the world or a non-mainstream view of the world, they are perfectly free to do so.


What they are not free to do and what they should not be free to do is to advocate the commission of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence, because that goes beyond merely the expression of an opinion. What that involves is encouraging or promoting or urging other people—almost always vulnerable people, I might say, who are susceptible to the injunctions of these predators—to do harm or violence to innocent people and, indeed, in many cases, to themselves. If, Senator Wright, that is okay with you, then that is a matter between you and your conscience. But I think most of the Australian people would agree with the government that it ought not to be lawful in this country to do so.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:47):  Attorney-General, I will pick up on a couple of things you said. First of all, I think you are a lawyer; is that right? Is my memory serving me correctly that you are a lawyer too?



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WRIGHT:
  I did not start this, Senator Macdonald—so, a bit of respect, Senator Brandis. I do not think you would want to mislead either this chamber or the public who might be listening to this debate. First of all, let me make it really clear: at no time has this amendment sought to remove that provision. We are working with the bill that the government has drafted, but we are reflecting genuine and widespread concerns about the broad and risky potential of this offence to have unintended consequences for freedom of expression in Australia. 


At no point did I say in my comments earlier that we should remove the term 'advocates'. I specifically referred to the word 'promotes' and I asked you a specific question about how that would be defined—and I allow you as a lawyer to tell us what would in fact amount to 'promoting' under this bill so that people who are listening have some idea of the type of behaviour or speech they may not be able to be involved with if the bill is passed. 


I will say a couple of other things. One of them is that you quibbled with me about using the words 'ramming through' about these laws. Certainly, last night there was debate about various amendments that were being put up by the Australian Greens, by Senator Leyonhjelm and by the government. But the sad reality is that the time allowed for this debate has been truncated; there is a guillotine hanging over us—at 12.30. So, much as I would have liked to ask further questions about the amendments that were being moved last night, I had to be very careful, knowing that I had other, substantive matters to deal with today. That has been hanging over my head and, no doubt, over the heads of other people who might want to engage in the debate today. So that is why the Australian Greens say that there was no justifiable reason to have an arbitrary guillotine that allowed less than eight hours of debate in the Senate.


I will go to the question that I put to you, and I do not think I received an answer, because you went off to suggest that the Australian Greens somehow do not care about the safety of Australians and that we perhaps are not concerned about people who might be in the community advocating some form of violence against others in the form of terrorism. So I will come back to my question: can you please as a lawyer explain in clear terms what the term 'promotes' means in the context of this offence, given that 'promotes' is one of the words used to define the term 'advocating' or 'advocacy'.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:50):  Before the minister answers that, I have a similar question about definitions, and perhaps he could address both at the same time. I am wondering if the minister could indicate what the term 'reckless' means in the passage that he read out here.


Before I elaborate on that, could I say I am flabbergasted that Senator Wright should be complaining about guillotining bills and restricting debate when I sat through six years of dysfunctional government supported by Senator Wright and her party, when no fewer than 150 bills were guillotined, some of them very important bills, with not one word of debate, Senator Wright. Where was your holier-than-thou opposition at that time? You were part of it. You and your party were part of that disgraceful episode in Australian politics where important legislation was indeed rammed through with not one word of debate. For you to get up and say that two days of debate is restriction really shows the hypocrisy of the Greens political party.


I support the general thrust of the government's legislation. I just want to indicate to the minister that, whilst some people say this does perhaps have restrictions on things that we might have been able to do in the past, I am one of those—and I think I speak for the majority of Australians here—who are prepared to forgo just a little bit of the freedoms that I would otherwise have had if it means that I and my family and the people that I know, love and respect are a little safer in their daily events and lives.


This is a situation which the government and the majority of Australians have not created, but it is a real situation. We are, I guess, lucky—and perhaps you make your own luck here. We are well prepared and we have in place a number of agencies and facilities that allow us to stop these terrorist acts before they happen. But I think that, when I and all Australians—indeed, all citizens of the world—see again just what happened in Canada last week, we cannot help but think that could happen here.


I have to say that for years I have left my front door of my office in Parliament House open, because I always want my office to look like it is welcoming. If people want to pop in and see me, they do it. I have to say that in the last few weeks I have started to shut the door in case someone comes through.




Senator Leyonhjelm:
  Mr Chairman, on a point of order: Senator Macdonald is continuing the second reading debate. The issue before the chair currently is the amendment moved by the Greens. We are operating under a guillotine—a time limit—and I think it would be appropriate if we return to the matter at hand.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Chairman, on the point of order: if Senator Leyonhjelm is that concerned, perhaps he should have taken the same point of order on Senator Wright when she was giving what was clearly a second reading debate speech.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Leyonhjelm, I understand the point you are making, but it is not a point of order that I can rule on. I think the debate is still within the realms of the question before the Chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I will be brief. I am conscious of the need to deal with a lot of amendments from all sides and I do want the minister to explain to me how the term 'reckless' is defined and how it operates in this context. Senator Leyonhjelm is quite right: I did not take part in the second reading debate because I did not want to take 20 minutes as most contributing speakers did, therefore restricting others from the debate. I think it  is appropriate in dealing with Senator Wright's amendment to indicate my view generally on her amendment, on the amendments being proposed by the government and, indeed, the whole bill, which I hope will be passed as amended. I repeat that most Australians are prepared to forgo some of the rights we have had throughout our existence if it means that people who might otherwise be harmed or killed are protected in this country. 


Over the years I have had bits to do with ASIO, the Crimes Commission and the Australian Federal Police through the different committees I have been involved in. They do a magnificent job but they always abide by the rules—the rules that are passed by parliament. The people whom they are competing against—the organised crime, the terrorist cells, those who would harm Australians—never follow one rule. They do not worry about human rights or getting warrants or unlawful killings—all that just happens as a matter of course. We have to give our agencies the maximum powers that a democracy can possibly give them to enable them to fight—not for anything they might get out of it—to protect me, my family and all other Australians. I think it is essential that, within the constrained limits that the Attorney-General has spoken about and that do understand the way Australian democracy and freedoms work, we do have to give them maximum amount of powers. If that means giving up a little of what we always thought we had in the way of freedoms, then most Australians—I think I can speak for them—are prepared to forgo them in return for keeping themselves, their families and their loved ones safe.


Minister, in answering Senator Wright's question, I wonder if you could address the issue of how 'reckless' is interpreted.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. Senator Brandis? Senator Collins.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:57):  I thought it might be useful for the opposition to deal with our position before we go into what might be a more lengthy question-and-answer discussion. Senator Wright, we have reached the provisions in the bill that deal with the very important issue of advocating terrorism. During my second reading contribution and others from the Labor Party—we did have a rather limited second reading debate—I did not cover the full detail of Labor's concerns about this area to assist the committee stage consideration or, indeed, the amendments that we will be moving. I will do that when we come to our amendments, but in relation to this particular amendment (12) I should indicate, as I think Senator Brandis has already noted in his comments, that Labor supports a new offence for counselling or urging the commission of a terrorist act. We believe that it is right that this captures those whose reckless conduct leads to someone committing a terrorist act. This Green amendment would mean this offence goes no further than existing incitement crimes which would apply already where someone urges or counsels a terrorist act intending that act to be committed. Senator Wright, that is our specific concern in relation to your amendment (12).


On some broader issues, I understand that, like Senator Macdonald, Senator Dastyari did not have an opportunity to contribute to the second reading debate but also wants to highlight to the government some of the important issues around concerns in the community about how we need to get advocating terrorism right in this bill. I hope there will be some small scope in this committee consideration for Senator Dastyari to cover a few points for the opposition as well, appreciating the limited time that we have available.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:00):  I do not want to unduly delay consideration of this amendment, but I do want to place on the record that I will support Greens amendment (12) moved by Senator Wright. I will also support Greens amendment (13). I will support the Labor amendments along the same lines. The intention of each of those is to limit the scope of the bill in relation to advocating terrorism, with various attempts to bring it closer to the definition of 'incitement', which I think is the appropriate approach. The Attorney-General says that 'incitement' is not appropriate. I am not a lawyer, just to make things clear, but I do think that something close to 'incitement' is the appropriate definition for this. I do not intend to speak on these amendments again, but I will be supporting each of these amendments—those of Labor and the Greens—to bring the definition of 'advocating terrorism' to something that I think we can live with. 


I have to say that if it comes down to it I am probably an advocate of terrorism in terms of overthrowing the regime in North Korea and perhaps in Zimbabwe as well. We really are talking about specific circumstances in relation to this bill, yet the bill is not specific to those circumstances.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:01):  Let me deal with the questions that have been put to me by Senator Macdonald and Senator Wright. Senator Macdonald, you ask for a definition of 'recklessness'. I know, Senator Macdonald, that you are a lawyer and, from my recollection—because we have known each other for a very long time—a much respected lawyer in North Queensland before you turned your career to public service. So, Senator Macdonald, as you would be aware, recklessness is a term with a technical legal meaning as well as a common-speech meaning. The concept of recklessness involves doing something heedless as to the consequences of one's conduct. So it is something more serious than negligence but something less serious than intention, because it does not involve the element of volition but it does involve the element of doing something heedless of the consequences for others of your conduct.


It is given a reasonably architectural definition in division 5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which I might read, just to give you a complete answer. Section 5.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code defines recklessness in these terms: 


(1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if: 


(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 


(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 


(2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if: 


(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 


(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 


(3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 


Senator Macdonald, what we are dealing with here is recklessness in relation to the commission of a terrorist offence or performing a terrorist act. The way in which the provisions of section 5.4 of the Criminal Code would be attracted, particularly subsection (2), recklessness as to a result, could be seen in a case like this. 


Let it be said that somebody advocates the doing of a terrorist act. If, in their advocacy, they were aware that there was a substantial risk that that would occur—that is, the terrorist act they advocate—and, having regard to the circumstances known to them, it was unjustifiable to take that risk—that being a question of fact to be determined objectively by a jury—that is where the recklessness element would be satisfied, and that is what it means. So, to put flesh on the theoretical bones here, we have all seen instances—whether directly or on social media—of hate preachers advocating, and saying, particularly to young people, 'Go out and commit a terrorist act.' Now that is not the offence of incitement to violence, as I tried to explain to Senator Wright, because there is not the immediacy of the connection between the words and the act. But I think, Senator Macdonald, an experienced lawyer like yourself would well understand that that is a circumstance of recklessness. If you are a person who advocates to impressionable, radicalised youth, that they should go out and commit a terrorist act—a terrorist act being defined elsewhere, of course, as an act of violence for a religious, political or ideological cause—then it may very well be that a jury would conclude: 'You were reckless as to the consequences. You were more than negligent; you were reckless—because in those circumstances, there was a very substantial risk that the audience whom you were addressing would go and do the very thing that you were advocating.' I hope that satisfies your inquiry, Senator Macdonald.


Senator Wright asks what is the definition of promotion. Senator Wright, with respect, you asked the wrong question, because what is being prohibited here is 'advocacy', and 'promotes' is one of the four verbs that are used to define advocacy. So it is the 'advocacy' of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence, that attracts the operation of the new offence provision. To deal with your question directly, a court would read or interpret that word in the context of the words that appear around it, applying ordinary canons of statutory interpretation. So the word 'promotes' would take its meaning from the words around it in the statute: 'counsels, encourages or urges'. None of which, I see, you seek to omit. You are probably aware, Senator Wright, that there are certain areas of the law where the word 'promotes' does have a more technical meaning—for example, in the promotion of companies. But that is an entirely different area of law. So the word 'promotes' can have a technical legal meaning but in this case it does not; it has its ordinary, common-speech meaning, derived from the words that appear adjacent to it in the statute, and that much is made clear by paragraph 700 of the replacement explanatory memorandum. Let me read it to you, since you are not evidently familiar with it—




Senator Wright:
  No; I am familiar with it.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Well, then why did you ask the question, Senator Wright, if you are familiar with it?




Senator Wright:
  I can explain that.




Senator BRANDIS:
  However, let me read it to you:


The terms ‘promotes’ and ‘encourages’ are not defined.  The ordinary meaning of each of the relevant expressions varies, but it is important that they be interpreted broadly to ensure a person who advocates terrorism does not escape punishment by relying on a narrow construction of the terms or one of the terms.  However, some examples of the ordinary meaning of each of the expressions follow: to ‘counsel’ the doing of an act (when used as a verb) is to urge the doing or adoption of the action or to recommend doing the action; to ‘encourage’ means to inspire or stimulate by assistance of approval; to ‘promote’ means to advance, further or launch; and ‘urge’ covers pressing by persuasion or recommendation, insisting on, pushing along and exerting a driving or impelling force.


That is the way in which these expressions are treated in the replacement explanatory memorandum. But, as the explanatory memorandum also says—and as I said—the expressions will have their ordinary language meaning. Therefore, Senator Wright, you do not have to be a lawyer to know what these words mean. They have the same meaning in this section as they have in common speech. The courts and juries, I believe, given the guidance that this provision gives them, can be relied upon to decide whether or not conduct amounts to encouraging, urging, counselling or promoting.


Lastly, Senator Wright, because you did make some rather extravagant claims, I emphasise a point that is too often lost in this debate. We are criminalising conduct. You could not work out before whether this was unnecessary because it was already covered by the law or it was extravagant because it was not already covered by the law. But I think you settled on saying it goes too far because it is not already covered by the law. Whenever the parliament declares something to be unlawful and, indeed, a crime which is not currently a crime, it should do so after careful deliberation, which is why we are having this debate and why the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security looked at this so exhaustively. But we should always remember that the ordinary principles of criminal law are not suspended. That means that the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove every element of the offence, including the recklessness element.


But, secondly, the criminal standard of proof also applies. Let's never forget that. In all of these debates we have about the language of particular statutes and safeguards, the greatest safeguard of all is a principle of English criminal law going back centuries—namely, that the standard of proof for a crime for every element of an offence is beyond reasonable doubt. That is the greatest safeguard of the law. It has been part of our law, as inheritors of the English legal system, for centuries. Every element of this offence, like any other criminal offence, needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (10:12):  I think it is important that I begin by saying that, much like Senator Leyonhjelm, I am not a lawyer. Only in the rarefied air of the Australian Senate, Senator Leyonhjelm, do we have to apologise for not being lawyers! But I assure you that, while in this place we apologise for not being lawyers, once we leave the Senate chamber it is they who have to apologise for being lawyers!


I have a few questions for Senator Brandis, but I wanted to touch on something that Senator Macdonald said that I think was unintentionally clumsily phrased. Senator Macdonald made the point that he is prepared to give up some of his freedom for security and safety. That is the kind of language and debate that we have heard a lot in recent times when we talk about these things. While I see the point that Senator Macdonald is making, I always get concerned when people use that kind of language because I hold—and I know others in this chamber do as well; maybe almost everyone in this place does—a slightly more sophisticated view, which is that our safety stems from our freedom, not the other way around. I do not like the characterisation that we sometimes make in this place or in simplistic media commentary that there has to be some kind of trade-off between being free and being safe and that there is somehow an equilibrium. While I understand in a practical sense that they sometimes can come into conflict with each other, I think we have to be more sophisticated and more intelligent in how we approach these debates and start talking about how we can have an environment in which we are safe and secure that makes us more free, not less free. That is the challenge that we have in this place.


I also want to note that I have a lot of sympathy for where Senator Wright is going with her amendments. I am going to explain a bit about why I slightly disagree with her. The point that is being made here—that is, making sure the bar is high—is the right one. I did not have a chance to speak in the second reading debate and I do want to speak specifically to the amendments, but in doing so I will ask for a tiny bit of indulgence from the Senate to talk around the issues that relate to the amendment as well as the wording of the amendments. Senator Brandis, I think it is really important as we go forward and look at the amendments in this debate that we acknowledge the real obligation here is not just what we do as law-makers to set the regulations but how we engage with the communities themselves—the Muslim communities in particular, which are obviously more directly impacted by some of the debates that are happening—and how we create an environment of engagement with them. I want to note and put on the record the incredible work of adult of Muslim leaders around Australia, in particular, as I come from Sydney, people like Samier Dandan from the Lebanese Muslim Association, people like Dr Jamal Rifi, people like Maha Abda from the Muslim Women's Association and Muslim community leaders who have actually stepped up and said, 'This isn't part of our community. There is no place for this in our society. We do not support this.' When we have these debates we have a real responsibility to acknowledge and respect the fact that those Muslim community leaders at the coalface who are confronting these issues on a regular and daily basis deserve our encouragement and our acknowledgement of the work they do.


We talk about who the victims are of those who are out there inciting or encouraging or promoting—whatever language you want to use—terrorism. I do not want to forget the fact that the victims of this are not just those people in Syria, Jordan, Iraq and the Middle East region where foreign fighters go to fight. They are the victims, of course, but in a lot of cases you have impressionable young people at a very delicate age who are, let us face it—I would like to use the word that Senator Leyonhjelm used on the outside of parliament, but I do not believe that the word beginning with the letter 'd' and ending in the word 'head' is parliamentary, so I will not use it. We forget that they also can be victims of this. The community becomes a victim. Their families also become victims. In a lot of cases they are impressionable youth, a lot of whom come from south-west Sydney, and—I want to be honest here—a lot of their life experiences up to a certain point were not all that different from some of my life experiences. That makes me wonder about and question what influences they have had and what community influence has at times led those impressionable youths to make those kinds of decisions.


Those in the Senate chamber know me well. I was four when I came to Australia. I came from that part of the world. I was born in a small fishing village in northern Iran. I look at the incredible opportunity and experience that this country has given me and, when I see a 17-year-old youth on the front page of The Daily Telegraph out there making ridiculous statements halfway across the world, I question what led to that happening. Why I support a lot of this is that part of what these laws are doing is acknowledging that the people who also have a responsibility are the people who incite, who encourage, who promote and who push impressionable youth to make foolish and ridiculous decisions. I would say to Senator Brandis that where this legislation is going on that front is a good step and that the implicit acknowledgements we can make are that there are many victims of terrorism, that there are many victims of this kind of behaviour and that the community itself and the families of these people also become victims. The responsibility should and needs also to lie with them. Do not get me wrong: if people travel halfway around the world to participate in horrible, brutal acts they deserve to be punished and as they commit crimes they deserve to have the full force of the law thrown at them. But the people who are inciting them, the people who are pushing them, the people who are promoting them, the people who are using their positions of power over impressionable youth to make them make these foolish and improper decisions also deserve to have punishment. The wording of the amendment concerns me, Senator Wright. I understand the intention of what you are trying to achieve. I have a very strong view that these impressionable youths can also at times be victims, based on the information that they are being provided.


On the idea about how much time there is for the debate, I think Senator Wright makes a fair point about the guillotine and deliberations. I am not an expert in Senate procedure; I do not pretend to be. I do not know what is an appropriate amount of time.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You're not even a lawyer!




Senator DASTYARI:
  I'm not even a lawyer; that's right. I think what has been a good part of this process—I have spoken to other senators as they were going through the parliamentary committee process and the recommendations were being developed—has been the ability to have had some of this debate out there.



Senator Wright interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  What is important is that there be more of this kind of debate. I will take the interjection from Senator Wright, who made the point that my party was part of those deliberations and through the committee process her party was excluded. If that is the case, that does not allow for good legislation. The opportunity to have those kinds of debates in the committee environment as a rule leads to better legislation and better amendments. I acknowledge that Senator Brandis has really gone out of his way to make sure that, from the perspective of the Labor Party, we were fully engaged in this debate. I think that adds to it.


I also acknowledge the real work that a lot of not just the Muslim community leaders that I mentioned earlier but the parliamentarians who have been engaging with the Muslim community. I was at Lakemba mosque on Saturday morning with Scott Morrison. That is not something that most people can say they have done. It was good to see the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection go there. I acknowledge that Senator Fierravanti-Wells in particular has spent a lot of time engaging with the emerging communities of Sydney and the Sydney Muslim communities. We have to be careful in the language we use in this chamber and about the message we send. I am not going to get into a debate now about things like the debate we had on the burqa and whatnot, but we have to be very careful that we are not sending the wrong signal to the sections of the community that are doing their best to try to engage, who want to be part of this process. We have to empower them, speak highly of them and bring them in as part of the process. I know the law enforcement agencies have really gone out of their way—they deserve our congratulations—to try to engage with the community. If the real issue here is a group of impressionable, young, mostly, men—I think almost all are men—from a Middle Eastern background, some of whom were born here, many of whom came here while they were quite young, as I did, then the best people to counter the narrative that they are getting, of hate and of the incitement of violence, are those within their own community. It is about empowering those kinds of voices.


Senator Brandis, turning more specifically to the question, I hope this question is not too far from the amendment so that it is one you can answer. I would not mind if you are able to touch on, while we talk about the specifics and the wording of this amendment, what the government is doing not just in the letter of the law but to try and make sure that we are engaging with Muslim community leaders and empowering them. When we talk about the issue of those who incite and those who encourage reckless behaviour we must talk not just about punishing those who have committed the crime but encouraging those who on the opposite end are trying to send the right kind of message to the community.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:24):  The very message we are trying to send to the community is a message to discourage its members, particularly its young members, from engaging in this kind of conduct. In a sense, Senator Dastyari, once a person has been radicalised and once a person has travelled to Syria or northern Iraq to fight with ISIL—as, sadly, we have seen some young Australian men doing in media reports in recent days—in most cases, frankly, they are lost. They are lost. One aspect of social conduct that is very troubling is how swiftly apparently ordinary, everyday Australian youths can be radicalised. There have been many instances of individuals being radicalised in a very short span of time that we know about. That, Senator Dastyari, by the way is why we need to have this advocacy of terrorism offence. I do not seem to be able to get through to some members of the Senate, but I am sure you understand, Senator Dastyari, that, when you create a climate in which the advocacy of terrorism is acceptable, then you constrain your capacity to prevent those who by advocating terrorism encourage young men—sometimes unsure of their identity, sometimes unsure about the path or the course of their life, sometimes unsure about their belief system and where they fit into family or social structures—to embrace this radical solution.


So, Senator Dastyari, preventing young people becoming radicalised by measures, such as the measure we are now debating, is absolutely critical. The measures for the advocacy of terrorism are not directed, at least primarily, at the vulnerable young men who are the targets; they are directed to the evil old men who are the proselytisers, the predators and the advocates who seek to ensnare young men in this false, perverted and distorted version of the Islamic faith.


Another important element, Senator, is our engagement with Islamic communities. I am glad you were at Lakemba the other day with my friend Scott Morrison. He, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I and many other members of the government in our own electorates and our communities have spent a lot of time—as I am sure opposition members of parliament like you have done as well—reaching out to these communities. I spoke in the debate last night about the many meetings I have had with leaders of the Islamic community to engage them as our partners in this task. They are some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this legislation—they are because they know it is designed to address a problem that arises, in particular, in their communities. It is intensely, deeply threatening to those communities and threatening to the vulnerable young people in their communities. We will continue to engage. When the Prime Minister and I announced a suite of measures on 5 August, one of the most important of those measures was a very substantial sum of money to invest in our Countering Violent Extremism programs, which are being delivered through the Australian Federal Police, through state police agencies and other government agencies.


There are other things that civil society does and can do. Only recently, on the day before the AFL Grand Final, I went to Melbourne to present the Bachar Houli Cup, which is a wonderful initiative promoted by the AFL in Melbourne. It recruits young Muslim men who want careers as AFL football players into a scholarship and mentoring program inspired by Australia's first great AFL player who professes the Islamic faith, Bachar Houli—it was my great privilege to meet him that morning—and engage them through sport. I can say, as a former sports minister, that engagement of young people through sport is one of the best possible ways of avoiding alienation and promoting a sense of belonging and inclusion. In a broad sense that is what the Prime Minister means whenever he uses the term 'Team Australia'—that we are all part of the team. In a narrow sense, that is what the AFL is doing, by saying to these young men who are participants in the Bachar Houli program, 'You are part of our particular team'—which is but an element of the great variety of the many community groups to which people feel a sense of belonging and which, in aggregate, amounts to 'Team Australia'.


Senator, the observations you have made are very wise, if I may say so. I know you have been very constructive in your own communities and networks, and have been a very constructive force in promoting this agenda of inclusion in trying to prevent young men feeling so alienated that they become radicalised and prey to the false doctrines of those who would seek to recruit them for evil purposes, to do violence to themselves and to others. The legislative element of this is only one element of a whole-of-government approach, and I appreciate the Labor Party supporting and seeing the wisdom of having this element securely in place.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:31):  I have a couple of very brief comments to make in response to the answers that the Attorney-General gave to my question about the meaning of 'promotes' earlier.


I would also like to seek the guidance of the chair. Last night, when I began to address this amendment (12) on sheet 7594, I indicated that I would like to move this amendment separately to amendment (13), although they are amendments that relate to the same offence of advocating terrorism. In the interests of time, I am wondering if it would be possible to deal with these two amendments together.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Senator Wright, that is entirely appropriate, if you would like to. Is leave granted for Senator Wright to move amendment (13)?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I would like to speak on the leave question.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  It is not a question; Senator Wright is seeking leave. Leave is either granted or it is not.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Leave is granted, but I want to address amendment (13), which I have not yet addressed.


Leave granted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:32):  I move Australian Greens amendment (13) on sheet 7594:


(13) Schedule 1, item 61, page 64 (line 1), omit ""promotes,"".



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We are now considering amendments (12) and (13) on sheet 7594 standing in the name of the Australian Greens.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I would like to do that; indeed, we have been discussing the second amendment inadvertently anyway, which is removing the word 'promotes' from the definition of advocating terrorism. We have been having a relevant discussion about that particular amendment.


If I could come back to the question that I posed to the Attorney-General, which was asking for what the meaning of the word 'promotes' is. The Attorney-General suggested that it takes its ordinary meaning. In that case, I guess any of us in the chamber would probably be equipped to try to define what 'promotes' means.


The Attorney-General tried to reassure me about the concerns that I was expressing, but that have also have been expressed by many legal commentators, about the broadness of the word 'promotes' and the uncertainty that that would create, in terms of understanding whether particular behaviour would be defined to be promoting terrorism. The Attorney-General was wanting to reassure us that if it went to a court case and a prosecution, then the burden of proof is 'beyond reasonable doubt'. However, one of the concerns raised is that, when we are dealing with laws that do not define particular behaviours with certainty and clarity, there is a chilling effect on those people who do not want to end up in a court where the prosecution has to be put to the standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt. The risk is that people will pull right back from what would, potentially, be considered to be legitimate activity—because they are justifiably fearful about the consequences.


The Attorney-General also sought to reassure us that the government's view on what 'promotes might mean is set out in the explanatory memorandum. But—as Senator Leyonhjelm has pointed out several times in this debate already—courts, in interpreting legislation, will only have recourse to the explanatory memorandum if they feel it necessary to do so. In fact, it is quite rare. They would generally prefer to look at the wording of the offence itself in the legislation. That is why it is also desirable to have clarity and certainty about what words and terms mean.


An example that has been raised by legal commentators to illustrate the risks associated with having terms like 'promotes'—where it is not really clear how far they extend—is that of a person who 'likes' a Facebook comment which contains a favourable reference to terrorist activity. Would that fall within the definition of 'promoting or advocating terrorism to others'? What about someone who is wearing a T-shirt with an ISIL symbol on it? Although that is not a T-shirt that would be in my wardrobe, and I would not be encouraging my kids to wear it—it would be abhorrent to me—that would be, arguably, a legitimate form of political expression in Australia. I think most of us would be reluctant to prevent it—someone indicating an allegiance to something that we do not necessarily agree with. But there are serious issues here about freedom of expression and how far that freedom of expression may be affected by this legislation. So in absolute good faith, that is the reason that, if we cannot get clarity about the word 'promotes', the Greens will be seeking to have the word 'promotes' removed from the definition of 'advocating terrorism'. That is all I intend to say in this debate. I seek leave to move these amendments together.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:36):  Chairman, could I respond to that, before Senator Collins makes her contribution?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Yes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Wright, I have told you and I have pointed out to you the relevant paragraph of the explanatory memorandum. The word 'promotes' has its common-speech meaning, so please do not say to the chamber that I cannot tell you what it means, when I have just told you what it means and I have just directed you to a longish discussion about the meaning in the explanatory memorandum. Frankly, Senator Wright, because it has its common-speech meaning you need look no further than the Oxford English Dictionary or the Macquarie Dictionary to satisfy yourself what the word means if you do not already know.


There is no useful purpose to be served by imagining hypothetical instances of what may or may not be caught by a statutory definition expressed in common English, because that is what courts do. We have a separation of powers in this country. It is not for the parliament to define, by legislation or by regulation, every single imaginable instance. That would be bad legislative practice. It is not for the parliament to set out in an act of parliament whether, for example, a T-shirt or a particular form of words is caught by a general statutory prohibition. That is what courts do. They apply the generic language of statutes to the facts of particular cases.


I think we can rely upon and trust the judges and juries to apply this clear statutory language to particular instances. The debate is not served by imagining instances which could conceivably come before the courts and ask, 'What does the statute have to say about that?' That is not our job. It is not my job as the Attorney-General and the person moving this bill; it is not your job or our jobs as senators deliberating upon this bill; it is the job of the courts to apply the law.


Senator Wright, I do not think I need go beyond that. I have already made the point. I do not want to be tedious and repeat myself, but it does not seem to be getting through to you that this is not about freedom of expression. This is about the advocacy of terrorism. The advocacy of terrorism is not the expression of an opinion; it is the injunction to an act of violence. If you cannot see the distinction, Senator Wright, I suspect most senators can.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:39):  As I indicated before, I am happy for the Greens to move amendments (12) and (13) together. However, my earlier comments were quite discrete with respect to amendment (12). Whilst I indicated that we were now dealing with the 'advocating terrorism' element of the bills and that we had circulated amendments to deal with that issue, I would like to deal with Labor's position in more detail at that stage.


I should now, for the benefit of the Senate, indicate that Labor has circulated revised and further amendments because, through further consideration and discussions, we have determined to take a different approach to dealing with this issue. I will come to the detail of those when I receive advice as to where in the running sheet we should address those amendments. 


With respect to Greens amendment (13), which was similar to our previous approach, in the amendments that we first provided, I should indicate that on the basis of Labor's new approach addressing this issue we would be opposing amendment (13) with respect to removing the word 'promote'. 


I appreciate the Greens' concern here. Indeed, up until recently we had sought to address the issue in a similar way. On the basis of further advice—senators will see our changed position in amendments on sheet 7605—we believe that this approach ensures that our concerns that the breadth of these provisions not touch behaviour which would not be reasonably regarded as advocating terrorism are dealt with in this new fashion.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  The committee is considering the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 and amendments (12) and (13) on sheet 7594 standing in the name of the Australian Greens and moved by Senator Wright. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.


Question negatived. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We will now move to opposition amendments. Is it appropriate, Senator Collins, for us to deal with opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7601 (revised) and opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7605 concurrently, now? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:43):  At this stage I hope to proceed simply with amendment (1) on sheet 7605. I move the amendment:


(1) Schedule 1, page 64 (after line 14), after item 61, insert:




61A


After subsection


80.3(1)



Insert:


(1A) Without limiting subsection (1), section 80.2C does not apply to a person who engages in good faith in public discussion of any genuine academic, artistic, scientific, political or religious matter.


Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1A). See subsection 13.3(3).




61B


Subsection


80.3(2)



After ""subsection (1)"", insert ""or (1A)"".


As I mentioned before, these deal with our further considered approach in relation to managing our concerns about advocating terrorism. As we have indicated, we are concerned about the breadth of the new 'advocating terrorism' offence. In our consultation with the Australian community—and especially with representatives of the Muslim community, that I think Senator Dastyari has covered today—we have heard concerns that this new offence might capture quite legitimate speech on controversial political matters or that it might capture legitimate religious discussion, debate or preaching.


Labor agrees with the need for an offence addressing conduct which might cause others to engage in terrorism. We know that there is a line to be carefully drawn. We would never want to criminalise legitimate religious conduct or to cause the Muslim community to fear that honest religious activity would be criminalised. That would be completely contrary to our purpose.


Labor's amendment would expand the existing good faith defence in section 80.3 of the Criminal Code as it applies to the new advocacy of terrorism offence to make it clear that those who engage in good faith in public discussion of any genuine academic, artistic, scientific, political or religious matter will be protected from liability. We think this strikes the right balance. We support the new offence, but we want to make sure that it does not capture innocent conduct. We think that this amendment will make sure that this new offence does not go too far.


I am in the hands of the Senate as to whether, given that these amendments have been recently circulated, we might want to defer consideration to a later stage in the committee stage of debate to allow some consideration of the detail of these. Maybe I will add some humour to the debate at this stage. I also am not a lawyer. It might entertain senators to understand that Senator Brandis, many years ago, had assumed I was a lawyer, to which I laughed and indicated that it might have been my major in logic!



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  This was many years ago, Senator Brandis, I think in the context of the 'children overboard' investigation. That said, I obviously have been dealing with making laws for many years. I appreciate that some time to consider the new approach that Labor has taken on this issue might be important to other senators, so I am in their hands as to whether they might seek to defer dealing with these amendments until later in the debate, if some further consideration is warranted.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:47):  The government opposes the Labor Party's amendment. This is, as Senator Collins has said candidly, the second position the Labor Party has taken on this issue. There has been some reconsideration evidently within the Labor Party's inner circles. I welcome the fact that the initial amendment has been withdrawn, but nevertheless the government cannot support this amendment. We do not support the amendment for a very simple reason, Senator Collins: it is entirely unnecessary because what the amendment does is provide—we are talking about 7605 at the moment?




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  No, Senator Brandis. We are dealing with 7601.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  No, I beg your pardon, senators. We are dealing with 7601.




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is not what Senator Collins was talking about. She was talking about 7605.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Amendment (1) on 7605.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Collins and I understand each other. We are dealing with a proposed amendment to subsection 80.3(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, by which the opposition would include a provision specifying that section 80.2C—that is, the advocacy of terrorism offence—does not apply to a person who engaged in good faith in public discussion of any genuine academic, artistic, scientific, political or religious matter. The government opposes this amendment for a couple of reasons. On a narrow reading it is unnecessary because what section 80.2C would do is make it an offence to advocate terrorism—to advocate the commission of a terrorist offence or to engage in a terrorist act. It is inconceivable that a person could, if they are advocating the commission of a terrorist offence or engagement in a terrorist act, be merely acting bona fides in a public discussion of political or religious matters.


The amendment that Senator Collins has moved, for reasons I explained to Senator Wright earlier in the morning, is quite unnecessary. There is nothing in the proposed advocacy of terrorism offence which would capture the expression of political or religious opinions, unless they were to trespass beyond being merely the expression of opinions and become the advocacy of violence. That is what this captures. The distinction between the expression of opinions and the advocacy of violence is a very clear distinction. So the Labor Party amendment, on a strict view, is unnecessary.


It is also invidious for another reason. You will recall that I said to Senator Wright before that we should always conduct these debates about the introduction of new criminal offences mindful of the fact that the onus of proof lies on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt before a jury that every element of the offence has been committed, and the jury must also consider any defences that might be raised. The very vagueness of the terms 'academic', 'political' or 'religious' matters as such could very well cause confusion in the minds of jurors. I would not expect that the typical juror would be a scholar of the Koran. Let us say that, in relation to a particular prosecution in which terrorism was advocated, it was said by an expert witness, 'This is really consistent with a particular passage of an Islamic holy book.' There are a variety of claims made about every religious faith. There are a variety of contestable claims made about what constitutes the doctrine of every religious faith. I have said from start to finish in this debate that Islam is a religion of peace and that those who preach the doctrines of ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra and the other radical deviants from that religion do not represent the views of that religious faith. But let us say that in a prosecution a particular scholar with a particular point of view were to contend to the contrary. Does that mean that a jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there should be a prosecution even though what was involved constituted the advocacy of terrorism? So I think, from a technical point of view, this amendment is unnecessary, but from a practical point of view, from the point of view of giving effect to the amendment in the real-world circumstances of a criminal prosecution, it may very well defeat the effect of section 80.2, and that is why the government oppose it and we call on the crossbenchers other than the Greens—who, of course, would support this—to oppose it as well.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  For the purpose of the committee, I called upon 7601 when I called Senator Collins, but we will deal with 7605. Senator Collins, I would now invite you to move that amendment formally.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  That is fine.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I have moved it, but I am happy to do so again if it clears that up. As I think I said previously, I was prepared to defer consideration of this, but the senators in the chamber have indicated their positions. The government has too. I am quite disappointed that, given the consultation and effort that has been put into settling this matter, the government has indicated that it will oppose these amendments. Although senators on the crossbench may not have been party to those discussions, into which some considerable effort has been put overnight, to try to reach an acceptable understanding, I would encourage them to understand that these amendments represent a move from Labor's first approach to address this very important issue, as was highlighted by Senator Dastyari. The Australian community's concern is that we get this balance and this provision right, since it is important to our multiculturalism, to our nation and to protecting Australians, whatever their race or creed. I encourage senators on the crossbench, even reflecting on the reservations that Senator Brandis may have made, to err on the side of caution and to support these amendments on that basis.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I invite you to move the amendments, Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I thought I had moved them twice now.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  No. The first time, Senator Collins, you put it to the Senate about deferring the amendment and you never actually moved it, that I recall.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I do so move.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7605 be agreed to.

(17) Schedule 1, page 64 (after line 16), after item 62, insert:




62A


Subsection


100.1(1) of the 
Criminal Code



   Insert:



   engage in a hostile activity has the meaning given by subsection 117.1(1).


(18) Schedule 1, item 71, page 66 (lines 24 and 25), omit ""(within the meaning of subsection 117.1(1))"".


(21) Schedule 1, item 73, page 67 (lines 11 and 12), omit ""(within the meaning of subsection 117.1(1))"".


These amendments are technical amendments. Amendment (17) inserts a definition for the term 'engage in a hostile activity' into section 100.1 for the purposes of part 5.3 of the Criminal Code. Amendment (21) is a consequential amendment to amendment (17). The effect of the amendments would be to provide that for the purposes of part 5.3 of the Criminal Code 'engage in a hostile activity' has the same meaning as it has where it is defined in the new section 117.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The amendments amend the need to cross-reference that subsection each time the expression is used.

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:05):  by leave—I move government amendments (19), (20) and (22) to (24) together:


(19) Schedule 1, item 71, page 66 (line 26), omit ""or a foreign country"".


(20) Schedule 1, item 71, page 66 (after line 29), at the end of paragraph 104.2(2)(b), add:


      ; or (iv) been convicted in a foreign country of an offence that is constituted by conduct that, if engaged in in Australia, would constitute a terrorism offence (within the meaning of subsection 3(1) of the Crimes Act 1914).


(22) Schedule 1, item 73, page 67 (lines 13 and 14), omit ""or a foreign country"".


(23) Schedule 1, item 73, page 67 (line 17), omit ""and"", substitute ""or"".


(24) Schedule 1, item 73, page 67 (after line 17), after subparagraph 104.4(1)(c)(iv), insert:


      (v) that the person has been convicted in a foreign country of an offence that is constituted by conduct that, if engaged in in Australia, would constitute a terrorism offence (within the meaning of subsection 3(1) of the Crimes Act 1914); and


These amendments implement recommendation 9 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by separating the grounds for requesting, making, confirming and varying a control order on the basis of a conviction for a terrorism related offence in Australia, on one hand, and a foreign offence. These amendments also limit the ground in relation to foreign convictions to circumstances where the conduct that resulted in the conviction would be a terrorism offence if it occurred in Australia. The practical effect of the amendments is to require a correlation between a foreign conviction and conduct that would be considered a terrorism offence in Australia. As such, these amendment seek to provide confidence that the control order regime will apply only in relation to the recognised Australian standards of criminal law.

Subsection


104.23(1) of the

   Repeal the subsection, substitute:

   (a) suspects on reasonable grounds that the varied order in the terms to be sought would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act; or


   (b) suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has:


      (i) provided training to, received training from or participated in training with a listed terrorist organisation; or


      (ii) engaged in a hostile activity in a foreign country; or


      (iii) been convicted in Australia of an offence relating to terrorism, a terrorist organisation (within the meaning of subsection 102.1(1)) or a terrorist act (within the meaning of section 100.1); or


      (iv) been convicted in a foreign country of an offence that is constituted by conduct that, if engaged in in Australia, would constitute a terrorism offence (within the meaning of subsection 3(1) of the Crimes Act 1914).


This amendment further implements recommendation 9 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by separating the grounds for requesting a variation of a control order on the basis of a conviction for a terrorism-related offence in Australia on the one hand and a foreign offence. It is, in a sense, an analogue of the previous amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:32):  I would like to recap what is happening in this debate. Late last night, the government was ramming through laws that they say will make Australians safer. But we know that they involve a fundamental weakening of the rights and freedoms that make Australia one of the world's top democracies.


The government's approach to this bill has been rushed, and the bill is flawed. The Greens have said it, the country's top legal experts have been saying it and, as we saw yesterday, even the government-dominated Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has said it. Yesterday afternoon, Senator Smith, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, stood in this chamber and told the Senate that parts of this bill are likely to be incompatible with human rights. That was a unified position that the committee took. I am on the committee and I know that, for the committee, that is as strong as it gets: parts of this bill are likely to be incompatible with human rights. 


It is a damning review. The human rights committee has found the new declared area zones offence to be incompatible with human rights. Other parts of the bill have caused the committee to raise concerns about the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of movement, the right to freedom from arbitrary detention, the right to privacy and the right to a fair trial, as well as the right to a presumption of innocence. And yet this bill—if the government, aided by Labor and some of the crossbench, have their way—will pass this place in three short hours, by 12.30 pm today. In the committee stage of this debate, we can see there are still so many questions about how it will really affect people into the future and what the implications are.


Late last night, the Attorney-General was at pains to reassure us that the concerns raised about this bill by some of the country's top legal experts in the area of human rights and civil liberties—the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, the Law Council of Australia, the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, Human Rights Watch, Professor Ben Saul and the Human Rights Commission—should not worry us. But in the cold hard light of day, once again we have to remember and take stock of what this bill is seeking to do and, if passed, what it will do. It will change whether and where people in Australia travel; it will change the circumstances in which people can be detained and questioned by ASIO, customs and police; it will change the kind of personal information that is captured and stored at the airport; and the kind of public commentary or reflection on controversial issues that is legal. As we saw with the first tranche of national security legislation, it is simply too late to ponder the consequences and, in some cases, to rue them, once the legislation has been passed. I know that if this law is to be passed in haste we will regret it at leisure. Over time we will come to fully realise the freedoms we have traded away for a situation that many say will not actually make us safer.


Coming to the offence of advocating terrorism, this is a new offence where a person will be guilty of the offence if they intentionally counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence and the person is reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. It is a serious offence; it carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The Australian Greens' first amendment, item (12) on the sheet, substitutes 'an intention'—a fault element of intention—to commit the act for 'recklessness'. The Australian Greens say that this amendment is necessary because the offence of advocating terrorism in this bill duplicates and unnecessarily expands what are already-existing criminal offences which capture conduct or speech that advocates the commission of terrorist acts. For instance, there is already an offence on Australia's statute books to urge another person to engage in intergroup violence or violence against members of groups. There is already an offence to recruit others to join terrorist organisations or organisations engaging in hostile activities against foreign governments. There are already incitement offences which cover a person who urges the commission of an offence, such as a terrorist-related offence. It is already an offence to be a member of, or provide support to, a terrorist organisation. This Greens amendment seeks to tighten the scope of this new proposed offence to ensure that it will only apply to those who intend to cause another to engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. This amendment is needed because this serious criminal offence, as it is currently drafted, only requires a person to be reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence.


The legal commentators from whom we have sought advice, and whose position is similar to the position that the Australian Greens are taking in relation to this, are the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, the Law Council of Australia and Human Rights Watch. I have a question to put to the Attorney-General. It has been suggested that the new offence of advocating terrorism duplicates and unnecessarily expands existing criminal offence provisions, and contains terms that are so broadly defined that they will pose problems for prosecutors, as well as potentially encroaching on freedom of speech. Attorney-General, can you please explain, in clear terms, what the term 'promotes means in the context of this offence?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (09:39):  Let me respond to a few of the observations that have come from Senator Wright. First of all, Senator Wright, I wish you would not falsely claim that this legislation was rammed through the chamber last night. Each of the amendments—government, opposition, Green and Senator Leyonhjelm's—were dealt with by the chamber in an orthodox parliamentary debate, subject to no time limitation. There are time limitations in place later in the day, but last night's debate was not limited or circumscribed or foreshortened in anyway. You know that, Senator Wright, so why you would choose to say it was rammed through the chamber when in fact it proceeded in a routine, regular and orthodox parliamentary way I have no idea. Perhaps it is because you do not want to come to terms with the substance of the legislation that you make remarks like that.


Senator Wright, it is still not clear to me what your concern is. You seem to be saying in one breath that the problem with this new provision is that it duplicates existing law and therefore is unnecessary, and then in the very next breath you say it unnecessarily expands existing law and therefore takes the law beyond where it ought to be. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on the one hand that the provision is otiose because it merely restates what is already in the law and then in the next breath say the provision is dangerous because it takes the law too far beyond where it already is. It is not clear to me what your complaint is but, as I say, you cannot have it both ways.


The lacuna in the law that this provision seeks to fill is where the advocacy of terrorism is not caught by the existing law relating to the incitement of violence. That is the answer to your question. That is not merely my opinion; it is also the unanimous opinion of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which in its review of this bill observed—I am quoting from its report:


… the current incitement offence is not appropriate to capture the range of activity being encountered and investigated …


Senator Wright, I think you are a lawyer, are you not?




Senator Wright:
  I think you know I am, yes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I thought you were. So you would be aware that the existing criminal law of incitement to violence requires a very direct correlation between the words that constitute the incitement and the violent act. But when we are dealing with the advocacy of terrorism—terrorism, as you know, is a defined term in the act—the immediacy of that correlation which the existing criminal offence requires is not always there. It is not necessarily there. This legislation seeks to address that area where the existing offence of incitement of violence is not available to prosecutors. It does that by saying:


(1) A person commits an offence if:


(a) the person advocates:


   (i) the doing of a terrorist act; or


   (ii) the commission of a terrorism offence … and


(b) the person engages in that conduct reckless as to whether another person will:


   (i) engage in a terrorist act; or


   (ii) commit a terrorism offence …


A terrorism offence is one of the existing terrorism offences set in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code. 'Advocates' is a defined term. 'Advocates' is not a term of art. It is not a term with a particular technical legal meaning, so it is defined by subclause 2 of the proposed section in these terms:


… a person advocates the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence if the person counsels, promotes, encourages or urges the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence.


What those words, those synonyms, seek to capture is the essence of advocacy, the essence of advocacy being an attempt by language or other verbal forms to persuade someone to do something. The relevant event being caught here is 'the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence'. Now, Senator Wright, if you and your colleagues from the Greens party want to go out into the public space of Australia and say it should not be against the law to advocate the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence, you go right ahead, Senator Wright. But the government believe, the opposition believe as well and most of the crossbench senators to whom I have spoken also believe that it should not be lawful in this country to advocate the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence.


Lastly, Senator Wright, let me address what you said about freedom of speech. The Australian Greens having led the campaign against freedom of speech in the early part of this year, it seems to me, Senator Wright, that it is beyond bizarre that you would now be posing as a champion of freedom of speech. But, that being said, there is all the difference in the world between advocating the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence, and expressing an opinion, bearing in mind that terrorism is defined in terms of violence or causing fear, on the one hand, and expressing a point of view, on the other hand. There is not a word in this bill—not a word—that impinges upon or restricts freedom of opinion. If a person wants to express radical views, if they want to promote or proselytise a radical view of the world or a non-mainstream view of the world, they are perfectly free to do so.


What they are not free to do and what they should not be free to do is to advocate the commission of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence, because that goes beyond merely the expression of an opinion. What that involves is encouraging or promoting or urging other people—almost always vulnerable people, I might say, who are susceptible to the injunctions of these predators—to do harm or violence to innocent people and, indeed, in many cases, to themselves. If, Senator Wright, that is okay with you, then that is a matter between you and your conscience. But I think most of the Australian people would agree with the government that it ought not to be lawful in this country to do so.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:47):  Attorney-General, I will pick up on a couple of things you said. First of all, I think you are a lawyer; is that right? Is my memory serving me correctly that you are a lawyer too?



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WRIGHT:
  I did not start this, Senator Macdonald—so, a bit of respect, Senator Brandis. I do not think you would want to mislead either this chamber or the public who might be listening to this debate. First of all, let me make it really clear: at no time has this amendment sought to remove that provision. We are working with the bill that the government has drafted, but we are reflecting genuine and widespread concerns about the broad and risky potential of this offence to have unintended consequences for freedom of expression in Australia. 


At no point did I say in my comments earlier that we should remove the term 'advocates'. I specifically referred to the word 'promotes' and I asked you a specific question about how that would be defined—and I allow you as a lawyer to tell us what would in fact amount to 'promoting' under this bill so that people who are listening have some idea of the type of behaviour or speech they may not be able to be involved with if the bill is passed. 


I will say a couple of other things. One of them is that you quibbled with me about using the words 'ramming through' about these laws. Certainly, last night there was debate about various amendments that were being put up by the Australian Greens, by Senator Leyonhjelm and by the government. But the sad reality is that the time allowed for this debate has been truncated; there is a guillotine hanging over us—at 12.30. So, much as I would have liked to ask further questions about the amendments that were being moved last night, I had to be very careful, knowing that I had other, substantive matters to deal with today. That has been hanging over my head and, no doubt, over the heads of other people who might want to engage in the debate today. So that is why the Australian Greens say that there was no justifiable reason to have an arbitrary guillotine that allowed less than eight hours of debate in the Senate.


I will go to the question that I put to you, and I do not think I received an answer, because you went off to suggest that the Australian Greens somehow do not care about the safety of Australians and that we perhaps are not concerned about people who might be in the community advocating some form of violence against others in the form of terrorism. So I will come back to my question: can you please as a lawyer explain in clear terms what the term 'promotes' means in the context of this offence, given that 'promotes' is one of the words used to define the term 'advocating' or 'advocacy'.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:50):  Before the minister answers that, I have a similar question about definitions, and perhaps he could address both at the same time. I am wondering if the minister could indicate what the term 'reckless' means in the passage that he read out here.


Before I elaborate on that, could I say I am flabbergasted that Senator Wright should be complaining about guillotining bills and restricting debate when I sat through six years of dysfunctional government supported by Senator Wright and her party, when no fewer than 150 bills were guillotined, some of them very important bills, with not one word of debate, Senator Wright. Where was your holier-than-thou opposition at that time? You were part of it. You and your party were part of that disgraceful episode in Australian politics where important legislation was indeed rammed through with not one word of debate. For you to get up and say that two days of debate is restriction really shows the hypocrisy of the Greens political party.


I support the general thrust of the government's legislation. I just want to indicate to the minister that, whilst some people say this does perhaps have restrictions on things that we might have been able to do in the past, I am one of those—and I think I speak for the majority of Australians here—who are prepared to forgo just a little bit of the freedoms that I would otherwise have had if it means that I and my family and the people that I know, love and respect are a little safer in their daily events and lives.


This is a situation which the government and the majority of Australians have not created, but it is a real situation. We are, I guess, lucky—and perhaps you make your own luck here. We are well prepared and we have in place a number of agencies and facilities that allow us to stop these terrorist acts before they happen. But I think that, when I and all Australians—indeed, all citizens of the world—see again just what happened in Canada last week, we cannot help but think that could happen here.


I have to say that for years I have left my front door of my office in Parliament House open, because I always want my office to look like it is welcoming. If people want to pop in and see me, they do it. I have to say that in the last few weeks I have started to shut the door in case someone comes through.




Senator Leyonhjelm:
  Mr Chairman, on a point of order: Senator Macdonald is continuing the second reading debate. The issue before the chair currently is the amendment moved by the Greens. We are operating under a guillotine—a time limit—and I think it would be appropriate if we return to the matter at hand.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Chairman, on the point of order: if Senator Leyonhjelm is that concerned, perhaps he should have taken the same point of order on Senator Wright when she was giving what was clearly a second reading debate speech.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Leyonhjelm, I understand the point you are making, but it is not a point of order that I can rule on. I think the debate is still within the realms of the question before the Chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I will be brief. I am conscious of the need to deal with a lot of amendments from all sides and I do want the minister to explain to me how the term 'reckless' is defined and how it operates in this context. Senator Leyonhjelm is quite right: I did not take part in the second reading debate because I did not want to take 20 minutes as most contributing speakers did, therefore restricting others from the debate. I think it  is appropriate in dealing with Senator Wright's amendment to indicate my view generally on her amendment, on the amendments being proposed by the government and, indeed, the whole bill, which I hope will be passed as amended. I repeat that most Australians are prepared to forgo some of the rights we have had throughout our existence if it means that people who might otherwise be harmed or killed are protected in this country. 


Over the years I have had bits to do with ASIO, the Crimes Commission and the Australian Federal Police through the different committees I have been involved in. They do a magnificent job but they always abide by the rules—the rules that are passed by parliament. The people whom they are competing against—the organised crime, the terrorist cells, those who would harm Australians—never follow one rule. They do not worry about human rights or getting warrants or unlawful killings—all that just happens as a matter of course. We have to give our agencies the maximum powers that a democracy can possibly give them to enable them to fight—not for anything they might get out of it—to protect me, my family and all other Australians. I think it is essential that, within the constrained limits that the Attorney-General has spoken about and that do understand the way Australian democracy and freedoms work, we do have to give them maximum amount of powers. If that means giving up a little of what we always thought we had in the way of freedoms, then most Australians—I think I can speak for them—are prepared to forgo them in return for keeping themselves, their families and their loved ones safe.


Minister, in answering Senator Wright's question, I wonder if you could address the issue of how 'reckless' is interpreted.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. Senator Brandis? Senator Collins.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:57):  I thought it might be useful for the opposition to deal with our position before we go into what might be a more lengthy question-and-answer discussion. Senator Wright, we have reached the provisions in the bill that deal with the very important issue of advocating terrorism. During my second reading contribution and others from the Labor Party—we did have a rather limited second reading debate—I did not cover the full detail of Labor's concerns about this area to assist the committee stage consideration or, indeed, the amendments that we will be moving. I will do that when we come to our amendments, but in relation to this particular amendment (12) I should indicate, as I think Senator Brandis has already noted in his comments, that Labor supports a new offence for counselling or urging the commission of a terrorist act. We believe that it is right that this captures those whose reckless conduct leads to someone committing a terrorist act. This Green amendment would mean this offence goes no further than existing incitement crimes which would apply already where someone urges or counsels a terrorist act intending that act to be committed. Senator Wright, that is our specific concern in relation to your amendment (12).


On some broader issues, I understand that, like Senator Macdonald, Senator Dastyari did not have an opportunity to contribute to the second reading debate but also wants to highlight to the government some of the important issues around concerns in the community about how we need to get advocating terrorism right in this bill. I hope there will be some small scope in this committee consideration for Senator Dastyari to cover a few points for the opposition as well, appreciating the limited time that we have available.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:00):  I do not want to unduly delay consideration of this amendment, but I do want to place on the record that I will support Greens amendment (12) moved by Senator Wright. I will also support Greens amendment (13). I will support the Labor amendments along the same lines. The intention of each of those is to limit the scope of the bill in relation to advocating terrorism, with various attempts to bring it closer to the definition of 'incitement', which I think is the appropriate approach. The Attorney-General says that 'incitement' is not appropriate. I am not a lawyer, just to make things clear, but I do think that something close to 'incitement' is the appropriate definition for this. I do not intend to speak on these amendments again, but I will be supporting each of these amendments—those of Labor and the Greens—to bring the definition of 'advocating terrorism' to something that I think we can live with. 


I have to say that if it comes down to it I am probably an advocate of terrorism in terms of overthrowing the regime in North Korea and perhaps in Zimbabwe as well. We really are talking about specific circumstances in relation to this bill, yet the bill is not specific to those circumstances.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:01):  Let me deal with the questions that have been put to me by Senator Macdonald and Senator Wright. Senator Macdonald, you ask for a definition of 'recklessness'. I know, Senator Macdonald, that you are a lawyer and, from my recollection—because we have known each other for a very long time—a much respected lawyer in North Queensland before you turned your career to public service. So, Senator Macdonald, as you would be aware, recklessness is a term with a technical legal meaning as well as a common-speech meaning. The concept of recklessness involves doing something heedless as to the consequences of one's conduct. So it is something more serious than negligence but something less serious than intention, because it does not involve the element of volition but it does involve the element of doing something heedless of the consequences for others of your conduct.


It is given a reasonably architectural definition in division 5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which I might read, just to give you a complete answer. Section 5.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code defines recklessness in these terms: 


(1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if: 


(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 


(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 


(2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if: 


(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 


(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 


(3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 


Senator Macdonald, what we are dealing with here is recklessness in relation to the commission of a terrorist offence or performing a terrorist act. The way in which the provisions of section 5.4 of the Criminal Code would be attracted, particularly subsection (2), recklessness as to a result, could be seen in a case like this. 


Let it be said that somebody advocates the doing of a terrorist act. If, in their advocacy, they were aware that there was a substantial risk that that would occur—that is, the terrorist act they advocate—and, having regard to the circumstances known to them, it was unjustifiable to take that risk—that being a question of fact to be determined objectively by a jury—that is where the recklessness element would be satisfied, and that is what it means. So, to put flesh on the theoretical bones here, we have all seen instances—whether directly or on social media—of hate preachers advocating, and saying, particularly to young people, 'Go out and commit a terrorist act.' Now that is not the offence of incitement to violence, as I tried to explain to Senator Wright, because there is not the immediacy of the connection between the words and the act. But I think, Senator Macdonald, an experienced lawyer like yourself would well understand that that is a circumstance of recklessness. If you are a person who advocates to impressionable, radicalised youth, that they should go out and commit a terrorist act—a terrorist act being defined elsewhere, of course, as an act of violence for a religious, political or ideological cause—then it may very well be that a jury would conclude: 'You were reckless as to the consequences. You were more than negligent; you were reckless—because in those circumstances, there was a very substantial risk that the audience whom you were addressing would go and do the very thing that you were advocating.' I hope that satisfies your inquiry, Senator Macdonald.


Senator Wright asks what is the definition of promotion. Senator Wright, with respect, you asked the wrong question, because what is being prohibited here is 'advocacy', and 'promotes' is one of the four verbs that are used to define advocacy. So it is the 'advocacy' of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorist offence, that attracts the operation of the new offence provision. To deal with your question directly, a court would read or interpret that word in the context of the words that appear around it, applying ordinary canons of statutory interpretation. So the word 'promotes' would take its meaning from the words around it in the statute: 'counsels, encourages or urges'. None of which, I see, you seek to omit. You are probably aware, Senator Wright, that there are certain areas of the law where the word 'promotes' does have a more technical meaning—for example, in the promotion of companies. But that is an entirely different area of law. So the word 'promotes' can have a technical legal meaning but in this case it does not; it has its ordinary, common-speech meaning, derived from the words that appear adjacent to it in the statute, and that much is made clear by paragraph 700 of the replacement explanatory memorandum. Let me read it to you, since you are not evidently familiar with it—




Senator Wright:
  No; I am familiar with it.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Well, then why did you ask the question, Senator Wright, if you are familiar with it?




Senator Wright:
  I can explain that.




Senator BRANDIS:
  However, let me read it to you:


The terms ‘promotes’ and ‘encourages’ are not defined.  The ordinary meaning of each of the relevant expressions varies, but it is important that they be interpreted broadly to ensure a person who advocates terrorism does not escape punishment by relying on a narrow construction of the terms or one of the terms.  However, some examples of the ordinary meaning of each of the expressions follow: to ‘counsel’ the doing of an act (when used as a verb) is to urge the doing or adoption of the action or to recommend doing the action; to ‘encourage’ means to inspire or stimulate by assistance of approval; to ‘promote’ means to advance, further or launch; and ‘urge’ covers pressing by persuasion or recommendation, insisting on, pushing along and exerting a driving or impelling force.


That is the way in which these expressions are treated in the replacement explanatory memorandum. But, as the explanatory memorandum also says—and as I said—the expressions will have their ordinary language meaning. Therefore, Senator Wright, you do not have to be a lawyer to know what these words mean. They have the same meaning in this section as they have in common speech. The courts and juries, I believe, given the guidance that this provision gives them, can be relied upon to decide whether or not conduct amounts to encouraging, urging, counselling or promoting.


Lastly, Senator Wright, because you did make some rather extravagant claims, I emphasise a point that is too often lost in this debate. We are criminalising conduct. You could not work out before whether this was unnecessary because it was already covered by the law or it was extravagant because it was not already covered by the law. But I think you settled on saying it goes too far because it is not already covered by the law. Whenever the parliament declares something to be unlawful and, indeed, a crime which is not currently a crime, it should do so after careful deliberation, which is why we are having this debate and why the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security looked at this so exhaustively. But we should always remember that the ordinary principles of criminal law are not suspended. That means that the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove every element of the offence, including the recklessness element.


But, secondly, the criminal standard of proof also applies. Let's never forget that. In all of these debates we have about the language of particular statutes and safeguards, the greatest safeguard of all is a principle of English criminal law going back centuries—namely, that the standard of proof for a crime for every element of an offence is beyond reasonable doubt. That is the greatest safeguard of the law. It has been part of our law, as inheritors of the English legal system, for centuries. Every element of this offence, like any other criminal offence, needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (10:12):  I think it is important that I begin by saying that, much like Senator Leyonhjelm, I am not a lawyer. Only in the rarefied air of the Australian Senate, Senator Leyonhjelm, do we have to apologise for not being lawyers! But I assure you that, while in this place we apologise for not being lawyers, once we leave the Senate chamber it is they who have to apologise for being lawyers!


I have a few questions for Senator Brandis, but I wanted to touch on something that Senator Macdonald said that I think was unintentionally clumsily phrased. Senator Macdonald made the point that he is prepared to give up some of his freedom for security and safety. That is the kind of language and debate that we have heard a lot in recent times when we talk about these things. While I see the point that Senator Macdonald is making, I always get concerned when people use that kind of language because I hold—and I know others in this chamber do as well; maybe almost everyone in this place does—a slightly more sophisticated view, which is that our safety stems from our freedom, not the other way around. I do not like the characterisation that we sometimes make in this place or in simplistic media commentary that there has to be some kind of trade-off between being free and being safe and that there is somehow an equilibrium. While I understand in a practical sense that they sometimes can come into conflict with each other, I think we have to be more sophisticated and more intelligent in how we approach these debates and start talking about how we can have an environment in which we are safe and secure that makes us more free, not less free. That is the challenge that we have in this place.


I also want to note that I have a lot of sympathy for where Senator Wright is going with her amendments. I am going to explain a bit about why I slightly disagree with her. The point that is being made here—that is, making sure the bar is high—is the right one. I did not have a chance to speak in the second reading debate and I do want to speak specifically to the amendments, but in doing so I will ask for a tiny bit of indulgence from the Senate to talk around the issues that relate to the amendment as well as the wording of the amendments. Senator Brandis, I think it is really important as we go forward and look at the amendments in this debate that we acknowledge the real obligation here is not just what we do as law-makers to set the regulations but how we engage with the communities themselves—the Muslim communities in particular, which are obviously more directly impacted by some of the debates that are happening—and how we create an environment of engagement with them. I want to note and put on the record the incredible work of adult of Muslim leaders around Australia, in particular, as I come from Sydney, people like Samier Dandan from the Lebanese Muslim Association, people like Dr Jamal Rifi, people like Maha Abda from the Muslim Women's Association and Muslim community leaders who have actually stepped up and said, 'This isn't part of our community. There is no place for this in our society. We do not support this.' When we have these debates we have a real responsibility to acknowledge and respect the fact that those Muslim community leaders at the coalface who are confronting these issues on a regular and daily basis deserve our encouragement and our acknowledgement of the work they do.


We talk about who the victims are of those who are out there inciting or encouraging or promoting—whatever language you want to use—terrorism. I do not want to forget the fact that the victims of this are not just those people in Syria, Jordan, Iraq and the Middle East region where foreign fighters go to fight. They are the victims, of course, but in a lot of cases you have impressionable young people at a very delicate age who are, let us face it—I would like to use the word that Senator Leyonhjelm used on the outside of parliament, but I do not believe that the word beginning with the letter 'd' and ending in the word 'head' is parliamentary, so I will not use it. We forget that they also can be victims of this. The community becomes a victim. Their families also become victims. In a lot of cases they are impressionable youth, a lot of whom come from south-west Sydney, and—I want to be honest here—a lot of their life experiences up to a certain point were not all that different from some of my life experiences. That makes me wonder about and question what influences they have had and what community influence has at times led those impressionable youths to make those kinds of decisions.


Those in the Senate chamber know me well. I was four when I came to Australia. I came from that part of the world. I was born in a small fishing village in northern Iran. I look at the incredible opportunity and experience that this country has given me and, when I see a 17-year-old youth on the front page of The Daily Telegraph out there making ridiculous statements halfway across the world, I question what led to that happening. Why I support a lot of this is that part of what these laws are doing is acknowledging that the people who also have a responsibility are the people who incite, who encourage, who promote and who push impressionable youth to make foolish and ridiculous decisions. I would say to Senator Brandis that where this legislation is going on that front is a good step and that the implicit acknowledgements we can make are that there are many victims of terrorism, that there are many victims of this kind of behaviour and that the community itself and the families of these people also become victims. The responsibility should and needs also to lie with them. Do not get me wrong: if people travel halfway around the world to participate in horrible, brutal acts they deserve to be punished and as they commit crimes they deserve to have the full force of the law thrown at them. But the people who are inciting them, the people who are pushing them, the people who are promoting them, the people who are using their positions of power over impressionable youth to make them make these foolish and improper decisions also deserve to have punishment. The wording of the amendment concerns me, Senator Wright. I understand the intention of what you are trying to achieve. I have a very strong view that these impressionable youths can also at times be victims, based on the information that they are being provided.


On the idea about how much time there is for the debate, I think Senator Wright makes a fair point about the guillotine and deliberations. I am not an expert in Senate procedure; I do not pretend to be. I do not know what is an appropriate amount of time.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You're not even a lawyer!




Senator DASTYARI:
  I'm not even a lawyer; that's right. I think what has been a good part of this process—I have spoken to other senators as they were going through the parliamentary committee process and the recommendations were being developed—has been the ability to have had some of this debate out there.



Senator Wright interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  What is important is that there be more of this kind of debate. I will take the interjection from Senator Wright, who made the point that my party was part of those deliberations and through the committee process her party was excluded. If that is the case, that does not allow for good legislation. The opportunity to have those kinds of debates in the committee environment as a rule leads to better legislation and better amendments. I acknowledge that Senator Brandis has really gone out of his way to make sure that, from the perspective of the Labor Party, we were fully engaged in this debate. I think that adds to it.


I also acknowledge the real work that a lot of not just the Muslim community leaders that I mentioned earlier but the parliamentarians who have been engaging with the Muslim community. I was at Lakemba mosque on Saturday morning with Scott Morrison. That is not something that most people can say they have done. It was good to see the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection go there. I acknowledge that Senator Fierravanti-Wells in particular has spent a lot of time engaging with the emerging communities of Sydney and the Sydney Muslim communities. We have to be careful in the language we use in this chamber and about the message we send. I am not going to get into a debate now about things like the debate we had on the burqa and whatnot, but we have to be very careful that we are not sending the wrong signal to the sections of the community that are doing their best to try to engage, who want to be part of this process. We have to empower them, speak highly of them and bring them in as part of the process. I know the law enforcement agencies have really gone out of their way—they deserve our congratulations—to try to engage with the community. If the real issue here is a group of impressionable, young, mostly, men—I think almost all are men—from a Middle Eastern background, some of whom were born here, many of whom came here while they were quite young, as I did, then the best people to counter the narrative that they are getting, of hate and of the incitement of violence, are those within their own community. It is about empowering those kinds of voices.


Senator Brandis, turning more specifically to the question, I hope this question is not too far from the amendment so that it is one you can answer. I would not mind if you are able to touch on, while we talk about the specifics and the wording of this amendment, what the government is doing not just in the letter of the law but to try and make sure that we are engaging with Muslim community leaders and empowering them. When we talk about the issue of those who incite and those who encourage reckless behaviour we must talk not just about punishing those who have committed the crime but encouraging those who on the opposite end are trying to send the right kind of message to the community.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:24):  The very message we are trying to send to the community is a message to discourage its members, particularly its young members, from engaging in this kind of conduct. In a sense, Senator Dastyari, once a person has been radicalised and once a person has travelled to Syria or northern Iraq to fight with ISIL—as, sadly, we have seen some young Australian men doing in media reports in recent days—in most cases, frankly, they are lost. They are lost. One aspect of social conduct that is very troubling is how swiftly apparently ordinary, everyday Australian youths can be radicalised. There have been many instances of individuals being radicalised in a very short span of time that we know about. That, Senator Dastyari, by the way is why we need to have this advocacy of terrorism offence. I do not seem to be able to get through to some members of the Senate, but I am sure you understand, Senator Dastyari, that, when you create a climate in which the advocacy of terrorism is acceptable, then you constrain your capacity to prevent those who by advocating terrorism encourage young men—sometimes unsure of their identity, sometimes unsure about the path or the course of their life, sometimes unsure about their belief system and where they fit into family or social structures—to embrace this radical solution.


So, Senator Dastyari, preventing young people becoming radicalised by measures, such as the measure we are now debating, is absolutely critical. The measures for the advocacy of terrorism are not directed, at least primarily, at the vulnerable young men who are the targets; they are directed to the evil old men who are the proselytisers, the predators and the advocates who seek to ensnare young men in this false, perverted and distorted version of the Islamic faith.


Another important element, Senator, is our engagement with Islamic communities. I am glad you were at Lakemba the other day with my friend Scott Morrison. He, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I and many other members of the government in our own electorates and our communities have spent a lot of time—as I am sure opposition members of parliament like you have done as well—reaching out to these communities. I spoke in the debate last night about the many meetings I have had with leaders of the Islamic community to engage them as our partners in this task. They are some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this legislation—they are because they know it is designed to address a problem that arises, in particular, in their communities. It is intensely, deeply threatening to those communities and threatening to the vulnerable young people in their communities. We will continue to engage. When the Prime Minister and I announced a suite of measures on 5 August, one of the most important of those measures was a very substantial sum of money to invest in our Countering Violent Extremism programs, which are being delivered through the Australian Federal Police, through state police agencies and other government agencies.


There are other things that civil society does and can do. Only recently, on the day before the AFL Grand Final, I went to Melbourne to present the Bachar Houli Cup, which is a wonderful initiative promoted by the AFL in Melbourne. It recruits young Muslim men who want careers as AFL football players into a scholarship and mentoring program inspired by Australia's first great AFL player who professes the Islamic faith, Bachar Houli—it was my great privilege to meet him that morning—and engage them through sport. I can say, as a former sports minister, that engagement of young people through sport is one of the best possible ways of avoiding alienation and promoting a sense of belonging and inclusion. In a broad sense that is what the Prime Minister means whenever he uses the term 'Team Australia'—that we are all part of the team. In a narrow sense, that is what the AFL is doing, by saying to these young men who are participants in the Bachar Houli program, 'You are part of our particular team'—which is but an element of the great variety of the many community groups to which people feel a sense of belonging and which, in aggregate, amounts to 'Team Australia'.


Senator, the observations you have made are very wise, if I may say so. I know you have been very constructive in your own communities and networks, and have been a very constructive force in promoting this agenda of inclusion in trying to prevent young men feeling so alienated that they become radicalised and prey to the false doctrines of those who would seek to recruit them for evil purposes, to do violence to themselves and to others. The legislative element of this is only one element of a whole-of-government approach, and I appreciate the Labor Party supporting and seeing the wisdom of having this element securely in place.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:31):  I have a couple of very brief comments to make in response to the answers that the Attorney-General gave to my question about the meaning of 'promotes' earlier.


I would also like to seek the guidance of the chair. Last night, when I began to address this amendment (12) on sheet 7594, I indicated that I would like to move this amendment separately to amendment (13), although they are amendments that relate to the same offence of advocating terrorism. In the interests of time, I am wondering if it would be possible to deal with these two amendments together.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi

Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I would like to speak on the leave question.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  It is not a question; Senator Wright is seeking leave. Leave is either granted or it is not.

  Leave is granted, but I want to address amendment (13), which I have not yet addressed.


Leave granted.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:32):  I move Australian Greens amendment (13) on sheet 7594:


(13) Schedule 1, item 61, page 64 (line 1), omit ""promotes,"".



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We are now considering amendments (12) and (13) on sheet 7594 standing in the name of the Australian Greens.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I would like to do that; indeed, we have been discussing the second amendment inadvertently anyway, which is removing the word 'promotes' from the definition of advocating terrorism. We have been having a relevant discussion about that particular amendment.


If I could come back to the question that I posed to the Attorney-General, which was asking for what the meaning of the word 'promotes' is. The Attorney-General suggested that it takes its ordinary meaning. In that case, I guess any of us in the chamber would probably be equipped to try to define what 'promotes' means.


The Attorney-General tried to reassure me about the concerns that I was expressing, but that have also have been expressed by many legal commentators, about the broadness of the word 'promotes' and the uncertainty that that would create, in terms of understanding whether particular behaviour would be defined to be promoting terrorism. The Attorney-General was wanting to reassure us that if it went to a court case and a prosecution, then the burden of proof is 'beyond reasonable doubt'. However, one of the concerns raised is that, when we are dealing with laws that do not define particular behaviours with certainty and clarity, there is a chilling effect on those people who do not want to end up in a court where the prosecution has to be put to the standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt. The risk is that people will pull right back from what would, potentially, be considered to be legitimate activity—because they are justifiably fearful about the consequences.


The Attorney-General also sought to reassure us that the government's view on what 'promotes might mean is set out in the explanatory memorandum. But—as Senator Leyonhjelm has pointed out several times in this debate already—courts, in interpreting legislation, will only have recourse to the explanatory memorandum if they feel it necessary to do so. In fact, it is quite rare. They would generally prefer to look at the wording of the offence itself in the legislation. That is why it is also desirable to have clarity and certainty about what words and terms mean.


An example that has been raised by legal commentators to illustrate the risks associated with having terms like 'promotes'—where it is not really clear how far they extend—is that of a person who 'likes' a Facebook comment which contains a favourable reference to terrorist activity. Would that fall within the definition of 'promoting or advocating terrorism to others'? What about someone who is wearing a T-shirt with an ISIL symbol on it? Although that is not a T-shirt that would be in my wardrobe, and I would not be encouraging my kids to wear it—it would be abhorrent to me—that would be, arguably, a legitimate form of political expression in Australia. I think most of us would be reluctant to prevent it—someone indicating an allegiance to something that we do not necessarily agree with. But there are serious issues here about freedom of expression and how far that freedom of expression may be affected by this legislation. So in absolute good faith, that is the reason that, if we cannot get clarity about the word 'promotes', the Greens will be seeking to have the word 'promotes' removed from the definition of 'advocating terrorism'. That is all I intend to say in this debate. I seek leave to move these amendments together.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:36):  Chairman, could I respond to that, before Senator Collins makes her contribution?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Yes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Wright, I have told you and I have pointed out to you the relevant paragraph of the explanatory memorandum. The word 'promotes' has its common-speech meaning, so please do not say to the chamber that I cannot tell you what it means, when I have just told you what it means and I have just directed you to a longish discussion about the meaning in the explanatory memorandum. Frankly, Senator Wright, because it has its common-speech meaning you need look no further than the Oxford English Dictionary or the Macquarie Dictionary to satisfy yourself what the word means if you do not already know.


There is no useful purpose to be served by imagining hypothetical instances of what may or may not be caught by a statutory definition expressed in common English, because that is what courts do. We have a separation of powers in this country. It is not for the parliament to define, by legislation or by regulation, every single imaginable instance. That would be bad legislative practice. It is not for the parliament to set out in an act of parliament whether, for example, a T-shirt or a particular form of words is caught by a general statutory prohibition. That is what courts do. They apply the generic language of statutes to the facts of particular cases.


I think we can rely upon and trust the judges and juries to apply this clear statutory language to particular instances. The debate is not served by imagining instances which could conceivably come before the courts and ask, 'What does the statute have to say about that?' That is not our job. It is not my job as the Attorney-General and the person moving this bill; it is not your job or our jobs as senators deliberating upon this bill; it is the job of the courts to apply the law.


Senator Wright, I do not think I need go beyond that. I have already made the point. I do not want to be tedious and repeat myself, but it does not seem to be getting through to you that this is not about freedom of expression. This is about the advocacy of terrorism. The advocacy of terrorism is not the expression of an opinion; it is the injunction to an act of violence. If you cannot see the distinction, Senator Wright, I suspect most senators can.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:39):  As I indicated before, I am happy for the Greens to move amendments (12) and (13) together. However, my earlier comments were quite discrete with respect to amendment (12). Whilst I indicated that we were now dealing with the 'advocating terrorism' element of the bills and that we had circulated amendments to deal with that issue, I would like to deal with Labor's position in more detail at that stage.


I should now, for the benefit of the Senate, indicate that Labor has circulated revised and further amendments because, through further consideration and discussions, we have determined to take a different approach to dealing with this issue. I will come to the detail of those when I receive advice as to where in the running sheet we should address those amendments. 


With respect to Greens amendment (13), which was similar to our previous approach, in the amendments that we first provided, I should indicate that on the basis of Labor's new approach addressing this issue we would be opposing amendment (13) with respect to removing the word 'promote'. 


I appreciate the Greens' concern here. Indeed, up until recently we had sought to address the issue in a similar way. On the basis of further advice—senators will see our changed position in amendments on sheet 7605—we believe that this approach ensures that our concerns that the breadth of these provisions not touch behaviour which would not be reasonably regarded as advocating terrorism are dealt with in this new fashion.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi

Question negatived. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We will now move to opposition amendments. Is it appropriate, Senator Collins, for us to deal with opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7601 (revised) and opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7605 concurrently, now?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:43):  At this stage I hope to proceed simply with amendment (1) on sheet 7605. I move the amendment:


(1) Schedule 1, page 64 (after line 14), after item 61, insert:




61A


After subsection


80.3(1)



Insert:


(1A) Without limiting subsection (1), section 80.2C does not apply to a person who engages in good faith in public discussion of any genuine academic, artistic, scientific, political or religious matter.


Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1A). See subsection 13.3(3).




61B


Subsection


80.3(2)



After ""subsection (1)"", insert ""or (1A)"".


As I mentioned before, these deal with our further considered approach in relation to managing our concerns about advocating terrorism. As we have indicated, we are concerned about the breadth of the new 'advocating terrorism' offence. In our consultation with the Australian community—and especially with representatives of the Muslim community, that I think Senator Dastyari has covered today—we have heard concerns that this new offence might capture quite legitimate speech on controversial political matters or that it might capture legitimate religious discussion, debate or preaching.


Labor agrees with the need for an offence addressing conduct which might cause others to engage in terrorism. We know that there is a line to be carefully drawn. We would never want to criminalise legitimate religious conduct or to cause the Muslim community to fear that honest religious activity would be criminalised. That would be completely contrary to our purpose.


Labor's amendment would expand the existing good faith defence in section 80.3 of the Criminal Code as it applies to the new advocacy of terrorism offence to make it clear that those who engage in good faith in public discussion of any genuine academic, artistic, scientific, political or religious matter will be protected from liability. We think this strikes the right balance. We support the new offence, but we want to make sure that it does not capture innocent conduct. We think that this amendment will make sure that this new offence does not go too far.


I am in the hands of the Senate as to whether, given that these amendments have been recently circulated, we might want to defer consideration to a later stage in the committee stage of debate to allow some consideration of the detail of these. Maybe I will add some humour to the debate at this stage. I also am not a lawyer. It might entertain senators to understand that Senator Brandis, many years ago, had assumed I was a lawyer, to which I laughed and indicated that it might have been my major in logic!



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  This was many years ago, Senator Brandis, I think in the context of the 'children overboard' investigation. That said, I obviously have been dealing with making laws for many years. I appreciate that some time to consider the new approach that Labor has taken on this issue might be important to other senators, so I am in their hands as to whether they might seek to defer dealing with these amendments until later in the debate, if some further consideration is warranted.

It is very well drafted, very well thought through and I think it would be difficult for the government to oppose it. Bear in mind that we have had the word 'bipartisan' used a great deal in the debate about this bill and also the national security bill that we considered last month. I just make the comment that I think bipartisanship works both ways.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:47):  The government opposes the Labor Party's amendment. This is, as Senator Collins has said candidly, the second position the Labor Party has taken on this issue. There has been some reconsideration evidently within the Labor Party's inner circles. I welcome the fact that the initial amendment has been withdrawn, but nevertheless the government cannot support this amendment. We do not support the amendment for a very simple reason, Senator Collins: it is entirely unnecessary because what the amendment does is provide—we are talking about 7605 at the moment?




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  No, Senator Brandis. We are dealing with 7601.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  No, I beg your pardon, senators. We are dealing with 7601.




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is not what Senator Collins was talking about. She was talking about 7605.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Amendment (1) on 7605.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Collins and I understand each other. We are dealing with a proposed amendment to subsection 80.3(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, by which the opposition would include a provision specifying that section 80.2C—that is, the advocacy of terrorism offence—does not apply to a person who engaged in good faith in public discussion of any genuine academic, artistic, scientific, political or religious matter. The government opposes this amendment for a couple of reasons. On a narrow reading it is unnecessary because what section 80.2C would do is make it an offence to advocate terrorism—to advocate the commission of a terrorist offence or to engage in a terrorist act. It is inconceivable that a person could, if they are advocating the commission of a terrorist offence or engagement in a terrorist act, be merely acting bona fides in a public discussion of political or religious matters.


The amendment that Senator Collins has moved, for reasons I explained to Senator Wright earlier in the morning, is quite unnecessary. There is nothing in the proposed advocacy of terrorism offence which would capture the expression of political or religious opinions, unless they were to trespass beyond being merely the expression of opinions and become the advocacy of violence. That is what this captures. The distinction between the expression of opinions and the advocacy of violence is a very clear distinction. So the Labor Party amendment, on a strict view, is unnecessary.


It is also invidious for another reason. You will recall that I said to Senator Wright before that we should always conduct these debates about the introduction of new criminal offences mindful of the fact that the onus of proof lies on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt before a jury that every element of the offence has been committed, and the jury must also consider any defences that might be raised. The very vagueness of the terms 'academic', 'political' or 'religious' matters as such could very well cause confusion in the minds of jurors. I would not expect that the typical juror would be a scholar of the Koran. Let us say that, in relation to a particular prosecution in which terrorism was advocated, it was said by an expert witness, 'This is really consistent with a particular passage of an Islamic holy book.' There are a variety of claims made about every religious faith. There are a variety of contestable claims made about what constitutes the doctrine of every religious faith. I have said from start to finish in this debate that Islam is a religion of peace and that those who preach the doctrines of ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra and the other radical deviants from that religion do not represent the views of that religious faith. But let us say that in a prosecution a particular scholar with a particular point of view were to contend to the contrary. Does that mean that a jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there should be a prosecution even though what was involved constituted the advocacy of terrorism? So I think, from a technical point of view, this amendment is unnecessary, but from a practical point of view, from the point of view of giving effect to the amendment in the real-world circumstances of a criminal prosecution, it may very well defeat the effect of section 80.2, and that is why the government oppose it and we call on the crossbenchers other than the Greens—who, of course, would support this—to oppose it as well.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  For the purpose of the committee, I called upon 7601 when I called Senator Collins, but we will deal with 7605. Senator Collins, I would now invite you to move that amendment formally.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:53):  Thank you, Chair. I am happy to move as you suggested, but I understood that, when encouraged to deal with 7601 and 7605, I said I sought to just proceed with 7605.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  That is fine.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I have moved it, but I am happy to do so again if it clears that up. As I think I said previously, I was prepared to defer consideration of this, but the senators in the chamber have indicated their positions. The government has too. I am quite disappointed that, given the consultation and effort that has been put into settling this matter, the government has indicated that it will oppose these amendments. Although senators on the crossbench may not have been party to those discussions, into which some considerable effort has been put overnight, to try to reach an acceptable understanding, I would encourage them to understand that these amendments represent a move from Labor's first approach to address this very important issue, as was highlighted by Senator Dastyari. The Australian community's concern is that we get this balance and this provision right, since it is important to our multiculturalism, to our nation and to protecting Australians, whatever their race or creed. I encourage senators on the crossbench, even reflecting on the reservations that Senator Brandis may have made, to err on the side of caution and to support these amendments on that basis.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I invite you to move the amendments, Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I thought I had moved them twice now.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  No. The first time, Senator Collins, you put it to the Senate about deferring the amendment and you never actually moved it, that I recall.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I do so move.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7605 be agreed to.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:04):  by leave—I move government amendments (17), (18) and (21) together:

(21) Schedule 1, item 73, page 67 (lines 11 and 12), omit ""(within the meaning of subsection 117.1(1))"".


These amendments are technical amendments. Amendment (17) inserts a definition for the term 'engage in a hostile activity' into section 100.1 for the purposes of part 5.3 of the Criminal Code. Amendment (21) is a consequential amendment to amendment (17). The effect of the amendments would be to provide that for the purposes of part 5.3 of the Criminal Code 'engage in a hostile activity' has the same meaning as it has where it is defined in the new section 117.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The amendments amend the need to cross-reference that subsection each time the expression is used.

These amendments implement recommendation 9 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by separating the grounds for requesting, making, confirming and varying a control order on the basis of a conviction for a terrorism related offence in Australia, on one hand, and a foreign offence. These amendments also limit the ground in relation to foreign convictions to circumstances where the conduct that resulted in the conviction would be a terrorism offence if it occurred in Australia. The practical effect of the amendments is to require a correlation between a foreign conviction and conduct that would be considered a terrorism offence in Australia. As such, these amendment seek to provide confidence that the control order regime will apply only in relation to the recognised Australian standards of criminal law.

These amendments also constrain that element to conduct that would be a serious offence—one that carries at least two years imprisonment if undertaken within Australia. The two-year threshold is consistent with the definition of 'serious offence' in section 3C of the Crimes Act.

We have a series of amendments, but the first amendment that we would be moving would be to oppose the section of the act which creates the declared areas zone. I ask leave of the committee to that extent, to move the Australian Greens amendment first so that we can be clear on whether or not the committee is willing to support that amendment. It would just make sense logically to deal with that first and then move to the opposition's amendments.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:14):  The Australian Greens oppose schedule 1 in the following terms.


(16) Schedule 1, item 110, page 82 (line 1) to page 85 (line 10), sections 119.2 and 119.3 to be opposed.


On moving item (16), being Australian Greens amendment to remove the declared areas offence in the bill, the bill seeks to create a new offence of entering or remaining in a declared area, which would be punishable by 10 years imprisonment, so it is a significant offence. Under the provision, if it were to be passed, areas in a foreign country can be declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by way of legislative instrument, if he or she is satisfied that a listed terrorist organisation is engaging in a hostile activity in that area of the foreign country. Declarations can last for a maximum of three years.


There is a narrow legitimate purpose defence available for those charged with the substantive offence. The Australian Greens amendment (16) would remove the proposed no-go-zone offence from the bill because it is considered that this offence will unnecessarily and disproportionately restrict freedom of movement in Australia. Certainly views have been expressed and the Greens are of the view that this is potentially an extremely counterproductive outcome. It risks entrenching feelings of isolation and alienation in the very communities in Australia that we rely upon to assist in this fight against terrorism and in order to build social cohesion and inclusion in the Australian community because this offence, if it stays, will criminalise what is perfectly legitimate travel. It will make it punishable by 10 years imprisonment for a person to travel to a declared area and because there is no fault element required, it has the practical—if not the technical—effect of reversing the onus of proof. It would require anyone who is charged with the offence after having travelled to a declared area to bring their own evidence to demonstrate that their travel was not only to fall within a narrow list of legitimate purposes but also that that travel was solely for that reason. For instance, an elderly couple who are travelling to a declared area to visit a dying friend or a young person who is travelling to a declared area to study, or a business person who remained in an area, after it had become a declared area, to conclude a business deal, there is no need to establish any criminal intent. Those people would be subject to potential prosecution upon returning to Australia. Even where there is a legitimate purpose provided for in the offence such as a journalist, they remain liable to be charged with the offence, brought before a criminal court and required to bring evidence to prove that journalism was the sole reason for their travel to escape conviction. 


The legal experts we have been paying attention to have stated that this is yet one more example of a completely unnecessary new offence. The expert advice in this area which we would be referring to is advice from the Law Council of Australia, the Gilbert and Tobin Centre for Public Law, the Australian Human Rights Commission, Professor Ben Saul, Human Rights Watch and the Human Rights Law Centre. The Parliamentary Joint Committee for Human Rights has also expressed concerns about the potential incompatibility of this provision with human rights in Australia.


Australia's criminal laws, which we asked the chamber to consider, already cover well and truly circumstances where a person leaves Australia in order to participate in hostile or terrorist activities overseas, as well as circumstances where a person encourages or urges another person to engage in such activities or a person who financially or otherwise supports terrorist or criminal organisations. That is the reason that the Australian Greens are moving to have this offence removed from the bill. I have some questions to which I really would appreciate the Attorney-General's response. The first I will put to the Attorney-General in relation to the offence as it stands in the bill at this stage is why the government has chosen to frame this offence in such a way that departs so significantly from the type of established criminal law and rule of law principles that the Attorney has a tradition of vigorously defending.

This is a new offence which is being created. I will wait until you have asked whatever questions you want to ask me before speaking at length about the desirability of the provision, but this is no departure from established rule of law principles merely to create a new criminal offence, a very narrow one, subject to the ordinary defences which are provided for in the generic provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, transparent on the face of the statute with no reverse of the onus of proof, no reduction in the standard of proof and beyond the generic defences a series of specific defences which in the government's view deal with legitimate reasons for travel to declared areas. There is nothing unusual about this. How you think merely because it is a newly expressed offence that that is a departure from the rule of law escapes me.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:20):  I am happy to elaborate on why the Australian Greens and certainly other legal commentators are of the view that it is a significant  departure from established principles and that is the offence has been drafted in such a way as to have the same effect, without being semantic, as a reversal of the onus of proof because, while the prosecution has to prove that a person was in the declared area, that is all they have to prove initially and the defendant is then guilty of the offence unless the defendant brings evidence to demonstrate that the travel was solely for one of the listed legitimate purposes—if you want to respond to that first, Attorney-General.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:21):  I am happy to, Senator Wright. This is a red –herring argument which has been raised many times. There is no reversal of the onus of proof here at all. The way the criminal law works is that an offence—let us assume we are talking about statutory offences—is defined and the prosecution bears the onus of proving every element of that offence beyond reasonable doubt. Then defences are provided for. If an accused person seeks to rely upon a defence then they have to bring forward evidence to discharge what, as you would know as a lawyer, Senator Wright, is known as 'the evidential onus', to show that there is sufficient material upon which that defence may be invoked. That is not a reversal of the onus of proof. It is merely to say that, if a criminal defendant seeks to rely upon a defence, he or she has to bring sufficient facts before the court to demonstrate the availability of that defence. That has never been regarded as a reversal of the onus of proof.

 (Victoria) (11:22):  Given the way the committee is moving, I think it might be opportune for Labor to indicate its position in relation to the declared areas matter, rather than waiting until I formally move my amendments, in response to these amendments moved by Senator Wright, because we have now moved through the first of Labor's main concerns, which were those in relation to the issues that we dealt with around advocating terrorism. The second main area where we had concerns arising out of the intelligence committee's consideration was this declared area provision. The third major area in which we had concerns was that around the provisions with respect to welfare measures. I should indicate that we appreciate the government's cooperation in relation to those third measures, and we will come to those subsequently if we have time in the debate, but if we do not have sufficient time I want to indicate that we have appreciated the government's cooperation in accepting our concerns there. We would, however, like them to consider what we are now addressing in our amendments regarding declared areas. I will come to those in a moment.


As to these Greens amendments which would remove the entirety of the declared areas offence, we believe that the approach that we have circulated in revised schedule 7601 renders it a workable and useful tool for our agencies. So we obviously accept, with the intelligence committee's advice, that such a tool is warranted. Our concern about protecting the rights of the accused is what we will be dealing with in our amendment.


As we know, the bill creates a new offence in relation to people who travel to areas declared by the foreign minister. A number of members of the intelligence committee were unsatisfied with the prescription and limited range of excuses available to persons accused of travelling to or remaining in such a declared area. These committee members argued that a general exclusion should be available to those with a wholly legitimate purpose for being in a declared area. Specifically, the intelligence committee stated, at 2.387 of their report:


Committee members had different views about whether the declared area offence as currently drafted would be an effective and workable provision. Some members of the Committee questioned whether the legitimate concerns presented in evidence had been adequately addressed, particularly in relation to the evidential burden and the limited range of legitimate purposes for travel to declared areas. The Committee notes that the proposed INSLM—


the proposed security monitor—


and Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security reviews leading into the sunset provision will enable this to be more fully explored.


At 2.388, the committee reflected that:


Some members of the Committee believed that, given the seriousness of offences arising under this section that it is appropriate for there to be a 'wholly legitimate purposes' general provision in the legislation.


So, in accordance with these comments of the intelligence committee, Labor will be moving amendments to provide a general defence of wholly legitimate purposes for those accused of travelling to or remaining in a declared area. We do not believe that it is possible for the parliament to anticipate in advance every possible legitimate reason for a person to travel to a declared area.


Our amendment to this provision will recognise the critical role that the third arm of government, our judiciary and the criminal justice system, plays in our democracy. We think that it is entirely appropriate for the courts to determine whether a person travelling to a declared area has done so for a solely legitimate purpose. Labor believes that it is entirely appropriate and just for a judge or a jury to decide whether a person has travelled to a declared area for a sole and legitimate purpose, assuming that the police and the DPP have decided to charge that person with that offence. To expect that the parliament can, here and now, anticipate all legitimate reasons for a person to be in a declared area is a serious mistake that could potentially create a very unjust law. Our amendment, creating a general defence for a sole legitimate reason for travelling to a declared area, does not fix all of the problems with this offence, but it at least provides a more just and appropriate defence to those who may be charged, and our amendment recognises the critical role that the judiciary and our courts have in administering our criminal laws rather than trying to circumvent that role, as the government's more prescriptive approach clearly seeks to do.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:28):  I did not want to necessarily jump in ahead of the Attorney-General, if he wanted to respond, but I had some further questions for the Attorney-General, to make sense of how this would actually work in practice. As to being accused of using hypothetical examples: I think it is actually very much the role of this chamber to be saying: 'This is the law you want us to pass. How will it actually work on the ground? How will it be interpreted? What are the likely consequences, and the effects on people's lives?'


Attorney-General, you were saying that this is not a departure from traditional legal principles of criminal law. You have not acknowledged that what it does effectively do is to criminalise something that is without any intention on the part of a person. It criminalises something that would have been perfectly legitimate before the offence became law. But I am interested specifically to ask why the offence departs so significantly from the Attorney-General's Department's own guide to drafting Commonwealth offences which provides, for example, that:


The requirement for proof of fault is one of the most fundamental protections in criminal law. This reflects the premise that it is generally neither fair, nor useful, to subject people to criminal punishment for unintended actions or unforeseen consequences unless these resulted from an unjustified risk (ie recklessness).


In this case, I am genuinely trying to understand what the fault is if you are going to criminalise what is perfectly legitimate travel. Is that the fault? Is the fault being in the declared area and staying there, or going into a declared area when in fact no malice or wrong intentions are necessary to create the offence? It is just a matter of having to prove when you come back that you had what the government considers to be a legitimate purpose. And we will go into the inadequacies in what legitimate purposes are in a minute.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:30):  That is a very good question, if I may say so, and I am happy to be able to provide you with the answer. The provision does not depart from the Attorney-General's Department's recommended guidelines. It does make clear the fault elements. There are two aspects to it. The fault element in relation to travel to or remaining in a declared area is intention, so that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person intended to travel to or intended to remain in the particular locality.


The fault element in relation to the person's knowledge of whether or not the locality was a declared area is recklessness. Earlier on in the debate I read to Senator Macdonald the Criminal Code's definition of 'recklessness' for the purposes of the generic fault provisions of that statute, and you were in the chamber when I did that, so I will not waste time reading them to you again. So, that is the answer to your question. A fault element in relation to travel or remaining there is intention. The fault element in relation to awareness of whether or not that particular locality is declared is recklessness.


While I am on my feet, Senator, I might point out, particularly since you have frequently invoked the Australian Human Rights Commission in support of your position, that the Australian Human Rights Commission, in its commentary on this provision, some of which I acknowledge is critical, actually acknowledged that there was no reversal of the onus of proof. The Human Rights Commission acknowledged that the position is exactly as I have explained to you: that a person seeking to invoke one of the defences has an evidential onus to bring forward the facts before the court so that the court can be possessed of the facts constituting the defence. But in relation to all of the elements that constitute the offence, there is no reversal of the onus or proof.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:33):  I did actually say, and I made it quite clear, that it is an effective reversal of the onus of proof, not a technical one. When we consider the fault element you are relying on, the fault is travel or remaining in the geographical area. That is the fault at the heart of this offence. I would say that that is actually a serious departure from established criminal law principles, in that traditionally crimes have been actions or behaviour that have an element that is inherently negative, malicious or harmful to other people. It is actually quite unprecedented through the enactment of a provision, through the writing of a new offence, to criminalise something that on its own is perfectly legitimate. Indeed, freedom of movement is an important human right. To talk about the fault element of the travelling or remaining in an area as being within the scope of ordinary criminal law is nonsensical. There is no inherent harm or wrongful behaviour in people exercising their right to travel. There has not been previously, and the Australian Greens and many others are very concerned at the precedent this is setting.


What I am interested in following up is what will happen to a person who is already in an area when it is declared. How will they find out that they are committing a criminal offence by remaining in that area, if they are not aware that it has been declared, and are at risk of criminal punishment upon their return to Australia.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:35):  I am afraid that the law of evidence is by its nature a very technical area. So, Senator Wright, with respect it gets you nowhere to say, 'Well, Senator Brandis, you might be technically right about the law of evidence, but effectively this is a reversal of the onus of proof.' This is a technical area, and when you say 'Well, although you are technically right, effectively it is different,' you are coming very close to a Dennis Denuto like observation about it being 'the vibe'. The fact is that the law of evidence—and the principles by which courts determine where the onus of proof lies, and the distinction between the persuasive onus and the evidential onus—is a very technical area. Let us not try to mask our refusal to accept the technicality of the area by reverting to non-technical language.


Senator Wright, contrary to what you say—that this is unprecedented or unknown to the law—it is very common for our law to say that it is prohibited to go to a particular area. Let me give you a few examples. It is against the law of Australia to go to certain areas in South Australia that are used for the purposes of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed—although I am thinking of that particular example inspired by the presence behind me of the distinguished Senator Fawcett—in general it is against the law for a person to go to a military base or to attend upon a military base, without authority to do so. It is against the law, in many instances, for a person to go into Indigenous territories without appropriate permissions. It is, I think you will find, Senator Wright, against the law for people to go to certain areas of the Australian Antarctic Territories without permission. The idea that it is unknown to the law that there should be a prohibition on a person visiting a particular place is, with respect, quite erroneous. It is a perfectly commonplace form of prohibition and a prohibition of that kind has been extended in this particular case to areas declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as satisfying the statutory tests as being no-go zones for Australian travellers. This is essentially because those areas are areas where Australians have no place being, because they are areas under the control of terrorist armies. In a practical sense, that is the way this legislation is going to operate. There are exceptions and defences, as you have acknowledged, but I challenge utterly the suggestion that it is unusual for the law to prohibit a person visiting certain specified localities. That is just not right at all.

 (South Australia) (11:39):  Attorney-General, I think you might have forgotten the question that I asked at the end of that, which was: what will happen to a person when they are already in an area when it is declared and how will they find out that they are at risk of criminal punishment upon return to Australia?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:39):  If a person is in an area when it is declared, they commit the offence by intentionally remaining there and they commit the offence if the recklessness element of having reckless disregard as to whether or not the area is a declared area is made out by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will, in the event that an area were to be declared, take extensive steps to publicise that matter, including on the web and through social media.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:39):  How will a person demonstrate that his or her travel is solely for a listed legitimate purpose? And how will the prosecution rebut such a defence if it is raised? This requirement of 'solely' has been causing a great deal of concern among legal commentators.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:40):  It would not be causing a great deal of concern among legal commentators who are familiar with testing 'sole purpose'. It might cause vexation to Professor Ben Saul—Professor Saul is an international lawyer—but it would not be causing a lot of concern to practitioners and legal commentators who understand that, in many areas of the law, courts are every day seized of determining the question of purpose in determining the question of state of mind. That includes determining whether or not a person's purposes in engaging in a particular act are a sole purpose or one of a variety of purposes. This is not hard, Senator. 


Let me give you an example in a practical sense of why it is necessary to have a sole purpose test if one is to invoke one of the variety of exemptions. One of the exemptions in proposed section 119.23(g) is making a bona fide visit to a family member. I imagine, Senator Wright, that you think that it should be all right for a person who makes a bona fide visit to a family member not to be caught by this prohibition. But let us say that a person would have travelled to a declared area and, in the course of making a bona fide visit to a family member, were also to facilitate the travel to, let us say, a township in northern Iraq under the control of ISIL, were also to facilitate the travel of foreign fighters to that township or were also to provide financial or other material sustenance to ISIL. Then, unless we have a sole purpose test, the ordinary law would be that as long as it was a substantial purpose, then the defence would be available. So if the person in the hypothetical case I have given were to say: 'It may well be that I travelled to this particular township in order to assist ISIL but, as it happens, my brother lives in this township and I actually did visit him and my desire to visit my brother was a bona fide desire to make a family visit.' We cannot have what I think we both acknowledge to be a legitimate exemption used as a mask or a pretext or a ruse to conceal purposes which, I am sure you would agree with me, ought not to be legitimate. But unless we have a sole purpose test, that could happen.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:43):  I suppose a different example that has been brought to my attention would be for us to perhaps imagine an elderly couple, who have been living in Australia for a long time, who return to see family, perhaps for the last time before they die. While they are there making a bona fide visit to a family member, because they are returning to an area where they have perhaps grown up, they are invited to go to a wedding of people who are not family members but who are in another town and they travel there for that. Again, I do not want to be accused of raising hypothetical examples, because these are the very live examples and fears that people have who need to take account of this legislation. My concern is that, even if in the end you say that a court will interpret this, a court will give people the benefit of the doubt and so on, the real concern here is that this restriction will have a chilling effect. Those people will not even potentially take the risk of going or will not take up an opportunity like that, of attending a wedding of a friend in a different village, which would seem to be perfectly legitimate, perfectly harmless, perfectly reasonable and perfectly understandable

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:44):  The courts are very practised, as I said a moment ago, in determining state of mind, and part of that forensic process is to determine whether a purpose is a sole purpose or one of a multiplicity of purposes.


In the example you have given, it would seem to me that, if there were a trivial, incidental event that was not the sole purpose of the travel but was engaged in while the person was travelling to a declared area for the sole purpose of, in the example you have just instanced, making a bone fide family visit, that would not defeat their reliance on the defence. We can quibble at the margins. You know the old legal maxim 'de minimis non curat lex'? Trivial, incidental examples would not defeat the operation of this principle, but the principle is important: a person must be travelling solely for that legitimate purpose. Now, if while they are there they do something entirely incidental that is not the sole purpose or even a purpose of their travel, I would not think that that would defeat them.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:46):  I will come back to an operational question now, about the way the offence would operate in practice. How would areas be declared in such a way as to be responsive to the fluidity of war and conflict? For example, would a new declaration be made each time a new Syrian city or region is embroiled in conflict, or is it envisaged that a blanket declaration would be issued?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:46):  That would be a judgement for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to make. Obviously, because we are talking about geography here, areas will be defined by descriptions of a location. In my view, the description of the location should be as specific as possible to give people as much guidance as possible. I take your point about the mobility of modern warfare. There is, of course, a lot of immobility in warfare as well, as we have seen in more recent wars, but, in a highly mobile environment where, for example, the front changes often, obviously that will require a judgement to be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not a particular locality should be added to the list.


I think we are a little bit jumping at shadows, Senator Wright. I said at the initial press conference with the Prime Minister on 5 August that I expected a provision like this would be used very sparingly. I remain of that view. It is, as you rightly say, an unusual provision. A decision, not by me but by the foreign affairs minister, to make such a declaration would be made on the best advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and perhaps, I dare say, the Department of Defence and the description of the area would be a geographical description.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, before I give you the call, it was with the indulgence of the chamber that we moved away from the running order and I wonder if you might give an indication of what time you think we will bring this question to a close.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:48):  Thank you, Mr Chairman. That is a fair question and I was about to indicate that. I thought I would speak briefly to the consequential amendments so that I will not need to speak about those again, and then I will ask that this amendment, regarding the removal of the offence, be put to the chamber for decision. Then I imagine that Senator Collins will move her further amendment.



The CHAIRMAN:  Yes, I then want to go back to that amendment.




Senator WRIGHT:
  Given that we have now, in a sense, moved in the debate to the other aspects of the amendments that the Greens will be moving, I will not need to speak to those later. I totally understand your concerns about the time. I will speak briefly about those amendments and then I will have nothing more to say on this.


I indicate that the consequential amendments that the Greens will be moving, if the first Greens' amendment is not successful, will add an element of intent to the offence—that is item 1 on sheet 7598—and to expand the definition or broaden the range of legitimate behaviour defences for this offence by expanding the range of legitimate purposes, to allow for the making of a bona fide visit to a friend or personal or business associate, to provide legal advice, or to perform a bona fide business, teaching or research obligation such as archaeology or some kind of research at an educational or teaching institution.


Finally, the Greens' amendment to deal with legitimate purposes in the way a court may interpret those is to create a provision whereby the court would ultimately have discretion—any other purpose that the court determines is legitimate in all the circumstances—which would, in the Greens' view, appropriately give the decision making about what is a serious criminal offence to the judiciary.


Certainly, the Attorney-General has reassured us that this provision would not be used very often, he envisages, and that we really need to trust that this is a sensible provision that will not be misused. Unfortunately, what we know is that, once there is a provision on the books—once legislation is there—governments come and go, attorneys-general and ministers for foreign affairs come and go, and the provision is there, able to be relied upon. Some kind of suggestion that we should just be reassured that it will not be abused is not actually satisfactory for many people because, if it is there, it can be used. That is why, ultimately, the Greens' third amendment suggests that we should allow the judiciary to be able to respond to circumstances which may not be envisaged in the other legitimate purposes that have been set out.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that sections 119.2 and 119.3 in item 110 of schedule 1 stand as printed.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:59):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Collins, move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7601 revised:


(1) Schedule 1, item 110, page 82 (line 18) to page 83 (line 8), omit subsection 119.2(3), substitute:




Exception—entering or remaining for a legitimate purpose



(3) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person enters, or remains in, the area for a legitimate purpose.


Example:   A legitimate purpose may include, but is not limited to, a purpose in the following list:


(a) providing aid of a humanitarian nature;


(b) satisfying an obligation to appear before a court or other body exercising judicial power;


(c) performing an official duty for the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;


(d) performing an official duty for the government of a foreign country or the government of part of a foreign country (including service in the armed forces of the government of a foreign country), where that performance would not be a violation of the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;


(e) performing an official duty for the United Nations or an agency of the United Nations;


(f) making a news report of events in the area, where the person is working in a professional capacity as a journalist or is assisting another person working in a professional capacity as a journalist;


(g) making a bona fide visit to a family member.


Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (3): see subsection 13.3(3).


I want to make some brief comments, not only on that amendment but also because I was away yesterday, on the broader issue of the bill.


As a general proposition, the Labor Party has taken a strongly principled and responsible approach to national security legislation. We on this side of the chamber do understand it is a fundamental responsibility of government to keep citizens safe. That is why we support appropriate resources and powers being given to our national security agencies to keep Australians safe from threats at home and abroad. At the same time, Labor recognises that such powers must be accompanied by the appropriate safeguards, by oversight of the security agencies. This is to ensure that the rights and liberties of citizens are not infringed.


Senator Collins has said our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque. That is why the opposition sought significant changes to this bill. Labor worked tenaciously, as Senator Collins has outlined, to improve this bill. We sought to ensure that it assists our agencies in addressing risks posed by foreign fighters and we have insisted on necessary safeguards for fundamental democratic freedoms.


The government's original bill went to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, where members and senators from the Labor Party, and our parliamentary colleagues, closely scrutinised the bill and tested the case for each new measure.


I would make this point that the experience of Labor senators and members who were involved in the scrutiny of this bill is considerable. Three of the four members of Labor's federal parliamentary leadership team—Ms Plibersek, Senator Conroy and I—are members of this committee. We are joined by Mr Anthony Byrne who has served on this committee and its predecessor for the majority of the last decade, including three years as chair. The committee membership also includes Senator John Faulkner—and anyone who heard Senator Faulkner's contribution to the second reading debate on this bill yesterday would be left in no doubt about the experience, knowledge and insights he brings to this area. I do take this opportunity to particularly commend Senator Faulkner for his work not only on this inquiry and in the debate on this bill but also on his recent paper, 'Surveillance, intelligence and accountability'.


As a number of contributors to the debate have identified, the report of the inquiry of the PJCIS into this bill made 36 substantive recommendations. Those have resulted in substantial amendments being proposed by the government to this bill. I want to emphasise the impact of the committee's report and the resulting amendments that have been proposed as compared with the original bill. I would also like to point out that when the Attorney-General released his original response to the recommendations of the committee, stating that all of the recommendations had been accepted, closer examination found this was not the case, in some measures. For example, the committee explicitly recommend it in recommendation 14 that its functions be extended to encompass the counter-terrorism activities of the AFP. The government response, while saying the recommendation was accepted, did not rule this out. I am pleased that through the work particularly of the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, amendments have now been made to give effect of this recommendation in full. 


One of the areas that was the subject of concern in many submissions to the committee's inquiry and consumed a considerable amount of time in the public hearings was the proposed sunset clauses. The original bill proposed to extend the operation of the control-order regime for a further 10 years, to December 2025, preventative-detention-order regime for a further 10 years to the same month, December 2025, and to stop search-and-seizure powers relating to terrorism offences the same period. The questioning-and-detention-warranting regime under the ASIO Act was proposed to be extended for a further 10 years, to 22 July 2026. 


Labor believed these provisions were unacceptable and made that clear. We are pleased that the committee agreed and unanimously recommended that all of these clauses proposed for sunset will do so—that is, will sunset during the life of the next parliament. That is a much more limited period prior to the sunset provisions coming into effect. We are also pleased that the government and the Attorney-General in particular has agreed in substance to this recommendation, with amendments proposing set dates for the sunset to take place. Further, all sunset clauses are accompanied by mandated review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.


We are pleased that we were able to put forward, successfully, that these sunset provisions are accompanied by mandatory reviews ahead of their expiry. As was noted in a number of submissions to the committee and in evidence, the whole purpose of sunsetting provisions is undermined if appropriate reviews are not conducted. In relation to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor I note that earlier this year the government claimed this oversight position just added red tape and sought to repeal the legislation establishing the position. I welcome the government's change of heart and I would ask—if it has not already been indicated—if the Attorney-General has an indication as to the time frame for the filling of that position, which has been vacant since April.


Labor has also improved human-rights protections in the bill's provision in relation to the use of overseas evidence in terrorism prosecution in Australian courts. We sought amendments to clarify that torture can never be accepted under our law and are pleased that the joint committee recommendations dealt with this and other matters in relation to foreign evidence.


I now wish to turn to the defences in relation to the 'declared areas offence', which is the subject of the amendment that I have now moved on behalf the opposition. Labor recognises the policy reason behind the declared areas offence. However, we believe we need to ensure that Australians are not being prosecuted for these offences when they are in declared areas for an entirely legitimate purpose. What is intended by this offence is to capture nefarious purposes, which have been the subject of discussion not only in this chamber but also in the context of the committee inquiry.


You cannot identify in legislation every possible legitimate or non-nefarious reason that a person might have for travelling to a particular place in the world. Accordingly, it is our view that this legislation needs to include a general defence or exception for cases where a person enters or remains in a declared area for a legitimate purpose.


The parliamentary joint committee noted: 


… the Committee accepts that there are likely to be some legitimate reasons for travel to an area that are not covered in the proposed grounds of defence listed in subclause 119.2(3) of the Bill. It may be inconsistent, for example, for persons to be allowed to travel to a declared area for a social visit to a family member, while prohibiting travel to a declared area to visit a close friend who is dying. The Committee supports the inclusion in the Bill of a provision to allow additional legitimate purposes to be prescribed by regulation if needed. The Committee encourages the Attorney-General’s Department to review the evidence provided by participants to this inquiry to identify legitimate purposes that could be added to the regulations in this manner, without reducing the deterrent effect of the offence.


Further, the committee stated in its report:


Committee members had different views about whether the declared area offence as currently drafted would be an effective and workable provision. Some members of the Committee questioned whether the legitimate concerns presented in evidence had been adequately addressed, particularly in relation to the evidential burden and the limited range—


the very limited range—


of legitimate purposes for travel to declared areas.


The committee went on to state:


Some members of the Committee believed that, given the seriousness of offences arising under this section that it is appropriate for there to be a ‘wholly legitimate purposes’ general provision in the legislation.


This is the subject of the amendment I have now moved on behalf of the opposition. I believe—Labor believes—that courts should have the discretion to determine the appropriateness of a person's defence that they were in a declared area for a wholly legitimate purpose. That is not a special job we are asking the courts to do. Judges and courts are appropriately placed to hear evidence and make decisions—and make such decisions responsibly. It is not a sensible way to proceed to have parliament seek to set out the factual circumstance of every defence to this offence. It is entirely consistent with a responsible approach to this offence—and a responsible approach to legislating—to enable the courts to have the discretion to consider factual circumstances which this parliament may not be able to contemplate.


So Labor has sought to remedy the short-comings of the defences listed by proposing amendments to widen the scope. In this amendment I wish to highlight the inclusion of some examples in our amendment, which include the provision of humanitarian aid—




Senator Brandis:
  It's already in the bill.




Senator WONG:
  The Attorney-General correctly indicates that that is in the original legislation. Other examples include working in a professional capacity as a journalist, performing an official duty of the United Nations or an agency of the United Nations, or making a bona fide visit to a family member.


This goes to a broader question—I appreciate that the Attorney-General's advice is different—which is about the roles of the legislature and the courts. Are we seriously saying that we do not trust the courts to assess the particular factual circumstance that is presented to it, and make an appropriate judgement as to whether those facts ground a legitimate basis for the defence that parliament has prescribed? I think we should give the courts that opportunity. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:11):  Let me make a couple of preliminary observations and then deal with the Labor Party amendment. It is not correct to say that the government's acceptance of all 37 recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was misleading. We accepted all 37 recommendations. 


In relation to some of the recommendations, there was a variety of ways in which they could be given effect to, because only in a minority of cases—I think it was in some dozen cases—did the PJCIS recommend legislative amendment. Most of the changes that were recommended were administrative changes in the way in which, for example, the PJCIS works and interacts with the government.


The example that Senator Wong gave, of the recommendation that the counter-terrorism function of the Australian Federal Police should be transferred from the legislative oversight of the Joint Parliamentary Law Enforcement Committee to the Joint Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, was accepted by the government. The manner in which that was given effect to depended upon soliciting the views of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which is what I did. I spoke to the chairman of that committee, Mr Bert van Manen MP, to solicit his views about the transfer of that important responsibility from his committee to another committee. Mr van Manen was good enough to say to me that he, on behalf of the committee, was content for that to happen. 


Senator Wong has come into the chamber—evidently not fully briefed on this issue; there were a number of errors in her contribution—and has claimed that somehow the government was being misleading in claiming that it had accepted a recommendation without having done so, merely because I paid the committee from whose jurisdiction a particular function was to be transferred the courtesy of inquiring of their views before giving effect to that recommendation. That is a little mendacious, I must say.


This has not been a particularly partisan debate, and it disappointed me to hear Senator Wong constantly say that the Labor Party has done this or that. The fact is that the improvements to this legislation, which the government has accepted wholly, came from a committee of the parliament, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—on which I had the honour to serve for some years when in opposition—which always acts in a collaborative and bipartisan way. I think that if the Australian public could see its deliberations it would be proud of the way that committee acts. It is unlike the way in which virtually every other committee of this parliament acts. 


The recommendations were the product of the joint effort, the joint careful thought, of Labor Party and Liberal Party and National Party members of that committee, working collaboratively as parliamentarians, working in a bipartisan fashion as patriots. It was not the work of one side of politics; it was the work of all sides of politics. So let me correct the regrettably partisan tone that Senator Wong just injected into the debate.


Dealing with the Labor Party's amendment that is before the chair, the government opposes the amendment. Let me explain why. I might point out that this is the second iteration of this amendment that we have seen today, but, nevertheless, ultimately the Labor Party, through its own internal councils and processes, has arrived at a final position after quite a lot of uncertainty during the course of the debate. The government opposes the Labor amendment for several reasons. Let me put them in the context of the purpose of this provision. The purpose of this provision, quite candidly and openly and unashamedly, is to say that there are some areas of the world—under the control of terrorist armies which are at war against their own populations, as they are in northern Iraq, which are engaged in genocide and religious persecution and subversion of legitimate governments—to which Australians should not travel. The government makes absolutely no apology for saying that there ought to be a law enabling in certain circumstances the Australian government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and on the advice of her department, to say that, because of the particular circumstances of a particular locality or region of the world, this is a place to which Australians should not be permitted to go, just as there are many other places to which Australians are not permitted to go by existing laws. I gave some examples to Senator Wright before. Nevertheless, the government accepts that there may be special circumstances which necessitate travel to such an area.


In the bill we set out seven particular cases where, if a person can lead evidence before a court to show that they were there solely for that purpose, then that constitutes a defence to the charge of being in a declared area. Let me take the one that I was discussing with Senator Wright before—making a bone fide visit to a family member. That, I suspect, is the exemption which would be most often availed of. We accept that if, for example, a relative of an Australian happens to live in an area somewhere in Syria or northern Iraq which may have become a centre of terrorist operations, but, nevertheless, let us say that the person had a sick relative for whom they felt a need to travel to care for, to visit that area should not be caught within this offence. There are other examples given as well.


The Labor Party seems to accept the spirit of this provision, but it wants to change the way in which it works by replacing seven specific grounds, which constitute defences to the offence of visiting a declared area, with a generic discretion which the courts would exercise, saying, 'If you travel for a reasonable purpose, then that is a defence.' There are three reasons in particular as to why that is a very bad idea. The first reason is that it is appalling statutory drafting. We are dealing here with a crime, and in particular, for the purposes of this discussion, with the defences available to a person who is charged with a crime. Senator Wright raised the issue of the importance of the rule of law before. It is, as Senator Wright well knows, one of the fundamental tenets of the rule of law that, if a person is to be exposed to a criminal liability, then the nature and extent of that criminal liability should be known as certainly as can be known and expressed as certainly as it can be expressed in the statute. To say that a person is guilty of a crime and then draft a defence that gives no guidance whatsoever as to whether or not that defence will be available to the person is a fundamental violation of that principle of the rule of law—that the grounds of criminal liability have to be expressed with as much specificity as possible. How could anyone know whether or not they are going to be in breach of the criminal law merely because there is a generic defence that says, 'If a court decides you had reasonable grounds to be there', and gives no guidance whatever as to what the reasonable grounds might be? That is all they have to go by. So, applying your own principle, Senator Wright, to which I subscribe of course, this is a very, very, very bad piece of legislative drafting and it is a shocking example, in particular in a criminal statute, of creating a liability of uncertain dimension.


The second reason the government opposes this amendment is that it actually removes the sole purpose test. Senator Collins, in her contribution before, perhaps was unaware of this, because Senator Collins did say that it was important that a person should have the defence if it could be demonstrated that they travelled to a declared area solely for one of the legitimate purposes, though she said it would need to be solely for the generic purpose, not for one of the specified purposes. Nevertheless, she did say in her contribution that the sole purpose test should apply. But, if you look at the Labor Party's amendment, the sole purpose test is gone. If the sole purpose test is gone, then the ordinary provisions of the Criminal Code apply and, as long as the purpose is one of a multiplicity of purposes, that is enough. So to give the example I gave a little earlier: if a person were to visit a declared area and one of their purposes was to make a bona fide family visit and another one of their purposes was to engage in the facilitation of terrorism, then they would be able to avail themselves of that defence. This does not work unless the sole purpose test remains and the Labor Party's amendment would remove the sole purpose test.


Lastly, the other thing that the Labor Party's amendment would remove is paragraph (h) of proposed subsection (3), which gives the minister the power to proscribe by regulation another purpose. So there is flexibility in this statute through a regulation-making power conferred on the minister to specify other purposes. So let us say, for example, that it became apparent that, in listing seven specified purposes, the government had got it wrong, that it had overlooked something that ought to be a legitimate purpose. That could be corrected by a legislative instrument under the regulation-making power in subparagraph (3)(h), but the Labor Party amendment would remove that as well.


So the Labor Party amendment fails the test of specificity—it is vague when it should be precise; it fails the test of purpose, because it abandons the sole purpose test, which is central to the capacity of this provision to operate; and it abandons the regulation-making power, so it fails the test of flexibility as well. For all of those reasons, the government opposes the Labor Party's amendment, and it looks to the good sense of the crossbenchers, excepting the Greens, of course, to do so as well.


Lastly, let me say this: this was not one of the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security supported the provision that the government seeks to enact. That was the bipartisan view of Senator Wong and Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy and Ms Tanya Plibersek and Mr Anthony Byrne from the Labor Party. They actually endorsed the government's position. This is one respect in which the Labor Party, having changed its position here, now seeks to walk away from the bipartisan report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security. If this provision were to be passed for the various reasons I have expressed, it would defeat the entire purpose of an important reform to the criminal law, which the PJCIS has unanimously, in a bipartisan report, endorsed.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2014-10-29,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (12:26):  I have wrestled with this bill, and the discomfort I have felt has been exacerbated by the haste with which this debate has been forced to a conclusion. I have followed and appreciated the contributions of all, particularly my colleague Senator Leyonhjelm, who spoke eloquently in a 'shining' contribution to the debate yesterday. I appreciate the briefings from government and meetings with the Attorney-General on this bill, and I have put to him some of the arguments I am putting forward now—and they are serious.


I recall an old Peanuts cartoon, where Charlie Brown shoots an arrow into a fence and then proceeds to paint circles around the arrow to show that he had hit the target. I am concerned that the target of this legislation is already known in the form of those people under surveillance who may have come back from the ISIS conflict already. That target may well be justified but I am very concerned about laws drafted to target specific individuals. I am also concerned that censoring and incarcerating people who are preaching hatred may not suppress but, in fact, fan the fire of fanaticism. Putting radical preachers, activists and would-be terrorists in prison gives them a captive audience, so to speak. Radical preaching that promotes bombings and beheadings and other gross acts of violence against innocent Australian citizens—men, women, children, the elderly—is utterly abhorrent and contrary to not only Australian values but Australian citizenship and eligibility for residency.


I trust that my colleagues in this place will be as watchful and vigilant in these matters as those law enforcement officials who protect us to ensure recently enacted powers and the powers proposed in this bill are not exceeded. Having stated those reservations and given strong cautions to those who might use these laws in ham-fisted or wrongful ways, I say that Family First will be supporting this bill.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:28):  In the two minutes remaining for debate on this bill, I want to say that this is exactly why—I welcome Senator Day's contribution; he has not spoken before in the committee stage—it is a farce to have an agreement to push this significant counterterrorism law through this parliament by 12.30. There are still important, significant, unexplained and unexplored provisions like stopping welfare, suspension of travel documents, and cancellation and suspension of visas that have not even been touched on in the debate in this chamber today.


I do not think anyone can suggest that there has been any filibustering going on with this. Legitimate concerns and queries have been raised. Not many members of the Senate even had an opportunity to engage in the debate on this. Legitimate questions have been put. Often clear answers have not been given, and those answers have had to be explored. And here we are with the gagging of the debate, and the amendments from various parties and the opposition and the government will be put through as a job lot without any ability to talk to them, to explain them, to understand them. And this is going to be the national security law that Australia will be saddled with after this finishes.



The CHAIRMAN:  Order! The time allocated for consideration of this bill has expired. The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7601 revised be agreed to.

(33) Schedule 1, item 109, page 76 (after line 17), after subsection 106.5(4), insert:


   (4A) Section 104.23, as amended by Schedule 1 to the Counter‑Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Act 2014, applies to variations of control orders, where the relevant interim control order is requested after that commencement.


This is an application provision. It provides that the amendments to section 104.23 of the Criminal Code, which authorise the Australian Federal Police commissioner to seek a variation of a control order on any of the grounds for requesting a control order, include the new foreign-fighting and terrorism conviction grounds. The effect of the application provision is to ensure that the ability to vary a control order applies only to a control order requested after the bill comes into operation.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:10):  by leave—I move government amendments (34) to (39) together:


(34) Schedule 1, item 110, page 77 (line 23) to page 78 (line 14), omit the definition of engage in a hostile activity in subsection 117.1(1), substitute:



   engage in a hostile activity: a person engages in a hostile activity in a foreign country if the person engages in conduct in that country with the intention of achieving one or more of the following objectives (whether or not such an objective is achieved):


   (a) the overthrow by force or violence of the government of that or any other foreign country (or of a part of that or any other foreign country);


   (b) the engagement, by that or any other person, in action that:


      (i) falls within subsection 100.1(2) but does not fall within subsection 100.1(3); and


      (ii) if engaged in in Australia, would constitute a serious offence;


(c) intimidating the public or a section of the public of that or any other foreign country;


   (d) causing the death of, or bodily injury to, a person who is the head of state of that or any other foreign country, or holds, or performs any of the duties of, a public office of that or any other foreign country (or of a part of that or any other foreign country);


(e) unlawfully destroying or damaging any real or personal property belonging to the government of that or any other foreign country (or of a part of that or any other foreign country).


(35) Schedule 1, item 110, page 78 (lines 15 and 16), omit the definition of engagein subverting society in subsection 117.1(1).


(36) Schedule 1, item 110, page 78 (after line 31), after the definition of recruit in subsection 117.1(1), insert:



   serious offence means an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that is punishable by imprisonment for 2 years or more.


(37) Schedule 1, item 110, page 79 (lines 8 and 9), omit paragraph 117.1(2)(b), substitute:


   (b) the engagement, in Australia or a foreign country allied or associated with Australia, in action that falls within subsection 100.1(2) but does not fall within subsection 100.1(3); or


(38) Schedule 1, item 110, page 79 (line 12), after ""relations"", insert ""(within the meaning of section 10 of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004)"".


(39) Schedule 1, item 110, page 79 (line 13) to page 80 (line 7), omit subsections 117.1(3) and (4).


Amendments (34) to (39) implement recommendations 15 and 16 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security by replacing the phrase 'engages in subverting society,' which is one of the elements of the definition of 'engage in hostile activity,' with a cross-reference to the conduct contained in the definition of 'terrorist act' in section 100.1 of the Criminal Code. These amendments also constrain that element to conduct that would be a serious offence—one that carries at least two years imprisonment if undertaken within Australia. The two-year threshold is consistent with the definition of 'serious offence' in section 3C of the Crimes Act.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:11):  I just want to seek the guidance of the chair. The Australian Greens also have amendments in this particular area. We have a series of amendments, but the first amendment that we would be moving would be to oppose the section of the act which creates the declared areas zone. I ask leave of the committee to that extent, to move the Australian Greens amendment first so that we can be clear on whether or not the committee is willing to support that amendment. It would just make sense logically to deal with that first and then move to the opposition's amendments.



The CHAIRMAN:  I think that does make sense, but I have been following the order on the running sheet. I will just get some guidance from Senator Collins on whether she objects to that and also from the minister. There does not seem to be any objection. Senator Wright, if you could now move amendment (16).

I think your amendments (16) and (17) are related, and I think amendments (18) and (19) might be as well. Are you just moving (16)? Or should we deal with all of your amendments on declared areas at the same time?




Senator WRIGHT:
  I am really at the indulgence of the committee. I am not wishing to gazump the debate, so I would be interested to know if Senator Collins would be prepared to agree to that. I would be happy to do that because it might be more efficient. Otherwise, we will just move the aspects of our amendments which would seek to knock out the no-go zones.



The CHAIRMAN:  If I could just intervene. Amendments (16) and (17) have to be put separately, anyway. I am happy if the debate goes across the three of them, if it is the will of the committee at the time. Maybe if you just move (16) and, if people want to talk to the three amendments, that will be fine.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:14):  The Australian Greens oppose schedule 1 in the following terms.


(16) Schedule 1, item 110, page 82 (line 1) to page 85 (line 10), sections 119.2 and 119.3 to be opposed.


On moving item (16), being Australian Greens amendment to remove the declared areas offence in the bill, the bill seeks to create a new offence of entering or remaining in a declared area, which would be punishable by 10 years imprisonment, so it is a significant offence. Under the provision, if it were to be passed, areas in a foreign country can be declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by way of legislative instrument, if he or she is satisfied that a listed terrorist organisation is engaging in a hostile activity in that area of the foreign country. Declarations can last for a maximum of three years.


There is a narrow legitimate purpose defence available for those charged with the substantive offence. The Australian Greens amendment (16) would remove the proposed no-go-zone offence from the bill because it is considered that this offence will unnecessarily and disproportionately restrict freedom of movement in Australia. Certainly views have been expressed and the Greens are of the view that this is potentially an extremely counterproductive outcome. It risks entrenching feelings of isolation and alienation in the very communities in Australia that we rely upon to assist in this fight against terrorism and in order to build social cohesion and inclusion in the Australian community because this offence, if it stays, will criminalise what is perfectly legitimate travel. It will make it punishable by 10 years imprisonment for a person to travel to a declared area and because there is no fault element required, it has the practical—if not the technical—effect of reversing the onus of proof. It would require anyone who is charged with the offence after having travelled to a declared area to bring their own evidence to demonstrate that their travel was not only to fall within a narrow list of legitimate purposes but also that that travel was solely for that reason. For instance, an elderly couple who are travelling to a declared area to visit a dying friend or a young person who is travelling to a declared area to study, or a business person who remained in an area, after it had become a declared area, to conclude a business deal, there is no need to establish any criminal intent. Those people would be subject to potential prosecution upon returning to Australia. Even where there is a legitimate purpose provided for in the offence such as a journalist, they remain liable to be charged with the offence, brought before a criminal court and required to bring evidence to prove that journalism was the sole reason for their travel to escape conviction. 


The legal experts we have been paying attention to have stated that this is yet one more example of a completely unnecessary new offence. The expert advice in this area which we would be referring to is advice from the Law Council of Australia, the Gilbert and Tobin Centre for Public Law, the Australian Human Rights Commission, Professor Ben Saul, Human Rights Watch and the Human Rights Law Centre. The Parliamentary Joint Committee for Human Rights has also expressed concerns about the potential incompatibility of this provision with human rights in Australia.


Australia's criminal laws, which we asked the chamber to consider, already cover well and truly circumstances where a person leaves Australia in order to participate in hostile or terrorist activities overseas, as well as circumstances where a person encourages or urges another person to engage in such activities or a person who financially or otherwise supports terrorist or criminal organisations. That is the reason that the Australian Greens are moving to have this offence removed from the bill. I have some questions to which I really would appreciate the Attorney-General's response. The first I will put to the Attorney-General in relation to the offence as it stands in the bill at this stage is why the government has chosen to frame this offence in such a way that departs so significantly from the type of established criminal law and rule of law principles that the Attorney has a tradition of vigorously defending.

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:19):  Thank you for the compliment, Senator Wright, but I do not for a moment share your view that this is a departure from traditional rule of law principles. This is a new offence which is being created. I will wait until you have asked whatever questions you want to ask me before speaking at length about the desirability of the provision, but this is no departure from established rule of law principles merely to create a new criminal offence, a very narrow one, subject to the ordinary defences which are provided for in the generic provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, transparent on the face of the statute with no reverse of the onus of proof, no reduction in the standard of proof and beyond the generic defences a series of specific defences which in the government's view deal with legitimate reasons for travel to declared areas. There is nothing unusual about this. How you think merely because it is a newly expressed offence that that is a departure from the rule of law escapes me.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:20):  I am happy to elaborate on why the Australian Greens and certainly other legal commentators are of the view that it is a significant  departure from established principles and that is the offence has been drafted in such a way as to have the same effect, without being semantic, as a reversal of the onus of proof because, while the prosecution has to prove that a person was in the declared area, that is all they have to prove initially and the defendant is then guilty of the offence unless the defendant brings evidence to demonstrate that the travel was solely for one of the listed legitimate purposes—if you want to respond to that first, Attorney-General.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:21):  I am happy to, Senator Wright. This is a red –herring argument which has been raised many times. There is no reversal of the onus of proof here at all. The way the criminal law works is that an offence—let us assume we are talking about statutory offences—is defined and the prosecution bears the onus of proving every element of that offence beyond reasonable doubt. Then defences are provided for. If an accused person seeks to rely upon a defence then they have to bring forward evidence to discharge what, as you would know as a lawyer, Senator Wright, is known as 'the evidential onus', to show that there is sufficient material upon which that defence may be invoked. That is not a reversal of the onus of proof. It is merely to say that, if a criminal defendant seeks to rely upon a defence, he or she has to bring sufficient facts before the court to demonstrate the availability of that defence. That has never been regarded as a reversal of the onus of proof.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (11:22):  Given the way the committee is moving, I think it might be opportune for Labor to indicate its position in relation to the declared areas matter, rather than waiting until I formally move my amendments, in response to these amendments moved by Senator Wright, because we have now moved through the first of Labor's main concerns, which were those in relation to the issues that we dealt with around advocating terrorism. The second main area where we had concerns arising out of the intelligence committee's consideration was this declared area provision. The third major area in which we had concerns was that around the provisions with respect to welfare measures. I should indicate that we appreciate the government's cooperation in relation to those third measures, and we will come to those subsequently if we have time in the debate, but if we do not have sufficient time I want to indicate that we have appreciated the government's cooperation in accepting our concerns there. We would, however, like them to consider what we are now addressing in our amendments regarding declared areas. I will come to those in a moment.


As to these Greens amendments which would remove the entirety of the declared areas offence, we believe that the approach that we have circulated in revised schedule 7601 renders it a workable and useful tool for our agencies. So we obviously accept, with the intelligence committee's advice, that such a tool is warranted. Our concern about protecting the rights of the accused is what we will be dealing with in our amendment.


As we know, the bill creates a new offence in relation to people who travel to areas declared by the foreign minister. A number of members of the intelligence committee were unsatisfied with the prescription and limited range of excuses available to persons accused of travelling to or remaining in such a declared area. These committee members argued that a general exclusion should be available to those with a wholly legitimate purpose for being in a declared area. Specifically, the intelligence committee stated, at 2.387 of their report:


Committee members had different views about whether the declared area offence as currently drafted would be an effective and workable provision. Some members of the Committee questioned whether the legitimate concerns presented in evidence had been adequately addressed, particularly in relation to the evidential burden and the limited range of legitimate purposes for travel to declared areas. The Committee notes that the proposed INSLM—


the proposed security monitor—


and Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security reviews leading into the sunset provision will enable this to be more fully explored.


At 2.388, the committee reflected that:


Some members of the Committee believed that, given the seriousness of offences arising under this section that it is appropriate for there to be a 'wholly legitimate purposes' general provision in the legislation.


So, in accordance with these comments of the intelligence committee, Labor will be moving amendments to provide a general defence of wholly legitimate purposes for those accused of travelling to or remaining in a declared area. We do not believe that it is possible for the parliament to anticipate in advance every possible legitimate reason for a person to travel to a declared area.


Our amendment to this provision will recognise the critical role that the third arm of government, our judiciary and the criminal justice system, plays in our democracy. We think that it is entirely appropriate for the courts to determine whether a person travelling to a declared area has done so for a solely legitimate purpose. Labor believes that it is entirely appropriate and just for a judge or a jury to decide whether a person has travelled to a declared area for a sole and legitimate purpose, assuming that the police and the DPP have decided to charge that person with that offence. To expect that the parliament can, here and now, anticipate all legitimate reasons for a person to be in a declared area is a serious mistake that could potentially create a very unjust law. Our amendment, creating a general defence for a sole legitimate reason for travelling to a declared area, does not fix all of the problems with this offence, but it at least provides a more just and appropriate defence to those who may be charged, and our amendment recognises the critical role that the judiciary and our courts have in administering our criminal laws rather than trying to circumvent that role, as the government's more prescriptive approach clearly seeks to do.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:28):  I did not want to necessarily jump in ahead of the Attorney-General, if he wanted to respond, but I had some further questions for the Attorney-General, to make sense of how this would actually work in practice. As to being accused of using hypothetical examples: I think it is actually very much the role of this chamber to be saying: 'This is the law you want us to pass. How will it actually work on the ground? How will it be interpreted? What are the likely consequences, and the effects on people's lives?'


Attorney-General, you were saying that this is not a departure from traditional legal principles of criminal law. You have not acknowledged that what it does effectively do is to criminalise something that is without any intention on the part of a person. It criminalises something that would have been perfectly legitimate before the offence became law. But I am interested specifically to ask why the offence departs so significantly from the Attorney-General's Department's own guide to drafting Commonwealth offences which provides, for example, that:


The requirement for proof of fault is one of the most fundamental protections in criminal law. This reflects the premise that it is generally neither fair, nor useful, to subject people to criminal punishment for unintended actions or unforeseen consequences unless these resulted from an unjustified risk (ie recklessness).


In this case, I am genuinely trying to understand what the fault is if you are going to criminalise what is perfectly legitimate travel. Is that the fault? Is the fault being in the declared area and staying there, or going into a declared area when in fact no malice or wrong intentions are necessary to create the offence? It is just a matter of having to prove when you come back that you had what the government considers to be a legitimate purpose. And we will go into the inadequacies in what legitimate purposes are in a minute.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:30):  That is a very good question, if I may say so, and I am happy to be able to provide you with the answer. The provision does not depart from the Attorney-General's Department's recommended guidelines. It does make clear the fault elements. There are two aspects to it. The fault element in relation to travel to or remaining in a declared area is intention, so that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person intended to travel to or intended to remain in the particular locality.


The fault element in relation to the person's knowledge of whether or not the locality was a declared area is recklessness. Earlier on in the debate I read to Senator Macdonald the Criminal Code's definition of 'recklessness' for the purposes of the generic fault provisions of that statute, and you were in the chamber when I did that, so I will not waste time reading them to you again. So, that is the answer to your question. A fault element in relation to travel or remaining there is intention. The fault element in relation to awareness of whether or not that particular locality is declared is recklessness.


While I am on my feet, Senator, I might point out, particularly since you have frequently invoked the Australian Human Rights Commission in support of your position, that the Australian Human Rights Commission, in its commentary on this provision, some of which I acknowledge is critical, actually acknowledged that there was no reversal of the onus of proof. The Human Rights Commission acknowledged that the position is exactly as I have explained to you: that a person seeking to invoke one of the defences has an evidential onus to bring forward the facts before the court so that the court can be possessed of the facts constituting the defence. But in relation to all of the elements that constitute the offence, there is no reversal of the onus or proof.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:33):  I did actually say, and I made it quite clear, that it is an effective reversal of the onus of proof, not a technical one. When we consider the fault element you are relying on, the fault is travel or remaining in the geographical area. That is the fault at the heart of this offence. I would say that that is actually a serious departure from established criminal law principles, in that traditionally crimes have been actions or behaviour that have an element that is inherently negative, malicious or harmful to other people. It is actually quite unprecedented through the enactment of a provision, through the writing of a new offence, to criminalise something that on its own is perfectly legitimate. Indeed, freedom of movement is an important human right. To talk about the fault element of the travelling or remaining in an area as being within the scope of ordinary criminal law is nonsensical. There is no inherent harm or wrongful behaviour in people exercising their right to travel. There has not been previously, and the Australian Greens and many others are very concerned at the precedent this is setting.


What I am interested in following up is what will happen to a person who is already in an area when it is declared. How will they find out that they are committing a criminal offence by remaining in that area, if they are not aware that it has been declared, and are at risk of criminal punishment upon their return to Australia.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:35):  I am afraid that the law of evidence is by its nature a very technical area. So, Senator Wright, with respect it gets you nowhere to say, 'Well, Senator Brandis, you might be technically right about the law of evidence, but effectively this is a reversal of the onus of proof.' This is a technical area, and when you say 'Well, although you are technically right, effectively it is different,' you are coming very close to a Dennis Denuto like observation about it being 'the vibe'. The fact is that the law of evidence—and the principles by which courts determine where the onus of proof lies, and the distinction between the persuasive onus and the evidential onus—is a very technical area. Let us not try to mask our refusal to accept the technicality of the area by reverting to non-technical language.


Senator Wright, contrary to what you say—that this is unprecedented or unknown to the law—it is very common for our law to say that it is prohibited to go to a particular area. Let me give you a few examples. It is against the law of Australia to go to certain areas in South Australia that are used for the purposes of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed—although I am thinking of that particular example inspired by the presence behind me of the distinguished Senator Fawcett—in general it is against the law for a person to go to a military base or to attend upon a military base, without authority to do so. It is against the law, in many instances, for a person to go into Indigenous territories without appropriate permissions. It is, I think you will find, Senator Wright, against the law for people to go to certain areas of the Australian Antarctic Territories without permission. The idea that it is unknown to the law that there should be a prohibition on a person visiting a particular place is, with respect, quite erroneous. It is a perfectly commonplace form of prohibition and a prohibition of that kind has been extended in this particular case to areas declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as satisfying the statutory tests as being no-go zones for Australian travellers. This is essentially because those areas are areas where Australians have no place being, because they are areas under the control of terrorist armies. In a practical sense, that is the way this legislation is going to operate. There are exceptions and defences, as you have acknowledged, but I challenge utterly the suggestion that it is unusual for the law to prohibit a person visiting certain specified localities. That is just not right at all.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:39):  Attorney-General, I think you might have forgotten the question that I asked at the end of that, which was: what will happen to a person when they are already in an area when it is declared and how will they find out that they are at risk of criminal punishment upon return to Australia?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:39):  If a person is in an area when it is declared, they commit the offence by intentionally remaining there and they commit the offence if the recklessness element of having reckless disregard as to whether or not the area is a declared area is made out by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will, in the event that an area were to be declared, take extensive steps to publicise that matter, including on the web and through social media.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:39):  How will a person demonstrate that his or her travel is solely for a listed legitimate purpose? And how will the prosecution rebut such a defence if it is raised? This requirement of 'solely' has been causing a great deal of concern among legal commentators.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:40):  It would not be causing a great deal of concern among legal commentators who are familiar with testing 'sole purpose'. It might cause vexation to Professor Ben Saul—Professor Saul is an international lawyer—but it would not be causing a lot of concern to practitioners and legal commentators who understand that, in many areas of the law, courts are every day seized of determining the question of purpose in determining the question of state of mind. That includes determining whether or not a person's purposes in engaging in a particular act are a sole purpose or one of a variety of purposes. This is not hard, Senator. 


Let me give you an example in a practical sense of why it is necessary to have a sole purpose test if one is to invoke one of the variety of exemptions. One of the exemptions in proposed section 119.23(g) is making a bona fide visit to a family member. I imagine, Senator Wright, that you think that it should be all right for a person who makes a bona fide visit to a family member not to be caught by this prohibition. But let us say that a person would have travelled to a declared area and, in the course of making a bona fide visit to a family member, were also to facilitate the travel to, let us say, a township in northern Iraq under the control of ISIL, were also to facilitate the travel of foreign fighters to that township or were also to provide financial or other material sustenance to ISIL. Then, unless we have a sole purpose test, the ordinary law would be that as long as it was a substantial purpose, then the defence would be available. So if the person in the hypothetical case I have given were to say: 'It may well be that I travelled to this particular township in order to assist ISIL but, as it happens, my brother lives in this township and I actually did visit him and my desire to visit my brother was a bona fide desire to make a family visit.' We cannot have what I think we both acknowledge to be a legitimate exemption used as a mask or a pretext or a ruse to conceal purposes which, I am sure you would agree with me, ought not to be legitimate. But unless we have a sole purpose test, that could happen.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:43):  I suppose a different example that has been brought to my attention would be for us to perhaps imagine an elderly couple, who have been living in Australia for a long time, who return to see family, perhaps for the last time before they die. While they are there making a bona fide visit to a family member, because they are returning to an area where they have perhaps grown up, they are invited to go to a wedding of people who are not family members but who are in another town and they travel there for that. Again, I do not want to be accused of raising hypothetical examples, because these are the very live examples and fears that people have who need to take account of this legislation. My concern is that, even if in the end you say that a court will interpret this, a court will give people the benefit of the doubt and so on, the real concern here is that this restriction will have a chilling effect. Those people will not even potentially take the risk of going or will not take up an opportunity like that, of attending a wedding of a friend in a different village, which would seem to be perfectly legitimate, perfectly harmless, perfectly reasonable and perfectly understandable

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:44):  The courts are very practised, as I said a moment ago, in determining state of mind, and part of that forensic process is to determine whether a purpose is a sole purpose or one of a multiplicity of purposes.


In the example you have given, it would seem to me that, if there were a trivial, incidental event that was not the sole purpose of the travel but was engaged in while the person was travelling to a declared area for the sole purpose of, in the example you have just instanced, making a bone fide family visit, that would not defeat their reliance on the defence. We can quibble at the margins. You know the old legal maxim 'de minimis non curat lex'? Trivial, incidental examples would not defeat the operation of this principle, but the principle is important: a person must be travelling solely for that legitimate purpose. Now, if while they are there they do something entirely incidental that is not the sole purpose or even a purpose of their travel, I would not think that that would defeat them.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:46):  I will come back to an operational question now, about the way the offence would operate in practice. How would areas be declared in such a way as to be responsive to the fluidity of war and conflict? For example, would a new declaration be made each time a new Syrian city or region is embroiled in conflict, or is it envisaged that a blanket declaration would be issued?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:46):  That would be a judgement for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to make. Obviously, because we are talking about geography here, areas will be defined by descriptions of a location. In my view, the description of the location should be as specific as possible to give people as much guidance as possible. I take your point about the mobility of modern warfare. There is, of course, a lot of immobility in warfare as well, as we have seen in more recent wars, but, in a highly mobile environment where, for example, the front changes often, obviously that will require a judgement to be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not a particular locality should be added to the list.


I think we are a little bit jumping at shadows, Senator Wright. I said at the initial press conference with the Prime Minister on 5 August that I expected a provision like this would be used very sparingly. I remain of that view. It is, as you rightly say, an unusual provision. A decision, not by me but by the foreign affairs minister, to make such a declaration would be made on the best advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and perhaps, I dare say, the Department of Defence and the description of the area would be a geographical description.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, before I give you the call, it was with the indulgence of the chamber that we moved away from the running order and I wonder if you might give an indication of what time you think we will bring this question to a close.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:48):  Thank you, Mr Chairman. That is a fair question and I was about to indicate that. I thought I would speak briefly to the consequential amendments so that I will not need to speak about those again, and then I will ask that this amendment, regarding the removal of the offence, be put to the chamber for decision. Then I imagine that Senator Collins will move her further amendment.



The CHAIRMAN:  Yes, I then want to go back to that amendment.




Senator WRIGHT:
  Given that we have now, in a sense, moved in the debate to the other aspects of the amendments that the Greens will be moving, I will not need to speak to those later. I totally understand your concerns about the time. I will speak briefly about those amendments and then I will have nothing more to say on this.


I indicate that the consequential amendments that the Greens will be moving, if the first Greens' amendment is not successful, will add an element of intent to the offence—that is item 1 on sheet 7598—and to expand the definition or broaden the range of legitimate behaviour defences for this offence by expanding the range of legitimate purposes, to allow for the making of a bona fide visit to a friend or personal or business associate, to provide legal advice, or to perform a bona fide business, teaching or research obligation such as archaeology or some kind of research at an educational or teaching institution.


Finally, the Greens' amendment to deal with legitimate purposes in the way a court may interpret those is to create a provision whereby the court would ultimately have discretion—any other purpose that the court determines is legitimate in all the circumstances—which would, in the Greens' view, appropriately give the decision making about what is a serious criminal offence to the judiciary.


Certainly, the Attorney-General has reassured us that this provision would not be used very often, he envisages, and that we really need to trust that this is a sensible provision that will not be misused. Unfortunately, what we know is that, once there is a provision on the books—once legislation is there—governments come and go, attorneys-general and ministers for foreign affairs come and go, and the provision is there, able to be relied upon. Some kind of suggestion that we should just be reassured that it will not be abused is not actually satisfactory for many people because, if it is there, it can be used. That is why, ultimately, the Greens' third amendment suggests that we should allow the judiciary to be able to respond to circumstances which may not be envisaged in the other legitimate purposes that have been set out.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that sections 119.2 and 119.3 in item 110 of schedule 1 stand as printed.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:59):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Collins, move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7601 revised:


(1) Schedule 1, item 110, page 82 (line 18) to page 83 (line 8), omit subsection 119.2(3), substitute:




Exception—entering or remaining for a legitimate purpose



(3) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person enters, or remains in, the area for a legitimate purpose.


Example:   A legitimate purpose may include, but is not limited to, a purpose in the following list:


(a) providing aid of a humanitarian nature;


(b) satisfying an obligation to appear before a court or other body exercising judicial power;


(c) performing an official duty for the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;


(d) performing an official duty for the government of a foreign country or the government of part of a foreign country (including service in the armed forces of the government of a foreign country), where that performance would not be a violation of the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;


(e) performing an official duty for the United Nations or an agency of the United Nations;


(f) making a news report of events in the area, where the person is working in a professional capacity as a journalist or is assisting another person working in a professional capacity as a journalist;


(g) making a bona fide visit to a family member.


Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (3): see subsection 13.3(3).


I want to make some brief comments, not only on that amendment but also because I was away yesterday, on the broader issue of the bill.


As a general proposition, the Labor Party has taken a strongly principled and responsible approach to national security legislation. We on this side of the chamber do understand it is a fundamental responsibility of government to keep citizens safe. That is why we support appropriate resources and powers being given to our national security agencies to keep Australians safe from threats at home and abroad. At the same time, Labor recognises that such powers must be accompanied by the appropriate safeguards, by oversight of the security agencies. This is to ensure that the rights and liberties of citizens are not infringed.


Senator Collins has said our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque. That is why the opposition sought significant changes to this bill. Labor worked tenaciously, as Senator Collins has outlined, to improve this bill. We sought to ensure that it assists our agencies in addressing risks posed by foreign fighters and we have insisted on necessary safeguards for fundamental democratic freedoms.


The government's original bill went to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, where members and senators from the Labor Party, and our parliamentary colleagues, closely scrutinised the bill and tested the case for each new measure.


I would make this point that the experience of Labor senators and members who were involved in the scrutiny of this bill is considerable. Three of the four members of Labor's federal parliamentary leadership team—Ms Plibersek, Senator Conroy and I—are members of this committee. We are joined by Mr Anthony Byrne who has served on this committee and its predecessor for the majority of the last decade, including three years as chair. The committee membership also includes Senator John Faulkner—and anyone who heard Senator Faulkner's contribution to the second reading debate on this bill yesterday would be left in no doubt about the experience, knowledge and insights he brings to this area. I do take this opportunity to particularly commend Senator Faulkner for his work not only on this inquiry and in the debate on this bill but also on his recent paper, 'Surveillance, intelligence and accountability'.


As a number of contributors to the debate have identified, the report of the inquiry of the PJCIS into this bill made 36 substantive recommendations. Those have resulted in substantial amendments being proposed by the government to this bill. I want to emphasise the impact of the committee's report and the resulting amendments that have been proposed as compared with the original bill. I would also like to point out that when the Attorney-General released his original response to the recommendations of the committee, stating that all of the recommendations had been accepted, closer examination found this was not the case, in some measures. For example, the committee explicitly recommend it in recommendation 14 that its functions be extended to encompass the counter-terrorism activities of the AFP. The government response, while saying the recommendation was accepted, did not rule this out. I am pleased that through the work particularly of the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, amendments have now been made to give effect of this recommendation in full. 


One of the areas that was the subject of concern in many submissions to the committee's inquiry and consumed a considerable amount of time in the public hearings was the proposed sunset clauses. The original bill proposed to extend the operation of the control-order regime for a further 10 years, to December 2025, preventative-detention-order regime for a further 10 years to the same month, December 2025, and to stop search-and-seizure powers relating to terrorism offences the same period. The questioning-and-detention-warranting regime under the ASIO Act was proposed to be extended for a further 10 years, to 22 July 2026. 


Labor believed these provisions were unacceptable and made that clear. We are pleased that the committee agreed and unanimously recommended that all of these clauses proposed for sunset will do so—that is, will sunset during the life of the next parliament. That is a much more limited period prior to the sunset provisions coming into effect. We are also pleased that the government and the Attorney-General in particular has agreed in substance to this recommendation, with amendments proposing set dates for the sunset to take place. Further, all sunset clauses are accompanied by mandated review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.


We are pleased that we were able to put forward, successfully, that these sunset provisions are accompanied by mandatory reviews ahead of their expiry. As was noted in a number of submissions to the committee and in evidence, the whole purpose of sunsetting provisions is undermined if appropriate reviews are not conducted. In relation to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor I note that earlier this year the government claimed this oversight position just added red tape and sought to repeal the legislation establishing the position. I welcome the government's change of heart and I would ask—if it has not already been indicated—if the Attorney-General has an indication as to the time frame for the filling of that position, which has been vacant since April.


Labor has also improved human-rights protections in the bill's provision in relation to the use of overseas evidence in terrorism prosecution in Australian courts. We sought amendments to clarify that torture can never be accepted under our law and are pleased that the joint committee recommendations dealt with this and other matters in relation to foreign evidence.


I now wish to turn to the defences in relation to the 'declared areas offence', which is the subject of the amendment that I have now moved on behalf the opposition. Labor recognises the policy reason behind the declared areas offence. However, we believe we need to ensure that Australians are not being prosecuted for these offences when they are in declared areas for an entirely legitimate purpose. What is intended by this offence is to capture nefarious purposes, which have been the subject of discussion not only in this chamber but also in the context of the committee inquiry.


You cannot identify in legislation every possible legitimate or non-nefarious reason that a person might have for travelling to a particular place in the world. Accordingly, it is our view that this legislation needs to include a general defence or exception for cases where a person enters or remains in a declared area for a legitimate purpose.


The parliamentary joint committee noted: 


… the Committee accepts that there are likely to be some legitimate reasons for travel to an area that are not covered in the proposed grounds of defence listed in subclause 119.2(3) of the Bill. It may be inconsistent, for example, for persons to be allowed to travel to a declared area for a social visit to a family member, while prohibiting travel to a declared area to visit a close friend who is dying. The Committee supports the inclusion in the Bill of a provision to allow additional legitimate purposes to be prescribed by regulation if needed. The Committee encourages the Attorney-General’s Department to review the evidence provided by participants to this inquiry to identify legitimate purposes that could be added to the regulations in this manner, without reducing the deterrent effect of the offence.


Further, the committee stated in its report:


Committee members had different views about whether the declared area offence as currently drafted would be an effective and workable provision. Some members of the Committee questioned whether the legitimate concerns presented in evidence had been adequately addressed, particularly in relation to the evidential burden and the limited range—


the very limited range—


of legitimate purposes for travel to declared areas.


The committee went on to state:


Some members of the Committee believed that, given the seriousness of offences arising under this section that it is appropriate for there to be a ‘wholly legitimate purposes’ general provision in the legislation.


This is the subject of the amendment I have now moved on behalf of the opposition. I believe—Labor believes—that courts should have the discretion to determine the appropriateness of a person's defence that they were in a declared area for a wholly legitimate purpose. That is not a special job we are asking the courts to do. Judges and courts are appropriately placed to hear evidence and make decisions—and make such decisions responsibly. It is not a sensible way to proceed to have parliament seek to set out the factual circumstance of every defence to this offence. It is entirely consistent with a responsible approach to this offence—and a responsible approach to legislating—to enable the courts to have the discretion to consider factual circumstances which this parliament may not be able to contemplate.


So Labor has sought to remedy the short-comings of the defences listed by proposing amendments to widen the scope. In this amendment I wish to highlight the inclusion of some examples in our amendment, which include the provision of humanitarian aid—




Senator Brandis:
  It's already in the bill.




Senator WONG:
  The Attorney-General correctly indicates that that is in the original legislation. Other examples include working in a professional capacity as a journalist, performing an official duty of the United Nations or an agency of the United Nations, or making a bona fide visit to a family member.


This goes to a broader question—I appreciate that the Attorney-General's advice is different—which is about the roles of the legislature and the courts. Are we seriously saying that we do not trust the courts to assess the particular factual circumstance that is presented to it, and make an appropriate judgement as to whether those facts ground a legitimate basis for the defence that parliament has prescribed? I think we should give the courts that opportunity. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:11):  Let me make a couple of preliminary observations and then deal with the Labor Party amendment. It is not correct to say that the government's acceptance of all 37 recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was misleading. We accepted all 37 recommendations. 


In relation to some of the recommendations, there was a variety of ways in which they could be given effect to, because only in a minority of cases—I think it was in some dozen cases—did the PJCIS recommend legislative amendment. Most of the changes that were recommended were administrative changes in the way in which, for example, the PJCIS works and interacts with the government.


The example that Senator Wong gave, of the recommendation that the counter-terrorism function of the Australian Federal Police should be transferred from the legislative oversight of the Joint Parliamentary Law Enforcement Committee to the Joint Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, was accepted by the government. The manner in which that was given effect to depended upon soliciting the views of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which is what I did. I spoke to the chairman of that committee, Mr Bert van Manen MP, to solicit his views about the transfer of that important responsibility from his committee to another committee. Mr van Manen was good enough to say to me that he, on behalf of the committee, was content for that to happen. 


Senator Wong has come into the chamber—evidently not fully briefed on this issue; there were a number of errors in her contribution—and has claimed that somehow the government was being misleading in claiming that it had accepted a recommendation without having done so, merely because I paid the committee from whose jurisdiction a particular function was to be transferred the courtesy of inquiring of their views before giving effect to that recommendation. That is a little mendacious, I must say.


This has not been a particularly partisan debate, and it disappointed me to hear Senator Wong constantly say that the Labor Party has done this or that. The fact is that the improvements to this legislation, which the government has accepted wholly, came from a committee of the parliament, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—on which I had the honour to serve for some years when in opposition—which always acts in a collaborative and bipartisan way. I think that if the Australian public could see its deliberations it would be proud of the way that committee acts. It is unlike the way in which virtually every other committee of this parliament acts. 


The recommendations were the product of the joint effort, the joint careful thought, of Labor Party and Liberal Party and National Party members of that committee, working collaboratively as parliamentarians, working in a bipartisan fashion as patriots. It was not the work of one side of politics; it was the work of all sides of politics. So let me correct the regrettably partisan tone that Senator Wong just injected into the debate.


Dealing with the Labor Party's amendment that is before the chair, the government opposes the amendment. Let me explain why. I might point out that this is the second iteration of this amendment that we have seen today, but, nevertheless, ultimately the Labor Party, through its own internal councils and processes, has arrived at a final position after quite a lot of uncertainty during the course of the debate. The government opposes the Labor amendment for several reasons. Let me put them in the context of the purpose of this provision. The purpose of this provision, quite candidly and openly and unashamedly, is to say that there are some areas of the world—under the control of terrorist armies which are at war against their own populations, as they are in northern Iraq, which are engaged in genocide and religious persecution and subversion of legitimate governments—to which Australians should not travel. The government makes absolutely no apology for saying that there ought to be a law enabling in certain circumstances the Australian government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and on the advice of her department, to say that, because of the particular circumstances of a particular locality or region of the world, this is a place to which Australians should not be permitted to go, just as there are many other places to which Australians are not permitted to go by existing laws. I gave some examples to Senator Wright before. Nevertheless, the government accepts that there may be special circumstances which necessitate travel to such an area.


In the bill we set out seven particular cases where, if a person can lead evidence before a court to show that they were there solely for that purpose, then that constitutes a defence to the charge of being in a declared area. Let me take the one that I was discussing with Senator Wright before—making a bone fide visit to a family member. That, I suspect, is the exemption which would be most often availed of. We accept that if, for example, a relative of an Australian happens to live in an area somewhere in Syria or northern Iraq which may have become a centre of terrorist operations, but, nevertheless, let us say that the person had a sick relative for whom they felt a need to travel to care for, to visit that area should not be caught within this offence. There are other examples given as well.


The Labor Party seems to accept the spirit of this provision, but it wants to change the way in which it works by replacing seven specific grounds, which constitute defences to the offence of visiting a declared area, with a generic discretion which the courts would exercise, saying, 'If you travel for a reasonable purpose, then that is a defence.' There are three reasons in particular as to why that is a very bad idea. The first reason is that it is appalling statutory drafting. We are dealing here with a crime, and in particular, for the purposes of this discussion, with the defences available to a person who is charged with a crime. Senator Wright raised the issue of the importance of the rule of law before. It is, as Senator Wright well knows, one of the fundamental tenets of the rule of law that, if a person is to be exposed to a criminal liability, then the nature and extent of that criminal liability should be known as certainly as can be known and expressed as certainly as it can be expressed in the statute. To say that a person is guilty of a crime and then draft a defence that gives no guidance whatsoever as to whether or not that defence will be available to the person is a fundamental violation of that principle of the rule of law—that the grounds of criminal liability have to be expressed with as much specificity as possible. How could anyone know whether or not they are going to be in breach of the criminal law merely because there is a generic defence that says, 'If a court decides you had reasonable grounds to be there', and gives no guidance whatever as to what the reasonable grounds might be? That is all they have to go by. So, applying your own principle, Senator Wright, to which I subscribe of course, this is a very, very, very bad piece of legislative drafting and it is a shocking example, in particular in a criminal statute, of creating a liability of uncertain dimension.


The second reason the government opposes this amendment is that it actually removes the sole purpose test. Senator Collins, in her contribution before, perhaps was unaware of this, because Senator Collins did say that it was important that a person should have the defence if it could be demonstrated that they travelled to a declared area solely for one of the legitimate purposes, though she said it would need to be solely for the generic purpose, not for one of the specified purposes. Nevertheless, she did say in her contribution that the sole purpose test should apply. But, if you look at the Labor Party's amendment, the sole purpose test is gone. If the sole purpose test is gone, then the ordinary provisions of the Criminal Code apply and, as long as the purpose is one of a multiplicity of purposes, that is enough. So to give the example I gave a little earlier: if a person were to visit a declared area and one of their purposes was to make a bona fide family visit and another one of their purposes was to engage in the facilitation of terrorism, then they would be able to avail themselves of that defence. This does not work unless the sole purpose test remains and the Labor Party's amendment would remove the sole purpose test.


Lastly, the other thing that the Labor Party's amendment would remove is paragraph (h) of proposed subsection (3), which gives the minister the power to proscribe by regulation another purpose. So there is flexibility in this statute through a regulation-making power conferred on the minister to specify other purposes. So let us say, for example, that it became apparent that, in listing seven specified purposes, the government had got it wrong, that it had overlooked something that ought to be a legitimate purpose. That could be corrected by a legislative instrument under the regulation-making power in subparagraph (3)(h), but the Labor Party amendment would remove that as well.


So the Labor Party amendment fails the test of specificity—it is vague when it should be precise; it fails the test of purpose, because it abandons the sole purpose test, which is central to the capacity of this provision to operate; and it abandons the regulation-making power, so it fails the test of flexibility as well. For all of those reasons, the government opposes the Labor Party's amendment, and it looks to the good sense of the crossbenchers, excepting the Greens, of course, to do so as well.


Lastly, let me say this: this was not one of the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security supported the provision that the government seeks to enact. That was the bipartisan view of Senator Wong and Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy and Ms Tanya Plibersek and Mr Anthony Byrne from the Labor Party. They actually endorsed the government's position. This is one respect in which the Labor Party, having changed its position here, now seeks to walk away from the bipartisan report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security. If this provision were to be passed for the various reasons I have expressed, it would defeat the entire purpose of an important reform to the criminal law, which the PJCIS has unanimously, in a bipartisan report, endorsed.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2014-10-29,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (12:26):  I have wrestled with this bill, and the discomfort I have felt has been exacerbated by the haste with which this debate has been forced to a conclusion. I have followed and appreciated the contributions of all, particularly my colleague Senator Leyonhjelm, who spoke eloquently in a 'shining' contribution to the debate yesterday. I appreciate the briefings from government and meetings with the Attorney-General on this bill, and I have put to him some of the arguments I am putting forward now—and they are serious.


I recall an old Peanuts cartoon, where Charlie Brown shoots an arrow into a fence and then proceeds to paint circles around the arrow to show that he had hit the target. I am concerned that the target of this legislation is already known in the form of those people under surveillance who may have come back from the ISIS conflict already. That target may well be justified but I am very concerned about laws drafted to target specific individuals. I am also concerned that censoring and incarcerating people who are preaching hatred may not suppress but, in fact, fan the fire of fanaticism. Putting radical preachers, activists and would-be terrorists in prison gives them a captive audience, so to speak. Radical preaching that promotes bombings and beheadings and other gross acts of violence against innocent Australian citizens—men, women, children, the elderly—is utterly abhorrent and contrary to not only Australian values but Australian citizenship and eligibility for residency.


I trust that my colleagues in this place will be as watchful and vigilant in these matters as those law enforcement officials who protect us to ensure recently enacted powers and the powers proposed in this bill are not exceeded. Having stated those reservations and given strong cautions to those who might use these laws in ham-fisted or wrongful ways, I say that Family First will be supporting this bill.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:28):  In the two minutes remaining for debate on this bill, I want to say that this is exactly why—I welcome Senator Day's contribution; he has not spoken before in the committee stage—it is a farce to have an agreement to push this significant counterterrorism law through this parliament by 12.30. There are still important, significant, unexplained and unexplored provisions like stopping welfare, suspension of travel documents, and cancellation and suspension of visas that have not even been touched on in the debate in this chamber today.


I do not think anyone can suggest that there has been any filibustering going on with this. Legitimate concerns and queries have been raised. Not many members of the Senate even had an opportunity to engage in the debate on this. Legitimate questions have been put. Often clear answers have not been given, and those answers have had to be explored. And here we are with the gagging of the debate, and the amendments from various parties and the opposition and the government will be put through as a job lot without any ability to talk to them, to explain them, to understand them. And this is going to be the national security law that Australia will be saddled with after this finishes.



The CHAIRMAN:  Order! The time allocated for consideration of this bill has expired. The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7601 revised be agreed to.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (12:50):  This coming weekend and in particular this Saturday, 1 November, will mark a moment of both enormous pride and enormous solemnity in a very special part of regional Western Australia. This Friday and Saturday, the City of Albany on Western Australia's southern coast will be the focus of national and international attention, as tens of thousands of people gather to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the departure of those troops whose bravery and commitment gave birth to a tradition that continues to inspire a nation.


The morning of 1November 1914 saw 36 merchant ships anchored in the waters of Albany's King George Sound, joined by two newly-born Royal Australian Navy ships, HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Sydney, along with HMS Minotaur, which had escorted ships from New Zealand. Aboard the merchant ships were some 27,000 troops from the Australian Imperial Force and the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, along with 26 nurses from the Australian Army Nursing Service. Although they could not have known it at the time, these men and women were beginning a journey that would transport them not only to the other side of the world but into the realm of legend, for they were the Anzacs.


Today, the phrase 'the Anzacs' carries totemic weight. Even those Australians who take little or no interest in military matters or history nonetheless understand 'Anzac' to be a byword for service, for selflessness and for sacrifice. It is my hope that, as a result of this weekend's commemorative events being held in Albany and the extensive media coverage they are receiving, many more Australians will gain a deeper understanding of just how significant that sacrifice was.


All told, 41,265 Australians and New Zealanders departed from Albany and Fremantle in 1914, the first convoy departing on 1 November and the second departing on 31 December that year. Those in Albany leading up to the departure of the first convoy report the air as being thick with excitement rather than foreboding. The Albany Advertiser noted that waiting troops came ashore 1,500 at a time, along with 'bands and regimental mascots in the form of all conceivable breeds of dogs. Night and day, the scene was pulsating with life.' The departure of the convoy was several times delayed by unfavourable weather, which only served to build the sense of anticipation, on the ships and on the shore.


Also in town to join the departing convoy as a war correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald was Banjo Paterson, already famous as an Australian balladeer and a poet of renown. He wrote: 'Each day there was a report that we were to sail on the following day, but day after day passed, and no move was made by any of the ships. At last, on Saturday October 31, word passed round in the mysterious way in which word does pass round at sea that the transports would leave the next morning.'


Charles Bean, who had narrowly beaten Keith Murdoch for the right to serve as official AIF war correspondent, was one of those aboard. He crisply noted on 1 November: 'At 6.26 am, with the harbour glassily smooth, the Minotaur and Sydney up-anchored and moved out between the sun-bathed hills to sea.'


Banjo Paterson, with his lyrical touch, set the scene more poetically: 'A red sun rises behind a long island away out seaward, on which is a lighthouse, sharply silhouetted against the sky. Not a sound, nor any movement of any living thing, comes from the frowning hills on either side of the waterway. The sea is dull, still grey, without a ripple. A vague electric restlessness is in the air. As each big vessel clears the gateway of the harbour, she too swings around the west and after her leader, and seems to dip her head into the waves with a sort of enjoyment at being once more on the trail.'


It took around three hours in total for all the ships in the convoy to clear Princess Royal Harbour and King George Sound that day. Another aboard, Lieutenant Alan Henderson, wrote to his family about his experience: 'A red letter day in truth. I haven't got any black ink, but this deserves red. We left Albany at about 8:30 this morning. It was a glorious morning, sunny and calm. I snapped the shore as we passed the lighthouse. Then we deployed in three long lines about a mile apart, with 800 yards distance between the ships. It was a beautiful sight. We steamed along the shore till about 6 pm when we turned north-west. This is, I think, the last of Australia. God bless us all while we are away.' Sadly, for Lieutenant Henderson it was indeed the last of Australia. Like so many others aboard the convoy, he was killed in fighting at Gallipoli. Indeed, one third of those aboard the convoys never returned home, meaning that, for many, Albany's dramatic coastline and the spectacular King George Sound afforded a final glimpse of their homeland.


What happened at Gallipoli shaped our nation in a great many ways, but it gave rise to a marked shift in this nation's attitude to war. The horror of what unfolded at Anzac Cove in April 1915 was without precedent in the Australian experience. Our young nation was forced to grow up and to learn hard lessons about the realities of war. In the aftermath of Gallipoli, reportage of troop departures to other conflicts would not feature the word 'excitement' prominently. In that spirit, the events that will take place in Albany this weekend are a commemoration, not a celebration.


The most lasting legacy of this weekend's commemorative activities comes in the form of the brand new National Anzac Centre, which will be officially opened on Saturday. This will mean that, finally, there will be a place for Australians, overseas visitors and—perhaps most importantly—the generations that follow to go, reflect and be immersed in the personal stories of the men and women whose service and valour our nation will always honour.


Fittingly, the National Anzac Centre is perched atop Mount Adelaide, and looks out over the waters of King George Sound, where the story began. Inside, visitors will be able to view a range of interactive exhibits that deepen our understanding of the Anzac experience. An especially moving aspect of the centre is a contemplative water feature, which will continuously screen the names of all who departed on the Anzac convoys. To watch the full cycle of names just once would take over 50 hours.


The National Anzac Centre complements Albany's other significant World War I memorial, the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial, which sits atop Mount Clarence, not far from the site of the of new centre. This memorial was opened by Prime Minister Robert Menzies when he visited Albany in October 1964, and it is fitting that, fifty years later, Prime Minister Tony Abbott will be in Albany this weekend to take part in these commemorative events. His Excellency the Governor-General will also be present, along with the Leader of the Opposition, and representatives from many other states and foreign governments.


With around 60,000 people expected to visit Albany to take part in the various commemorative events, the next 96 hours will be among the most momentous in the community's long history. Among the highlights, in addition to those events I have already discussed, will be a re-enactment of the convoy's departure, comprising ships from the Royal Australian Navy, along with ships sent from our friends and allies internationally to take part. There will also be a troop march and formal commemorative services, as well as films and live concerts that will showcase the ongoing influence of the Anzac experience in Australia today.


None of this, of course, has come together by chance. The series of moving commemorative events we are about to witness in Albany is the culmination of many years of collaborative effort from federal, state and local governments, as well as tremendous amounts of planning and hard work from the local community and, most particularly, the local Returned Services League group.


During my 2½ years as a senator for Western Australia, an absolute highlight has been working cooperatively with Mayor Dennis Wellington and his fellow councillors; Mr Laurie Fraser MBE, OAM, and Mr Peter Aspinall of the Albany RSL—and countless others in the local community that time does not permit me to name. They, together, have helped to make sure that this weekend's events are a fitting tribute to those who gave so much.


Along with many other Western Australians, I very much look forward to being in Albany this weekend as our nation pays tribute to our Anzacs and their enduring spirit, described best, I think, by Charles Bean as standing for: 'reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and endurance that will never own defeat.'

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cameron today relating to indexation of fuel excise.


When will the lies stop? When will this government ever stop lying to the Australian public? This is a government that came to power based on lies. In November 2013 we had lie-athons from this government. It was lie after lie after lie. They barefacedly said that there would be no increases in tax. They said that there would be no cuts to health. They said that there would be no cuts to education. They said the pension would remain untouched. On and on it went. Yet what do we have? Every one of those positions has been turned around by this government.


Now we move on to petrol. Can you all remember the then Leader of the Opposition standing, pouring the petrol, in a western suburbs petrol station, bemoaning the price of petrol and blaming the then government for the price of petrol? Now all that has changed, and it is the Prime Minister putting a tax hike on petrol for ordinary Australians.


Senator Ian Macdonald is one of the longest serving senators in this chamber. He is a senator who I do not have much agreement with on too many issues. But on this issue of the petrol tax, Senator Macdonald, we are as one, because I agree with you, Senator Macdonald, that this tax is wrong and unfair. And I agree that this tax will increase the cost of living and it is bad for people in regional Australia. This is not the Labor Party that is saying these things. This is one of the most senior and experienced Liberal senators in this chamber.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Get on with something important!




Senator CAMERON:
  No wonder Senator Macdonald wants to interject, because he knows that what he has said goes to the heart of the problems with this government.


It is not just about what Senator Macdonald says; it is about the issues that it splits wide open—No. 1: the opposition and division in this government. There is division in this government over the attacks on ordinary working Australians, and now some of them are beginning to realise that you just cannot assault ordinary Australians, day in and day out, without repercussions. I think Senator Macdonald is picking up on that point.


Senator Macdonald goes on to say that, rather than hike the petrol tax, the government should abandon the Paid Parental Leave scheme—the Paid Parental Leave scheme that is going to cost $5.5 billion and which will give benefits to some of the wealthiest people in this country.


What this government does is to lie to the Australian people—and now we have Senator Macdonald exposing the lies. We have Senator Macdonald joining with the Labor Party to expose the lies. We see the lies laid bare. So we see that this government cannot be trusted. It cannot be trusted on anything it says. It cannot be trusted whenever it makes a promise. It cannot be trusted when it comes and says anything in parliament because this is a government that has been brought to power based on lies, and it is a government that continues to lie. So the issues are about lies and the issues are about trust. It is a government that cannot be trusted. It is a government that lied its way to power, and it is a government that continues to lie—'untrustworthy' is the word. (Time expired)

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (15:11):  It is always a pleasure to follow Senator Cameron in a debate after question time. However, I got the sense that Senator Cameron's heart was not quite in it this afternoon. I got the sense that there was a touch of mock outrage, because I think back to the days when we were on the other side of the chamber, and I recall the days when he voted for higher fuel taxes. I recall the days when Senator Cameron voted for a carbon tax that was going to include transport fuels. I recall those days in the first debate over the CPRS. I recall those days when Labor breached its profound commitment to the Australian people and voted to impose a carbon tax at the behest of the fringe Greens in the corner of this chamber. So Senator Cameron did not quite have his heart in attacking the government over this today.


Just once, I am sure all my Liberal and National colleagues would enjoy coming to office and not having to fix a mess inherited from the Labor Party. Just once, we would like to come to office and find the pot of gold that Labor always seems to find upon arriving in office. Just once we would like to come to office and, rather than giving the electorate the truth—the bad news—about the mess that has been inherited and the sacrifices that will need to be made, we would like to have a little bit of money in the kitty to undertake a few new initiatives.


In my short period of being involved in politics, I saw the Kennett government elected in 1992 with the disaster that was bequeathed them by Victorian Labor run by Joan Kirner and John Cain, and the tragedy of very difficult budgets and funding cuts, and the decisions that had to be made by a government to put a state back on its feet and, quite frankly, avoid the state falling into bankruptcy.


I remember the Howard government coming to office in 1996 with an unsustainable deficit, and debt that had peaked at a high level—and, as I am sure someone on the other side will point out, technically a higher level than now, although not increasing as quickly as debt was under the former Labor Party. Then in comparison there was the Labor Party coming to office in 2007 with one of the best fiscal circumstances in the world—with tens of billions of dollars in the bank to cover superannuation liabilities mainly invented by former minister Clyde Cameron when he put so many public servants onto high salaries and into defined benefit superannuation schemes for which no money had been put aside. That was all put aside in the Future Fund. And tens of billions of dollars in surpluses were also put aside for investments in higher education and health. Yet the Labor Party came to office and blew all of that.


The Labor Party came to office and what do we have to show as a nation? We have Senator Conroy sitting in the chamber here with the NBN to nowhere that has cost billions of dollars but served so few people, and that froze investment in new estates all around our country so that people buying new houses were screaming out for services that people in older suburbs could take for granted.


Yet now we have the Labor Party coming in here and complaining about a measure that was announced in the budget—and a mechanism that was used by them in a particularly nasty tax grab on younger Australians to increase the alcohol tax on a particular type of drink, hidden behind the veil of a health measure, which we know did not achieve any of the health objectives it set out to achieve. It just wanted to target young Australians.


When we came to office this government was borrowing money to pay the interest bill accumulated in five budgets of the other side. The other side will say that we do not have that serious a debt problem in Australia, but we had the second fastest growth in debt in the developed world. If those opposite would like to stand and say that there is nothing wrong with our budget situation, the Australian people will judge them on that. Our budget situation is unsustainable in the mechanism that was inherited from those opposite, because when you add all the other liabilities the Commonwealth has, and when you add the liabilities of the state and local governments, the Australian taxpayer is nowhere near as safe and secure as those opposite might have you believe.


This measure is a small one that will cost the average household between 30 and 40 cents a week over the next four years. It will support the balancing of the budget and an investment program that will improve the quality of life and the productivity of the economy. The people will not buy the mock outrage of those opposite.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:16):  On 22 August 2011, Mr Abbott spoke to the parliament about the need for governments to keep their pre-election commitments. On this matter he said:


It is an absolute principle of democracy that governments should not and must not say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards. Nothing could be more calculated to bring our democracy into disrepute and alienate the citizenry of Australia from their government …


Well, this is exactly what they did yesterday. They broke yet another promise to the Australian people and chipped away even further at the trust Australians have in our democracy. Despite the Prime Minister's pre-election promises that there would be no new taxes and no tax increases, the Abbott government yesterday announced that next month they are going to impose a new petrol tax on every motorist in the country. In an extraordinary act, this government is totally bypassing proper democratic processes and sneaking their nasty petrol tax in through the back door. Knowing that they would fail to get support, the government employed trickly tactics to bypass the parliament. It is entirely understandable that Australian Automobile Association chief executive Andrew McKellar has condemned the government's ploy as weak, sneaky, tricky and gutless. That is not me saying this. These are the words of the Australian Automobile Association chief executive.


The move to increase the petrol tax on the sly shows complete disregard for our parliament and for the Australian people, who took Mr Abbott at his word when he promised no new taxes and no tax increases. We heard from Senator Cameron a moment ago that even one of Mr Abbott's own senators, Senator Ian Macdonald, can see what a bad move is. Yesterday, he said, 'My opposition will not change, because I just think it is wrong and it is unfair.' He rightly pointed out that the government would be better off to get rid of their gold plated paid parental leave scheme rather than launching another cost-of-living attack on Australians, and particularly on the most vulnerable Australians.


They were unable to get support for their unfair petrol tax, so they have decided to launch a sneaky attack on the wallets of all motorists, of all families and of all businesses. This is bad. It is underhanded behaviour and it is a clear breach of trust. Nor can those opposite be trusted to put the interests of Australians first. The Labor Party will not support this attack on Australia's cost of living. The fuel tax is neither fair nor is it right.


We have worked with the government on a number of areas, but we will not be blackmailed or bullied by those opposite into supporting bad policy. That is exactly what this bill is—it is bad policy. It is a regressive tax and it will hit hardest the low-income Australians and those in regional areas.




Senator Conroy:
  They do not drive cars.




Senator URQUHART:
  No, they do not drive cars.




Senator Conroy:
  Mr Hockey said that.




Senator URQUHART:
  That is right. Mr Hockey said they do not drive cars. I know a lot of people who live in regional Australia and are on low incomes and they do have to drive cars, because they have no other way to get around. This is the sort of thing, along with the rest of the stuff the government is introducing through their nasty budget, that will continue to hit those on low incomes, the poor, the elderly, the sick—the list goes on and on. These are the people who cannot afford to have this nasty, sneaky, tricky and gutless tax imposed on them.


Again, Senator Macdonald got it right. I do not very often agree with those on the opposite benches, but Senator Macdonald got it right when he said, 'Anything that increases the price of fuel and increases the cost of living is bad for people in regional Australia.' What is worse is the fact that the government is now saying that if they do not get their way in 12 months—that is, if they do not get it put through—they would be happy to hand it all back to their friends in the big oil companies. So don't worry about those on low incomes, don't worry about the people who are struggling: 'We will give it to the big oil companies.' (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  That was a very refreshing contribution from Senator Urquhart. Thank you, Senator Urquhart, because it is refreshing not to hear Senator Urquhart constantly complain about the issue of GST distribution and how bad it would be for Tasmania, not recognising of course that GST distribution is not just in Western Australia's interest, but it is in the national interest, and could in fact set free a state like Tasmania. It could allow the new Liberal government in Tasmania to prosper. GST distribution reform is a great thing. It is disappointing that Labor senators from Tasmania are slow to appreciate that point. But that is not what I am here to talk about.


I feel sorry for Bob Hawke. Once upon a time the Labor Party in this country had a tradition. It was rich in its economic reformist zeal. It took to the challenge of governing this country and it took to the challenge well. I do not mind admitting that, under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, Labor led economic reform in this country—and on many issues with the bipartisan support of the coalition we were able to drive ourselves to new reform and to new levels of economic prosperity.


Of course, that is now lost. Labor no longer has the will to govern. It no longer has the will to drive economic reform. We have heard a lot from Labor over the last 12 months or so and much of it can be categorised as a scare campaign. Let me give you two powerful examples of that: one of them is current to the debate we are having at the moment, but indulge me while I talk about the first one. The first one is the terrible, terrible idea of a Medicare co-payment in our country. The idea that people might have to pay $7—what a terrible idea it is! 


But what they do not talk to you about is that it was Labor's idea—it was Bob Hawke's idea, back in 1991. You do not hear them talking about that. Let me quote—



Senator Lines interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  No, I am on a path to talk about indexation. Senator Lines, hold your talk!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith, direct your comments to the chair and, Senator Lines, please cease interjecting.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy President. I will direct my comments through the chair. Let me read briefly from the House of Representatives Hansard of 20 August 1991. I am happy to say I was at school at the time. This is what Brian Howe, the Labor Deputy Prime Minister and health minister, in 1991, said about the need for a Medicare co-payment in our country, 'Reforms to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable and efficient universal health insurance system are important.' These are the Labor health minister's words in 1991, under the leadership of Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, advocating for a Medicare co-payment in our country. That is a fact.


That brings us to the second issue—one that we were debating today. Isn't it terrible that, as a result of the belligerence of Labor and others in this Senate in not allowing the government to work towards delivering a budget surplus, the government had to make changes to that budget? Yesterday we had Labor members and senators—and you heard them a few moments ago in this place—bemoaning the idea that a new tax was being introduced by this government. But what did they conceal? They concealed the fact that this tax, this fuel excise, was in fact brought in by the Hawke Labor government. Interestingly, in Senate debates you know you are hitting the mark when your opponents go quiet. Let me share with you what Mr Abbott said in the House of Representatives yesterday when talking about this alleged new tax. What did Mr Abbott say? This statement sums up the position perfectly—not surprisingly, as he is the leader, he is the Prime Minister—and exposes the Labor opposition. Mr Abbott said, 'It is not a new tax, it is an indexation of an old tax, a tax that was first introduced by the Hawke government.'

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:26):  I rise to take note of answers to questions put to Senator Cormann around the fuel tax. Instead of publicly defending their objective, stating their case, fighting and arguing the objective to increase fuel tax in the parliament, the government took the sneaky, backdoor approach and used a customs tariff to increase fuel costs at the petrol bowser for all Australians. The Abbott government are so afraid to debate this mean new tax in the parliament that they just went behind the backs of every Australian to sneak this measure through the backdoor. And who could forget the classic clanger from Australia's Treasurer, Joe Hockey? Who could forget when he showed just how out of touch he is—and indeed, the whole of the Abbott government are—when he said, 'The poorest Australians do not have cars or, in many cases, actually do not drive very far.' Wrong! In fact, if any government members, including Mr Hockey, bothered to meet with low-income earners—the ones Mr Hockey said do not have cars or do not drive cars—they would find that they cannot actually afford to fill their cars with petrol. That is the truth. On their meagre budgets they put just enough fuel in their cars to get to and from work and to undertake other important or necessary family functions—just enough fuel to get by on. Now, through the Abbott government's sneaky move, these Australians will have extra pressure on their family budgets. The only person in the Abbott government who seems to understand that is Senator Macdonald, when he belled the cat, when he was brave enough to stand up and say, 'This is a mean tax; this will affect low-income earners.' Senator Macdonald is exactly right.


On top of all the other cruel increases the Abbott government want to heap on the poor and on low-income earners, there is now a new tax on fuel. What about the poor in the bush, who drive even further to get to work, to get to the doctor, to ferry kids around? Thanks to the Nationals, they will cop this new tax, too, and they will have to carry this extra burden in their household incomes. Mr Abbott can talk all he likes about this being a small increase. The more he does it, the more ordinary Australians know how out of touch he is because, when you are living on a benefit or a pension, or you are a low-paid early childhood educator, or you are a low-paid aged carer, every cent counts. Mr Abbott does not have to live on an hourly rate of around $20 per hour and he does not have to make a part-time wage stretch across his whole family. He is a Prime Minister with no idea about those who are less fortunate than himself. If he had any understanding at all, he would stop making these claims. Now this mean-spirited, out-of-touch Abbott government is talking up an increase in the GST, which, just like this fuel increase, will hit the poorest in our society the hardest. In people's next pay packet, they will be hit with this fuel increase, whether they like it or not.


Who could forget how the Liberal Party hatched their cunning plan to trick the Nationals earlier in the year—they trapped their junior partners—by pretending it was all about the diesel fuel debate? No, the plan has been on the table since then; it was always about the fuel increase. Instead of having the stomach to come in here and face the Labor Party opposition, they went out the back door because they know, just like Senator Macdonald knows, that this is a harsh measure. The fuel tax will hit every single Australian and it will hit those who Mr Hockey apparently thinks do not have cars or do not drive very far the hardest. They are an out-of-touch, mean-spirited government who will not now bring their measures into this parliament so that the Australian people can see the inconsistencies of this government—a government of broken promises and harsh measures.

The Civil Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is an omnibus bill which will amend sections of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Copyright Act 1968, the Court Security Act 2013, the Evidence Act 1995, the Family Law Act 1975, the International Arbitration Act 1974, andthe Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. The bill will make minor and technical amendments to provide more clarity to the legislation, correct legislative oversights and amend obsolete provisions. The combined effect of these amendments will improve the efficiency and operation of the justice system administered by the Attorney-General's portfolio. 




Body



The government is determined to reduce regulation and make Commonwealth laws clear and accessible. Some of the provisions in this bill go directly towards implementing the government's deregulation agenda. For example, the amendments to the Copyright Act will reduce the impact of the legal deposit scheme on publishers. At present, publishers of certain literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works must deliver copies of their works in print format. The amendments will provide for publishers to submit their works electronically, which will reduce the time and cost burden on the industry. 


The government aims to make all Commonwealth legislation coherent, readable and accessible to the widest possible audience. To this end, the Court Security Act will be amended to clarify the process by which court security orders can be varied and revoked. Minimising confusion creates a fairer and more accessible justice system. The Court Security Act amendments will also address court management issues by extending the authority to hold and dispose of unclaimed dangerous items. 


Amendments to the Evidence Act will increase consistency with the Uniform Evidence Bill for greater cross-jurisdictional compliance. 


The bill will also amend the International Arbitration Act to clarify its application, providing certainty for private parties who entered into arbitration agreements before the International Arbitration Act was last amended in 2010. 



Minor, technical amendments contained in the bill will improve the operation of the Family Law Act by correcting errors and ensuring the use of consistent language. The bill will also amend the Family Law Act to explicitly permit the provision of certain information relating to family law proceedings to child welfare authorities. This amendment will ensure that child welfare authorities have access to any relevant material to enable them to better protect children.


The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act will ensure that assistance received under the National Disability Insurance Scheme is not distributed to a bankrupt's creditors. The amendments also modernise the drafting of offences under the Act and ensure that they have kept up with modern technology. Additionally the amendments will enhance the Australian Financial Security Authority's capacity to act as a special trustee for other government agencies. In its special trustee role the Australian Financial Security Authority seizes and sells property pursuant to a Court order in relation to a debt owed to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency.


The bill will add currency and ease of application to the legal system as it stands today. Significantly, the bill will facilitate the removal of obsolete and redundant clauses. For example, the bill will amend the Family Law Act to remove obsolete requirements for annual publication of certain information, as well as to repeal an obsolete definition. And the bill will amend the Evidence Act to remove obsolete provisions and references to the operation of the Evidence Act in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. 


The bill reflects the government's commitment to better equip Australia to meet the needs of industry and consumers in the digital age. For example, the amendments to the Copyright Act will allow the National Library of Australia to collect not only our print history but also our digital history.




Conclusion



In conclusion, the intention of this bill is to make minor and technical amendments to a number of Acts in order to increase access to justice for all Australians by removing ambiguity in legislation and streamlining legal processes. The bill will increase the currency, clarity and consistency of legislation administered by the Attorney-General's portfolio. Significantly, the amendments contained within the bill will improve the justice system by making it easier for individuals to understand and comply with the law.


COUNTER TERRORISM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2014


The Bill contains a package of amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (IS Act) and the Criminal Code 1995 (Code).


The amendments address three key areas:


facilitating the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) supporting and cooperating with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) on military operations;


enhancing the arrangements for the provision of emergency Ministerial authorisations to IS Act agencies to undertake activities in the performance of their statutory functions; and


enhancing the control order regime to allow the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to seek control orders in relation to a broader range of individuals of security concern and to streamline the application process. 


The Bill will also implement a final recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in relation to the Counter Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014.


These proposed amendments are being brought forward in a separate Bill to the two major tranches of national security legislation the Government has introduced in the Spring sittings – the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 1) (which passed the Parliament on 1 October and received the Royal Assent on 2 October); and the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill (introduced on 24 September and is presently before the Parliament).


The measures in the Bill have been included as a result of instances of operational need identified by relevant agencies subsequent to the introduction of the previous two tranches of legislation. In the case of the proposed IS Act amendments, the need for amendment is urgent, as a result of recent developments in the security environment, primarily due to the Government's decision to authorise the ADF to undertake operations against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist organisation in Iraq.


The Government has brought forward these measures in a separate Bill, to ensure that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) has an opportunity to conduct a review of them, and report to the Parliament on its findings.


I have today referred the Bill to the PJCIS for inquiry and report by 17 November, so that its analysis can inform the Parliamentary debate of the Bill in the final fortnight of the Spring sittings.




Intelligence Services Act amendments



There is an urgent need to make amendments to the ISA to ensure that intelligence agencies can undertake relevant activities in support of the ADF's operations in Iraq against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist organisation. 


These activities are anticipated to include the collection of intelligence in relation to Australian persons who are known or suspected participants in the hostilities, and particularly those who are known or suspected of fighting with or alongside the IS terrorist organisation. Such intelligence is likely to prove instrumental to these operations, including in protecting ADF personnel, members of other defence forces, and civilians from death or serious harm as a result of terrorist or other hostile acts committed in the course of the conflict.


The proposed amendments are directed to two key areas.


ASIS activities in support of, and in cooperation with, the ADF


First, the primary purpose of the amendments is to better facilitate ASIS providing timely assistance to the ADF in support of military operations, and its cooperation with the ADF on intelligence matters. The proposed amendments make explicit that such support and cooperation is a function of ASIS, consistent with explicit functions to this effect conferred upon the other two ISA agencies, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO). 


These measures also make a small number of amendments to facilitate the timely performance by ASIS of this function. These concern the provision of Ministerial authorisation by the Minister responsible for ASIS in relation to a class of Australian persons, and enabling the Attorney-General as the Minister responsible for ASIO to provide agreement to an authorisation in respect of individuals falling within a specified class of Australian persons. All of the existing safeguards in the ISA will apply to the performance of the new function. These include the statutory thresholds for the granting of authorisations, Ministerial reporting requirements, and the independent oversight of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS).




Emergency Ministerial authorisations



Secondly, the proposed amendments also remedy practical limitations identified in the arrangements for emergency ministerial authorisations which apply to ASIS, ASD and AGO.


The amendments make provision for the contingency that the relevant Ministers may be temporarily uncontactable when there is an urgent, previously unforeseen need to collect vital intelligence. Presently, there is no legal basis on which agencies can undertake activities in these circumstances, meaning that critical intelligence collection opportunities may be missed. The amendments will address this, by enabling an agency head to grant a limited emergency authorisation, subject to rigorous and extensive safeguards and oversight mechanisms. 


These authorisations are strictly limited to 48 hours maximum and cannot be renewed. Additional issuing criteria apply to authorisations by agency heads, including express consideration of whether the relevant Minister would have been likely to grant the authorisation, on the basis of the existing statutory criteria. Further, to ensure it is only available in an extreme emergency, the agency head must also be satisfied that, if the activity was not authorised, security would be seriously prejudiced or there would be a serious risk to a person's safety. The Minister must be notified as soon as practicable within 48 hours, and is under a positive obligation to make a decision about whether it should continue within the 48 hour maximum, or be cancelled or replaced with a Ministerial authorisation. The IGIS must also be notified as soon as practicable within three days.


The amendments also provide for contingency arrangements in the event that the Attorney-General is not readily available or contactable to provide his or her agreement to the making of an emergency Ministerial authorisation, where such agreement is required because the authorisation concerns the undertaking of activities in relation to an Australian person who is, or who is likely to be, engaged in activities that are, or are likely to be, a threat to security.


The amendments address an unintended limitation in the ability of Ministers to issue emergency authorisations. Presently, no provision is made for Ministers to issue these authorisations orally, with a written record to be made of that decision. This is incompatible with the circumstances of urgency in which emergency authorisations are designed to operate, and with the longstanding approach to other forms of emergency authorisation – including search warrants, telecommunications interception warrants, surveillance devices warrants and, more recently, the authorisation by the Attorney-General of special intelligence operations by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The proposed amendments bring the emergency Ministerial authorisation process in the ISA into line with this approach.




Criminal Code amendments



The amendments to the Criminal Code will further strengthen the control order regime and enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies to protect the public from terrorist acts. The amendments will allow the AFP to request, and an issuing court to make, a control order in relation to those who ""enable"" and those who ""recruit"". Although such individuals may not directly participate in terrorist acts, their conduct in supporting and facilitating terrorism through the provision of funds and equipment, or by recruiting vulnerable young people to champion their cause – and even to die for it – is instrumental to carrying out terrorist conduct. The expansion of the control order regime to cover such individuals will help disrupt terrorism at an earlier stage, keeping Australia and Australians safe and secure.


The amendments to the control order regime will also streamline the application process by reducing the volume of material that must be provided to the Attorney General when seeking consent to request an interim control order, and extend the time for obtaining the Attorney General's consent when making an urgent request to an issuing court without first obtaining the Attorney General's consent. 


Finally, the implementation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's recommendation will require the Attorney General to advise the Committee before amending a regulation that lists a terrorist organisation by adding an alias or removing a former name and to allow the Committee to review any proposed change during the disallowable period.




Concluding remarks



The measures in the Bill will ensure that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have the necessary capability to operate effectively in the contemporary security environment. They will be of particular utility in circumstances of urgency presented by the activities of Australians who participate in foreign conflicts, including fighting with, or otherwise supporting the violent activities of, terrorist organisations.

Senator MILNE:
  I am delighted to stand up here and support initiatives that will bring downward pressure on the cost of energy to all Australians, and the best initiative in that regard would be to increase the renewable energy target which is bringing down the wholesale price of power as I stand here and speak. 


An initiative that would bring down the price of power is fixing the national electricity market rules to allow more renewable energy to engage and flow into the system. Stopping the gold plating of the polls and wires would be another fantastic initiative to bring downward pressure on the price of power. So the best thing we can do is support the initiatives that roll out renewables and stop the costs associated with fossil fuels. I am delighted to support the initiatives that bring down the price of power.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (15:57):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need for the Abbott Government to respond to the Ebola epidemic and to take responsibility for Australia's role in the international effort to combat Ebola.


Before entering this place, I worked in public health. I was a public health specialist. I spent some time on HIV prevention in India. I also worked in Victoria's health department, for a time, as part of an outbreak investigation team. In that role we responded to all sorts of outbreaks—food-borne outbreaks from restaurants, influenza outbreaks from aged care facilities and measles outbreaks from childcare centres. The one thing that is common to each outbreak is that time is of the essence. With each day that we wait more people are exposed and the outbreak spreads further. And it becomes much more difficult to contain. That is why I am so concerned about this government's response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. 


Ebola has always been of concern because of the deadly nature of the virus. There is about a 50 per cent chance that if you contract the virus you will die from it. But this outbreak in west Africa is unprecedented. It is unprecedented in terms of the scale of the outbreak and in terms of its spread into urban settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States have said that if it is left unchecked Ebola could infect anywhere from half a million to 1.4 million people, with a good chance that over half of them will die. We already know that thousands have died and that many more thousands will face a horrific death. We have seen comments from Medecins Sans Frontieres' Executive Director, Paul McPhun, who said that responding to Ebola is a lot like responding to a bushfire, and he is right. Unless you combat the fire at its source, then spot fires will continue to burn right around the globe. In places that are unprepared—usually places with low capacity in terms of their health systems—those spot fires will take hold and soon we will be fighting this epidemic on many different fronts.


Thankfully Australia has a first-class health system. We are able to carry out the basic tasks that are the mainstays of outbreak containment. We can identify cases early through diagnosis and laboratory testing, we can trace contacts and we can ensure that there is appropriate isolation and quarantine measures, and it can all be done very quickly. But countries in our region are not so lucky. Like an ember landing on a tinder-dry forest floor, Ebola has the potential to quickly spiral out of control in a country like PNG. Its rudimentary health system just does not have the capacity to identify cases and put in the appropriate public health measures to contain it.


The global response so far has been insufficient. The United Nations estimates that, in order to beat Ebola, at least four and a half thousand beds are needed. We need about 20,000 doctors and nurses, but we have only a fraction of that on the ground. Thankfully we have seen some movement. President Obama is to be commended for the leadership he is showing on this issue. The US has now sent a major general to take over the US military mission to fight Ebola. One of its divisions has been in Liberia for six weeks. It has built two new laboratories and, along with the UK, is now building field hospitals that should be operational in the coming weeks. They have pledged 4,000 troops and they have trained health workers. Cuba has deployed 250 health workers to West Africa, Israel is sending medical crews and Japan has dispatched medical experts. China has expanded its medical deployment and Britain is working on five new treatment centres and 700 additional beds. Special mention goes to MSF, or Doctors Without Borders, who have around 3,000 staff in West Africa, are operating six Ebola case management centres and are providing 600 isolation beds. They are one of the biggest players in this crisis—bigger than any nation state.


Contrast that with the response from the Australian government, which has been, frankly, appalling. It is no wonder that the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, who is visiting the three West African nations worst hit by Ebola, has been very critical of the international community, and she has reason to be angry. Here in Australia, the Prime Minister stated that it would be irresponsible to send our people and put them in harm's way without getting an assurance that they would be evacuated. But we heard, through Senate estimates just last week, that Australia has been given assurances that people would be looked after on a case-by-case basis, and there has not yet been one case where a medical evacuation has been refused. We have also learnt that, with the UK and the US now building field hospitals, there will not be a need for medical evacuation. We have also heard the Prime Minister say that we should keep our trained health professionals in Australia so they can be first responders to an outbreak in a place like PNG, but that is a decision that displays incredible ignorance and runs the risk of putting their lives at risk. Unless our first responders have the field experience necessary to respond to this unique outbreak, their lives will be at risk and they will not be able to combat the epidemic in a place like PNG. It is akin to sending in firefighters to tackle a raging fire without ever having seen one.


There is a world of difference between responding to an outbreak in an Australian hospital and responding to an outbreak in the field in a developing country. That is why NGOs send their workers to intensive training in Europe and field experience under the supervision of mentors. This is not something you can do from a lecture theatre. If we are genuine about keeping our region safe, we would be sending our health workers to get that training and experience in the field. Why is it that we can agree to military intervention in Iraq in the name of saving lives and yet we cannot commit a fraction of those resources to an emergency that the UN has said is bigger than the threat of terrorism? I suspect that part of the reason lies in fear and ignorance. Those are the enemies in a crisis like this.


We had the federal government on Tuesday announcing that it would stop processing visa applications to people travelling from Ebola affected countries. On what advice was that decision made? I know that my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young will have more to say on this. It is not based on science. Infectious disease experts and biosecurity experts know that these sorts of bans do nothing to keep Australia safe, but what they do is create a climate of fear and panic. As the United Nations say, it is that climate of fear and panic that discourages the vital relief work that is necessary to get on top of this epidemic. We have seen Liberia's president urging Australia to reconsider its travel bans. We have seen Sierra Leone calling the move draconian—a move that does not target Ebola; it is a move that targets the 24 million citizens of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.


Thankfully we have President Obama showing some leadership on this. He said that health workers who volunteer to treat Ebola patients should be applauded, and he has been very cautious about quarantine measures. Instead, what do we get from the health minister here in Australia? Just this morning he was talking about people cancelling their holidays to places like Queensland in response to the isolated cases that state has seen. Ignorance and fear are the enemies here. The minister needs to realise that words are bullets. What we need to hear are statements based on fact and evidence—statements that do more to encourage people to contribute to the field effort in West Africa.


There are many reasons that Australia should act. If this outbreak proceeds unchecked and the worst case scenarios predicated by the CDC are realised, it has the potential to disrupt trade right across the world and to cause a huge jolt to the global economy. We know that there are Australian health workers who are desperate to contribute. They want to be there. They are just waiting for the go-ahead from the government. But, most of all, there are hundreds of thousands of people—people just like us, people who share the same dreams and aspirations that we share—who will die if we do not act. That is reason alone.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:08):  I am delighted to rise to contribute to this debate. I acknowledge Senator Di Natale for his professional experience and his work in the public health area. Let me make this first point: the primary obligation of any country is to ensure that it does not put its citizens unnecessarily at risk and without a circumstance in which it is able to assist them, should they be placed at risk—indeed, heaven forbid, should they pick up a virus such as this one. The second point that I make is that there is nothing stopping Australian volunteers at this time from making themselves available through NGOs or any other process in Africa to contribute to the work associated with getting on top of and hopefully eliminating this virus.


Senator Di Natale quite rightly says that, on a case-by-case basis, progress is being made in this area. Senator Di Natale used the bushfire analogy. As Senator Siewert knows, I have some expertise in the bushfire area. Using that analogy, Senator Di Natale, I can assure you that the last thing a fire service would ever do is say that it is ready for the fire season on a fire-by-fire basis. You are either ready, prepared and able to respond and eventually assist the recovery process or you are not. That is the circumstance in which Australia finds itself at the moment.


There is nothing stopping volunteers who feel that there are safeguards adequately in place from making a contribution. There are already people in the health and allied areas involving themselves. Australia's contribution to date has been some $18 million announced by the Prime Minister and the foreign minister: $10 million to the UN Ebola Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund, $3.5 million to the World Health Organisation, $2.5 million to support provision of front-line services under the Humanitarian Partnership Agreement and $2 million to support the UK's delivery of frontline medical services in Sierra Leone. Australia's contribution was praised by the United Nations as 'exactly the kind of quick and effective response the UN is asking of member states.' The issue of Australia's possible further contribution is alive, but it will be on the basis of doing what all governments should do—that is, ensure the safety of their citizens. There would be no circumstance at this time—as I, with some understanding of epidemiology and virus diseases, would understand it—where we could be strongly endorsing or conscripting people to participate.


The virus is an interesting one. It is a zoonosis, a disease transmissible between animals and humans. It has its name from a river, the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease was first described in humans in 1976. It is a member of the filoviridae family. As we have been told, its contagion is more akin to that of HIV-AIDS, which is not of itself highly contagious. Its transmission is through bodily fluids and is not of itself an aerosol based transfer as we would find with, for example, pneumonia viruses. Let me make this point strongly—this was confirmed the other day for me by the Chief Medical Officer—sputum, phlegm or nasal discharge is highly infectious. Indeed, if a person who has nasal discharge or mucus from the mouth were to cough or sneeze over other people, it certainly would be spread through the air. Whilst not an aerosol droplet as with an influenza virus, it certainly has the capacity to be so spread.


We know that in the very same geographic areas in Africa, in parts of South America and in the Indian subcontinent the horrific disease malaria is endemic. I have had this discussion with Senator Di Natale. Malaria is a blood parasite transmitted by mosquitoes, as nearly everybody knows. In 2012 alone, there were 207 million cases, of which 627,000 died—over 90 per cent in Africa. That is more than 1,700 deaths a day, affecting mainly young children, pregnant women, older people and those with low immunity. Why do I make that point? I do not in any way wish to belittle or demean the incidences we have had of Ebola; we have had 10,000 cases of which about 50 per cent have died. It is a very high mortality rate. But it is interesting that from the time that this particular outbreak was first diagnosed in December of 2013 there have been 510,000 deaths from malaria in Africa. That is over half a million. Even since August, when the Ebola epidemic ramped up towards the horrific numbers we are seeing now, 150,000-plus people have died from malaria. Let us ensure that when we are engaged in the activities of looking to prevent disease and to protect the health of people in underdeveloped communities we do not forget that we are losing over half a million people to a disease which is preventable.


In the last couple of moments available to me I want to turn attention to the circumstance here in Australia. We are very, very well equipped. Each capital city now has a hospital that is ready. We saw evidence of that in Brisbane only the other day, when a person presented with clinical signs that could have been those of the Ebola virus. The actions that took place were correct; they were timely. The lessons learnt in Dallas, Texas—obviously one of the world's leading medical and hospital systems—as a result of failures of biosecurity were well and truly addressed in Australia. I am very confident of our contribution.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:15):  I also rise to contribute to this urgency motion regarding the tragedy occurring in West Africa with the outbreak of Ebola. It is indeed with a sense of urgency that we contribute to this debate, because attention in West Africa is urgently needed. Personnel is needed in West Africa. Yet what we have had, unfortunately, from the Abbott government is some kind of stagnation when it comes to actually doing something and joining with our international partners—the UK, the US and other Western democracies—to offer that assistance.


Despite that, for weeks now Labor has been pressing the Abbott government to do more to fight the Ebola crisis and in doing so our shadow foreign affairs minister, Tanya Plibersek, and our shadow health minister, Catherine King, wrote to the Abbott government requesting that immediate arrangements be made, specifically highlighting the need to deploy Australian medical assistance teams—AUSMAT or similar—to West Africa and support other specialist Australian personnel who are willing and able to prevent the spread of Ebola. But on top of Labor's insistence in urging the government to act, there have been myriad specialists and organisations in the medical field that have been doing likewise, including the nation's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Baggoley, who threw his support behind the need to send Australian medical teams to West Africa. Again, that has fallen on deaf ears, with no action at all.


I noticed that Senator Back raised the fact that there has been an $18 million contribution provided by the Australian government. Of course the opposition supports providing that money for relief efforts, but money alone is not enough to resolve this terrible crisis occurring in West Africa. Organisations on the front line, like Medecins Sans Frontieres, have made that very clear and have said that they now are in desperate need of personnel rather than donations. Yet that is falling on deaf ears here with the Abbott government. In the meantime, we know that another day passes when there are more people becoming infected; another day passes when more people are dying. This is a terrible disease. We know it is not the only disease; we know there are people dying of malaria and other diseases in parts of the world. And we have appropriate mechanisms that we have contributed to try to help that as well. But this is a crisis that has been brought about and that can be resolved in some way if we as a nation join with the US and the UK and ensure that we do something to support preventing its spreading any further.


What we know so far is that the British are reportedly sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone. The US has dispatched 3,000 people to Sierra Leone, and there have also been personnel sent from South Africa, China and Cuba. Yet the Abbott government is still ignoring the advice to assist in putting people on the ground. That is despite calls by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon; the UN Security Council—their own resolution on the matter—Medecins Sans Frontieres, as I said; the International Crisis Group; the President of Sierra Leone; Oxfam; the Australian Medical Association; and the Public Health Association of Australia. And the list goes on—the amount of calling on this government to act.


We know that going to help fight Ebola in West Africa would not be without risk, which is why it is important that safety protocols are put in place to support Australian personnel who volunteer to serve. Of course the safety of those personnel must be paramount. But it should not be beyond the wit of this Australian government to negotiate with our international partner countries to ensure that those appropriate stand-by evacuation and treatment arrangements and the like are provided for any Australian personnel. It is a deep concern that this is not happening so far with the Abbott government. In fact, it is simply unacceptable that the Abbott government has failed to make such arrangements and to act. In the meantime, we know that many Australian workers are ready, willing and able to assist. There is simply no time to lose.


As I understand, there are some who have gone. But we need this Abbott government to be sending, along with the $18 million committed so far, personnel, just like the UK and just like the US have done, and to be ensuring that we are doing our part to keep this terrible disease under control. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict that if the international community does not do more then the number of Ebola cases could reach 1.4 million by early 2015. That in itself I think shows the reason our government should be doing more. We cannot afford to wait until Ebola reaches our region or our own country—Australia itself—before it becomes part of the global effort to control this virus.


This week, as I said, we have heard wildly different accounts about the Abbott government's preparedness to respond to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. We have heard about it from the Chief Medical Officer himself, the head of the health department, the Defence Force, the foreign affairs department and the immigration minister. At an estimates hearing, the foreign affairs department revealed that it was actually back in September—we are almost into November—that the UK and US governments made specific requests to Australia to send personnel to help fight the Ebola crisis in West Africa. I think it was Senator Di Natale that raised the point that, when our efforts in security issues are required and military issues in other parts the world, we are fairly quick to respond. When it is necessary, we do so. Why can't we respond to this terrible Ebola crisis that is going on in West Africa?


As I said in the adjournment debate last night, in my home state of Tasmania and across the country, the Sierra Leone community have set up the Salone Ebola Action Group, who themselves have been fundraising. In my home state, they fundraised $7,000 and got a lot of donations to provide medical equipment—a whole container left Sydney a couple weeks ago—to send to Sierra Leone, at the request of the Sierra Leone government and because some of those Sierra Leone community members in my home state have lost members of their own family and wanted to do something. So we have individual members of the Australian community acting. We have civil society acting. We have the medical fraternity making it very clear that there needs to be more action. Yet, when all of that is put forward to the Abbott government we have, unfortunately, this kind of stagnation where no decision has been made. Now is the time—that is what this urgency motion is about.


Now is the time for the Abbott government to actually get on board. They have had the request from the UK and US governments. They have had the request from the international community. They have had the request from the AMA and from the other civil society bodies here in Australia and elsewhere. There is absolutely no reason why the Abbott government should not be acting today on this issue. As I said, it should not be beyond the wit of the government to negotiate with our international partner countries on the issue of safety of our Australian personnel.


We know that, so far, Ebola has killed more than 4,000 people. It has infected around 10,000 people in West Africa. If we do not do more, some predictions suggest the number of Ebola cases could reach 1.4 million. This is no longer just a humanitarian issue in West Africa; it poses a direct threat on the rest of the world and we need to act. (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:25):  I rise today to contribute to this important debate on the issue of Australia's contribution to the efforts to defeat Ebola in West Africa and of course to deal with it as a global issue, not simply left to those nations currently struggling with the epidemic. As the Greens spokesperson for immigration I am extremely concerned at the approach and attitude of the government's Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison, in relation to this issue.


On Monday, the Abbott government made an extraordinary announcement. On the ABC's AM program, the immigration minister announced that he was effectively shutting Australia's borders to people from Western Africa, that anyone who did not already have a visa would be locked out and that the humanitarian program has been suspended—just like that, slam! The Australian government has locked the front door and shuttered up the windows while the house is burning. The message is clear from the Australia immigration minister and his government: 'No refugees and no people who are seeking to leave West Africa are welcome here; sorry, but we're just not interested in your suffering.' How mean, cruel and incredibly selfish this government is.


Not only are we refusing to carry our weight in responding to the Ebola crisis, as previously outlined by my colleague Senator Di Natale, but also to send such an irrational, fearmongering message not just to our own domestic community but to the rest of the world is devastating for those who are actively trying to do their best to control the Ebola epidemic. 


The United Nations has said that measures such as suspending these types of visa programs and closing the door on those fleeing from West Africa could discourage the vital relief work, making it harder to stop the spread of the deadly virus. So well done, Scott Morrison! Well done, immigration minister! There is no doubt that slamming the door in the face of people from West Africa is dispiriting to those who are struggling to fight the outbreak on the ground. Liberia's president has urged Australia to reconsider its travel ban, saying:


Anytime there's stigmatisation, there's quarantine, there's exclusion of people … we get very sad.


Sierra Leone's information minister, Alpha Kanu, said Australia's move is discriminatory in that it is not going after Ebola but, rather, is against the 24 million citizens of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. He added:


Certainly, it is not the right way to go.


Mr Kanu, I could not agree with you more. US President, Barack Obama, said his country's response would be guided by science and not by fear. And, yet, here we have our Australian ministers whipping up fear, fearmongering and creating hysteria. The fact of the matter is that announcements like this one, banning refugees from the region and cancelling visa requests, create fear in both Australia and the communities that are actually struggling to deal with the crisis.


The World Health Organisation has said that any type of travel bans would deter aid workers, which is the last possible thing that we should be doing at this time. A senior Ugandan government spokesperson said, 'With moves like this, Western countries are creating a culture of fear.' Again, well done, Minister Morrison, for being such a wonderful diplomat on the international stage! The Ugandan government spokesperson said, and I quote: 


If they create mass panic ... this fear will eventually spread beyond ordinary people to health workers or people who transport the sick and then what will happen? Entire populations will be wiped out.


These are the words of the very people who are asking Australia for help. Other Ugandan officials have said that they are worried that Africa will be cut off from the world. 'We don't want anybody to think that this is an African problem,' they said. 'It is a global problem that we must handle together.'


Why is Australia so insistent on isolating itself from the rest of the world? Ebola is certainly a global problem, and it is only by working together that we will overcome it. Australia's selfish response to this crisis, with MPs trying to score domestic political points while the government drags its heels, has been extremely disappointing, and it is starting to bite in terms of our international reputation. In the past, Australia has been at the forefront of responding to international catastrophes. There were inspiring scenes during a surge of national pride when we came together and worked with other nations in response to the tragic Boxing Day tsunami in 2004. Last year, when the massive earthquake struck the Philippines, Australian men and women came together and worked with the government to help those who were suffering. These were great achievements that helped build our national character. But when it comes to the global response to Ebola, Australia is severely lacking. In fact, apart from a deafening silence, the Abbott government's only response has been to ban West African refugees from coming to Australia. That is a shameful announcement—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  That is just a lie and you know it.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  and a baseless decision, and it must be reversed as soon as possible.




Senator Moore:
  I rise on a point of order. Senator Macdonald has called Senator Hanson-Young's contribution a lie and has consistently said that over and over again. I ask him to withdraw it.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Senator Macdonald, could you withdraw that remark?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I am happy to.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Let's be clear about this: the immigration minister's ban on refugees is political politically motivated. It is disturbing to see that, with his thirst for power on his own frontbench, his campaign against anyone who is asking for Australia's help seems just to spread to the next front.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why don’t you tell the truth?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you will get an opportunity to speak shortly. You will be free then to respond to anything you choose to. In the meantime, please let Senator Hanson-Young finish. She only has a few minutes to go.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Clearly, there are members of Mr Morrison's own party who are either unclear or uncomfortable with the ban of West African refugees, as announced by the minister this week. And why was this ban announced, Madam Acting Deputy President? Let me spell it out for you. This is a minister who was firstly anti-boats. Then he was anti-Middle East. Now he is anti-West African. This is a minister who is doing everything he can to keep people who need help from ever being able to reach Australia. The question is: what do these groups of people have in common? I will not venture a guess. But I think it is important to remember what Scott Morrison, the immigration minister, once urged his party room to do. He asked them: why don't we capitalise on what he referred to as the growing anti-Muslim feeling in Australia? That is what I believe is at the core of this baseless, heartless, cruel decision to ban West African refugees.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I rise on a point of order. Was Senator Hanson-Young in the party room to hear Mr Morrison say this? She cannot be allowed to tell deliberate and outrageous untruths in this parliament.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I believe that is a point of debate.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I fear that, at this time, with a populist, knee jerk, irrational move to ban refugees from West Africa, the minister this time has gone too far. I urge him to reconsider. I urge his government to reconsider before any more damage is done not just to Australia's reputation of being a caring and cooperative nation but to those millions of people on whom Mr Morrison is simply suggesting that Australia turn its back. We know this government needs to be doing more on the ground. We know we need to be helping to send professionals. But what we also know is that we should not be slamming the door shut and shuttering up the windows while the house is burning.


The Senate today has called on the government to provide this place by 3 pm tomorrow with the advice by which this decision to suspend the humanitarian program was made by the minister. I look forward very much to reading that advice come 3 pm tomorrow. If it is not produced by 3 pm tomorrow, you have got to wonder if this was just part of Mr Morrison's cruel crusade, or does he really think that by putting a stethoscope around his neck and walking in to question time he is instantly a medical expert on the issue?

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Ebola</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,19,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:35):  What a nasty, vicious and completely untruthful address that was by the previous speaker. It was a diatribe against the minister who has done more to save lives and to get our immigration system in order than any minister in recent history. Senator Hanson-Young cannot stand that. She cannot stand the fact that she has been proved wrong and that Mr Morrison saves lives and brings some order into the immigration system that brings in those who have been waiting in refugee camps for years.


I am a bit confused by this debate. I have heard Senator Singh and Senator Hanson-Young. I am not quite sure what they are complaining about. Senator Hanson-Young, untruthfully, said that the Australian government had done nothing. It is a matter of fact that already $18 million has been provided in direct assistance, and at the estimates committee hearing we were told that Australia punches well above its weight when it comes to humanitarian aid. If it is the money that Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Singh are talking about, and if they want Australia to provide more money, then they should say where it is to come from. I say to Senator Hanson-Young: how would it be if we were able to give $33 million a day to fight Ebola? She would probably say, 'Ooh, that'd be good!' If Senator Hanson-Young had not supported the previous government, which ran up a debt that will approach $600 billion and costs Australia $33 million a day in interest—if Senator Hanson-Young had not been part of that—we could be using that $33 million every day to go to aid around the world. It could go to the Ebola crisis. But do we hear that from Senator Hanson-Young? Of course not.


Senator Hanson-Young's diatribe was just—well, it was not full of untruths; there was not an accurate thing in what she said! I think it is quite interesting that when Senator Hanson-Young misrepresents something and the information she has provided to the Senate is completely wrong, all she does is sit there and giggle. It simply proves that Senator Hanson-Young does not give one iota of concern to the plight of people who are in these situations around the world. If she did, she would support Mr Morrison's attempt to bring people into this country who are waiting their turn in the squalid camps around the world. But there we are. Senator Hanson-Young, if you want to give $33 million a day to fight Ebola, you could have done that if you had not supported the previous government in running up a debt that now costs us $33 million a day in interest.


I ask Senator Hanson-Young or Senator Singh, as I asked Senator Di Natale in estimates: what is stopping any of them from volunteering their services today to go to these places in western Africa? As we were told at estimates, there is not one thing stopping Senator Di Natale using his expertise as a medical practitioner to slip over there and help—not one thing. I might say that Senator John Herron, formerly of this chamber, actually did just that when he went to South Africa, to Rwanda and Burundi, to use his medical skills to help there. There is nothing that the Australian government is doing that would stop any person in Australia from going and doing that. Senator Hanson-Young tells us that there are dozens or hundreds of people waiting to go. If they want to go, good luck to them; they go with my best wishes and my great admiration. We should be encouraging those people. But the Australian government has an obligation, a duty of care, to anyone it might send, and the duty of care is to make sure that those people, those Australians, are safe when they are there and that they come back into the country, as well, safely.


We have heard of some politician—up in Cairns, I understand—getting on their soap box and berating the Australian government for letting anybody back into the country who happens to have ever been over there. Nobody takes any notice of that particular politician anyhow, but he was reflecting a view of many people that we have to be very careful that the disease does not come into Australia.


All of the evidence we have heard at estimates committee hearings, all of the things we have read in the paper and all of the announcements by the Prime Minister, the health minister, the foreign affairs minister and the immigration minister point to the fact that we want to be very careful, for Australian citizens, that we do not have the Ebola crisis here. I also raised the point at estimates—and it is something I have raised often—that there are other countries who have a closer association with Africa than Australia does. Australia has now, fortunately, directed its humanitarian aid to the Pacific and to South-East Asia, which I think is appropriate. And we are keeping money in reserve to address any possible outbreak of Ebola in the areas close to Australia for which we have a special responsibility.


Senator Hanson-Young made a lot out of the UK and the US and Sierra Leone asking Australia to help. Well, as was pointed out in estimates, as Senator Hanson-Young would have heard had she bothered to go along and listen, those were form letters that went out to everyone; it was not a particular request to Australia as Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens would have you believe.


So Australia is punching well above its weight in this. If there are Australians who want to go, they are quite free to go, and when they come back they will go through the normal processes. But the Australian government will not direct people there until it can satisfy its duty of care to people who expect it to look after them.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:43):  I too rise today to speak in the debate on this matter of urgency and about the Ebola crisis that is facing West Africa—indeed, it is a problem for the world. As Labor has consistently put on the public record, we acknowledge that the Abbott government has made a contribution of funds—we acknowledge that. Senator Singh has acknowledged that. Our shadow health minister has acknowledged that. We have given funds. But funds are clearly not enough. We cannot give money and then no personnel.


The view that we have heard from senators from the Abbott government this afternoon quite frankly makes me feel quite ashamed. This is not about people, of their own free will, volunteering; it is about Australia making a proper effort as a modern, democratic, well-resourced country to support those in West Africa. I have listened to the government, and a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday I heard our health minister say that we would commit medical personnel—if the disease reached New Guinea. Heaven help us if it gets that far, because then we would all be in trouble! I could not believe that the government of Australia, through its health minister, was seriously suggesting that that is when we would commit medical staff. I sat as I listened and could not believe I was hearing that someone in a very responsible position, such as the health minister of our country, could make that short-sighted comment. I just wondered what was motivating that kind of response.


As a rich, resourced, democratic country we have some responsibility, as do other countries in a similar situation to us, of ensuring that West African countries do have robust health systems that can prevent these outbreaks. That is part of our responsibility; it is part of our moral responsibility, it is part of who we are as human beings.


Then, this morning as I listened to the news I heard this ridiculous assertion that tourism numbers in Cairns and other places have been dropping off because people were fearful of somehow contracting the Ebola virus. Then I wondered what is being created here—fear. Earlier we heard Senator Di Natale, a medical practitioner, refer to that. It is not appropriate for us to be evoking fear in fellow Australians.


I also read in the newspaper last Saturday this horrific story of this young girl of 15 who had lost her mother and her father. She did not really know, but they had gone and had been placed outside of a hospital, because they could not get in. We all know the truth of this. Both her mother and father had died of Ebola and this young 15-year-old was left without any resources. Everyone in her village was shunning her because her family had contracted Ebola and died. She was left with very young siblings to care for, and one of them subsequently died. I put myself in the shoes of that family and was heartbroken, yet we have this cold callousness coming from the Abbott government, and indeed some of the senators here today, that if want to go off and volunteer, off you go. That is not what this is about. As part of the Australian community it is our responsibility to act as a country, to give funds—and, yes, we have done that—but to also enable our health workers to go under the umbrella of an Australian volunteer, not a personal volunteer. But, no, what we are seeing is this narrowing down and this attitude that we are only going to act in our region, this closing of our borders. We have stopped people from West Africa now being able to get visas, when really we should be looking forward and looking to how we can help.


There is no doubt that there are not enough medical personnel working in West Africa. That now is the crux of the problem. Yes, we initially did have a problem about evacuating health workers from the region. But that is not a reason to say no. That is a problem we solve. We solve that by building field hospitals and by calling on other countries to support us. When we act as countries assisting in these sorts of crises we do act together. It is not the Americans, the English and the Cubans. We are there together with our comrades and colleagues in West Africa, working together to defeat this virus. That is what we have to do, because I for one do not want to see many more deaths in West Africa. These are people just like us, who have families and jobs and want to live a full life, and they are dying in huge numbers.


I for one want to be part of a community that reaches out and says 'Yes, along with our funds you will also get our best medical personnel,' because we are equipped to do this. Nobody is questioning whether our hospitals in Australia can cope with a crisis. We would expect that, and as Australians we have a right to expect, in a well-developed country, that we are adequately protected. But the reality is that we now have 6,000 confirmed cases of Ebola in West Africa. Yet we sit on our hands and start to be small-minded. We attempt to close our borders and we say things like, 'We will only look after those in our region.' That is wrong. We are part of the world community and we have a responsibility to support West Africa, not only with funds but also with medical personnel.


Along with the tragic story of the young 15-year-old girl losing her family, we know that more than two and a half thousand people have already died. That is a crisis by anyone's imagination. By any stretch, by any measure, that is a crisis, and it is a crisis we need to act on.


Health experts are telling us that the disease is increasing incredibly fast. Experts are predicting that 21,000 will be infected now. We must act to stop Ebola spreading. We know, and the UN have told us, that there is a very small window to which we can contain this crisis, before it gets completely out of hand. Heaven help if it ever spreads to New Guinea. I certainly do not believe that New Guinea and many other countries in our region are equipped to deal with a crisis like that. It is a very short-sighted and uninformed view to suggest that that is when Australia will step in and help, because by then the whole world is in crisis.


The time for us to be helping is right now. As other senators have said, we have the Australian Medical Association urging the Abbott government to get on board and help. They are the experts in this. We have our own government medical people telling us that we need to be supporting and acting with personnel in this crisis. We have MSF out there, who are always one of the groups that are in the frontier risking lives. There would not be a crisis in the world that MSF is not actively participating in. Doctors and nurses, many of them from Australia, are saying that we must act. The government could arrange for these volunteers to be attached to existing operations. The government does not have to spend a lot of money setting up new resources. They could be attached to MSF, to the Red Cross, to the UK or the US. There is no reason why Australia should not be committing personnel. It is not good enough for the government to say, 'You can volunteer.' We need to show that, as a country, we are committed to stopping this virus in West Africa, to saving lives so that children can grow up with parents and to stopping this disease right now—because the window will start to close in the next couple of days—before we well and truly have a crisis which will spread. I would hate to see that happen. I would urge the Abbott government to get on board and look at how we recruit those desperately-needed medical staff and to do it very, very quickly and in the partnerships I have just outlined.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2014-10-29,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:53):  I also rise to speak on this urgency motion on the Ebola epidemic. I have to say up-front that, listening to the speakers opposite, all I could think was: never let the facts or the public interest get in the way of a good political scare story. It completely appals me that those opposite have used this very grave international issue to try to score some very cheap political points. Without question, the primary responsibility of our government is the protection of Australians. No matter how much those on the other side assert that that is not the case and that this government has been sitting on its hands, it has not. 


Last week many of those opposite, including Senator Di Natale, sat there and heard very clear evidence from the chief medical officer and also from the secretary of the Department of Health that Australia is very well prepared domestically. A lot of work and a lot of action have gone into ensuring that our primary responsibility is protecting Australians. Even those opposite acknowledged that that testimony was correct.


It is also very appropriate that, once we ensure that we have the proper controls and response mechanisms in place in a public policy sense, we then turn to our region which, interestingly, Senator Lines just acknowledged is in the areas of Papua New Guinea and elsewhere in our region. It almost defies logic that we would, first, be looking to send our health professionals not only whom we need here in case of an outbreak here but, as she acknowledged, who might be required in our region because they do not necessarily have sufficient primary health care to deal with those issues. Therefore, I think it is entirely appropriate that this government, after making sure that we are as prepared as we can be, help those in our region in the event of an outbreak. 


It is also very important to take a look at the facts, absolutely none of which I heard from those opposite. The facts on Ebola are yes, it has great lethality. About 50 per cent of those who contract it do die. However, what we have not heard is the nature of the disease. This is not a highly contagious disease and it has very specific times when people can get sick. It is not a new disease, we know how to treat it and we know how to—




Senator Di Natale:
  How do we treat it?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, am I being asked a question?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Senator Di Natale, Senator Reynolds has sought the assistance of the chair. Please allow her to finish her contribution in silence.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  From all of the evidence from the World Health Organization, from those who have been dealing with this and from the recent experiences in Nigeria and Senegal, both of whom have now effectively dealt with outbreaks and are now Ebola free, we know that it is passed on through person-to-person contact at a very highly infectious stage, which is generally towards the end stages, and that it is passed on through direct contact with bodily fluids. Two nations have already successfully dealt with this disease and, if we do get it, we know how we can prevent it and treat it. So it is entirely appropriate that we adopt a domestic focus and then a regional focus. 


In relation to those opposite and their comments on our international support, I wholeheartedly endorse what this government is doing. The Minister for Health and our foreign affairs minister are dealing with this in a way that represents good government. They are not irresponsibly sending our personnel overseas when we cannot guarantee that, if they become infected, we can evacuate them. It is a 30-hour evacuation. The pods only have five hours of protection, so we need to have patients treated in a field hospital in-location, which does not yet exist. Even when it does, if the UK plan gets up, it will have bedding for 12. So, Senator Di Natale, if you would like to take your chances and head over to West Africa and provide some primary health care, just remember that we cannot evacuate you yet and look after you.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, please direct your remarks through the chair.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Through the chair, I would like to remind those opposite that, even if they go over today, we cannot yet evacuate them in time. Possibly, as the foreign minister has said, we will continue negotiating with the UK and others for access to a field hospital that does not yet exist.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—



Senator Di Natale interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that Senator Reynolds has the right to be heard in silence. Thank you, Senator Reynolds, if you would like to continue your remarks.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  It would be highly inappropriate to send our personnel overseas. We have at least 20 or 30 Australians who are now working with other organisations in West Africa and that is entirely appropriate. If Senator Di Natale, as a doctor, would like to go over there, there is nothing today stopping him from doing that. But he would have to remember that, if he goes over there, the Australian government does not yet have a guaranteed way to get him home in under 30 hours. It may take longer. And the UK does not yet have a field hospital that he could be treated in, so in that circumstance it would be irresponsible of the government to do so. This week there was a quote from infectious diseases expert Dr Nick Coatsworth from the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, who used the analogy:


If they can’t get you to a first-world intensive care unit in a reasonable time frame, it would be like sending in the SAS into Afghanistan with no helicopters to get them out.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:00):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission annual report gives an outline of the work that the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission have done over the last 12 months. The report shows that they have been extremely busy this year and, I think, highlights the value of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Their website has been viewed by over 3.6 million people. More than 1.5 million people have visited the Charity Portal. There have been 3,100 new charities registered, there are 60,736 charities on the charity register and there have been 303,158 views of the charity register. What I am trying to demonstrate is that they are carrying out a very important role in helping our charities and not-for-profits in this country.


This is, of course, the body that the government want to get rid of. One of the things they accuse the ACNC of is increasing red tape. We know that charities and not-for-profits in particular are very concerned about the red tape that they have faced around their reporting for the various grants and other things that they do. So, on the surface, you might think, 'The government and Minister Andrews have a point there,' but then you actually look at the details. Bear in mind that the ACNC are the body tasked specifically with reducing red tape. That is very clearly part of their role, and part of the reason the Australian Greens supported them was to reduce red tape for charities and not-for-profits.


I followed up this issue particularly at estimates this year and was very interested in one of the reports that the ACNC commissioned. EY—for those who are not familiar with the new name EY, it was formerly Ernst & Young—carried out a report to look at the red-tape burden. Just wait for this: the so-called red-tape burden that the ACNC is supposed to generate is 0.1 per cent of the total red-tape burden. Guess what the greatest burden of red tape for charities and not-for-profits was? It was government process—not the ACNC but government process. The point that Susan Pascoe, the CEO of the ACNC, made at estimates was that you need to bear in mind that some of this so-called red tape is very important red tape; in fact, it is necessary. When you look at some of the work of charities and not-for-profits, it is important, for example, that charities and not-for-profits working with children carry out the right processes for accreditation of their workers. It was also pointed out that the so-called red tape around keeping appropriate data is actually important in being able to do acquittals, for example, to ensure that charities' tax deductibility is maintained.


The point here is that the minister uses red tape as an excuse to get rid of the ACNC, when it has clearly now been demonstrated that they do not generate red tape and, in fact, help reduce red tape. The red tape that they are creating, that 0.1 per cent, helps them reduce other red tape. The reporting that they do as part of that 0.1 per cent also helps them to do their necessary acquittals.


One of the things that the ACNC has been working on is the charities passport, which is a process that they have been developing to work with government departments to assist charities and not-for-profits to work with government—because, as a charity or not-for-profit, you could be working with a number of government departments. In the past, you had to provide all your details to this department and that department and this department and that department, all of whom require these details. The idea of the charities passport is that you only have to submit your details once. Some government agencies have picked this up and are working with it, for example A-G's, the health department and a number of other departments. Guess what? One of the biggest departments that deals with charities and not-for-profits, the Department of Social Services, has not picked up the charities passport—the one department you would have thought would pick it up.


The ACNC plays a very important role. The government should get over their fixation with getting rid of it, keep it, move on and give certainty to that agency and certainty to the charities and not-for-profits sector. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Treaty tabled on 14 July 2014





Agreement between Australia and Japan for an Economic Partnership (Canberra, 8 July 2014)



Mr President, today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 144, containing the Committee's views on the Agreement between Australia and Japan for an Economic Partnership.


The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JAEPA) was tabled in Parliament on Monday 14 July 2014. Mr President, Australia and Japan enjoy a strong, long-standing bilateral relationship based on common values: democracy, human rights, the rule of law. During his visit to Australia in July 2014, the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Shinzo Abe, spoke of the evolving nature of the 'special relationship' between our two countries, as it expanded to take in closer security bonds and broader trade ties.


Mr President, that relationship has been reinforced by a steadily developing complementary bilateral economic relationship. Since the middle of the twentieth century, Australia's resources have supported Japan's prosperity and Japan's manufactured goods have contributed to Australian's modern, affluent standard of living. Today, Japan is our second-largest trading partner with two-way trade, in 2013, standing at $70.8 billion.


JAEPA will further enhance that economic relationship. It is the first such agreement that Japan has signed with a major agricultural exporting country. It is seen as the most liberalising trade agreement that Japan has ever concluded.



Mr President, this Agreement places Australia in an enviable position. Tariffs will be reduced in a range of areas. Modelling predicts that beef exports will benefit by around $5.5 billion over 20 years and deliver an increase of up to seven per cent in the annual gross value of Australian beef production. There will be duty-free quotas for Australian cheese, immediate duty-free access for the growing trade in milk protein concentrates and new opportunities for ice-cream and frozen yoghurt.


Importantly, Mr President, Australia will gain a first-mover advantage. Australian exporters will have the opportunity to beat their competitors into the Japanese market and establish a presence with consumers before other countries have the chance. 


As with all the free trade agreements that Australia has negotiated to date, Mr President, JAEPA did not deliver on all the outcomes we would have liked. However, as one witness pointed out to the Committee, the Agreement represents a 'seismic shift' in Japan's traditional thinking on trade. As another witness told the Committee, JAEPA will 'refocus' attention, both in Japan and Australia, on the relationship between the two countries. It will open up opportunities for further trade liberalisation and the flow on effects will go far beyond tariff reductions. 


The Committee found, Mr President, that increasing the non-screening investment level to $1 078 million is expected to significantly increase Japanese investment in Australia. In 2013 it stood at $131 billion. The revised provisions will make it simpler for Japanese investors to do business in Australia making it an attractive option in an increasingly competitive market.




Mr President, minerals and energy resources make up the bulk of Australia
'
s export trade with Japan, worth over $24 billion and accounting for over 80 per cent of total merchandise 
exports in 2013. Australia is facing major competition in this area from global competitors but the Economic Agreement will offer Japan reassurance concerning energy and resource security from Australia, providing suppliers with a boost. 



Overall, Mr President, we are satisfied that JAEPA has the potential to provide Australian business and industry with a range of profitable opportunities and to be a net benefit to the Australian economy


Mr President, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Report to the Senate.

The speech read as follows—



PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2014


The Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 implements a measure announced in the 2014-15 Budget, and will pause the indexation arrangements for the income thresholds in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 for three years. The income thresholds contained in the Private Health Insurance Act are used in determining the tiers for both the Australian Government Rebate on private health insurance and the Medicare levy surcharge.


In this Budget, the Government increases overall spending and investment in health from $68 billion this year, to $71 billion next year, increasing again to $75 billion in 2016-17, and to $79 billion in 2017-18.


The changes contained within this legislation being introduced today are part of a broader pause in indexation rates across multiple portfolios announced in the 2014-15 Budget in an effort to help make spending sustainable and to repair the fiscal position left by the previous Labor Government.


The amendments will see the income thresholds used to determine the private health insurance rebate and Medicare levy surcharge remain unchanged for three years, paused at the 2014-15 rates in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18. 


This bill preserves the explicit link between the Rebate and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. This is important as they operate together to ensure that people whose rebates are reduced because of means-testing have a strong incentive to retain their private health insurance.


It is important to note that these changes will not affect individuals with an income that remains below the 2014-15 base tier thresholds of $90,000, or couples and families with an income that remains $180,000 or below. 


It is estimated that only 4% of the 6.2 million private health insurance policies held as at December 2013 will be affected by this measure. 


The Coalition has inherited an enormous debt, and these measures are just a small part of the Government's strategy to clean up the mess that the Labor left behind.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:12):  This is a debate that concerns millions of Australian students in higher education today. It is about the 1.2 million Australians with outstanding HECS debts. It is about the millions currently in school or in the workforce who are hoping to study at university. Australians know how important this debate is to their future and their nation's future. Australians understand that this bill will take away the foundation stones of a fair go. Australians believe that access to higher education should not be based on the circumstances of their birth or where they live but, rather, on the clear principle of merit.


Australians do not want to be facing the prospect of taking out a second mortgage to help pay the cost of their child's education and find the idea that they must choose which child gets to go to university an idea that rightly belongs to the Menzies era. It is to these Australians that Labor speaks when it opposes this bill. We stand against $100,000 degrees. We are against crippling debts. We are against the Americanisation and the privatisation of Australian higher education.


It may well be argued that there is nothing of greater value to our nation than our universities. It may well be argued that there is nothing more important to our economy, to our culture and to our society than knowledge and ideas. Universities are the custodians and the generators of knowledge. While there will be a lot of talk about fairness in relation to this bill—because this bill rips fairness out of our university system—it is important in this debate to consider the wider role of universities in the Commonwealth.


Too often, we talk about teaching and research only as a means to an end, but ignore the most challenging and rewarding role of academics—that of imagining things entirely new. Academic creativity is not embraced by the straighteners of our body politic, but it serves as an inspiration for the enlargers. The achievements of the academy go to the very existence of who we are—every bit as much as our sporting triumphs or our military history. 


I think of eminent historians like Manning Clark, John Hirst and Iain McCalman, and the younger historians like Hannah Forsyth and James Boyce, who are reimagining the way we look at our country. I think of the writers who tell us stories, such as the Booker Prize winner Richard Flanagan, Hannah Kent, John Birmingham, Tim Winton, and Kate Grenville. I think of Professor Graham Clark, who put Australia on the map in medical science with his invention of the Cochlear implant, now used worldwide. I think of the Nobel laureates Brian Schmidt, Elizabeth Blackburn, Barry Marshall, Robin Warren, John Coetzee and Peter Doherty. All of these people and many more were nourished by our world-class public universities, whether it was as students, teachers or researchers, and in many cases all three. They pass on ideas and knowledge to future generations. They help us conceive who we have been, who we are and who we might be.


It is not just the towering intellects and the world-famous figures who make the achievements of our universities remarkable. Many who have made the transition to public life, including most people in this place, benefitted from a university education. More fundamentally, we thank our public universities for our teachers, our nurses, our engineers, our agricultural scientists, our doctors and our community workers—all the highly skilled professionals who keep this country's wheels in motion and contribute to its social, cultural and physical wealth. In short, our quality of life is vastly enriched by the quality and extent of the contributions made by our universities.


This is not the first time I have found it necessary to make these sorts of remarks in this place. The opposition finds it alarming that these things have to be said at all, but evidently they do have to be said. Not for the first time, we have had to ask why the conservative side of politics is hell-bent on destroying universities' capacities as custodians and as generators of ideas. In this country, since 1974, the university system has been a national enterprise. It has been largely funded by the Commonwealth. The policy directions are set by the Commonwealth. Foremost within this is the notion that access to undergraduate education should not be blocked by the cost of tuition. Equal access and equal participation have long been at the heart of Commonwealth policy. This is a bill that threatens to undermine this principle of the fair go in Australian education.


Its framers know that. Why else would they talk until they are blue in the face about the so-called equity measures and the need for scholarships, pathways and structural adjustment funds? We only need to introduce elaborate new scholarship schemes if the system itself is unfair. We need adjustment funds to try to adjust the inequalities that are inherent in these measures. These special arrangements are in themselves admissions of failure. It is an admission that incurable inequalities lie at the very heart of this package. Attacks on equity and merit, of course, are nothing new to the Liberal Party. Those opposite have form.


I can remember back in 1996 when they came in and unilaterally slashed university funding by five per cent. They hiked HECS fees and they lowered repayment thresholds, and they did this without warning. There was no mention of these matters in the previous election, and then they sought to bring about this very plan to cut spending, deregulate fees and offer faux scholarships. When the cabinet submission was leaked, even John Howard saw that under this proposal lay dragons and he backed off very quickly. But the current minister and the current Prime Minister do not have the sense to understand that fundamental fact of political life. There is a copy of the cabinet submission on my website for those who want to have a look and want to be reminded, either as students of history or scholars of the present predicament. Nothing changes when it comes to the Liberal Party's contempt for universities.


Let me speak plainly and honestly, because the other side will not. This policy is an uncontrolled experiment. We know one thing for sure: it will lead to very large fee increases. One-hundred-thousand-dollar degrees, which currently are relatively uncommon, will become much more common. That is why we have seen so many commentators call for a variety of price restraint mechanisms. The latest independent modelling, which the Labor Party released today, shows the dramatic impact of fees and debt all too clearly. It confirms, as many witnesses to the inquiry told us, that women will be particularly hard hit. Mature-age students will be particularly savagely hit. Students in rural and regional Australia will be most dramatically affected. The government has justified its radical reform by reference to inadequate government funding, but the crisis in funding is a direct result of the government's own decision to take 20 per cent of university funding away from students, hack into the research training scheme, cut funding to the Australian Research Council, cut reward funding, cut equity funding and cut indexation.


We have heard that the university vice-chancellors—if they have to deal with the various vicious cuts—want the ability to charge tuition fees at whatever level they think fit. The minister likes to claim that there is near unanimous support from university leaders. The reality we saw in inquiries and submissions in the hearing is very different. In submission after submission you read the reluctance, caution and hesitant declarations of those that are under duress. Whatever motivations or reservations there are of vice-chancellors, the fact remains: just as it is not the role of this Senate to rubberstamp the desires of the executive neither is it the role of this Senate automatically to give vice-chancellors whatever they want. Successful university funding policy does not simply provide carte blanche for this nation's vice-chancellors to have unlimited access to funding from the pockets of Australian students and from Australian workers. It is not our role to give them 'a licence to print HELP debt', to quote Dr Sharrock of the LH Martin Institute. It has often been said that getting between a vice-chancellor and a pot of money is a dangerous business, but that is what Labor will do, because there is much more at stake here than the performance bonuses of university managers. Access, equity, workforce needs, research excellence, the capacity to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing world—these are the things that this Senate has to give consideration to in this debate.


The government says that it has the support for its package from the universities; it does not. It does not have any support for its regressive changes to HECS—none at all. There is no support for cutting the funding from research—none at all. There is no support for charging fees for PhD students—none at all. There is no support for the 20 per cent cut to the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. There is a division around the issue of privatisation in higher education—particularly on this misleading, Orwellian concept of the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. Even Universities Australia, when pushed at the committee's hearings, said that it did not want to support this bill in its current form, 'far from it'. Its members, especially those outside the Group of Eight, are much more forthright in their many and varied criticisms. Is there any wonder?


This bill is rotten to the core. This is a bill that the Australian people did not vote for. This is a bill that offends the basic principles of equity. It offends the basic concept that, in this country, if you are bright and work hard, you have a right to expect a high-quality education that is not dependent on your having rich parents or on coming from a privileged background or on your postcode. None of those things are ever going to be accepted by the people of this country. This is a bill that the Australian people feel that they were lied to about. They were misled. Remember the last election: 'no cuts to education, no changes to the administrative arrangements' and the Prime Minister's visit down to Universities Australia's conference, where he talked about masterly inactivity. What a contrast! It was the most radical piece of social engineering we have seen in this country since the last time the Liberals tried it on. This is a bill that should be withdrawn.


The government should go back to the drawing board and should deal directly with the issues facing higher education. In doing so, it should actually consult with the stakeholders before announcing radical new policies. That is what John Dawkins did with the green and white paper approach. That is the proper approach. Earlier, I talked about the many luminaries who have studied, taught and done research in Australian universities. They are far from the only people who have benefited or hoped to benefit from an equitable higher education system. Ordinary Australians should benefit, such as Linley from Tasmania, who not only tells me she got a university education because of Gough Whitlam—she is now a grandmother—she says:


... my three grandchildren are preparing for years 10, 11 and 12. But the cost of sending them to UTAS will make it virtually impossible. The burden of repayments will mean they will not be able to afford their own home ...


And Graham, an Indigenous Australian who is studying at the University of Queensland and wants to do a PhD, says:


I would never have had the courage to start my degree if I knew it would cost me a six figure sum.


Trinh is an aspiring 15-year-old student from Western Sydney whose mother migrated from Vietnam and worked hard to give her children a better life. She said:


I want to grow up and become a nurse and be able to have an apartment where everything's stable. I want to be able to give my mum the things she deserves. But with this current government, I don't even know if I'll make it to university and I'm scared.


How can the Senate remain silent when confronted by these legitimate fears about this legislation? How can the Senate remain silent when it is confronted by the lies that this government told the Australian people prior to the election? How can we in all consciousness tick and flick a package that would cause such massive harm? There is a better way here.


The funding crisis within universities caused by the government can be fixed by the government with one stroke of a pen, by withdrawing the cuts. Labor has shown it can be done. In government, we increased investment in universities by nearly 100 per cent between 2007 to 2017 at the end of that forward estimates. Universities are right to demand that this parliament act. We must, of course, expect that action and we should expect that people will reject this unacceptable plan.


In urging the Senate to reject this bill, Labor is not suggesting that nothing needs to change. The Commonwealth needs to live up to its responsibilities and properly fund our universities—and to do so by working with them, not seeking to impose an ideological position upon them. We need a compact between the Commonwealth and our institutions to promote diversity, to foster excellence in research and scholarship and to maintain access on the basis of merit, not money. In the words of talented historian Hannah Forsyth:


Higher education … needs to keep looking for solutions to the problems that confront the world's economies, environments, democracies and philosophies.


Dwelling in the ruins is no solution.


This bill is no solution. Its ideology is no solution. No sugar coating, no side deals, no nudges or winks will save it.


The Senate has a legitimate choice here, and that choice boils down to one option in reality. Either we can destroy the university system as we know it by introducing structural changes to the university system which will see them have to cope, as the Parliamentary Budget Office highlights, with funding cuts of $18 billion—irreversible changes in the structure of universities—or we can reject this bill: send it back. That is what we should do. That is what the Labor Party will be urging all senators here to do, and I have every hope that that is exactly what will happen.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  By far the majority of Australians—those born here and those who come here to find a new life and opportunity—want a good education for their children, for the nation's children. The bill before us, the Higher Education and Research Amendment Bill 2014, will rob people of opportunity and hope to achieve that. It should be voted down in its entirety. There are no deals, no negotiations that can turn this bill into a winner.


The Liberals and the Nationals did not even have the courage to take this bill in any form—details of this bill—to the last election. They should now have the decency to withdraw it. There are nearly one million students in Australia who will be impacted by these changes if they go through. For people without a silver spoon, education is the key to survival. It gives you a leg up and makes freedom and choice possible. Education empowers people. Prime Minister Tony Abbott's education, however, is a very different story. It is about the entitlement of a rich boy from Sydney's North Shore who takes his power for granted. He is not bothered by $100,000 fees for a university degree or by public money earmarked for higher education going to for-profit companies.


By raising university fees the Liberals and the Nationals are slamming the door on opportunity for millions of Australians. Coalition policy is about keeping the world as a place with haves and have-nots. That approach is the basis of the bill we are considering tonight, and that is why the Greens say so emphatically that it should be scrapped completely. The bill is neoliberalism in its most crude form; 101 of neoliberalism is to strip the costs off government and put them on to ordinary people. The essence of this bill is to take $5 billion out of the public allocation for our universities and put the costs on to students through higher fees.


Minister Christopher Pyne, in pushing ahead with this bill, is ignoring the growing opposition to this destructive legislation. One of the lines we have heard trotted out time and again from the minister is the fact that apparently the entire university sector is behind the proposed shake-up of higher education that he is now engineering. It is clear that the minister and his coalition colleagues—Nationals as well as Liberals—have a strong preference for meeting and discussing higher education issues with university executives and managers over staff and students. What they need to remember is that the vice-chancellors and senior management are not the entirety of the sector; they are actually only a small part.


Just last week we saw the creation of the National Alliance for Public Universities, an organisation seeking 'to give voice to the researchers, teachers, administrators and other staff who oppose the deregulation of fees and whose perspective has been overlooked in the national debate'. The organisation has grown rapidly, with 500 academic staff signing up in a few days. The charter of the National Alliance argues: 


Universities provide both public and private benefits. To fulfil these, they must function independently of market forces and political interference.


They go on to say:


… universities have a social mission, enabling social mobility while striving to dissolve entrenched social inequalities altogether.


I congratulate them on their launch and welcome their voice in this crucial debate. These are the people who are truly representative of the university sector, along with the students, not the Group of Eight vice-chancellors, many of whom have been camped out in the minister's office attempting to lobby crossbenchers week after week. Sadly, the Group of Eight vice-chancellors have been prioritising their ideological commitment to unrestrained markets over the needs of their staff and students.


I would also like to congratulate the many students who have highlighted the damage this bill will cause. And I think at this time it is worth remembering the courageous students who took their protest to the ABC's Q&A program. They warrant a brief mention in this debate. Some people, including a few media commentators, grumbled that these young people had a bad attitude and apparently lacked respect. But most of those who criticised have a prominent voice within the public discourse on this and a range of issues. Most Australians, particularly young Australians—the ones who will be hardest hit by these measures—do not have a public voice, and the action at Q&A made a significant contribution to the debate on the Pyne bill. Just today—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I do acknowledge the interjection from Senator McKenzie. Just today two students at Melbourne University took direct action on this issue, blocking the entrance of a university building. Why do people do that? Because they are so deeply troubled and concerned. These students were campaigning against the proposals contained in this bill, and for free education—a realistic and affordable alternative for students. I said earlier that there are nearly one million students in Australia who will be impacted by these changes—250,000 of them are on youth allowance and will have their debt significantly increased as a result of the proposal to slash start-up scholarships and replace them with loans. There are also 140,000 university staff. They are the people whom we should have to the forefront of our mind when we debate this bill. 


The issue of fees is where we see the deeply damaging aspects of this legislation. We have heard vice-chancellors and senior management—prominent backers of the bill—using the lack of guaranteed high levels of funding as their main line of argument in backing fee deregulation. Many of the vice-chancellors have said that they have to support fee deregulation, as successive federal governments had inadequately funded higher education and that now they would be hit by this latest 'slash' approach to higher education, with a $5 billion cut. This is where we actually need to look closely at what is going on here. But it is also disappointing how the vice-chancellors respond to these cuts rather than being a strong voice out there advocating for a well-funded higher education sector.


Fee deregulation might be called a competitive agenda. But it is, pure and simple, an extreme budget measure in the first instance, to shift the $5 billion—the cost burden—that the government wants to save for itself onto students. By cutting students' subsidies by an average of 20 per cent by place, the government is essentially forcing all universities to raise their fees in order to retain their current level of funding. That is what the vice-chancellors should be spelling out and is the point they should have been arguing. Fears of prohibitively expensive fees were clearly set out by the independent National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, based at the University of Canberra. The NTEU, the ACTU and the National Union of Students also set out these issues in the submissions before the inquiry into this legislation.


It is worth commenting at this point on some of the comments from coalition members. Today, again, Senator McKenzie has been out there publicly accusing people who address this issue of fees—and the very real issue that we, and students in particular, have ahead of us, of $100,000 fees—of scaremongering.


What is going on here is that I and others are out there informing the many unions, community groups and students—we are being responsible. It is informing students of the reality that they will face. Even the University of Western Australia released its figures saying it will cost $16,000 a year for a degree, but if you look at that $16,000, you will see that over a five-year degree, which is increasingly common for many students, it will move into the range of $100,000 once interest on student debt is included. When you look into what so many of the coalition's own backers of this aspect of the legislation are saying and when you inform people of the high fee levels that they will face, that is where you will get proof that it is not scaremongering but reality.


Not a single witness at our inquiry agreed with the minister's proposition that university fees will go down as a result of deregulation. Given that university vice-chancellors are viewing fee deregulation as a tool to boost revenue, it is obvious that fees will increase across the board if this bill is passed by parliament. So there is great interest in this issue. When the budget first came out and we started hearing the details about the government's planned cutbacks and then the legislation came out, there just was not enough information out there about what the fees could blow out to.


One of the contributions the Greens made to this issue is the development of a website: whatwillmydegreecost.com.au. This site was obviously of value, which was just about providing information—that was all that it was doing—because it received so much traffic in the first few hours of its operation that it actually crashed. We quickly had it going again. In the space of a few weeks, it was viewed 1.3 million times. Over half a million students and future students used it to calculate the cost of their degrees under a deregulated environment. That highlights that it is not scaremongering; the government are being irresponsible. They have been trying to sugar-coat their poisoned piece of legislation by making out that it is something that it is not. The horror story of these high levels of fees is something very serious.


While the very damaging budget that the government brought down has disadvantaged people in the main—and, certainly, this legislation does—this bill also reaches into middle-class Australia. This is something I am coming across more and more with middle-class families. Socially, I am often with people who are lawyers, small business people and workers in the professions. I have had the experience of where they have actually been looking at their children and saying, 'How am I going to afford to send them to university?' This is increasingly troubling people in our communities.


I want to move on to the issue of Commonwealth-supported places. If this bill becomes law, public subsidies will be given to private for-profit higher education providers for the first time, to the tune of $450 million. Again, please focus on that—$450 million. It is not money just sitting there; it is money that once would have gone to our public universities. If the bill goes through, it would be there to help a number of companies increase their profit margins. The minister has been unable to confirm that new students will enrol in the courses with these private higher education providers.


This is very relevant to how this money plays out, and the bill's explanatory memorandum confirms that the rate of growth in student enrolments in this area will be slower than in previous years. The end result of these changes will be a windfall of half a billion dollars in subsidies to private education providers without any guarantee of increasing access. So the money is set aside and the government is telling us that all these students will flood to these providers. But when you question the minister he cannot confirm that more students will actually enrol and that more students will come into the system.


During our inquiry, the committee heard strong evidence from the Australian Education Union regarding the problems associated with allowing private providers to access public funding for higher education. We need to ask the question, and it needs to be answered: who is going to hold these operators to account? The experience with the vocational education and training sector shows the depth of this problem when these dodgy operators come in, and there are just too many of them there already. They can see that there is money and that it is easy pickings. They move in—and move in quickly. This is another serious worry regarding how this plays out.


The result of opening up the vocational education and training system to the marketplace brings growing doubts regarding the quality of the education provision that comes from the private sector and the cost of qualifications for the students who may enrol. Far from the opening up of the market in the VET leading to a downward pressure on prices, we now see the spectre of $30,000 being charged for diplomas and advanced diplomas in VET. Right now, under the current system, a degree at a public university will cost less than your technical and further education training costs under the system that has already been opened up to the marketplace. This is because the cost is being shifted onto students. The bill will not require private providers to reduce their fees as a result of receiving government support, and that is where we have this very serious problem with how this will play out with the private providers.


The issue of Commonwealth scholarships is one that the government has been trying to use in the past week as a key argument to make out that this system that they are bringing forward is such a fair one. They are even trying to start to equate it with free higher education, which is a stretch. But nothing is beyond this minister. No Commonwealth government funding will go into the so-called Commonwealth scholarships. Universities will be forced to increase their fees by at least 20 per cent before a single dollar will be diverted to these scholarships. Universities like the Group of Eight will be able to maximise the increase in student fees under deregulation, and they will have the largest pool of funds for these scholarships. This will distort the university activities. Group of Eight universities have the lowest proportion of students from low SES backgrounds.




Senator McKenzie:
  It is changing.




Senator RHIANNON:
  Yes, it will change under your system, Senator McKenzie. I am pleased the senator interjected at this point, because the sell-out by the Nationals of our regional universities is something that has to be documented and needs to be recognised. It is absolutely monumental. Minister Pyne has shown deception because he has said he did not expect fees to increase significantly under a deregulation system. But the minister cannot have it both ways. Either fees will increase significantly or Commonwealth scholarships will not exist. The whole issue of Commonwealth scholarships is something that is being brought forward as a scam to try and justify assistance being there for disadvantaged students. But there will only be a small number. We do not even know the form that those scholarships will take at the moment. Each university can work it out for itself, and there is no guarantee that those students who may receive scholarships will not end up with a heavy cost burden at the end of their education.


The issue of research is something where the government has also been deceptive. It has said that there will be no cuts to research. But in this bill the government is proposing a 10 per cent across-the-board cut to the research training scheme. This is an enormously backward step, placing greater financial burden on our universities, and remember that this comes on top of all the cuts that we have seen to the CSIRO, the cooperative research centres and so many other key research bodies.


Turning to the regional universities, I repeat that the sell-out by the Nationals of our regional universities is huge. Our regional universities could possibly be the most vulnerable aspect of this bill when we come to consider the various institutions. Regional universities like the University of Wollongong and the University of Newcastle are clearly from big areas. There are no universities there for them to compete with. It really shows that the whole competitive argument that so much of this bill is based on falls over when you look closely at how this works. I particularly pay tribute to the many organisations that have worked so hard to defeat this bill, including the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Students, those who work with postgraduate associations, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, the ACTU, the Australian Education Union and the Australian Medical Students' Association.


If the bill were to be passed it would create a higher education system that would be inequitable and elitist with limited accessibility to the highest quality public education institutions. Australia is already near the bottom of the OECD. When it comes to public funding for higher education, despite 96 per cent of Australian students— (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-10-29,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:51):  I rise very proudly tonight to speak to the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. I also rise to speak as the chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. We conducted a very comprehensive inquiry into this piece of legislation. There were over 169 submissions and four days of hearings, and I would like to congratulate all of those who took time out to make a submission to the inquiry and indeed to attend our hearings and give us very good evidence. I would also like to place on the record, on my behalf, particularly, our thanks to the secretariat for their tireless work in producing what I think is quite a comprehensive report, in which we traverse the history of higher education in Australia, which lands us at the place we are today: the reality we have to deal with if we want to continue to have and to increase the excellence of our higher education system while continuing its strong accessibility.


I just want to briefly quote Nelson Mandela: 'Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.' So, for the first five minutes, I absolutely adored everything Senator Carr had to say about higher education, the role of universities in society et cetera. They are absolutely crucial. That is why they have to be financially sustainable and accessible to all—which is exactly what this government is doing through this education reform agenda.


When the credit card statement arrives, the responsible thing to do is to actually pay the debt, just as this government is setting out to do, having inherited Labor's hefty credit card bill. A commission of audit took place, and ministers were told to find savings within their portfolios. A package of higher education reforms was the result of Minister Pyne's deliberation, striking a fair balance between careful savings and strategic investment—strategic investment by this minister. The ultimate goal is to spread opportunity to more students, drive creativity and innovation, and ensure that our universities are equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century and that Australia is not left behind. The higher education sector gets it, and supports the government's planned reforms contained in the bill that we are speaking to tonight—reforms which directly benefit higher education providers, students and communities, whilst driving economic growth and productivity.


The key element of the reforms is fee deregulation. That will give universities the longed-for freedom from government control, allowing them to make independent choices, not just about fees but about teaching methods, courses to be offered, scholarships and other services, in response to the market. And let us face it: 'the market' in this conversation is students, and they are not all young people leaving year 12. There is strong evidence that fee deregulation will lead to greater competition, and with greater competition comes greater choice. And, contrary to the rowdy views of a small number of critics, the higher education sector welcomes it. What bemuses me is the failure of our critics, including Labor, to acknowledge that fee deregulation already exists for postgraduate and international students, and that most higher education providers see full deregulation as the next logical step in the evolution of our higher education system.


In fact, students have been progressively making increased contributions to the cost of their higher education under successive governments since the 1980s. Even in Whitlam government years, there was no 'free education' because, in reality, university costs were funded by the taxpayer. Cabinet papers also later revealed Gough Whitlam's free tuition had little impact on the composition of student intake, with a continued overrepresentation of students from wealthy backgrounds.


A decade on, faced with the financial strain of a free education, and greater pressure to expand education opportunity for the growing number of students completing year 12, the Hawke government introduced the HEC Scheme. In a speech at the Victoria University of Technology a few years later, the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, said: 'There is no such thing, of course, as a free education. Somebody has to pay. In systems with no charges, those somebodies are all taxpayers.' He added: 'This is a pretty important point. A free higher education system is one paid for by the taxes of all, the majority of whom have not had the privilege of a university education.' So I think we all need to ask ourselves if that is a fair thing.


Bob Hawke, in an interview in 1988, stated: 'I do not have any problem with the concept of fees. In fact, one of the greatest stupidities was the proposition that the Whitlam Labor government introduced a free education. There is no such thing as a free education. It is a question of who pays and how it is paid for.'


The Howard government introduced a partial deregulation of student fees and domestic full fee-paying undergraduate places that were later abolished by the Rudd-Gillard government, without adequate compensation for universities. The Rudd-Gillard government went on to introduce a demand-driven system, whilst cutting funding by more than $2 billion. In fact, the previous Labor government announced a number of 'savings measures'—in plain speak, cuts—to higher education grants and student support, totalling $6.65 million from 2011-12 to 2016-17. Labor's Senator Carr vehemently opposed this whenever it was raised during the inquiry hearings, despite it being fact, in black and white, in the budget and MYEFO papers. It was an odd approach for a Labor government, led by a Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who advocated diversity and specialisation in universities. Julia Gillard reflects in her new book: 'I am particularly proud of our decision to unchain Australian universities, to enable them to define their own mission and educate more students.' This is precisely what the coalition government's reforms seek to achieve. And she adds: 'As a result of the new system, while students continue to compete for places, universities increasingly have to compete for students. A better run, better quality university can attract students who might be considering other universities.'


Fee deregulation is all about making universities compete for students. One wonders what Julia Gillard thinks of her party's apparent shift in direction. Claims of skyrocketing fees, made by student unions, Labor and the Greens, as a result of deregulation of fees also lack substance. The reliability of the methodology behind two of the most referred-to studies, from the NTEU and NATSEM, has been questioned more broadly.


I just want to go to those assumptions because, as anybody who appreciates a good mathematical model knows, the assumptions underpinning the model are actually what we need to go to before we start screaming about $310,000 degrees for social work, as was claimed this morning. The assumption under the modelling that was used is that we did not go to what the actual fee may be. There has been only one university, the UWA, that suggested a fee setting, and evidence throughout the inquiry from vice-chancellors and all, even some of the Labor Party—even Professor Quiggin came—was that universities are going to charge differently for different things. UWA has decided to do a broad-brush fee across all their courses. Other universities are not going to do that. CSU, for example, with the fabulous vet degree, might choose to charge a premium for that particular product and a different fee for some of their other offerings.


But when we go to the assumptions underpinning that modelling, they jump straight to the international fee, setting the highest fee you can charge within Australia for undergraduates. They then charge the six per cent bond rate over 20 years. Bearing in mind the bond rate for the last 10 years has been only 3.8 per cent. They then factored in some time off, presumably to have some children or to travel. That got us to the worst case scenario for a social work degree, which was $310,000.


In the best case scenario, using those same assumptions, which I have actually poked some holes in, that same social work degree costs $42,000. It is a scare campaign, because it is affecting the students and families who are not seeing higher education as an investment—the first generation, particularly, need to be convinced that it is an investment worth making and they can do their social work degree for $42,000 rather than the $310,000 quoted. So it is an absolute furphy. It is scary and they have to stop saying it, because it is actually not true, even using their own modelling.


The NTEU admits in their report that not every university degree at every university will cost $100,000, but we do not hear that in the public debate and discussion, and that is morally reprehensible, particularly when we are talking about increasing access to higher education for those we need to get through the door.


NATSEM modelling is based in the University of Canberra, and that is understood to be the only university in the whole country that does not appreciate or is actually opposed to fee deregulation. The groups representing universities have issued a variety public statements and modelling showing that universities can be relied on to act responsibly in setting fees. Analysis from the Australian Technology Network, Innovative Research Universities, and the Group of Eight, and assurances from the Regional Universities Network all show this. Member institutions of the Council of Private Higher Education have also confirmed that 'whatever they receive in Commonwealth support for students will be passed on to students through reduced tuition'. So, for Senator Rhiannon to stand up here and say that nobody has talked about lowering fees does not actually go to the evidence. Let us talk about the evidence and the facts, not fear.


Nor is there any basis to comparisons with other deregulated higher education systems. The rhetoric throughout has been of an Americanisation of our system. A directly comparable system does not exist. Australia's higher education system is unique in comparison, as the reform package will ensure that for all students, irrespective of their means, there are no up-front financial barriers to accessing higher education. So for Senator Carr to talk about merit and about financial impact as being a barrier, our system still offers an income-contingent loan scheme that is the ideal of the world. This was evident based on expert views to the Senate inquiry hearings. Professor John Dewar, Chair of the Legislation and Financing Working Group, explained that the US system was not one national system, as would be the case here. Rather it has extremely complicated and diverse. So to say that we are having an Americanisation is false.


Similarly, a submission from the Group of Eight explained that debt burdens like those in the US are simply not possible in Australia. In Australia, our HELP system of student loans means that graduates only repay when they earn enough to be able to do so, whereas in America the crippling debts are incurred by graduates because they do not have a provision for such loan support.


Further deregulation will drive a more competitive environment for universities, so charging exponentially higher fees will only result in empty lecture theatres and tutorials. Australian students are not idiots. They will go elsewhere. As the Australian Technology Network's Vicki Thomson logically explains, it would be untenable from a business perspective to do so. Vice-chancellor after vice-chancellor reiterated that there were not going to be $100,000 degrees hither and thither. There is strong evidence supporting the view that fee deregulation will boost equity and innovation. While providers will be able to determine course costs, they will have to compete on price and quality in order to attract students.


There is also strong stakeholder support for extending funding to sub-bachelor courses as well as to private universities and other higher education providers, with considerable benefits for regional students. We do not hear about these students. We do not hear about this absolutely fantastic access and equity aspect of this reform package.


Universities, colleges and TAFEs in the regions will be able to offer more courses with qualifications leading to careers or further study. The idea has merit, with a growing number of universities and TAFEs having already forged partnerships across regional Australia—for example, Federation University Australia at Ballarat and La Trobe University, in my home state of Victoria. These universities and TAFEs are also targeting first-generation students from families that did not previously have such opportunities, and nor could they afford it. By 2018, more than 80,000 additional students nationally will benefit from these increased opportunities—coming from the regions, disadvantaged and Indigenous backgrounds, mature age students and those with low ATAR scores. In the regions we have incredibly low year 12 completion rates, which means that you cannot easily go to university. These reforms seek to improve student mobility, while giving private and non-university providers flexibility to specialise and differentiate from one another.


The Kemp-Norton review of the Demand Driven Funding System found that expanding access to sub-bachelor pathway courses would lead to the improved efficiency by better matching students with appropriate courses. TAFE Directors Australia also endorsed these reforms, saying:


Commonwealth funding is required to support the increasingly important role TAFE plays in broadening student choice and access, strengthening the capacity and reach of the system, particularly in regional areas, and addressing critical shortages of higher skills in the Australian economy.


I want to go to the report, because while we hear a lot from NUS students, predominantly who attend Go8 universities I have to say. They always end up here in this place or in the other place. That is fine. I love hearing from students. But I did not hear Senator Carr nor Senator Rhiannon talk about the students who attend private institutions, or the TAFE students, who will be the beneficiaries of so much of our reform package. Going to the report where the Chisholm Institute explained to the committee that they built their degrees on industry strength. These are higher education providers that have very clear and direct links with industry. There are a certain cohort of students who appreciate that but who do not necessarily want theoretical philosophy degrees. They want to realise that the education they are getting at their local TAFE or local institute is going to result in a job. Right now, degrees at these institutions are costing $22,000 or $32,000.


I want to go to Miss Sara Moad, a second year Bachelor of Dance student with a private provider, that Senator Rhiannon does not want to see have the benefit of being treated equitably with other such students. She chose a career in a profession that is not well represented in our public universities, and I will quote her:


If and when the bill is implemented, I will have already graduated, with a debt of $56,000, of which $11,000 is an administration fee of 25 per cent—


which our legislation actually seeks to get rid of—


more than I need to save for a house deposit. Compare this with my brother, who will have completed a three-year degree in design at a public university, with a HECS debt of around $15,000. I will pay more than three times the amount … How is that equitable? Professionals in the performing arts have the ability to share so much with their communities and build culture, and often do so despite earning a lower income compared to other professions.


Senator Rhiannon and Senator Carr want to ensure that Miss Moad continues to pay $11,000 more than her brother and it is simply not fair when we want to go to equity. 


I want to briefly touch on the Commonwealth Scholarship scheme. Those institutions with more than 500 enrolled students will be required to put 20 per cent of the revenue raised through increased course fees towards scholarships targeting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Again, Senator Rhiannon, you went to complain about the Go8 universities' under-representation of that cohort of Australians, in their university lecture halls. This measure will ensure that that proportion increases. So I really would appreciate your support in getting that increase in the Commonwealth Scholarship scheme so that we can get more disadvantaged students into the great universities in many of our capital cities.


There has been a lot of debate about regional students and the effect on them, but many country students do not opt to study at a regional campus. In fact, evidence is that most of them do not choose to do so. We can talk about the Regional Universities Network, but I am also talking about regional students—regional kids—and their future and, by default, our future in regional Australia. They do it for a lot of different reasons. Steps must be taken to ensure that they can overcome the very real financial barriers to them accessing a quality education of their choice that currently their parents or they themselves have to bear. Our bill seeks to do this. Our Australian education system is unique because it remains cost free at the point of delivery, contrary to Labor's scaremongering. The Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne, has pointed out that, because the government currently lends to students at the bond rate, it is fair for them to be charged that. The committee inquiry report showed, I think, overwhelming evidence that that may need to be revisited. I am confident that the minister will consider the report and the evidence we received as we move forward.


The bill will see $11 billion extra funding for research—and I think that is fabulous—and $139 million to the Future Fellows program. That is not in the Labor Party's dissenting report; they do not want to keep that. They do not want to ensure that we are leading the world in research and can underpin that going forward. I support the bill and I recommend that the Senate does the same.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (19:11):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. It staggers me as to how much longer, and I suspect it will be until the next election, this Abbott government is going to go on hoodwinking the Australian people that, somehow, whatever it says does not represent a broken promise or indeed is an untruth. One of the biggest areas of hoodwinking of Australian voters must be in the area of university funding; it has to be in that area. I want to draw the Senate's attention to the Labor Party's substantial dissenting report—a well-researched document, a lot of facts and figures—unlike the majority report, which is quite emotive in parts. Our report has facts and figures based on what our own research tells us and of course based on the evidence that we heard.


I want to start with budget night. What we found out on budget night, despite promises to the contrary from Mr Abbott in the lead-up to the election, was the announcement of the most radical shake-up of higher education in 30 years. You might think that that is fair enough if the government had alerted the Australian voters before the election of its desire to do that. But no, that budget announcement, that radical shake-up, the most radical shake-up of higher education in this country for 30 years, came completely out of the blue. The Abbott government gave no indication in its statements either prior to or immediately after the 2013 election that it was anticipating radical changes in higher education. I would like to quote the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, and what he promised in 2013:


In an era of busy government and constant change, it's insufficiently recognised how often masterly inactivity can be the best contribution that government can make to a particular sector … A period of relative policy stability in which changes already made can be digested and adjusted to, such as the move to demand-driven funding, is probably what our universities most need now.


He went on:


We will be a stable and consultative government. If we put in place a policy or a program, we will see it through. If we have to change it, we will consult beforehand …


Let me just repeat that:


If we have to change it, we will consult beforehand, rather than impose it unilaterally and argue about it afterwards. We understand the value of stability and certainty, even to universities.


I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that what we have seen from the Abbott government in this radical change to universities is completely that: a unilateral change without any consultation. Certainly, as members of the committee that inquired into the bill before us, we asked universities if they were consulted and none of them were. Even if you try and gloss over it and say that the billions of dollars being taken out of universities is somehow magically still there, the fact is that this government has put in place the most radical change in 30 years without one skerrick of consultation. That just follows its pattern of broken promises and of no consultation—of, 'We're in government; we're doing what we want.'


The other thing that shows us that this is policy on the run is all the mistakes that the various ministers made when trying to explain this policy. We saw Christopher Pyne saying, 'No, this new student debt won't be retrospective,' and yet it was. We have seen mistake after mistake by Minister Pyne in trying to explain this package. That tells me that this package was done on the run. Somebody came up with a bright idea, perhaps on the back of an envelope, and it was given to Minister Pyne to implement without any plan. You either know the truth and don't want to admit it or you don't know it, and clearly Minister Pyne did not realise that his new student debt would be retrospective. And on and on it goes.


I want to start at the heart of this package, which is the 20 per cent cut to universities. It does not matter how the government tries to dress it up; it is a cut. Interestingly, we have heard senators on the government side trying to say that, overwhelmingly, universities support this package—well, they do not. During the inquiry, we did not find a university that said, 'Please, I put my hand up. Give me a 20 per cent cut in funding.' Every single university had real concerns about that 20 per cent cut in funding. That is what is at the heart of this package.


Then we go to fee deregulation. It is not fee deregulation; it is just charging whatever students will pay. It is just turning universities into a market. It is imposing an American system on our system in Australia. We have seen the failed markets in various parts of the world and here we are, taking our institutes of higher education and simply turning them into a market. Indeed, some of the witnesses to the Senate inquiry referred to going to Myer and having a choice of shirts. It is beyond words to suggest that we are down at that level of competition. It is ridiculous to suggest that. But the 20 per cent cut has to be found somewhere, and all universities expressed concerns about this cut and this loss of vital income. There was no dissent from that. The fact, of course, is that this loss of income can only be recouped from one source, and that source is students, by imposing unimaginable debt on people at a very young age—in their early 20s or, if they do a doctorate, maybe even into their mid- and later 20s. Imposing lifelong debt, unimaginable debt, on very young people shows that the Abbott government has complete disregard for students.


The government come in here, day after day, and say that they do not want to be the government to impose debt on future generations—but that is exactly what the Abbott government are doing here. There is no getting away from the fact that they are imposing a massive future debt on a young person, a debt of at least $100,000 and possibly more. We have already seen the University of Western Australia, in my state, put its fees up. The University of Western Australia is one of the universities that advocates for people to do four and five years of study, and for longer degrees we will see these sorts of debts being incurred by students.


It is fair to say that the vice-chancellors did not have a lot to say about student debt, but they certainly had a lot to say about the interest charge. There was not a university—

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-10-29,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:12):  This is a debate that concerns millions of Australian students in higher education today. It is about the 1.2 million Australians with outstanding HECS debts. It is about the millions currently in school or in the workforce who are hoping to study at university. Australians know how important this debate is to their future and their nation's future. Australians understand that this bill will take away the foundation stones of a fair go. Australians believe that access to higher education should not be based on the circumstances of their birth or where they live but, rather, on the clear principle of merit.


Australians do not want to be facing the prospect of taking out a second mortgage to help pay the cost of their child's education and find the idea that they must choose which child gets to go to university an idea that rightly belongs to the Menzies era. It is to these Australians that Labor speaks when it opposes this bill. We stand against $100,000 degrees. We are against crippling debts. We are against the Americanisation and the privatisation of Australian higher education.


It may well be argued that there is nothing of greater value to our nation than our universities. It may well be argued that there is nothing more important to our economy, to our culture and to our society than knowledge and ideas. Universities are the custodians and the generators of knowledge. While there will be a lot of talk about fairness in relation to this bill—because this bill rips fairness out of our university system—it is important in this debate to consider the wider role of universities in the Commonwealth.


Too often, we talk about teaching and research only as a means to an end, but ignore the most challenging and rewarding role of academics—that of imagining things entirely new. Academic creativity is not embraced by the straighteners of our body politic, but it serves as an inspiration for the enlargers. The achievements of the academy go to the very existence of who we are—every bit as much as our sporting triumphs or our military history. 


I think of eminent historians like Manning Clark, John Hirst and Iain McCalman, and the younger historians like Hannah Forsyth and James Boyce, who are reimagining the way we look at our country. I think of the writers who tell us stories, such as the Booker Prize winner Richard Flanagan, Hannah Kent, John Birmingham, Tim Winton, and Kate Grenville. I think of Professor Graham Clark, who put Australia on the map in medical science with his invention of the Cochlear implant, now used worldwide. I think of the Nobel laureates Brian Schmidt, Elizabeth Blackburn, Barry Marshall, Robin Warren, John Coetzee and Peter Doherty. All of these people and many more were nourished by our world-class public universities, whether it was as students, teachers or researchers, and in many cases all three. They pass on ideas and knowledge to future generations. They help us conceive who we have been, who we are and who we might be.


It is not just the towering intellects and the world-famous figures who make the achievements of our universities remarkable. Many who have made the transition to public life, including most people in this place, benefitted from a university education. More fundamentally, we thank our public universities for our teachers, our nurses, our engineers, our agricultural scientists, our doctors and our community workers—all the highly skilled professionals who keep this country's wheels in motion and contribute to its social, cultural and physical wealth. In short, our quality of life is vastly enriched by the quality and extent of the contributions made by our universities.


This is not the first time I have found it necessary to make these sorts of remarks in this place. The opposition finds it alarming that these things have to be said at all, but evidently they do have to be said. Not for the first time, we have had to ask why the conservative side of politics is hell-bent on destroying universities' capacities as custodians and as generators of ideas. In this country, since 1974, the university system has been a national enterprise. It has been largely funded by the Commonwealth. The policy directions are set by the Commonwealth. Foremost within this is the notion that access to undergraduate education should not be blocked by the cost of tuition. Equal access and equal participation have long been at the heart of Commonwealth policy. This is a bill that threatens to undermine this principle of the fair go in Australian education.


Its framers know that. Why else would they talk until they are blue in the face about the so-called equity measures and the need for scholarships, pathways and structural adjustment funds? We only need to introduce elaborate new scholarship schemes if the system itself is unfair. We need adjustment funds to try to adjust the inequalities that are inherent in these measures. These special arrangements are in themselves admissions of failure. It is an admission that incurable inequalities lie at the very heart of this package. Attacks on equity and merit, of course, are nothing new to the Liberal Party. Those opposite have form.


I can remember back in 1996 when they came in and unilaterally slashed university funding by five per cent. They hiked HECS fees and they lowered repayment thresholds, and they did this without warning. There was no mention of these matters in the previous election, and then they sought to bring about this very plan to cut spending, deregulate fees and offer faux scholarships. When the cabinet submission was leaked, even John Howard saw that under this proposal lay dragons and he backed off very quickly. But the current minister and the current Prime Minister do not have the sense to understand that fundamental fact of political life. There is a copy of the cabinet submission on my website for those who want to have a look and want to be reminded, either as students of history or scholars of the present predicament. Nothing changes when it comes to the Liberal Party's contempt for universities.


Let me speak plainly and honestly, because the other side will not. This policy is an uncontrolled experiment. We know one thing for sure: it will lead to very large fee increases. One-hundred-thousand-dollar degrees, which currently are relatively uncommon, will become much more common. That is why we have seen so many commentators call for a variety of price restraint mechanisms. The latest independent modelling, which the Labor Party released today, shows the dramatic impact of fees and debt all too clearly. It confirms, as many witnesses to the inquiry told us, that women will be particularly hard hit. Mature-age students will be particularly savagely hit. Students in rural and regional Australia will be most dramatically affected. The government has justified its radical reform by reference to inadequate government funding, but the crisis in funding is a direct result of the government's own decision to take 20 per cent of university funding away from students, hack into the research training scheme, cut funding to the Australian Research Council, cut reward funding, cut equity funding and cut indexation.


We have heard that the university vice-chancellors—if they have to deal with the various vicious cuts—want the ability to charge tuition fees at whatever level they think fit. The minister likes to claim that there is near unanimous support from university leaders. The reality we saw in inquiries and submissions in the hearing is very different. In submission after submission you read the reluctance, caution and hesitant declarations of those that are under duress. Whatever motivations or reservations there are of vice-chancellors, the fact remains: just as it is not the role of this Senate to rubberstamp the desires of the executive neither is it the role of this Senate automatically to give vice-chancellors whatever they want. Successful university funding policy does not simply provide carte blanche for this nation's vice-chancellors to have unlimited access to funding from the pockets of Australian students and from Australian workers. It is not our role to give them 'a licence to print HELP debt', to quote Dr Sharrock of the LH Martin Institute. It has often been said that getting between a vice-chancellor and a pot of money is a dangerous business, but that is what Labor will do, because there is much more at stake here than the performance bonuses of university managers. Access, equity, workforce needs, research excellence, the capacity to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing world—these are the things that this Senate has to give consideration to in this debate.


The government says that it has the support for its package from the universities; it does not. It does not have any support for its regressive changes to HECS—none at all. There is no support for cutting the funding from research—none at all. There is no support for charging fees for PhD students—none at all. There is no support for the 20 per cent cut to the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. There is a division around the issue of privatisation in higher education—particularly on this misleading, Orwellian concept of the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. Even Universities Australia, when pushed at the committee's hearings, said that it did not want to support this bill in its current form, 'far from it'. Its members, especially those outside the Group of Eight, are much more forthright in their many and varied criticisms. Is there any wonder?


This bill is rotten to the core. This is a bill that the Australian people did not vote for. This is a bill that offends the basic principles of equity. It offends the basic concept that, in this country, if you are bright and work hard, you have a right to expect a high-quality education that is not dependent on your having rich parents or on coming from a privileged background or on your postcode. None of those things are ever going to be accepted by the people of this country. This is a bill that the Australian people feel that they were lied to about. They were misled. Remember the last election: 'no cuts to education, no changes to the administrative arrangements' and the Prime Minister's visit down to Universities Australia's conference, where he talked about masterly inactivity. What a contrast! It was the most radical piece of social engineering we have seen in this country since the last time the Liberals tried it on. This is a bill that should be withdrawn.


The government should go back to the drawing board and should deal directly with the issues facing higher education. In doing so, it should actually consult with the stakeholders before announcing radical new policies. That is what John Dawkins did with the green and white paper approach. That is the proper approach. Earlier, I talked about the many luminaries who have studied, taught and done research in Australian universities. They are far from the only people who have benefited or hoped to benefit from an equitable higher education system. Ordinary Australians should benefit, such as Linley from Tasmania, who not only tells me she got a university education because of Gough Whitlam—she is now a grandmother—she says:


... my three grandchildren are preparing for years 10, 11 and 12. But the cost of sending them to UTAS will make it virtually impossible. The burden of repayments will mean they will not be able to afford their own home ...


And Graham, an Indigenous Australian who is studying at the University of Queensland and wants to do a PhD, says:


I would never have had the courage to start my degree if I knew it would cost me a six figure sum.


Trinh is an aspiring 15-year-old student from Western Sydney whose mother migrated from Vietnam and worked hard to give her children a better life. She said:


I want to grow up and become a nurse and be able to have an apartment where everything's stable. I want to be able to give my mum the things she deserves. But with this current government, I don't even know if I'll make it to university and I'm scared.


How can the Senate remain silent when confronted by these legitimate fears about this legislation? How can the Senate remain silent when it is confronted by the lies that this government told the Australian people prior to the election? How can we in all consciousness tick and flick a package that would cause such massive harm? There is a better way here.


The funding crisis within universities caused by the government can be fixed by the government with one stroke of a pen, by withdrawing the cuts. Labor has shown it can be done. In government, we increased investment in universities by nearly 100 per cent between 2007 to 2017 at the end of that forward estimates. Universities are right to demand that this parliament act. We must, of course, expect that action and we should expect that people will reject this unacceptable plan.


In urging the Senate to reject this bill, Labor is not suggesting that nothing needs to change. The Commonwealth needs to live up to its responsibilities and properly fund our universities—and to do so by working with them, not seeking to impose an ideological position upon them. We need a compact between the Commonwealth and our institutions to promote diversity, to foster excellence in research and scholarship and to maintain access on the basis of merit, not money. In the words of talented historian Hannah Forsyth:


Higher education … needs to keep looking for solutions to the problems that confront the world's economies, environments, democracies and philosophies.


Dwelling in the ruins is no solution.


This bill is no solution. Its ideology is no solution. No sugar coating, no side deals, no nudges or winks will save it.


The Senate has a legitimate choice here, and that choice boils down to one option in reality. Either we can destroy the university system as we know it by introducing structural changes to the university system which will see them have to cope, as the Parliamentary Budget Office highlights, with funding cuts of $18 billion—irreversible changes in the structure of universities—or we can reject this bill: send it back. That is what we should do. That is what the Labor Party will be urging all senators here to do, and I have every hope that that is exactly what will happen.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-10-29,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  By far the majority of Australians—those born here and those who come here to find a new life and opportunity—want a good education for their children, for the nation's children. The bill before us, the Higher Education and Research Amendment Bill 2014, will rob people of opportunity and hope to achieve that. It should be voted down in its entirety. There are no deals, no negotiations that can turn this bill into a winner.


The Liberals and the Nationals did not even have the courage to take this bill in any form—details of this bill—to the last election. They should now have the decency to withdraw it. There are nearly one million students in Australia who will be impacted by these changes if they go through. For people without a silver spoon, education is the key to survival. It gives you a leg up and makes freedom and choice possible. Education empowers people. Prime Minister Tony Abbott's education, however, is a very different story. It is about the entitlement of a rich boy from Sydney's North Shore who takes his power for granted. He is not bothered by $100,000 fees for a university degree or by public money earmarked for higher education going to for-profit companies.


By raising university fees the Liberals and the Nationals are slamming the door on opportunity for millions of Australians. Coalition policy is about keeping the world as a place with haves and have-nots. That approach is the basis of the bill we are considering tonight, and that is why the Greens say so emphatically that it should be scrapped completely. The bill is neoliberalism in its most crude form; 101 of neoliberalism is to strip the costs off government and put them on to ordinary people. The essence of this bill is to take $5 billion out of the public allocation for our universities and put the costs on to students through higher fees.


Minister Christopher Pyne, in pushing ahead with this bill, is ignoring the growing opposition to this destructive legislation. One of the lines we have heard trotted out time and again from the minister is the fact that apparently the entire university sector is behind the proposed shake-up of higher education that he is now engineering. It is clear that the minister and his coalition colleagues—Nationals as well as Liberals—have a strong preference for meeting and discussing higher education issues with university executives and managers over staff and students. What they need to remember is that the vice-chancellors and senior management are not the entirety of the sector; they are actually only a small part.


Just last week we saw the creation of the National Alliance for Public Universities, an organisation seeking 'to give voice to the researchers, teachers, administrators and other staff who oppose the deregulation of fees and whose perspective has been overlooked in the national debate'. The organisation has grown rapidly, with 500 academic staff signing up in a few days. The charter of the National Alliance argues: 


Universities provide both public and private benefits. To fulfil these, they must function independently of market forces and political interference.


They go on to say:


… universities have a social mission, enabling social mobility while striving to dissolve entrenched social inequalities altogether.


I congratulate them on their launch and welcome their voice in this crucial debate. These are the people who are truly representative of the university sector, along with the students, not the Group of Eight vice-chancellors, many of whom have been camped out in the minister's office attempting to lobby crossbenchers week after week. Sadly, the Group of Eight vice-chancellors have been prioritising their ideological commitment to unrestrained markets over the needs of their staff and students.


I would also like to congratulate the many students who have highlighted the damage this bill will cause. And I think at this time it is worth remembering the courageous students who took their protest to the ABC's Q&A program. They warrant a brief mention in this debate. Some people, including a few media commentators, grumbled that these young people had a bad attitude and apparently lacked respect. But most of those who criticised have a prominent voice within the public discourse on this and a range of issues. Most Australians, particularly young Australians—the ones who will be hardest hit by these measures—do not have a public voice, and the action at Q&A made a significant contribution to the debate on the Pyne bill. Just today—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I do acknowledge the interjection from Senator McKenzie. Just today two students at Melbourne University took direct action on this issue, blocking the entrance of a university building. Why do people do that? Because they are so deeply troubled and concerned. These students were campaigning against the proposals contained in this bill, and for free education—a realistic and affordable alternative for students. I said earlier that there are nearly one million students in Australia who will be impacted by these changes—250,000 of them are on youth allowance and will have their debt significantly increased as a result of the proposal to slash start-up scholarships and replace them with loans. There are also 140,000 university staff. They are the people whom we should have to the forefront of our mind when we debate this bill. 


The issue of fees is where we see the deeply damaging aspects of this legislation. We have heard vice-chancellors and senior management—prominent backers of the bill—using the lack of guaranteed high levels of funding as their main line of argument in backing fee deregulation. Many of the vice-chancellors have said that they have to support fee deregulation, as successive federal governments had inadequately funded higher education and that now they would be hit by this latest 'slash' approach to higher education, with a $5 billion cut. This is where we actually need to look closely at what is going on here. But it is also disappointing how the vice-chancellors respond to these cuts rather than being a strong voice out there advocating for a well-funded higher education sector.


Fee deregulation might be called a competitive agenda. But it is, pure and simple, an extreme budget measure in the first instance, to shift the $5 billion—the cost burden—that the government wants to save for itself onto students. By cutting students' subsidies by an average of 20 per cent by place, the government is essentially forcing all universities to raise their fees in order to retain their current level of funding. That is what the vice-chancellors should be spelling out and is the point they should have been arguing. Fears of prohibitively expensive fees were clearly set out by the independent National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, based at the University of Canberra. The NTEU, the ACTU and the National Union of Students also set out these issues in the submissions before the inquiry into this legislation.


It is worth commenting at this point on some of the comments from coalition members. Today, again, Senator McKenzie has been out there publicly accusing people who address this issue of fees—and the very real issue that we, and students in particular, have ahead of us, of $100,000 fees—of scaremongering.


What is going on here is that I and others are out there informing the many unions, community groups and students—we are being responsible. It is informing students of the reality that they will face. Even the University of Western Australia released its figures saying it will cost $16,000 a year for a degree, but if you look at that $16,000, you will see that over a five-year degree, which is increasingly common for many students, it will move into the range of $100,000 once interest on student debt is included. When you look into what so many of the coalition's own backers of this aspect of the legislation are saying and when you inform people of the high fee levels that they will face, that is where you will get proof that it is not scaremongering but reality.


Not a single witness at our inquiry agreed with the minister's proposition that university fees will go down as a result of deregulation. Given that university vice-chancellors are viewing fee deregulation as a tool to boost revenue, it is obvious that fees will increase across the board if this bill is passed by parliament. So there is great interest in this issue. When the budget first came out and we started hearing the details about the government's planned cutbacks and then the legislation came out, there just was not enough information out there about what the fees could blow out to.


One of the contributions the Greens made to this issue is the development of a website: whatwillmydegreecost.com.au. This site was obviously of value, which was just about providing information—that was all that it was doing—because it received so much traffic in the first few hours of its operation that it actually crashed. We quickly had it going again. In the space of a few weeks, it was viewed 1.3 million times. Over half a million students and future students used it to calculate the cost of their degrees under a deregulated environment. That highlights that it is not scaremongering; the government are being irresponsible. They have been trying to sugar-coat their poisoned piece of legislation by making out that it is something that it is not. The horror story of these high levels of fees is something very serious.


While the very damaging budget that the government brought down has disadvantaged people in the main—and, certainly, this legislation does—this bill also reaches into middle-class Australia. This is something I am coming across more and more with middle-class families. Socially, I am often with people who are lawyers, small business people and workers in the professions. I have had the experience of where they have actually been looking at their children and saying, 'How am I going to afford to send them to university?' This is increasingly troubling people in our communities.


I want to move on to the issue of Commonwealth-supported places. If this bill becomes law, public subsidies will be given to private for-profit higher education providers for the first time, to the tune of $450 million. Again, please focus on that—$450 million. It is not money just sitting there; it is money that once would have gone to our public universities. If the bill goes through, it would be there to help a number of companies increase their profit margins. The minister has been unable to confirm that new students will enrol in the courses with these private higher education providers.


This is very relevant to how this money plays out, and the bill's explanatory memorandum confirms that the rate of growth in student enrolments in this area will be slower than in previous years. The end result of these changes will be a windfall of half a billion dollars in subsidies to private education providers without any guarantee of increasing access. So the money is set aside and the government is telling us that all these students will flood to these providers. But when you question the minister he cannot confirm that more students will actually enrol and that more students will come into the system.


During our inquiry, the committee heard strong evidence from the Australian Education Union regarding the problems associated with allowing private providers to access public funding for higher education. We need to ask the question, and it needs to be answered: who is going to hold these operators to account? The experience with the vocational education and training sector shows the depth of this problem when these dodgy operators come in, and there are just too many of them there already. They can see that there is money and that it is easy pickings. They move in—and move in quickly. This is another serious worry regarding how this plays out.


The result of opening up the vocational education and training system to the marketplace brings growing doubts regarding the quality of the education provision that comes from the private sector and the cost of qualifications for the students who may enrol. Far from the opening up of the market in the VET leading to a downward pressure on prices, we now see the spectre of $30,000 being charged for diplomas and advanced diplomas in VET. Right now, under the current system, a degree at a public university will cost less than your technical and further education training costs under the system that has already been opened up to the marketplace. This is because the cost is being shifted onto students. The bill will not require private providers to reduce their fees as a result of receiving government support, and that is where we have this very serious problem with how this will play out with the private providers.


The issue of Commonwealth scholarships is one that the government has been trying to use in the past week as a key argument to make out that this system that they are bringing forward is such a fair one. They are even trying to start to equate it with free higher education, which is a stretch. But nothing is beyond this minister. No Commonwealth government funding will go into the so-called Commonwealth scholarships. Universities will be forced to increase their fees by at least 20 per cent before a single dollar will be diverted to these scholarships. Universities like the Group of Eight will be able to maximise the increase in student fees under deregulation, and they will have the largest pool of funds for these scholarships. This will distort the university activities. Group of Eight universities have the lowest proportion of students from low SES backgrounds.




Senator McKenzie:
  It is changing.




Senator RHIANNON:
  Yes, it will change under your system, Senator McKenzie. I am pleased the senator interjected at this point, because the sell-out by the Nationals of our regional universities is something that has to be documented and needs to be recognised. It is absolutely monumental. Minister Pyne has shown deception because he has said he did not expect fees to increase significantly under a deregulation system. But the minister cannot have it both ways. Either fees will increase significantly or Commonwealth scholarships will not exist. The whole issue of Commonwealth scholarships is something that is being brought forward as a scam to try and justify assistance being there for disadvantaged students. But there will only be a small number. We do not even know the form that those scholarships will take at the moment. Each university can work it out for itself, and there is no guarantee that those students who may receive scholarships will not end up with a heavy cost burden at the end of their education.


The issue of research is something where the government has also been deceptive. It has said that there will be no cuts to research. But in this bill the government is proposing a 10 per cent across-the-board cut to the research training scheme. This is an enormously backward step, placing greater financial burden on our universities, and remember that this comes on top of all the cuts that we have seen to the CSIRO, the cooperative research centres and so many other key research bodies.


Turning to the regional universities, I repeat that the sell-out by the Nationals of our regional universities is huge. Our regional universities could possibly be the most vulnerable aspect of this bill when we come to consider the various institutions. Regional universities like the University of Wollongong and the University of Newcastle are clearly from big areas. There are no universities there for them to compete with. It really shows that the whole competitive argument that so much of this bill is based on falls over when you look closely at how this works. I particularly pay tribute to the many organisations that have worked so hard to defeat this bill, including the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Students, those who work with postgraduate associations, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, the ACTU, the Australian Education Union and the Australian Medical Students' Association.


If the bill were to be passed it would create a higher education system that would be inequitable and elitist with limited accessibility to the highest quality public education institutions. Australia is already near the bottom of the OECD. When it comes to public funding for higher education, despite 96 per cent of Australian students— (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-10-29,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:51):  I rise very proudly tonight to speak to the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. I also rise to speak as the chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. We conducted a very comprehensive inquiry into this piece of legislation. There were over 169 submissions and four days of hearings, and I would like to congratulate all of those who took time out to make a submission to the inquiry and indeed to attend our hearings and give us very good evidence. I would also like to place on the record, on my behalf, particularly, our thanks to the secretariat for their tireless work in producing what I think is quite a comprehensive report, in which we traverse the history of higher education in Australia, which lands us at the place we are today: the reality we have to deal with if we want to continue to have and to increase the excellence of our higher education system while continuing its strong accessibility.


I just want to briefly quote Nelson Mandela: 'Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.' So, for the first five minutes, I absolutely adored everything Senator Carr had to say about higher education, the role of universities in society et cetera. They are absolutely crucial. That is why they have to be financially sustainable and accessible to all—which is exactly what this government is doing through this education reform agenda.


When the credit card statement arrives, the responsible thing to do is to actually pay the debt, just as this government is setting out to do, having inherited Labor's hefty credit card bill. A commission of audit took place, and ministers were told to find savings within their portfolios. A package of higher education reforms was the result of Minister Pyne's deliberation, striking a fair balance between careful savings and strategic investment—strategic investment by this minister. The ultimate goal is to spread opportunity to more students, drive creativity and innovation, and ensure that our universities are equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century and that Australia is not left behind. The higher education sector gets it, and supports the government's planned reforms contained in the bill that we are speaking to tonight—reforms which directly benefit higher education providers, students and communities, whilst driving economic growth and productivity.


The key element of the reforms is fee deregulation. That will give universities the longed-for freedom from government control, allowing them to make independent choices, not just about fees but about teaching methods, courses to be offered, scholarships and other services, in response to the market. And let us face it: 'the market' in this conversation is students, and they are not all young people leaving year 12. There is strong evidence that fee deregulation will lead to greater competition, and with greater competition comes greater choice. And, contrary to the rowdy views of a small number of critics, the higher education sector welcomes it. What bemuses me is the failure of our critics, including Labor, to acknowledge that fee deregulation already exists for postgraduate and international students, and that most higher education providers see full deregulation as the next logical step in the evolution of our higher education system.


In fact, students have been progressively making increased contributions to the cost of their higher education under successive governments since the 1980s. Even in Whitlam government years, there was no 'free education' because, in reality, university costs were funded by the taxpayer. Cabinet papers also later revealed Gough Whitlam's free tuition had little impact on the composition of student intake, with a continued overrepresentation of students from wealthy backgrounds.


A decade on, faced with the financial strain of a free education, and greater pressure to expand education opportunity for the growing number of students completing year 12, the Hawke government introduced the HEC Scheme. In a speech at the Victoria University of Technology a few years later, the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, said: 'There is no such thing, of course, as a free education. Somebody has to pay. In systems with no charges, those somebodies are all taxpayers.' He added: 'This is a pretty important point. A free higher education system is one paid for by the taxes of all, the majority of whom have not had the privilege of a university education.' So I think we all need to ask ourselves if that is a fair thing.


Bob Hawke, in an interview in 1988, stated: 'I do not have any problem with the concept of fees. In fact, one of the greatest stupidities was the proposition that the Whitlam Labor government introduced a free education. There is no such thing as a free education. It is a question of who pays and how it is paid for.'


The Howard government introduced a partial deregulation of student fees and domestic full fee-paying undergraduate places that were later abolished by the Rudd-Gillard government, without adequate compensation for universities. The Rudd-Gillard government went on to introduce a demand-driven system, whilst cutting funding by more than $2 billion. In fact, the previous Labor government announced a number of 'savings measures'—in plain speak, cuts—to higher education grants and student support, totalling $6.65 million from 2011-12 to 2016-17. Labor's Senator Carr vehemently opposed this whenever it was raised during the inquiry hearings, despite it being fact, in black and white, in the budget and MYEFO papers. It was an odd approach for a Labor government, led by a Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who advocated diversity and specialisation in universities. Julia Gillard reflects in her new book: 'I am particularly proud of our decision to unchain Australian universities, to enable them to define their own mission and educate more students.' This is precisely what the coalition government's reforms seek to achieve. And she adds: 'As a result of the new system, while students continue to compete for places, universities increasingly have to compete for students. A better run, better quality university can attract students who might be considering other universities.'


Fee deregulation is all about making universities compete for students. One wonders what Julia Gillard thinks of her party's apparent shift in direction. Claims of skyrocketing fees, made by student unions, Labor and the Greens, as a result of deregulation of fees also lack substance. The reliability of the methodology behind two of the most referred-to studies, from the NTEU and NATSEM, has been questioned more broadly.


I just want to go to those assumptions because, as anybody who appreciates a good mathematical model knows, the assumptions underpinning the model are actually what we need to go to before we start screaming about $310,000 degrees for social work, as was claimed this morning. The assumption under the modelling that was used is that we did not go to what the actual fee may be. There has been only one university, the UWA, that suggested a fee setting, and evidence throughout the inquiry from vice-chancellors and all, even some of the Labor Party—even Professor Quiggin came—was that universities are going to charge differently for different things. UWA has decided to do a broad-brush fee across all their courses. Other universities are not going to do that. CSU, for example, with the fabulous vet degree, might choose to charge a premium for that particular product and a different fee for some of their other offerings.


But when we go to the assumptions underpinning that modelling, they jump straight to the international fee, setting the highest fee you can charge within Australia for undergraduates. They then charge the six per cent bond rate over 20 years. Bearing in mind the bond rate for the last 10 years has been only 3.8 per cent. They then factored in some time off, presumably to have some children or to travel. That got us to the worst case scenario for a social work degree, which was $310,000.


In the best case scenario, using those same assumptions, which I have actually poked some holes in, that same social work degree costs $42,000. It is a scare campaign, because it is affecting the students and families who are not seeing higher education as an investment—the first generation, particularly, need to be convinced that it is an investment worth making and they can do their social work degree for $42,000 rather than the $310,000 quoted. So it is an absolute furphy. It is scary and they have to stop saying it, because it is actually not true, even using their own modelling.


The NTEU admits in their report that not every university degree at every university will cost $100,000, but we do not hear that in the public debate and discussion, and that is morally reprehensible, particularly when we are talking about increasing access to higher education for those we need to get through the door.


NATSEM modelling is based in the University of Canberra, and that is understood to be the only university in the whole country that does not appreciate or is actually opposed to fee deregulation. The groups representing universities have issued a variety public statements and modelling showing that universities can be relied on to act responsibly in setting fees. Analysis from the Australian Technology Network, Innovative Research Universities, and the Group of Eight, and assurances from the Regional Universities Network all show this. Member institutions of the Council of Private Higher Education have also confirmed that 'whatever they receive in Commonwealth support for students will be passed on to students through reduced tuition'. So, for Senator Rhiannon to stand up here and say that nobody has talked about lowering fees does not actually go to the evidence. Let us talk about the evidence and the facts, not fear.


Nor is there any basis to comparisons with other deregulated higher education systems. The rhetoric throughout has been of an Americanisation of our system. A directly comparable system does not exist. Australia's higher education system is unique in comparison, as the reform package will ensure that for all students, irrespective of their means, there are no up-front financial barriers to accessing higher education. So for Senator Carr to talk about merit and about financial impact as being a barrier, our system still offers an income-contingent loan scheme that is the ideal of the world. This was evident based on expert views to the Senate inquiry hearings. Professor John Dewar, Chair of the Legislation and Financing Working Group, explained that the US system was not one national system, as would be the case here. Rather it has extremely complicated and diverse. So to say that we are having an Americanisation is false.


Similarly, a submission from the Group of Eight explained that debt burdens like those in the US are simply not possible in Australia. In Australia, our HELP system of student loans means that graduates only repay when they earn enough to be able to do so, whereas in America the crippling debts are incurred by graduates because they do not have a provision for such loan support.


Further deregulation will drive a more competitive environment for universities, so charging exponentially higher fees will only result in empty lecture theatres and tutorials. Australian students are not idiots. They will go elsewhere. As the Australian Technology Network's Vicki Thomson logically explains, it would be untenable from a business perspective to do so. Vice-chancellor after vice-chancellor reiterated that there were not going to be $100,000 degrees hither and thither. There is strong evidence supporting the view that fee deregulation will boost equity and innovation. While providers will be able to determine course costs, they will have to compete on price and quality in order to attract students.


There is also strong stakeholder support for extending funding to sub-bachelor courses as well as to private universities and other higher education providers, with considerable benefits for regional students. We do not hear about these students. We do not hear about this absolutely fantastic access and equity aspect of this reform package.


Universities, colleges and TAFEs in the regions will be able to offer more courses with qualifications leading to careers or further study. The idea has merit, with a growing number of universities and TAFEs having already forged partnerships across regional Australia—for example, Federation University Australia at Ballarat and La Trobe University, in my home state of Victoria. These universities and TAFEs are also targeting first-generation students from families that did not previously have such opportunities, and nor could they afford it. By 2018, more than 80,000 additional students nationally will benefit from these increased opportunities—coming from the regions, disadvantaged and Indigenous backgrounds, mature age students and those with low ATAR scores. In the regions we have incredibly low year 12 completion rates, which means that you cannot easily go to university. These reforms seek to improve student mobility, while giving private and non-university providers flexibility to specialise and differentiate from one another.


The Kemp-Norton review of the Demand Driven Funding System found that expanding access to sub-bachelor pathway courses would lead to the improved efficiency by better matching students with appropriate courses. TAFE Directors Australia also endorsed these reforms, saying:


Commonwealth funding is required to support the increasingly important role TAFE plays in broadening student choice and access, strengthening the capacity and reach of the system, particularly in regional areas, and addressing critical shortages of higher skills in the Australian economy.


I want to go to the report, because while we hear a lot from NUS students, predominantly who attend Go8 universities I have to say. They always end up here in this place or in the other place. That is fine. I love hearing from students. But I did not hear Senator Carr nor Senator Rhiannon talk about the students who attend private institutions, or the TAFE students, who will be the beneficiaries of so much of our reform package. Going to the report where the Chisholm Institute explained to the committee that they built their degrees on industry strength. These are higher education providers that have very clear and direct links with industry. There are a certain cohort of students who appreciate that but who do not necessarily want theoretical philosophy degrees. They want to realise that the education they are getting at their local TAFE or local institute is going to result in a job. Right now, degrees at these institutions are costing $22,000 or $32,000.


I want to go to Miss Sara Moad, a second year Bachelor of Dance student with a private provider, that Senator Rhiannon does not want to see have the benefit of being treated equitably with other such students. She chose a career in a profession that is not well represented in our public universities, and I will quote her:


If and when the bill is implemented, I will have already graduated, with a debt of $56,000, of which $11,000 is an administration fee of 25 per cent—


which our legislation actually seeks to get rid of—


more than I need to save for a house deposit. Compare this with my brother, who will have completed a three-year degree in design at a public university, with a HECS debt of around $15,000. I will pay more than three times the amount … How is that equitable? Professionals in the performing arts have the ability to share so much with their communities and build culture, and often do so despite earning a lower income compared to other professions.


Senator Rhiannon and Senator Carr want to ensure that Miss Moad continues to pay $11,000 more than her brother and it is simply not fair when we want to go to equity. 


I want to briefly touch on the Commonwealth Scholarship scheme. Those institutions with more than 500 enrolled students will be required to put 20 per cent of the revenue raised through increased course fees towards scholarships targeting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Again, Senator Rhiannon, you went to complain about the Go8 universities' under-representation of that cohort of Australians, in their university lecture halls. This measure will ensure that that proportion increases. So I really would appreciate your support in getting that increase in the Commonwealth Scholarship scheme so that we can get more disadvantaged students into the great universities in many of our capital cities.


There has been a lot of debate about regional students and the effect on them, but many country students do not opt to study at a regional campus. In fact, evidence is that most of them do not choose to do so. We can talk about the Regional Universities Network, but I am also talking about regional students—regional kids—and their future and, by default, our future in regional Australia. They do it for a lot of different reasons. Steps must be taken to ensure that they can overcome the very real financial barriers to them accessing a quality education of their choice that currently their parents or they themselves have to bear. Our bill seeks to do this. Our Australian education system is unique because it remains cost free at the point of delivery, contrary to Labor's scaremongering. The Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne, has pointed out that, because the government currently lends to students at the bond rate, it is fair for them to be charged that. The committee inquiry report showed, I think, overwhelming evidence that that may need to be revisited. I am confident that the minister will consider the report and the evidence we received as we move forward.


The bill will see $11 billion extra funding for research—and I think that is fabulous—and $139 million to the Future Fellows program. That is not in the Labor Party's dissenting report; they do not want to keep that. They do not want to ensure that we are leading the world in research and can underpin that going forward. I support the bill and I recommend that the Senate does the same.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (19:11):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. It staggers me as to how much longer, and I suspect it will be until the next election, this Abbott government is going to go on hoodwinking the Australian people that, somehow, whatever it says does not represent a broken promise or indeed is an untruth. One of the biggest areas of hoodwinking of Australian voters must be in the area of university funding; it has to be in that area. I want to draw the Senate's attention to the Labor Party's substantial dissenting report—a well-researched document, a lot of facts and figures—unlike the majority report, which is quite emotive in parts. Our report has facts and figures based on what our own research tells us and of course based on the evidence that we heard.


I want to start with budget night. What we found out on budget night, despite promises to the contrary from Mr Abbott in the lead-up to the election, was the announcement of the most radical shake-up of higher education in 30 years. You might think that that is fair enough if the government had alerted the Australian voters before the election of its desire to do that. But no, that budget announcement, that radical shake-up, the most radical shake-up of higher education in this country for 30 years, came completely out of the blue. The Abbott government gave no indication in its statements either prior to or immediately after the 2013 election that it was anticipating radical changes in higher education. I would like to quote the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, and what he promised in 2013:


In an era of busy government and constant change, it's insufficiently recognised how often masterly inactivity can be the best contribution that government can make to a particular sector … A period of relative policy stability in which changes already made can be digested and adjusted to, such as the move to demand-driven funding, is probably what our universities most need now.


He went on:


We will be a stable and consultative government. If we put in place a policy or a program, we will see it through. If we have to change it, we will consult beforehand …


Let me just repeat that:


If we have to change it, we will consult beforehand, rather than impose it unilaterally and argue about it afterwards. We understand the value of stability and certainty, even to universities.


I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that what we have seen from the Abbott government in this radical change to universities is completely that: a unilateral change without any consultation. Certainly, as members of the committee that inquired into the bill before us, we asked universities if they were consulted and none of them were. Even if you try and gloss over it and say that the billions of dollars being taken out of universities is somehow magically still there, the fact is that this government has put in place the most radical change in 30 years without one skerrick of consultation. That just follows its pattern of broken promises and of no consultation—of, 'We're in government; we're doing what we want.'


The other thing that shows us that this is policy on the run is all the mistakes that the various ministers made when trying to explain this policy. We saw Christopher Pyne saying, 'No, this new student debt won't be retrospective,' and yet it was. We have seen mistake after mistake by Minister Pyne in trying to explain this package. That tells me that this package was done on the run. Somebody came up with a bright idea, perhaps on the back of an envelope, and it was given to Minister Pyne to implement without any plan. You either know the truth and don't want to admit it or you don't know it, and clearly Minister Pyne did not realise that his new student debt would be retrospective. And on and on it goes.


I want to start at the heart of this package, which is the 20 per cent cut to universities. It does not matter how the government tries to dress it up; it is a cut. Interestingly, we have heard senators on the government side trying to say that, overwhelmingly, universities support this package—well, they do not. During the inquiry, we did not find a university that said, 'Please, I put my hand up. Give me a 20 per cent cut in funding.' Every single university had real concerns about that 20 per cent cut in funding. That is what is at the heart of this package.


Then we go to fee deregulation. It is not fee deregulation; it is just charging whatever students will pay. It is just turning universities into a market. It is imposing an American system on our system in Australia. We have seen the failed markets in various parts of the world and here we are, taking our institutes of higher education and simply turning them into a market. Indeed, some of the witnesses to the Senate inquiry referred to going to Myer and having a choice of shirts. It is beyond words to suggest that we are down at that level of competition. It is ridiculous to suggest that. But the 20 per cent cut has to be found somewhere, and all universities expressed concerns about this cut and this loss of vital income. There was no dissent from that. The fact, of course, is that this loss of income can only be recouped from one source, and that source is students, by imposing unimaginable debt on people at a very young age—in their early 20s or, if they do a doctorate, maybe even into their mid- and later 20s. Imposing lifelong debt, unimaginable debt, on very young people shows that the Abbott government has complete disregard for students.


The government come in here, day after day, and say that they do not want to be the government to impose debt on future generations—but that is exactly what the Abbott government are doing here. There is no getting away from the fact that they are imposing a massive future debt on a young person, a debt of at least $100,000 and possibly more. We have already seen the University of Western Australia, in my state, put its fees up. The University of Western Australia is one of the universities that advocates for people to do four and five years of study, and for longer degrees we will see these sorts of debts being incurred by students.


It is fair to say that the vice-chancellors did not have a lot to say about student debt, but they certainly had a lot to say about the interest charge. There was not a university—


Debate interrupted.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (19:20):  Freedom is an innate human aspiration. Millions of people have campaigned for freedom. Millions have died in the cause of freedom. Freedom is a fundamental aspiration common to all humanity. We know this instinctively. Expression has been given to this instinct in various forms, including in the Magna Carta, in our conventions, in legislation and in treaties. The quest for freedom is universal.


I recall my time at university, where countless lecturers were either apologists for or, even worse, openly supportive of the repressive communist regimes around the world. We were told it was 'historical'; it was 'cultural'; it was 'insert excuse of your choice'—it was any excuse to justify the unjustifiable: the oppressive left-wing communist regimes. Those apologists, aged as they now are, have, thankfully, in their lifetimes seen the irrepressibility of the human spirit's pursuit of freedom. As an aside, most of them now have a political home in the Australian Greens or the left of the ALP.


My motivation to speak this evening is that, on 9 November 2014, the country of my birth will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. On that night of 9 November 1989, freedom entered the homes of over one million Berliners. On that historic night, freedom conquered not just one city but a nation, and not just a nation but the entire Eastern Bloc. The fall of the Berlin Wall stands as one of the greatest victories for freedom, liberty and democracy in modern history.


The Berlin Wall was erected on 13 August 1961 by Soviet East Germany. After the war, Germany was divided in two: democracy and capitalism flourished in the west whilst the repressive hand of socialism gripped the east with an iron fist. The open border between these two worlds ran through not just the German nation but the German capital. In West Germany an economic miracle led to a sustained period of prosperity with personal freedoms. In East Germany citizens struggled under communist command-and-control economics and personal oppression. 


It should have come as no surprise when literally hundreds of thousands of East Germans crossed the then open border in pursuit of a better life in the west. The sheer numbers are staggering: in the first six months of 1953, the number of East Germans who crossed the border exceeded 200,000. East Germany was bleeding and, in the minds of its Soviet leaders, that bleeding needed to be stopped. So, on 12 August 1961, an order was signed to close the border. By nightfall, East Germany was sealed. For the next three decades, the Berlin Wall stood there as a wall of shame symbolising the Iron Curtain that divided not only a country and its people but two ways of living and, indeed, the 20th century itself. The wall was 155 kilometres in length with 45,000 separate sections of reinforced concrete, 116 watchtowers and no less than 20 bunkers. Running parallel to the wall was the infamous death strip along which all who attempted to cross would be mercilessly executed. 


Dr Hartwich writes that the wall symbolised all the divisions of the time:


East against West, capitalism against communism, democracy against dictatorship: all the ideological confrontations at the end of the short twentieth century were marked by the wall in front of the Brandenburg Gate.


The human cost of this wall is incalculable. At least 255 innocent East Germans were gunned down in their attempt to cross from the depths of despair in the east into a life of liberty in the west. The wall separated workers from jobs, husbands from wives, fathers from sons and mothers from daughters. It stood, in the words of Dr Hartwich, as:


… an inhumane scar running right through the heart of Berlin.


This monument to communist failure would, thankfully, not stand forever. But the fact that the wall was pulled down by the east, for the east and from the east with little help from the west stands, I believe, as a blot on the west—albeit with a few notable exceptions including, for example, President Reagan when he called upon then Soviet President Gorbachev to 'tear down this wall.' That was in 1987, some two years before the wall was actually dismantled. 


It is interesting to learn that which left-wing politicians in West Germany said at the time. For example, it is very interesting to read that Gerhard Schroder, a leading light of the Social Democrats in Germany, just a few months before the wall was dismantled said:


After 40 years of the Federal Republic—


or West Germany—


we should no longer tell lies to the new generation about the chances of re-unification: there are none.


Joschka Fischer, a leading Green politician, just two months before the dismantling of the wall said:


Let’s forget reunification! .... Why don’t we just shut up about it for the next twenty years?


How disheartening would those words have been for those pursuing freedom in the east? Thank goodness there were men and women of the calibre of President Ronald Reagan, who was willing to say two years earlier, 'tear down this wall.' This wall does represent oppression. It does represent everything that is abhorrent to personal and individual freedom. 


In a poll in 1987, 97 per cent of West Germans believed that reunification would not take place. In the 1980s, the Social Democrats tried to stop the funding of the organisation that researched human rights abuses in East Germany. Just imagine how disheartening that was for those pursuing, fighting and indeed dying for freedom in East Germany; and we had people who were unwilling to even give some sort of lip service and sustenance to the people of East Germany who were seeking freedom. Whilst the left of politics in the west apologised, the human spirit demanding freedom, thankfully, prevailed.


The threats to freedom may be taking a different form this century, but the human spirit's innate desire for freedom must, and will, ultimately prevail. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall serves as an inspiration to those fighting for freedom over the evil of oppression. Those of us who enjoy freedom need to stand in solidarity with those who are oppressed and seeking freedom. As I reflect on the events in the country of my birth some nearly 25 years ago—not that I was born 25 years ago, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, but the dismantling of the wall 25 years ago—we should take great comfort from the fact that the indomitable spirit of humankind seeking freedom will, and does, prevail. But it is such a very sad reflection that when those of us who enjoy freedom—enjoy all the comforts of life that freedom provides—are not willing to stand in solidarity and support those who suffer oppression as a result of dictatorships around the world.


I believe that many people around the world do celebrate the events of 9 November 1989, and may those celebrations last for a long, long time.
