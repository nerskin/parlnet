"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-05-09,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. This is a brief bill which has significant implications for the governance of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The bill gives effect to the announcement by Senator Coonan in March that the government would ‘restructure the ABC board’. The proposed restructure consists of just one measure—just the one—and that is the abolition of the position on the board that is held by a director elected by the ABC staff. So reform of the ABC board is nothing more than knocking off the ABC staff-elected position. This is a position that has been in place under Labor and coalition governments for the last 23 years.
The board of the ABC is a body charged with significant responsibilities. Any move to change its composition should be subjected to careful scrutiny. ABC directors are required to be the guardians and protectors of a national asset that has been built up by generations of Australians over more than 70 years. The board is charged with responsibility for ensuring that the ABC fulfils the charter given to it by this parliament. The board must retain the independence and integrity of the ABC. Importantly, it must also ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial.
Labor believes that the parliament should maximise the likelihood that those appointed to be directors of the ABC are capable of fulfilling these duties. That is the fundamental principle that underlies Labor’s approach to this debate on the ABC staff-elected director. Labor’s starting point is to ask how the removal of this long established position will help the ABC board to meet its responsibilities under the act. Let us look at the government’s stated rationale for this legislation. The government argues that the staff-elected director is subject to a potential conflict of interest. It contends that staff-elected directors may feel obliged to represent the interests of the people who elected them, rather than to act in the best interests of the ABC.
Senator Coonan has stated that the staff-elected position is an anomaly among Australian government boards. Relying on the Uhrig report on the corporate governance of statutory authorities and officeholders conducted in 2003, the minister argued that representational appointments were not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance. Let us be perfectly clear—Uhrig’s corporate governance foray was a sham. He came up with proposals that run contrary to corporate governance principles adopted all around the world. He was the government’s hatchet man to deliver what the government wanted, and his appointment, the process of his inquiry and his report were a failure of corporate governance.
With the support of the minor parties, Labor moved to have these claims examined by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. Despite considerable public interest in the issue and a break between parliamentary sittings of more than five weeks, the government deigned to permit only one day of public hearings into the bill. While the inquiry was brief, it was long enough to expose the government’s failure to make a convincing case supporting the abolition of the staff-elected director.
This is a bill driven by extreme ideology and a desire to control the ABC, rather than any genuine concern to improve the ABC’s corporate governance. How can you take this government seriously? It wants the ABC to be its plaything. It is not interested in corporate governance; it just wants to be able to tell the ABC what to do. Submissions to the inquiry, many from concerned ABC viewers and listeners, overwhelmingly opposed the bill. The proposition that the staff-elected directors suffer from a conflict of interest was shown in the inquiry process to be without foundation.
Section 8 of the ABC Act is quite clear that the obligations of all directors are the same, regardless of whether they are elected by the staff or hand picked by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. During the hearing the government failed to produce any evidence—not one skerrick—that staff-elected directors had failed to comply with their duties to the ABC. There are a range of provisions under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act and the ABC Act that are available to discipline directors who breach their duties. While there have been rumours and unsubstantiated innuendo about leaking, there has not been one case in which the Commonwealth has sought to discipline a staff-elected director using these provisions.
The current and three previous staff-elected directors who appeared before the committee all showed a clear understanding that it is not the role of the staff-elected director to represent the ABC staff on the board. The committee heard of a number of instances which clearly demonstrated the priority that staff-elected directors have given to their responsibilities under the act. For example, in 2002 Kirsten Garrett opposed a lucrative exclusive deal between the ABC and Telstra because it would have allowed Telstra to influence ABC production decisions. In the mid-1990s, Quentin Dempster opposed backdoor sponsorship arrangements that contravened the ABC Act. In both cases, the staff-elected directors resisted proposals benefiting ABC staff because they came at the cost of undermining the independence of the ABC.
As I stated earlier, the government has relied on the flawed Uhrig review and its warnings against representational appointments to government boards to support the changes contained in the bill. The Senate should also be aware, however, that Mr Uhrig did not examine governance arrangements at the ABC. He did not interview the chairman of the ABC, nor did he interview any past or present directors of the ABC. In fact, the terms of reference for the review required Mr Uhrig to focus on government agencies with:
... critical business relationships.
Organisations like the Australian Taxation Office, the ACCC, APRA, ASIC, the Reserve Bank, the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink were specifically named in the terms of reference. These are very different entities to the ABC. The ABC is a unique institution. The governance arrangements of the ABC should be based upon its special needs. As Professor Bartos from the National Institute of Governance told the Senate inquiry:
In governance terms, the choice of model to be adopted for a public sector body should not be static or formulaic, but be driven by the objectives of the organisation concerned.
There is no reason to expect that a template developed for agencies like the tax office or Centrelink will be appropriate for the national broadcaster.
Labor believes there is a strong case for retaining the staff-elected director position on the ABC board. Since its inception, this position has always been occupied by experienced public broadcasters. The evidence received by the Senate committee demonstrated that staff-elected directors have brought considerable experience in public broadcasting to the deliberations of the board. This is expertise that has been in short supply on the ABC board in the last decade. Since 1996, the government has repeatedly sought to fill board vacancies with its conservative cronies.
Last Friday, Quentin Dempster was elected to succeed Ramona Koval as the next staff-elected director on the ABC board. Mr Dempster has more than 20 years experience as a broadcaster working in the ABC. He has an Order of Australia for his services to the media. In addition, Mr Dempster already has experience on the ABC board, having served as a staff-elected director for four years in the 1990s. It is difficult to imagine a candidate with a more suitable CV to join the ABC board. If this bill passes, however, Mr Dempster will not be permitted to take up his recently elected position.
Why is the government so desperate to stop this happening? Why is this bill being rushed through the parliament? The answer may lie in the fact that Mr Dempster has been strongly critical of proposals to commercialise the ABC’s growing broadband content. While the ABC Act prohibits advertising on television and radio, this restriction does not apply to the internet. The minister has already stated her view that the introduction of advertising is a matter for the board. Abolishing the staff-elected position would remove a strong opponent to such changes. Of course, the commercialisation of internet content would not be in the interests of the ABC; it would undermine the ABC’s editorial independence. The ABC’s digital content creators must be free to produce material without worrying about offending the sponsors of the ABC website. The parliament should not lightly silence the voice of a strong defender of ABC independence.
Labor believes that the abolition of a staff-elected director’s position will have a significant detrimental impact on the effectiveness of the ABC board and undermine public perceptions of its independence. The staff-elected directors have a unique insight into ABC operations. They can play a key role in assisting the board to hold ABC management to account. One adverse consequence of the bill that the Senate is considering today is that the actions of the ABC management will receive less scrutiny than they did yesterday.
Senators can search for a sustainable policy justification for abolishing the staff-elected director, but they will search in vain. The truth is that this bill is not about improving the ABC’s corporate governance; it is just a further attempt by the government to undermine the independence of the ABC. The staff-elected position is just one position out of a possible nine on the ABC board. However, it is the only position that is beyond Prime Minister John Howard’s capacity to influence or control. That is why he has decided it has to go. Some Liberals understand the dangers of the government’s proposal. They also understand the real motivation for this bill. In March, former leader of the Liberal Party John Hewson wrote in the Australian Financial Review:
... the Government’s recent decision to stop staff electing a director of the ABC board is a churlish, pyrrhic victory for some of the ideologically-based antagonists in the Liberal Party and some of their sympathetic business mates.
John Hewson has called it as it is. He goes on to say:
It is clearly against the best interests of the institution and the listening and viewing public.
This is not the Labor Party, the unions or the Friends of the ABC making these comments; this is the former leader of the Liberal Party. Dr Hewson has been on a few boards in his time. He might know something about the key requirements of good corporate governance. I hope that there are some Liberal senators who will reflect on John Hewson’s comments and stop and think about where the government is going with these proposals.
This legislation is simply the latest instalment in the government’s decade long ideological crusade against the ABC. In its first budget in 1996, the government slashed ABC funding. These funds have never been fully restored. Today, the ABC has $51 million less in real terms to make programs than when John Howard came to office. Is it any wonder that, last year, the ABC was only able to broadcast 13 hours of locally produced drama? This is a national disgrace.
The extent to which the ABC has been underfunded was recently exposed when a draft version of the government’s own KPMG funding adequacy and efficiency report was leaked to the media. Let us be clear. The government brought in an outside audit company to have a look at the ABC and the claims that they were underfunded. KPMG found that the ABC needs an extra $125 million over the next three years just to maintain existing services. Tonight’s budget provides an opportunity to restore adequate funding to the ABC. The government is sitting on a surplus that some estimate to be more than $17 billion. The fact that the minister will not release the KPMG report, however, does not bode well. It suggests that the government wants to continue to hide the impact of its ideologically motivated funding squeeze on the ABC. Australians are increasingly realising that this is an arrogant government. They have almost total control of the parliament and they are increasingly intent on using that power to pursue ideological obsessions that are not shared by ordinary Australians.
The government is convinced that the ABC is plagued by left-wing bias, so it dispatches its stooges and cronies to the board to keep it in line. The Australian people do not share the government’s warped views. According to research conducted by Newspoll, 82 per cent of people believe that the ABC is balanced and even handed when reporting news and current affairs. That leaves 18 per cent; I guess they must all live on the other side of the chamber.
Labor does believe that the ABC board is in need of genuine reform. There is public concern about the ABC’s corporate governance, but it does not relate to the staff-elected director. After a decade of the Howard government, there is now a clear conservative bias in the board. Reforms are needed to strengthen public confidence in the independence of the ABC board.
There was a time when the Prime Minister claimed to understand the importance of an independent ABC. Back in 1995 he railed against appointments made by the Keating government. Back then, he lectured: ‘You not only must have a board that is completely politically neutral but it must be seen to be neutral.’ That was said by John Howard, the current Prime Minister of Australia. It would be interesting to hear how the Prime Minister thinks his appointments of conservative spear throwers like Michael Kroger, Ron Brunton and Janet Albrechtsen measure up against this criterion. What incredible hypocrisy!
John Howard was right back in 1995, but in this area, as in so many others, he has failed to live up to the principles he espoused in opposition. The current appointments process lacks transparency and is too politicised. Under current arrangements, the names of candidates are taken by the minister for communications to cabinet, but that is about all the public know about the process. How do people apply to fill a board vacancy? Is it simply a matter of having a Liberal Party membership form? What criteria are used to assess candidates? Do you have to be a member of the right club? Does it help if you have donated money to the Liberal Party? Clearly, that is what the Reserve Bank board process has been. It certainly seems to help if you have been a conservative cultural warrior.
Labor believes that there needs to be real reform of the appointments process to guarantee the independence of the ABC board and the expertise of its members. Since 2003, Labor has supported an independent merits based appointments process for ABC and SBS board vacancies. The process is based on the so-called Nolan rules that were developed in the UK and govern appointments to the BBC. Appointments to the ABC board must be open and transparent. Vacancies should be publicly advertised. There should be clear merit based selection criteria.
Labor’s policy provides for an independent selection panel to undertake a proper shortlist selection process. In stark contrast to current arrangements, the selection of the shortlist would be independent of the minister. Under Labor’s model, the minister would be free to nominate someone not on the list, but there would be a political price to pay. The minister would be required to table in parliament a formal statement of the reasons for selecting a candidate who was not on the shortlist. The publicity surrounding such a move makes it extremely unlikely that any government would pursue this option. I have to say, though, that on the form of this government, it would be prepared to be so arrogant that it would do it, anyway.
Labor’s policy would not exclude people previously involved in politics from serving on the ABC board. It would ensure, however, that they had the skills to do the job. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-05-09,"—The first staff-elected position on the governing body of the ABC was introduced by the Whitlam government in 1975, 31 years ago, and was subsequently abolished by the Fraser government. Since 1986, under both coalition and Labor governments, the board of the ABC has included a director elected by the staff as legislated under the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983.
The staff-elected director is one of a maximum of nine directors. Up to seven members of the board are appointed by the government, and the managing director is appointed by the board. The staff-elected director is the only democratically elected position. All the others are appointments.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 proposes to abolish the staff-elected position. The Democrats believe that the decision to remove the staff-elected ABC board member is bad politics, bad public policy and bad corporate governance. It is bad politics because it exposes a nasty prejudice; it is bad public policy because an experienced staff member provides invaluable skills and insights to the board; and it is bad corporate governance because not only is that ABC board member the only appointment on merit through democratic election, but in Europe, and in many companies overseas, staff membership of boards is common because it is so useful.
As stated in the Labor, Greens and Democrats minority report on the bill, the Democrats believe that the bill will adversely impact on the performance of the ABC board and will further undermine public confidence in the independence of the ABC. The Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, in his second reading speech on the bill, argued that:
The position of a staff-elected Director is not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance and a tension relating to the position on the ABC Board has existed for many years.
This tension is manifested in the potential conflict that exists between the duties of the staff-elected Director under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to act in good faith in the best interests of the ABC, and the appointment of that Director as a representative of ABC staff and elected by them. The election method creates a risk that a staff-elected Director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC where they are in conflict.
I venture to suggest that the minister knows very little about international corporate governance. If he did, he would know that staff-elected directors are not uncommon and are a useful feature of the way in which boards operate internationally.
As was noted in the joint minority report, while the method of appointment of the staff-elected director differs from that of other non-executive directors, the ABC Act is quite clear that the duties and responsibilities are the same for all directors. On the theory that the government is putting forward, a Liberal Party member appointed by the government will be beholden to the Liberal Party that appointed him. That is the argument it is offering regarding the election of a staff-elected director—that that staff-elected director is beholden to the staff that elected them. If that is so, the Liberal Party appointed member is beholden to the Liberal Party. I think that is a slur on some of those persons who have been appointed.
This recommendation comes from a government that has done nothing about the patronage in companies that applies when directors are elected. Full independence of a director is only possible when the method of appointment and election is objective, on merit and not subject to patronage, favour or inducements, and where objective, fair and consistent separation or contract ending mechanisms exist.
The board of a company is the central institution in the relationship between shareholders and the company, stakeholders generally and auditors specifically. It is self-evident that many boards, directors and companies operate to high standards, but it is the task of legislation to attend to those who do not and to appraise the public interest. Companies have such an effect on our society that serious weaknesses in Corporations Law should be attended to, and a major weakness lies in the director election processes, to which the government has paid absolutely no attention. Regrettably, the election of directors is often either deliberately or effectively rigged in favour of dominant shareholder interests. I am told that 52 per cent of ASX corporations have a single dominant shareholder and many of the rest have a few dominant shareholders.
Such dominant shareholders frequently control the boards of our companies through their voting power. That means that many and perhaps most directors are directly placed by or under the patronage of a dominant shareholder or shareholders, who will quite naturally seek to ensure that their interests are put first. This dominance and patronage over many directors is reinforced by company constitutions and board behaviour that allow or foster poor director election processes. We have got exactly the same problem with appointments by the government to these boards. It is a question of patronage and the real problem the government has with a staff-elected director is, of course, that that staff-elected director is not subject to their patronage.
The Bills Digest notes that neither the ABC Act nor the CAC Act require or give the imprimatur to staff-elected board members to favour the interests of their constituents. Whether staff representatives make a practice of prosecuting the interests of staff may be moot, but it is clear that the legal duty and the actual practice of such board members has not been to their constituents but to the organisation more generally. Those duties are set out in the ABC Act and the CAC Act.
The CAC Act sets out the duties of directors such as reporting obligations. It also imposes duties. These include duties of care and diligence, the duty to act in good faith, the duty not to misuse the officer’s position and the duty not to misuse information. No staff-elected director has ever contravened those duties because the boards would have taken action if they had done so and it would have been brought to the attention of the board.
The Bills Digest concludes that the statutory duty of a staff-elected representative is not to the staff specifically, any more than it is for the other board members. Therefore a staff-elected board member who places the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC as a whole would be in breach of their duties under the legislation as it currently stands. The statutory duty of the staff-elected director was reconfirmed by a past director, a current director and a would-be future staff-elected director. The Bills Digest notes that former staff-elected director Kirsten Garrett, who was a staff representative on the ABC board from 1996-2000, said that the argument that the staff position created an untenable conflict was unfounded. She said:
Once he or she enters the boardroom, the staff-elected director is answerable to the charter of the ABC and the Australian community. You are informed by staff but you are in fact an executive director of the board and must behave as such, that is independently. The staff-elected director is accountable in exactly the same way as other directors.
Current staff-elected director Romana Koval said in her recent Staff-Elected Director’s Report no. 11:
Contrary to the Minister’s view, there has never been uncertainty about the accountability of the staff-elected director to the ABC Board. I am required to act in the best interests of the ABC, as are all other directors, and it’s a serious responsibility that I have carried out with passionate commitment
In an open letter to senators, the nominee for the staff-elected director position who has been elected by them, Quentin Dempster, had this to say:
The position of staff-elected director has prevailed since the creation of the corporation ... the primary purpose was to bring to the board table knowledge and expertise of broadcasting existing within the corporation’s creative program makers and staff …
                  …         …         …
The method of appointment by Electoral Commission ballot of all the corporation’s employees may imply a constituency but the Act clearly states the director appointed—
or elected—
by this method is bound by the Act’s clauses covering duties of directors.
As the joint minority report notes, a number of examples were cited where staff-elected directors argued against initiatives that would have directly benefited staff because they would have undermined the ABC’s independence. There is no evidence that the staff-elected director does not understand their legal responsibilities; there is no evidence that the person in this position has not acted in the best interests of the ABC; and there is no evidence that staff who elect the director have asked or expected the director to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC. Some people have argued that there is evidence that government appointed board members have been behaving with the interests of the government in mind. I do not know if that is true or not, but it has been said.
Minister Minchin also noted in his second reading speech that abolishing this position is consistent with the findings of the Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, also known as the Uhrig review. I have read Mr Uhrig’s report and recommendations and I am not inclined to bow down to them as wisdom from the mount because they are hardly that. In reading his report, I think he has had a fairly channelled and very Australian view and he needs to widen it to look at global trends and how international corporate governance operates. International corporate governance is seeking to introduce more independence, not less, into directorships and board positions and to represent a wider range of interests. It is very common in many overseas corporations and entities for staff-elected directors or people who represent their constituency to be on boards. Mr Uhrig, despite his name, which I suspect might be of a German origin, has not attended to, for instance, the German precedents.
The minister said that the position of a staff-elected director is uncommon amongst Australian government agency boards. While the minister’s statement may be true, it does not then stand to reason that there should not be a staff-elected position or that Australia uses the best governance models. For companies in Europe and in many other countries, representatives of staff are commonly included on boards because the practice is so useful. Professor Stephen Bartos, director of the National Institute for Governance, who has a great deal of experience as a former senior executive within the Department of Finance and Administration, in his submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill noted that:
... staff-elected directors on a Board do represent an anomaly amongst Australian public and private sector boards in general governance terms—although ours is not a universally accepted governance model. In the CCH article cited earlier, I comment: ‘In Australia, the whole Anglo-American model of governance doesn’t favour representative positions on boards. However, it’s not the case around the world. There are other countries where representative positions are much more common ...’
This is a country where we are continually asked to look for international precedents on such things as tax, intellectual property and the way in which research and development is operated. We are a country that is trying to take the best of globalisation but, in this area, we remain steadfastly committed to a peculiarly narrow perspective.
As the Bills Digest to this bill notes, there are in fact other Commonwealth statutory organisations in Australia with staff-elected positions on their governing bodies, including the Australian National University, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. Furthermore, many public bodies have a variety of other kinds of representational appointments, including departmental, industry, interest group, community and regional appointments.
Professor Bartos also observed:
In governance terms, the choice of model to be adopted for a public sector body should not be static or formulaic, but be driven by the objectives of the organisation concerned.
As was stated in the joint minority report, we believe that, given that the objectives of the ABC include the maintenance of independence, it is appropriate for a staff-elected director to sit alongside government appointed directors. Professor Bartos went on to say:
While there are both advantages and disadvantages of representative board positions, the final decision on an appropriate governance structure depends on where legislators see the ABC as situated in the broader map of the broadcasting industry. As I noted in my interview on the subject, if one sees the ABC “as operating in the same space as other television and radio stations, having a governance structure like them is probably rational and reasonable. If you conceive of the ABC as being somehow some sort of different community-based body, you’ll see having representative directors onboard as being more reasonable.”
The ABC is unique. The ABC is an important part of our democracy. It provides a lifeline to regional Australia, informed current affairs reporting, vital contributions to Australia’s culture and the provision of Australian content. Public funding means that the ABC does not have the same commercial pressures of other broadcasters, but it also has far greater constraints than other broadcasters because it is dependent on the government of the day for its funding.
The ABC is allowed to provide diverse programming and maintain its independence and journalistic integrity through its structure. The staff-elected director brings to the board the knowledge and expertise of broadcasting that exists within the corporation’s creative program makers, management and staff and the views of the Australian communities they work in.
The government has perversely claimed that an elected position is less accountable than an appointed one. This claim, however, is counterintuitive, because at present no other ABC board member, apart from the staff member, is democratically elected. That is in complete contrast to the major commercial media organisations. The other board appointments are made by the government of the day and are often made with partisan political criteria and patronage ideas in mind.
The interesting thing, of course, when you exercise patronage in appointing people is that you often find that the people surprise everybody and act in a way that is to their credit and contrary to the intention with which they were appointed. Many of those appointed under government patronage have actually turned out to be pretty good directors and have done rather well, as is shown by the Chairman of the ABC, who has not turned out to be anybody’s puppet.
There are no public advertisements for ABC board positions, no objective panels for selection and no published criteria for board selection. These are all weaknesses with the appointment process. Consequently, even the best ABC board members labour under the slur of being fellow travellers of the government of the day and of being fifth columnists trying to subvert the ABC charter of independence. Even where that is not true, that slur would be better countered by objective panels for selection and published criteria for board selection, which would allow people of merit to be on the board. At present, there is a widespread public perception that government appointments result in patronage to well remunerated positions. This perception can damage the reputation of these bodies, and indeed of the directors so appointed, as in the public eye they are seen as being controlled by persons who lack the appropriate independence and who have a political objective.
As I have noted many times in this chamber before and in the Democrats’s additional comments to the Senate committee report on this bill, this issue was extensively investigated by the Nolan committee appointed by the United Kingdom parliament, which in 1995 set out the following principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments: a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selection on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards that include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds that are sought should be clearly specified.
The United Kingdom government fully accepted the committee’s recommendations at the time and have maintained those principles and appointments. The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in the UK was subsequently created, with a similar level of independence from the government as the Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. The Democrats have used the Nolan committee’s recommendations in our persistent and long-term campaign for appointment-on-merit amendments in various items of legislation, because they are tried and tested. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability.
While some may appreciate the irony that, in a bill that proposes to remove the only democratically elected position to a board, the Democrats propose to move an appointment-on-merit amendment, even though we know that this government will reject for the 31st time at least—I suspect it is more—the idea of appointments on merit and the ideas on which the Nolan principles are pronounced. That is to their eternal discredit. They cannot even match up to the UK on this fundamental issue.
I am not sure what pushing this boat all the time makes me: stubborn and idealistic or someone who truly values government accountability and transparency. But I do hope that, one day, a future government may in fact bring these rules in.
In conclusion, as stated in the joint minority report, this bill comes after a decade where the ABC has been chronically underfunded and follows the appointment of a series of conservative members of the board to the ABC. The staff-elected position on the board is the sole remaining voice not directly appointed by the government and is the one position on the board that is beyond the government’s capacity to influence or control. It is no wonder that these control freaks are trying to remove it. The Democrats believe the ABC belongs to all Australians and the ABC board must contain people with a wide variety of experience and skills in broadcasting, journalism and communications to ensure that ‘Aunty’ can provide the range and depth of programming and the independence of views that its charter mandates.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-05-09,"—The Greens will be opposing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. If you look at the committee that inquired into this bill, you will find 55 submissions—53 opposed the bill and two were neutral. When you look at the government’s rationale for this bill as expressed in this place on 29 March, you will find that Senator Minchin argued:
... a staff-elected Director is uncommon amongst Australian Government agency boards.
He said it is not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance, creates tensions on the ABC board and creates an expectation that a staff-elected director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her to put their interests ahead of those of the ABC where they are in conflict. He also referred to the findings of the Uhrig review in relation to representational appointments to governing boards and stated:
There is a clear legal requirement on the staff-elected Director that means he or she has the same rights and duties as the other Directors, which includes acting in the interests of the ABC as a whole.
In arguing the response of the Australian Greens to this bill, I will address each of the following in turn: the alleged uncommonness of the role and its supposed inconsistency with modern governance; the creation of so-called tension on the board and the so-called expectations of constituents and whether this creates a conflict of interest; and the relevance of the findings of the Uhrig report on the issue of whether the board position is representational. Then I will talk about the independence of the ABC.
Firstly, I would like to look at existing legal requirements. There is already a legal requirement for board members to act in the best interests of the ABC, which is backed up by civil penalties. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the CAC Act, requires board members to:
... make the judgment in good faith for a proper purpose and does not have material personal interest in the subject matter of the judgment and informs himself or herself about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent that he or he reasonably believes to be appropriate and rationally believes that the judgment is in the best interests of the Commonwealth authority.
No evidence was presented to the inquiry or in this place that the staff-elected director ever acted contrary to these requirements, and if the government had such evidence they should act upon it—in other words, they should put their money where their mouth is. We believe that these civil penalties are sufficient to deal with any inappropriate behaviour by the staff-elected director should it arise. I would like to point out that we do not think it has ever arisen, but that the government has the power to take action as it is.
Is their argument that there is a public perception of bias? I think the argument is that there is a public perception of bias by the appointees from the government. Is this consistent with other practices? I would like to look at the statement about it being uncommon among Australian government agency boards and that it is not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance. A number of submissions presented evidence to the inquiry that staff-elected or stakeholder-nominated board members are consistent with practice elsewhere, including public companies, universities, some government statutory authorities, and exclusive private schools. There is the ANU—also Oxford and Cambridge—the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Mercedes Benz, the film schools, Canberra Girls Grammar, the fishing industry, Australia Post, Defence Housing Authority and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. All of these also seem to be travelling quite well with stakeholder representation.
Employee participation is arguably a well-established principle of good management, and many Australian government boards go to great lengths to ensure industry participation. Why not other participation? There is a wide diversity of practice in corporate governance. In fact, Uhrig stated:
It is not surprising that there is no universally agreed definition of corporate governance, just as there are no universally accepted structures and practices that constitute good governance.
We would argue that there are no precedents for removing this position and that good governance depends on how the board runs and what the requirements are of the company or structure that that board is managing. As Uhrig points out, there is no standard form for good governance. We argue that the current staff-elected director position is in fact essential to running an organisation of the nature of the ABC.
The Uhrig review was very specific to the areas of taxation regulation and the provision of services in response to complaints about the ACCC and the ATO treating big businesses unfairly. The ABC is a completely different class of statutory authority to those examined by Uhrig. The terms of reference of the Uhrig review were concerned with regulatory and service delivery authorities. In Uhrig’s own words, the review was very ‘practical’ in focus, and its key findings stem from ‘the outcome of consultations with key participants’. Neither the ABC nor any other federally legislated bodies with elected directors were considered or consulted. It is inappropriate to stretch its findings to the ABC.
Uhrig carefully qualified his findings and made it clear he was referring to the problems caused by representational appointments, not elected ones: in the private sector in relation to representatives of a parent company to the board of a subsidiary and in the public sector in relation to the appointment of public servants as departmental or government representatives. It is misleading to equate and confuse Uhrig’s comments and examples of representational appointments with the issue of stakeholder directorships. The election of a stakeholder position does not equate with a representational role.
That leads us on to the question of whether this is a representative role. The evidence presented by a range of stakeholders, including current and former staff-elected directors, made it very clear that the role is not seen as representational. Numerous examples were presented of situations where the staff-elected director had put the best interests of the ABC ahead of those of the staff, for example in the Telstra deal. When we questioned all the staff-elected directors who appeared before the committee during the inquiry, it was very clear that they knew what their obligations were and that they had acted in the best interests of the ABC at all times. This was backed up, as I said, by communications from the staff-elected directors to the ABC staff, which clearly spelt out that the role is not representational.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the ABC Act, made it very clear that the staff-elected director has no role to represent the interests of ABC employees to the board. The minister’s talk of expectations of constituents is particularly misleading in this context, and this is remarked upon in the dissenting report from the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens. We also made a comment about the attack on Ms Koval which appears in the majority report. It is extremely disappointing that the majority report criticises Ms Koval, particularly about her refusal to sign the ABC board protocol. In fact that refusal clearly demonstrated her independence, and she clearly outlined the reasons why she did not feel it was appropriate to sign the protocol.
That takes me on to the issue of conflict of interest. Evidence to the committee contradicted this claim. All previous staff-elected directors stated that the role is not a representational one and that they had been at pains to exercise their independence and to communicate this to ABC employees. No examples of particular conflicts of interest were presented. There is a requirement for all board members to declare any potential conflict of interest. This is good governance and this is a requirement for all members of the ABC board.
The issue of tension was also raised. It was claimed that having a staff-elected director on the board would cause tension. You would expect tension on any good governance board. Surely directors are never of one single mind, in any circumstances. Surely, as long as the interests of the ABC are put first and any conflicts of interest are declared, some tension between board members who have different ideas and are willing to discuss them is in fact in the best interests of the corporation. Having dynamic tension is creative. I do not believe that having a staff-elected director is any different from having anybody else on the board with a difference of opinion. Different perspectives encourage creativity and healthy debate.
Now I would like to talk quickly about the reasons for having a staff-elected director. Having argued why we believe that there is no problem with conflict of interest with the role and why existing legal requirements and civil penalties are sufficient to deal with any past or future inappropriate behaviour, I would like to look at the positive sides of having a staff-elected director.
The duties of the ABC board, as has been articulated before, are to ensure that the corporation output is of maximum benefit to the people of Australia, to maintain the independence and integrity of the ABC and to benchmark the accuracy and impartiality of news and information presentation by the recognised standards of objective journalism. The ABC is statutorily required to provide broadcasting services which are innovative and comprehensive, contribute to a sense of Australian identity and are entertaining, informative and educational. It is also required to encourage the performing arts in Australia and encourage awareness of Australia and Australian affairs within and outside Australia.
The point is that the requirements of the public broadcaster, as I have just articulated in terms of program quality and statutory requirements, are very different from those of a commercial broadcaster. Producing quality broadcasting is heavily reliant on the particular knowledge and skills of the ABC staff and their commitment to the ABC’s mission. The ABC must foster its creative human resources and monitor the breadth and quality of its output. It needs to ensure that there is broadcasting experience, particularly public broadcasting experience, on the board. Previous staff-elected directors have been experienced broadcasters who have brought valuable insights into policy issues and have been frequently called on by the board to share their experience. Kirsten Garrett, a former staff-elected director, said:
It is rare for other directors have a working knowledge of the dynamics of journalism or program making.
I would like now to turn to independence from political interference. Recent appointments have been blatantly political. The loss of a staff-elected director means that the actions of the ABC management are likely to receive less scrutiny. We need a position on the board which is beyond government’s capacity to influence or control. There is a strong public perception that this bill represents an ideologically motivated attack on the ABC. The ABC has been chronically underfunded for years. ABC historian Professor Inglis has said:
The ABC is bound to broadcast information and opinion useful and harmful to people in public life. More particularly, the ABC accommodates criticisms, sometimes severe, of the government on which it depends for revenue, and that is bound to be a rich source of conflict.
It is absolutely essential that we have independent people on the ABC board, and the only way at the moment that we can as a nation ensure that is by having a staff-elected director. That staff-elected director is at least one person who has shown independence, who has been willing to stand up and ensure that the charter of the ABC is maintained.
The Greens are deeply concerned that there is a real risk that the strength of ABC Online and the incredible diversity of its content will result in a push for the ABC board to enter into commercial agreements with such things as search engines, for example, or some other online provider and to more generally go down the line of commercial exploitation of the ABC’s content. We are deeply concerned that this commercial exploitation will further push and ignore the charter of the ABC. A number of us are deeply concerned about the commercialisation that has taken place at SBS and that the SBS charter has been further marginalised. We are deeply concerned that, with the loss of the staff-elected director, the ABC will be pursuing this line.
We believe that the process for appointments to the ABC board needs to be open and transparent. As was articulated in the dissenting report:
There should be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. Vacancies should be advertised and there should be clear merit-based selection criteria.
An independent selection panel should conduct the shortlist selection process.
If the Minister does not appoint a short-listed candidate he or she should be required to table in Parliament a formal statement of the reasons for departing from the shortlist.
We heard overwhelmingly in the committee that it is a bad idea to take away the staff-elected director position. We will oppose this legislation. We believe it is really about making the ABC less independent. We urge the government not only to reconsider this position but also to put in place a much more open and transparent process to make our ABC really independent and to maintain the quality that we believe is essential and which all Australia is looking for from the ABC.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-05-09,"—The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 has the effect of abolishing the position of staff-elected director on the ABC board. The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee has held an inquiry into the provisions of the bill in the last few weeks. The committee received submissions from 59 organisations and individuals and held a public hearing here in Canberra.
Abolishing the position of staff-elected director is consistent with the findings of Uhrig’s review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. The Uhrig review stated that it is opposed to representational appointments on boards because they:
... can fail to produce independent and objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing.
The review goes on to observe that the preferred position is not to create circumstances where a conflict of interest might arise. Members of the Senate will therefore, I am sure, understand that the position of staff-elected director does not accord with modern principles of corporate governance in that there is a potential conflict between the duties of the staff-elected director, under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, to act in good faith in the best interests of the ABC and the appointment of that director as a result of a process of election by the staff.
There is, without any doubt, an inherent risk that a staff-elected director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her—in this case, the staff of the ABC—to place their interests ahead of the overall interests of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This inherent conflict of interest was noted by the Chairman of the ABC, Mr Donald McDonald, when he stated:
Inevitably there has been a tension between the expectations placed by others on their role—
meaning the staff director—
and their established duties as directors of a corporation.
The committee received evidence that staff sometimes have expectations of the staff-elected director which do not accord with his or her role as the director of the corporation. The incumbent staff-elected director, Ms Ramona Koval, for example, refused to sign the ABC board protocol outlining the governance arrangements of the board. This protocol is viewed as important to the effective operation of the board, especially in the light of alleged leaks of confidential board information. In particular, it raises concerns about the ability of staff-elected directors to act in the best interests of the ABC and, in doing so, to act in a manner that places the interests of the ABC above those of the staff who elected them.
The committee received submissions expressing concern that the absence of a staff-elected director will compromise the independence and integrity of the ABC, but the arguments put were not supported by any compelling evidence to this effect. In fact, all members of the board will still be required to act in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, which charge the board and its members with the responsibility of maintaining the independence and integrity of the corporation. Moreover, in the absence of a staff-elected director, there will still be a member of the board not appointed by the government—this being the managing director of the ABC, who is a full member of the board and is appointed by the board rather than by the government.
The committee also received evidence that the staff-elected director brings broadcasting expertise and experience to the board. The implication seemed to be that that was the only means by which the board could be provided with information about broadcasting in its various dimensions. But there are of course other methods of bringing such knowledge and information to the board, such as by bringing in experts or seeking the opinions of consultants where necessary. This view also ignores the broadcasting experience of other board members—including Mr John Gallagher QC and Mr Steven Skala on the current board—all of whom have quite substantial experience in the television and broadcasting industries.
The ABC chairman, Mr Donald McDonald, has acknowledged that the interests of the staff will not be neglected in the absence of a staff-elected director. In particular, the managing director is a full member of the ABC board and he acts as a conduit between staff, management and the board, so the interests, needs and requirements of the staff of the ABC have a process through the managing director by which their views can be expressed and brought to the attention of the board.
This bill, in restructuring the board of the ABC, will ensure that it operates within modern principles of corporate governance and accountability. The staff-elected director faces, in the government’s opinion, an inherent conflict of interest. As the Uhrig review has noted, it is better not to create situations in which conflicts of interest can arise. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-05-09,"—The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 is nothing more than a continuation of the standard Howard government attack on our public broadcaster. The explanation for the bill is simply what we have come to expect from this government and its attack on the ABC. The excuse that the government gives for this new manipulation of the ABC’s board is that a potential conflict of interest exists in the duties of the staff-elected director, basically because they are elected rather than appointed to their position.
The minister announced the move by the government to impose this change during the Commonwealth Games. The existence of the position of staff-elected director to the board provides for the presence of staff expertise on the board. This staff-elected director gives the ABC board a vital insight into the day-to-day operations of our national broadcaster. Interestingly enough, in the 2001 report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee entitledMethods of appointment to the ABC board, in response to a recommendation, government senators stated:
There has been no suggestion that the position of the staff-elected director will be abolished.
Now the government has changed its mind. It changed it with the Senate majority.
The basis for the government’s logic in this theory of doing away with the position comes from their loose interpretation of the Uhrig review, which suggests that representational appointments to boards carry a risk. This is where Senator Coonan just does not get it. The position is elected by the ABC staff. The position is occupied by a member of the ABC staff. But it is not a position that represents the individual concerns of ABC staff. The staff-elected board members know this. Current and former directors stated it on record during the recent Senate inquiry. The directors know that they are there to serve the best interests of the ABC as a collective operation.
The government also relies heavily on the submission of Professor Stephen Bartos, yet Professor Bartos did not exactly tell the government what they wanted to hear either. If anything, his submission encouraged the position. He claims that ‘the choice of model to be adopted for a public sector body should not be static or formulaic’—it should not be standard or rigid. Professor Bartos adds to this by saying that public bodies should be ‘driven by the objectives of the organisation concerned’. In simple terms, he is saying that a unique organisation such as the ABC is benefited by having a wide-ranging composition of professionals on its board of directors.
The staff-elected director on the board of the ABC brings broadcasting experience to a select group which oversees the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The staff elect this person from among their peers because they are highly skilled, with a significant broadcasting knowledge base. They do not elect them on the basis that they will take all the individual problems of the staff to other members of the board. That is simply not their role. Senators opposite dismiss this and do not believe it to be important.
They seem to think that if the board is not sure about a decision relating to broadcasting then they will just outsource the question: ‘Ask an expert. Call in a consultant.’ How are the board members supposed to know what is relevant and what is not if they do not have the broadcasting knowledge? If they do not have an understanding of the day-to-day operational requirements of our national broadcaster, how are they to know when they should be consulting an expert? How do they know the questions they should be asking when they do not have the current knowledge of broadcasting that the staff-elected director brings to the board? We have, for our benefit, an example of just such a situation.
In submissions to the committee inquiry into this bill, there were a number of examples of the benefits that the staff-elected director position creates. Of particular note was a submission from the immediate past president of Friends of the ABC South Australia, Mr Darce Cassidy. Mr Cassidy worked for the ABC for 33 years, with his last position being that of managing director’s representative for South Australia. He highlighted an example where a former staff-elected director, Mr Tom Molomby, who served on the board from 1983 to 1987, used his position in the best interests of the ABC even though it proved to be unpopular with the staff. Not only did Molomby not support a move that was considered popular by staff but his understanding of the operational aspects of the organisation enabled him at one of his early board meetings to raise an issue that would have otherwise been overlooked.
In the early 1980s, the ABC in Melbourne was readying itself to move to outer East Burwood. This move was very popular with many members of the ABC staff because it was close to where they lived and meant that they would only have a short trip to work each day. Mr Molomby, however, used his professional knowledge and judgment with great distinction. I would like to read an extract from Mr Molomby’s book, which is quoted in Mr Cassidy’s submission, to allow the chamber to reflect on this judgment and how it directly affected major operations within the Melbourne bureau. Mr Molomby stated:
It was in my view a wholly impractical location from which to conduct radio in particular. Traveling time from there to the most frequently required locations for interviews and research would be enormous, and some outsiders would be reluctant to come so far …
He went on to say:
I outlined my reservations briefly to the Board and they agreed with me immediately … it seems to me that the only possible decision was in accordance with the operational interests of the organisation, bearing in mind that its effect would be of indefinite duration.
The East Burwood project was stopped, and we set about exploring locations close to the city.
Mr Molomby’s knowledge and understanding of the operational requirements of the ABC, and his foresight, saved the ABC board from making a serious mistake. Eventually, the ABC’s Melbourne operations were consolidated at Southbank, in the city. I hope that senators opposite are taking note of this, because it is fair to say that this situation probably saved the ABC—and therefore the taxpayers—millions of dollars.
That staff-elected director used his broadcasting knowledge and understanding of the ABC and saved probably millions of dollars for Australian taxpayers. What logic: get rid of a position which has already, by its very existence, saved millions of dollars. This example from Mr Cassidy’s submission is in direct contrast with the reasons the minister has given for the abolition of the position. It is directly opposite. I will quote from the explanatory memorandum to the bill. It reads:
The election method creates a risk that a staff-elected Director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC …
Yet Mr Molomby not only placed the interests of the ABC ahead of those of staff but also saved the corporation from a fiscal and logistical disaster. The explanatory memorandum, circulated by authority of the Hon. Helen Coonan, rubs more salt into the wound with its financial impact statement. It reads:
The Bill is not expected to have a significant financial impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.
Well, Minister, that is not what history tells us.
If coalition senators were to read through the submissions made to the inquiry, they would see other examples of where the persons occupying the position of staff-elected directors have played significant and positive roles on the board. They would have to feel embarrassed about supporting this bill, knowing that the reason the government is putting forward for abolishing such a position is not, in reality, justified. Its reason of conflict of interest is casting a shadow over what many believe to be the real reason for the government moving to abolish the position of staff-elected director on the board—that is, that the position of staff-elected director is the one position that the government does not have control or influence over.
In the minority report of the inquiry into the bill, submitted by Labor, Greens and Democrats senators, concern was expressed about the overall state of the ABC as a collective operation. I would like to expand on this for a minute, because this is at the core of this bill’s intentions. The composition and method of appointment of the board is central to the ailments of the national broadcaster, and there are few areas left of the ABC that are not soaked in conservative bilge water. The ABC is one of the last great public institutions that has seen Australians through some of our darkest hours and united us in moments of triumph. It is a symbol of independent thought and transparency in a free society. A strong, independent media is a dying entity. The capacities, rights and strengths of genuine fourth estate journalism are in grave danger.
It was World Press Freedom Day last Thursday and the Australian Press Council used the day to air concerns about the state of the media. The chairman, Professor Ken McKinnon had this to say about the Howard government’s contempt for a free press:
During Prime Minister Howard’s regime, the Commonwealth has centralised power to an unprecedented degree and used the buzzword ‘security’ to erect a seamless protective wall around information flows.
Professor McKinnon does not exactly mince his words in his criticism, and the irony is not lost on me. The government does not care about the loose and unfounded allegations about the board’s composition. The duties of the board stipulated in section 8 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act are quite clear about what is required from a board member.
There are nine positions on the ABC board, and they are filled by people who come from many different professional backgrounds. They all know that they are bound by the board’s protocol. It does not matter if their background is in civil and criminal law, as is the case with board member John Gallagher QC; or if they are the Chairman of Film Australia Limited, as is board member Steven Skala; or if they have a broadcasting background, like Ms Koval or the incumbent, Mr Dempster. They are all bound by the protocols, rules, directives—call them what you will; they are all bound by them. And it should be considered an asset to have a career broadcaster as part of the board structure.
During the Senate inquiry into this bill, there were a number of attacks on the integrity of the current staff-elected director. Prior to this there had been numerous other accusations about the staff-elected director by the government. If Senator Coonan had proof that any member of the ABC board was not upholding the protocols of the board, she had, and still has today, the power to remove them. If Senator Coonan believes that the current staff-elected director is in breach then she could enact section 18(1) of the ABC Act. Section 18(1) enables the Governor-General to remove—on advice from the government, of course—a misbehaving non-executive director from office. Aside from that, we all know it is relatively easy to sack people in Australia today. I do not really understand why the government need to go to the lengths of removing the entire position simply because they are not happy with the person currently tenured.
We know that is not the case, and again I state what to many is obvious. The truth is that the Howard government have introduced this bill because this is the one position on the ABC board that they cannot fill, cannot influence and cannot control. It is a simple equation really: if you cannot manipulate a board position—if you cannot fill it, if you cannot control it—what do you do? You get rid of it. That is really what this entire debate is about. It is about the Howard government’s calculated crusade to change our ABC and mould it into what they want—that is, a media outlet that will tell them what they want to hear and will not be critical of their agenda. It is a crusade that they have been waging against the broadcaster for many years now. The government have numerous fronts in this crusade; they are removing any existing traces of independent media on one front and opening up the market to those with the fattest chequebooks on the other.
I conclude by saying that the Australian Broadcasting Amendment Bill 2006 is not in the best interests of the Australian public, not in the best interests of free speech and not in the best interests of our national broadcaster. I will finish by letting the chamber reflect on the following comment by esteemed 20th century journalist Walter Lippmann:
The press is no substitute for institutions. It is like the beam of a searchlight that moves restlessly about, bringing one episode and then another out of darkness into vision. Men cannot do the work of the world by this light alone. They cannot govern society by episodes, incidents, and eruptions. It is only when they work by a steady light of their own, that the press, when it is turned upon them, reveals a situation intelligible enough for a popular decision. The theory of the free press is not that the truth will be presented completely or perfectly in any one instance but that the truth will emerge from free discussion.
Although this is a free discussion, the arrogance of this government ensures that we are seeing a narrow, ideological shadow covering the landscape. It is a shroud that is being imposed on us. The ABC Amendment Bill 2006 is another example of Howard’s way, with no redeeming features. Labor believes that there should be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. At the present time, the staff-elected position is the one position that fulfils this criterion.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-05-09,"—I would like to commence my remarks on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. I believe this bill demonstrates this federal government’s complete inability to deal with independence of thought and action. It would seem that this is a government, and this is a minister, that is afraid of any form of dissent, so it has to legislate it out of being. This is a government that cannot handle alternative points of view or independence of action—a government so drunk with power, some would say, so overwhelmed by its own importance and so arrogant about the power given to it by its numbers in this place that it believes it can do what it likes without recourse to what is fair, what is decent or what is honourable.
This bill, as has been said by my colleagues earlier, will remove the position of the staff-elected director from the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act at the moment states that the board of the ABC will consist of the managing director, the staff-elected director and no fewer than five and no more than seven other directors. This amendment will remove the staff-elected director from the board of the ABC.
What reasons has the government put forward to justify this action? The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, claimed on 24 March this year:
 As the staff-elected Director has been elected by staff rather than appointed, there have been claims that the position creates uncertainty about accountability.
To quote a television presenter from another network—using a well-known saying in the Australian vernacular these days—‘What the?’ The minister’s suggestion that, because a director is elected by staff as opposed to appointed by the minister, it makes their accountability uncertain is surely one that should make the annals of Australia’s most ridiculous assertions. The minister’s suggestion that a person appointed by the minister is more accountable than a person elected by the employees of an organisation is farcical. How does the method of a director’s appointment to a board determine their accountability? The method of a director’s appointment to a board does not determine that person’s accountability to the minister, the staff or the good of the corporation.
It is clear from all sides of this argument that there are clearly defined legal responsibilities, as alluded to earlier in this debate, that a director must undertake. In fact, the minister also said on 24 March this year:
However, there is a clear legal requirement on the staff-elected Director that means he or she has the same rights, duties and obligations as the other Directors, including to act in the interests of the ABC as a whole.
Surely that statement alone makes it clear that the means by which a director is appointed have absolutely nothing to do with the rights, duties and obligations that a person must discharge as a director. It is a fact that is enshrined in law, no matter how a director is appointed. If you are a director, no matter how you come to be appointed, you must act in the same prescribed manner as all other directors.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-05-09,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer. I refer to last week’s decision by the Reserve Bank to lift the interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent. Is the minister aware that a family with an average mortgage of $226,000 will have to find an extra $73 a month to pay for the two interest rate increases the government promised at the last election would not happen? According to the statement by the Reserve Bank, wasn’t the interest rate increase in part a result of what it described as ‘rather limited spare capacity’? Why has the government neglected nation-building investment in infrastructure? Hasn’t that failure led to greater upward pressure on interest rates?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-05-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given the history lesson, perhaps the minister would like to remind us about the peak of interest rates when the current Prime Minister was last Treasurer—reaching over 21 per cent, as I understand. Referring to the interest rate rise the government promised at the last election would not happen, didn’t the Reserve Bank also point out that another contributing factor was that ‘suitable labour is scarce’? Why has the government neglected significant investment in skills and training—resulting in, for example, the shortfall of 300,000 places in TAFE since 1999 and a shortfall of 100,000 university places since 2003?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-05-09,"—What I know is that, under Labor, interest rates hit a record 17 per cent. Under Labor, interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent. When we came into office, interest rates were 10½ per cent. Under our government, interest rates have consistently been lower than they were under the former Labor government, who ran massive budget deficits, built up the debts of this country and squeezed savings in this country. This put pressure on interest rates and led to the collapse of businesses all over the country and unemployment in the hundreds of thousands. That was the record of the Labor government.
Our whole strategy through our fiscal policy is to ensure that we put no undue pressure on interest rates as a result of our management of the economy and our management of public finances. The record speaks for itself. Interest rates have been consistently lower under our government than they ever were under the former Labor government. We are proud of that record, and that record will continue.
It is of course true that the Reserve Bank, by virtue of our instrument when we came into office, is an independent entity and runs monetary policy independently. It has done a superb job and is widely regarded throughout the world for its conduct of monetary policy in this country. Last week, the Reserve Bank raised the official rate by one-quarter of one per cent, taking account of the strength of the global economy and the impact of that on the Australian economy. Australia, as a commodity supplier, is benefiting enormously from the very strong global economy, particularly the economies of China and India, and that is of course feeding through to the domestic economy, which is running at a strong rate.
It is a fact that the Reserve Bank thought it best to—what you might colloquially describe as—‘touch the brakes’ to ensure that the economy did not overheat and that we did not exceed the two to three per cent band on underlying inflation. Our job in the budget ahead of us tonight is to make sure that there is nothing in that budget that puts any further undue pressure on interest rates. Indeed, the Reserve Bank has made it abundantly clear that there is nothing in relation to fiscal policy that is having an effect on its conduct of monetary policy.
As to so-called ‘nation building’, we know that the Labor Party wants to rort the Future Fund by using it for its favourite pet projects and as a slush fund to buy its way back into office. We will not allow the Future Fund to be used like that. Consistent with our responsibilities as the federal government—not a state government—we have invested significantly in road and rail and infrastructure. I ask the opposition to have regard to the budget tonight, where they may see further initiatives in that regard. We have a major AusLink program which has led to a very big increase in our investment in road and rail, in particular, in this country to improve our transport networks. We have invested substantially in skills, innovation and education.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senator Sherry today relating to interest rates and to the property development company, Westpoint.
On the matter of interest rates, which a couple of my colleagues will be dealing with in greater detail, last week we had the second rise in interest rates since the re-election of the Howard government. These rises were despite the promise given by the Liberal government at the last election that interest rates would not go up.

Senator Ferguson interjecting—

—Senator Ferguson is interjecting very arrogantly. He remembers very well the promise the Liberal government gave at the last election that interest rates would not go up. What have we had? We have had two interest rate movements since the election. The average Australian family with an average mortgage of some $226,000 will be paying an extra $73 a month as a consequence of yet another broken promise by the Liberal government at the last election that interest rates would not go up. As I said, my colleagues will touch on some other aspects of this.
I want to come to the issue of the Westpoint financial scandal. I have asked in the Senate about other aspects of this matter. The scandal involves thousands of Australian retirees or people near retirement who have lost up to $400 million of their superannuation retirement savings in a financial scam known as Westpoint and its related entities—it was constructed of a number of what are called mezzanine property companies.
The issue I asked particularly about today relates to the revelations on the ABC Four Corners program last night. On that program—and congratulations to them for their investigative journalism—we learnt in much greater detail about two new aspects of what is one of the largest superannuation financial scandals this country has seen in the last 10 to 20 years, as far as I can recall. At the heart of this are the thousands of Australians who have struggled to save for their retirement through superannuation who have been blatantly defrauded by this Westpoint entity and the activities around it.
There are numerous aspects relating to the actions and activities of Westpoint that this government should give answers to, but I want to focus on the issue that was raised on Four Corners last night. One of the operators involved in this financial scam, Mr Richard Beck, earned some $9.2 million in commissions by enticing elderly Australians into the Westpoint investment entities. On top of that we further learned that the receiver of the Westpoint entities, Mr Mark Korda, has identified a number of financial planners, who were also involved in recommending the Westpoint entities for Australians’ superannuation retirement savings, who have collected more than $50 million in commissions from those investment vehicles.
This goes to the heart of one of the problems with at least some aspects of our superannuation industry in Australia, and that is the issue of commission based selling. We have heard evidence from Mr Lucy and ASIC—I have asked Mr Lucy and ASIC what was going on with respect to Westpoint at at least two previous hearings. What was going on was that commissions of up to 12 per cent of the moneys paid into the Westpoint entities were being charged by planners. There is an obvious conflict of interest when there are enormous commissions by any industry standard being received by the planners involved, in this case, Mr Beck. They are certainly the largest commissions— (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2006-05-09,"—Two issues have been raised by Senator Sherry this afternoon following on from question time. The first of those is mortgage interest rates. He began his remarks by completely misrepresenting the position of the government at the last election when he claimed that the government had said that interest rates would not rise under this government. That is absolutely false. What the government did claim—and claimed quite justifiably—was that interest rates would be higher under a Labor government than they would ever be under a Liberal-National Party government. That is evident from the history of interest rates in this country.
Under the last Labor government, we saw mortgage interest rates rise to 17 per cent and borrowings for business purposes at times at 24 per cent. During Labor’s entire 13 years in office, home loan interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent. When we came to power in 1996, they were still high at 10.5 per cent. In contrast, home loan interest rates today, even with the recent quarter per cent rise, are at 7.55 per cent—a dramatic and substantial improvement on that dreadful record of Labor’s economic management which led to those enormous interest rates that people experienced between 1984 and 1996.
In fact, if home loan interest rates were now at the average level that they were at under that Labor government, home owners with an average new home loan would be paying $215 a week more than they currently pay. One of the reasons interest rates were higher under Labor—apart from general economic mismanagement—was that they left the federal budget some $10 billion in deficit and they left an accumulated federal government debt of $96 billion. The government was in the market borrowing money to pay that $96 billion of accumulated debt. Of course, inevitably, that puts upward pressure on interest rates because they are in the market competing with home buyers and businesses that want to borrow money to sustain their activities as well. In that way, that puts a competitive upward pressure on interest rates.
Over the last 10 years, as of April of this year, that $96 billion has been eliminated by the Howard government as a result of 10 years of hard work and effective financial management. The Reserve Bank said that the reasons for the decision to lift the official rate by a quarter of a per cent were primarily international factors relating to the outlook for growth internationally and were not domestic inflation, which is well under control and within their two to three per cent band. They also said that, with a surplus between a half and 1½ per cent of GDP, there is no upward pressure on interest rates flowing from the government’s fiscal settings. So, as I said, the rise in interest rates to the extent it has occurred is due to international factors. The present government’s position with regard to interest rates and their record with interest rates is far superior to that of the previous Labor government.
Let me turn now to the issue, which Senator Sherry also raised, of Westpoint and the disastrous situation there as far as investors are concerned. Senator Sherry has sought to use this to attack commission based selling of financial products. That is not the issue here at all. What is the issue, of course, is the ethics and honesty of the particular people involved with the Westpoint company and marketing their financial products.
We have legislation in place, which ASIC is applying, that will bring those people to book, but to use this particular issue to attack commission based selling when it is conducted by ethical and honest people is simply to use a particular case to further Labor hostility in general, and Senator Sherry’s hostility in particular, towards commission based selling, which is a legitimate activity when people do it on an ethical and honest basis.
In relation to Westpoint, as I said, ASIC has taken action against the perpetrators of the scheme which has cost people so much in lost investments. They are helping people to deal with Westpoint on a number of fronts and they are also working to bring charges against those who have been responsible for the financial losses suffered by investors. As long ago as 2003, ASIC started working in relation to this issue of Westpoint. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2006-05-09,"—I also seek to take note of the answer given by Senator Minchin on the issue of interest rates. Before dealing with some more general comments, I want to take a couple of moments to respond to something that Senator Chapman raised in his contribution and nail the lie once and for all that the interest rates on mortgages in this country were 10½ per cent when this government came to power. It is true that in 1996 the mortgage rates offered by the banks in this country were 10½ per cent, but Senator Chapman should know that in fact the banking sector mortgage rates had been deregulated under the Keating Labor government and that the mortgage rates from non-bank lenders were averaging around seven to 7½ per cent—and they have not moved much over the past 10 years. The deregulation of the mortgage sector, and in particular the opening up to non-bank lenders in the nineties, actually put pressure on the banks to reduce their interest rates to match what was available in the market. So let us nail the lie once and for all that somehow or other interest rates were 10½ per cent in 1996. That was certainly what the banks were charging, but that was not what was available in the rest of the marketplace.
I want to deal with the question of interest rates much more generally. I make the point to those listening that on 29 August 2004 the Prime Minister asked Australian families, ‘Who do you trust to keep interest rates low?’ The reality is that interest rates have just risen for the sixth time since 2001 under this government. So it is pretty clear that families should not trust this Prime Minister, because he has not been able to meet the commitment that he made in August 2004. It was during the last election campaign that the Liberal Party claimed that they would keep interest rates at record lows. In fact, interest rates have risen twice since that promise was made. They have risen twice since August 2004. The average cost of a mortgage for Australian home owners is something like $879 a year more than they were paying at that point in time. And I have to disagree with my colleague Senator Sherry, who says that it is $73 a month—it is a little bit more than that, because that works out to only $876 a year. There is a $3 difference. It is actually more than $73 a month.
Two weeks ago, the Treasurer was crowing that it was a debt-free day. However, what the Treasurer failed to mention when he was making that statement was that families in this country are more sensitive to interest rate rises than at any other time in our history. Families are more in debt than they have ever been. Ordinary household debt in this country has exploded under this government. People are borrowing to survive. They are not borrowing to buy assets, as is commonly argued by those on the other side, but borrowing to survive and living on their credit cards. That is what has happened to average families in this country and they are in more debt than they have ever been. And of course they are particularly sensitive to any interest rate rises under that set of circumstances, because they are spending more of their income to service the debt that they are accumulating day in and day out.
Let us also look at the question of the country. The country is in massive debt: $473 billion. We owe the rest of the world more than 50 per cent of our annual GDP. What did Prime Minister John Howard say in 1995 when he launched the Liberal debt truck? He said:
If it weren’t for the level of foreign debt, interest rates in this country would be much lower and every Australian today who owes money on his or her home is paying a higher interest rate than would otherwise be the case because of the size of our foreign debt.
He also said:
I can promise you that we will follow policies which will, over a period of time, bring down the foreign debt.
That is another promise that was broken. Perhaps the promise that was made back in 1996 was a non-core promise, because we know that foreign debt has exploded since that point in time. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2006-05-09,"—What we are witnessing today is a very brave Australian Labor Party—so brave that they are prepared to talk about interest rates 18 months out from an election. Did we hear the Australian Labor Party talking about interest rates during the last election campaign? No. The reason was that they know that the Australian public does not trust them with the economy. They know that the Australian public does not trust them with interest rates. They did not talk about interest rates in the teeth of a federal election because they knew that they would have been smashed at the polls. As it was, they were smashed at the polls even without talking about interest rates. We know that the Labor Party is gutless and scared about the subject of interest rates because Paul Keating told us that last night on the 7.30 Report. He said:
… why didn’t we take him on on interest rates?
He was referring to the Prime Minister. He continued:
Because we were too stupid. That’s why. Too gutless.
Kerry O’Brien asked:
Who was too stupid?
Keating said:
I think Latham should have taken him on …
Senators opposite might be gutless, but they are not completely crazy. They knew what talking about interest rates in an election campaign would have done: it would have driven their vote down even further. I was hoping that we would hear a bit about the orange-bellied parrot in taking note of answers today, but I think Paul Keating belled the cat by talking about the yellow bellies opposite when it comes to the economy.
When I think of Labor and the economy, the words of the Treasurer come to mind: ‘Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor.’ When Labor get on their feet and talk about the economy, it is always hypocrisy. Labor are in favour of bigger budget surpluses, lower tax, lower debt, higher surpluses, balanced budgets, more money for schools, more money for hospitals and lower interest rates. They are against every single measure that will create an environment in which those things can happen. We know that Labor in government left a budget deficit of $96 billion. Now, high budget deficits put pressure on interest rates. Labor say that they are in favour of lower interest rates, but they have opposed every single measure that this government introduced to reduce the deficit. They have opposed every single measure that this government introduced to pay down the debt.
Can Labor senators opposite name one single savings measure that they have supported in this parliament? I hear silence from the other side, because Labor opposed every single measure designed to bring this budget into balance, every single measure designed to pay down the debt. So when Labor talk about interest rates it is nothing short of hypocrisy. The home mortgage rate, as we know, is 7.55 per cent now. When we came to power, it was 10½ per cent.
—It was not 10½ per cent!
—The home loan interest rate, under Labor, averaged 12.75 per cent.
—It was not 10½ per cent and you know it wasn’t.
—Senator George Campbell!
—If the average rate that applied under Labor had operated since we have been in government, for an average new home loan now the average Australian would pay $215 a week more than they currently pay.
—Why don’t you come clean and admit it?
—Senator George Campbell, you have had your go. Senator Fifield is entitled to be heard in silence.
—In this debate, the Prime Minister and the government have been comprehensively misrepresented. This government never said during the election campaign that interest rates would not change under a coalition government. What the government said was that interest rates would be higher under a Labor government. Interest rates will always be higher under a Labor government than they will under a coalition government because senators opposite are not prepared to take the steps required to support an environment conducive to low interest rates.
—That is not true.
—If they were, they would have supported savings measures in the budget.
—That is not true.
—You should read the RBA statement; that’s what you should do.
—Senator Ludwig and Senator Campbell!
—If they were, they would have supported the paying down of debt. I again give Labor senators opposite the chance to state which particular savings measures they have supported to bring the budget into balance. Silence again. I am not surprised. We have heard more cant and hypocrisy from the other side of this chamber in relation to the issue of Westpoint. This government cannot and will not ever state that a particular investment is one which is safe and secure. On this side of the chamber, we will never do what the Labor Party did in the case of the Pyramid Building Society— (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2006-05-09,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Minchin to questions without notice today relating to interest rates. And weren’t those answers a stellar example of just how out of touch this government has become with ordinary Australians? Does Senator Minchin really think that his answers are going to make Australians who are facing an increase of up to $70 a month extra to pay off their mortgage—or those Australians who are going to have to pay $70 a month extra in rent because their landlord is going to pass on last week’s interest rate increase to them—feel better? That is the second interest rate increase since this government was re-elected in 2004 and, as Senator George Campbell pointed out, the sixth interest rate increase since 2001.
Are Senator Minchin’s answers going to provide any succour to young people, who will see their dreams of buying a home disappear because of this latest interest rate increase on the government’s watch? Not only will those young people find it harder to save for a deposit for a house but they will be forced to compete for rental properties in a housing market that is already completely stretched. And, of course, when the rental market is stretched even further because of this latest interest rate increase, we know which Australians are going to be in the worst possible position: those on the lowest income, especially those single parents in receipt of benefits—the ones whose income and benefits will be reduced by up to $100 a week when the so-called Welfare to Work legislation introduced by this government takes effect shortly. They are the same low-income families who are already paying over 30 per cent of their income in rent.
Just how out of touch is this government? I think that was highlighted today by reports in the media of the Treasurer telling Australians that it would be good if they could save some of the money from the miserly and long-overdue tax cuts that he is apparently going to give them tonight. How patronising is that, telling people to save their money for a rainy day, as the Treasurer has done? With Australians signing up for credit cards in record numbers and average household debt per Australian family at $60,000, the Treasurer is telling Australians it is a good idea to try to save some money. With credit card debt increasing at the rate of nearly 21 per cent a year for the past five years, the Treasurer helpfully tells us to save some money! With Australian families currently spending 2.3 per cent more than is coming into the average household each week in income, the Treasurer tells those families it would be good if they tried to save some money. What piece of paternalism are we going to hear next from this government? Perhaps we will get the Treasurer’s recipes for using cheaper cuts of meat so that the family food budget is extended a bit further!
What advice are the government and the Treasurer going to give Australia’s young people who are hoping to buy a home to participate fully in society by becoming home owners but who are saddled with HECS debts when they leave university—HECS debts which are up to $8,000 a year per year of study? What advice is the Treasurer going to give to those 300,000 Australians who want to improve their opportunities for better paid jobs by gaining better skills and qualifications but have been turned away by our TAFE colleges? What is the Treasurer going to say to those people?
Isn’t it about time that the government stopped giving out this paternalistic advice about how people should manage their finances and instead started doing something to give Australians real opportunities to earn a higher level of income and started doing something about improving the ability of people to skill up and to train so that they can take on better jobs and so we do not have to import skilled labour from overseas to do those jobs of Australians?
Not only have we seen this government preside over two interest rate increases since 2004 under the very watchful eye, apparently, of Senator Minchin, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, we have also seen petrol prices go through the roof. Today at a petrol station in Coober Pedy in regional South Australia, unleaded petrol is 143.5c per litre and diesel petrol is 152c per litre. With the government intending to increase the cost of fuel for regional Australians by another three cents per litre after June, the pain for Australian families in regional areas is just going to get worse. And of course, as we know, this government has absolutely no plan for dealing with how we are going to provide affordable energy for this country into the future.
How out of touch is this government? I do not know. I do not know who Senator Minchin talks to when he frames his answers. Maybe he talks to those people who are going to share a table at dinner tonight with the Deputy Prime Minister at a cost of, I think, $1,400 per head. I do not think ordinary Australians have that kind of money. Maybe that has escaped the government’s attention—or maybe they just do not care.
During the last election campaign, the government banged on endlessly about what great economic managers they were, but let us remember that, since the government have been in office—10 long years—average mortgage repayments for Australian families have gone from $700 a month to $1,100 a month and petrol prices have gone from 70c a litre to double that. Petrol prices are now 19 per cent higher than they were at this time last year. In just the last two years of this government, according to ABS statistics, the cost of petrol has risen 31 per cent, the cost of child care has risen 25.4 per cent, the cost of hospital and medical services has risen 11.4 per cent and the cost of pharmaceuticals has risen 8.2 per cent. It might have escaped me, but I have not seen wages and welfare benefits increase that much. (Time expired)

That the recommendation on page 4 of Report 2/2006 of the Committee of Senators’ Interests be adopted.
The report of the Senators’ Interests Committee on its review of arrangements for registration of senators’ interests was presented out of sitting on 6 April 2006. It represents the culmination of some intense work by the committee, starting with our decision last year to survey our colleagues about the system for registering interests.
As a result of the comments and responses of our colleagues, the committee has revised the forms for registering senators’ interests. Most of the changes are minor and cosmetic, but the committee’s intention was to make it as easy as possible for senators to comply with their obligations under the resolutions. There are more examples and more guidance provided on the forms themselves. We have also reviewed the explanatory notes and clarified one or two matters raised with the committee in recent times. For example, in relation to self-managed superannuation funds, the notes make it clear that shareholdings by such entities are included as registrable interests where the senator or their spouse or partner is able to exercise control over the right to vote or dispose of those shares. The committee has also published the administrative procedures for the maintenance of the register, which I draw to senators’ attention.
The main issue considered by the committee, however, was whether we should recommend an amendment to the resolutions to take into account the issue raised with the committee by the Procedure Committee and also alluded to in the survey—namely, whether the time for notifying alterations of interests should be increased from 28 days to make it easier for senators whose interests involve regular share trading to comply fully with the resolutions. As senators will know, there have been some problems experienced in this area in recent times. After much deliberation, the committee has recommended extending the time frame for notifying all alterations, not just share trading, by one week from 28 to 35 days. This is the subject of the motion I have moved this afternoon.
In moving this motion, it is not my intention that the Senate should vote today on whether to adopt the committee’s recommendation. At the end of my contribution I intend to seek leave to continue my remarks so that this matter will remain on the Notice Paper until the next occasion on which the Senate considers orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses on a Thursday afternoon. Depending on the demands of the Senate program, this may occur in June or it may not occur until the spring sittings. The new forms and the revised explanatory notes have taken effect already. The time frame change is subject to the approval of the Senate. I urge all senators to read the report and keep copies handy for reference. All the information is also readily available on the committee’s website. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-05-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
The Auditor-General’s Report No. 36 of 2005-06 is entitled Management of the Tiger Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter Project. Once again, the Auditor-General raises serious concerns about the management of a Defence procurement project. Again, the press has had a field day with this particular report. ‘Underpowered Tiger helicopters may lack growl,’ said the Australian Financial Review. ‘Choppers hit turbulence,’ said the Australian. From the Canberra Times we had, ‘Defence pays for toothless Tigers.’
Looking behind the headlines, the Auditor-General’s report tells the real story of this latest disaster from the Department of Defence. Briefly, the report found that we have a fleet of helicopters that are flawed in their contracted design. Tender guidelines were flouted when purchasing these craft. Buying the Tigers off the shelf—meant to save money—could end up costing at least another $110 million. And there was also that old friend from the past, inadequate oversight of contracts.
How did it come to this? The sorry saga started six years ago when the government approved the purchase of 22 Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters costing then some $1.58 billion. The government wanted craft that offered all-weather reconnaissance, provided fire support for our troops and had a commonality so that the craft could be used across the forces. Instead, it has ended up with four aircraft delivered and eight copters grounded in Brisbane, leaving our forces with no capability in this area at all in the field. This, by way of introduction, was meant to be a less risky way of buying helicopters.
Alarm bells should have started ringing right back in 2001 when contracts were entered into by the relevant agency. Back then, the Tigers had still not received full certification or design acceptance from their manufacturer, an agency of the French government. This meant Australia was the first country in the world to give the green light to the production of this type of helicopter—so much for minimising risk by buying off the shelf.
Certainly at this time, the government should have started checking more thoroughly into the way it set about tendering for these particular craft. It took the Auditor-General to tell us how the Defence Materiel Organisation’s Tender Evaluation Board failed to adhere to its own tender evaluation plan and, indeed, its own detailed policy guidelines in this area. Perhaps if the defence department had been more accountable here the next chapter in this sorry story would not have to have been written, for when the first two prototype Tigers were finally delivered in December 2004, they failed to meet more than 70 contractual specifications.
A few of the vital areas in which flaws were found included: their weapons operability, their navigation system, the emergency locator beacon, their ability to fly long distances over water and the flight data recorder, which was not compliant. The list goes on. But what did the DMO do? Instead of sending these back to the shop and demanding better—or demanding what had been contracted for—it took delivery and, believe it or not, paid. Why?
DMO advised the Auditor-General that that was normal practice. I quote from the Auditor-General’s report:
It is DMO’s practice to accept deliverables with contractual shortfalls, and operational limitations, on a risk-managed basis, to ... deliver the required operational capability.
What a marvellous sentence! Yet here we are 24 months on and still no line pilots have been trained to an operational standard. Not one craft is up to airworthiness and the DMO is haggling with the contractor over the through-life support and maintenance.
And this, the Auditor-General warns, is likely to lead to even more delays and cost blow-outs. How? Because part of the original contract to build the 22 Tigers contained a low estimate for the cost of giving essential through-life support—the maintenance required while they are in operation. DMO simply assumed such costs would be lower than the contractor’s competitors because of the Tiger’s ‘more modern design’. We will never know how much the other three contenders for the project would have charged for through-life support because their tenders were not required. That is because the DMO failed to follow its own tendering guidelines and merely provided briefs as to why it rejected the others. So, when accepting the winning contractor’s bid, DMO assumed any continuing support for the Tigers would be cheaper because they were a more advanced design.
As we know, they were in fact wrong by $625 million, according to another contractor. This figure is disputed by the DMO but, as the Auditor-General reminds us, the through-life support contract even now remains unresolved. We are now far removed from the government’s original intent of buying off-the-shelf helicopters to reduce the risk of overspend. Incidentally, the Auditor-General raised yet another red flag over DMO’s ability to drive a hard bargain. It found that intellectual property remains with the contractor. This means we do not have the means—unless we pay again—to fix our own craft.
According to the 2000 defence white paper, the Tigers should have been in service by 2004. A year after this, the DMO accepted delivery of another helicopter. Yet again, the goods were shoddy. A test pilot and flight test engineer found that the craft, in the words of the report:
Exhibited neither high quality nor mature system performance, and a number of issues would directly affect safe and efficient operation of the craft.
Don’t you love the people who draft these things? This means the craft would not fly and could not turn but was accepted for delivery. So here we are, six years later, with just four aircraft delivered and 18 in production in Brisbane, leaving the ADF none of the capability it desired in the field.
Let us revisit the government’s original checklist for buying the Tiger fleet. It wanted a helicopter offering all-weather reconnaissance. What do we have? The Tigers have engines that are too heavy and use too much fuel. It wanted fire support for our troops, naturally enough. What have we got? The Tigers are not even in service—serving troops have to rely on our allies for this. It wanted a commonality to allow it to be used across the services. What do we have? The Tigers are not even approved for operational use, let alone possess the desired commonality.
We have seen how a flawed contract design, operational shortcomings and a nonadherence to established process have led to none of the government’s original checklist for a high-powered craft being met. This whole project is a classic case of poor planning, inadequate specifications and huge time delays blowing out the defence budget.
I will conclude by referring to another article in the media following last week’s headlines. This one is on the defence minister, Dr Brendan Nelson. Apparently the minister is looking at how Defence can assure government it is achieving value for money in its procurement activities. I would like to remind Dr Nelson of a Senate resolution, carried three years ago, to independently audit Australia’s major defence projects. So far this remains unheeded by his government. Should Dr Nelson take on board the Senate’s resolution, perhaps fiascos such as that surrounding the acquisition of the Tiger helicopters would not escalate. Such an independent audit may also provide him with solid backup once change is implemented and ensure he is not merely a toothless tiger.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-05-09,"—As I was saying earlier when I was making a brief contribution to this debate, surely the minister’s statement on 24 March about the roles of directors of the ABC makes clear that the means by which a director is appointed has absolutely nothing to do with the rights, duties and obligations that a person must discharge as a director. In fact, as we all know, and as I said before, it is enshrined within the law. If you are a director it does not matter how you come to be appointed: you must act in the same prescribed manner as all other directors. So the staff-elected director of the ABC does not have the right to cherry-pick which parts of the rights, duties and obligations they can or will undertake. They are required under law to act in the same way as all other directors. So the government’s proposition that the staff-elected director is somehow different under the law is blatantly not true. There can be no uncertainty surrounding their legal position on the board of the ABC. After their election to the board they are simply another director under law.
I will accept that the staff elected director on the board has a different perspective from other directors in that they work within the corporation. They interact on a daily basis as part of their normal work with other staff and management of the ABC. However, that does not change their status or legal obligations. This chamber knows that there is no uncertainty in the legal obligations of the staff-elected director, so why is the minister using that absurd proposition that there is uncertainty about accountability? If this bill is passed by this chamber and becomes law, as the minister and the government are determined that it will, it will mean that all of the directors of the ABC will be appointed by the government. Maybe that is the accountability that the minister is concerned about. Maybe when they say ‘accountability’ the minister and the government actually mean that ultimately all directors of the ABC must be in their view accountable to the whims of the minister and the government of the day and only that, and that they are the only people that should have a say in who the directors shall be.
The government will not have to worry about differences of opinion or dissent on the board of the ABC once the staff-elected director is removed. The only way you can be on the board of the ABC any time in the future once this piece of legislation is passed is if the government appoints you—nothing more, nothing less. Every member of the board of the ABC will be accountable directly to the minister and the government. There will be no uncertainty about accountability in the future. There will be no director on the board who is not put there directly by the minister and the government—no more scrutiny of appointments to the board, no more independent voice. You have to ask yourself the question: why is it now so important to remove the staff-elected director of the ABC board? Why is the minister so concerned about this?
As was outlined in earlier contributions to this debate, the current staff-elected position was created in 1986 under the Hawke government. The staff-elected director has operated therefore for over 20 years. Where has the so-called uncertainty about that staff-elected director’s accountability been in all that time? It would seem that the government has only developed this concern about accountability once it got the numbers in this place to get rid of the only independently appointed director. Has the staff-elected director of the ABC ever been sacked for failing to undertake the duties and obligations as required under the law? Of course they have not. So a system that has worked for over 20 years, one that has provided a voice independent of the government of the day, is now deemed to not be in line with modern principles of corporate governance, according to the minister for communications. That is an absolute nonsense.
Every time the government attempt to cast this amendment in a reasonable way, they are hoist on their own petard. Look at what the explanatory memorandum says:
The election method creates a risk that a staff-elected Director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC ...
The constituents who elect the director can have whatever expectations they want of that director. As the minister so helpfully points out, upon becoming a member of the board of the ABC the staff-elected director has exactly the same rights, duties and obligations as any other director. The risk that the explanatory memorandum talks about is surely no different from the risk that faces all directors of the ABC. The government and the minister, as the constituents who appoint the other directors, may have exactly the same expectation that those directors will place the interests of their constituents above the interests of the ABC. So the risk exists in either case or it does not exist at all. You cannot have it both ways. Election by the staff creates the same level of risk as appointment by the minister.
The amendment contained in this bill will no doubt have to be followed up in other legislation, as other Commonwealth statutory authorities have staff-elected positions on their governing bodies as well. These include, as has been mentioned before, the Australian National University, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. However, this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. If we remove all representational members of boards and governing bodies from Commonwealth statutory authorities and corporations, I am sure that there will be a number of members of The Nationals and their fellow travellers who will lose out in a big way. What is the government going to do about all those representational appointments, especially in the agriculture area? How many boards of the Australian government have representational appointments? Surely, if it is good enough for the ABC to do without representational appointments, it is good enough for any government agency or authority?
Let us look at some examples from the corporate world—the arena where the minister’s so-called modern principles of corporate governance can be seen in operation. Firstly, let us look at a government company that was privatised only seven years ago—the Australian Wheat Board. That was done by this government. Let us examine the corporate governance of the AWB. Indeed, there are two different types of directors, class A and class B, who are elected by class A or class B shareholders. Class A directors are elected on a regional basis—two from New South Wales, two from Western Australia, one from South Australia, one from Victoria-Tasmania and one from Queensland-Northern Territory. A further two directors are elected by class B shareholders and two more are appointed by class A directors. So, by any measure, the AWB has a board elected and appointed on a representational basis. Some are elected on a regional basis, some are determined by the types of shares and some are appointed.
Surely, when the government talk about the principles of modern governance for the ABC, they would do well to apply the same principles to Australian companies. Look at what the corporate governance document of the AWB says:
Regardless of who elects or appoints a director, each director is obliged to act in the interests of AWB as a whole. Although directors may be elected by particular shareholders, directors are not considered the servants or agents of particular groups of shareholders or required to follow directions of or requests from any group of shareholders ...
BP Australia simply appoints its directors, and I suppose that is the model that the government are now proposing for the ABC. Woolworths Ltd directors are appointed, and the directors of the Australian Submarine Corporation are all appointed by the Minister for Finance and Administration.
The modern principles of corporate governance seem, from a cursory examination, to consist of directors being appointed by other directors, sometimes being elected by shareholders and sometimes on a representational basis. In none of the examples I am aware of is any director beholden to the group that elects or appoints them. In all cases, directors are required under law to act in the best interests of the corporation or company. The government has used a ridiculous assertion—that of uncertain accountability—to remove the staff-elected director from the board of the ABC. This is not for any reasons of modern corporate governance, nor for the reason of uncertain accountability, but solely for the reason of political expediency. With the removal of the staff-elected director of the ABC, the government will be completely in control of the ABC. This is what Mr Howard’s government has delivered after 10 long years: a less open and transparent ABC, appointed by government to serve the wishes of government without the possibility of independence or dissent.
The ABC, as was mentioned by Senator Conroy, is not like any of the other broadcasting companies in this country. The ABC fills a unique position in the Australian community and is full of hardworking, creative and inspirational talent. The ABC has been at the forefront of innovation, creativity and risk for its entire lifespan. The decision by the minister to remove the staff-elected director is not a step forward into modern corporate governance but a step backwards into an organisation run by mates for mates. The ABC has a unique place in our community, and the staff-elected director has demonstrated that they are able to effectively discharge the duties of a director and act in the best interests of the ABC as a whole. This is not an accountability debate. This is not even close to a corporate governance debate. This is simply a grab for power by the minister and the government, behind spurious and ridiculous reasoning.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2006-05-09,"—I rise to support the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. The government’s proposed amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act to abolish the position of staff-elected director are squarely aimed at improving the effective functioning of the ABC board and not at reducing the independence of the ABC. The key editorial principles that form part of the ABC Editorial policies will not change: honesty, fairness, respect and independence. To quote from the ABC Editorial policies:
Independence demands that program makers not allow their judgement to be influenced by pressures from political, commercial or other sectional interests, or by their own personal views or activities. There must be no external interference in the presentation or content of programs.
Abolishing the position of staff-elected director will not change how the independence of the ABC is maintained. The board position of managing director is not appointed by the government, and that will not change. The other national broadcaster, SBS, does not have a staff-elected director. That has not caused any concern about its independence. The Senate inquiry into this amendment also heard that another Australasian broadcaster, Television New Zealand, does not have a staff-elected director. Furthermore, the ABC in the past has not had a staff-elected director. For the first 40 years of its history the ABC did not have a staff-elected director and there was also no staff-elected director in the late seventies and early eighties. Critics of the abolition of the position of staff-elected director have not been able to produce any tangible evidence that this sensible step will diminish the independence of the ABC. Those critics are, quite simply, looking at the issue in the wrong way.
This decision has been taken because of concerns about the effective functioning of the ABC board. This is about the modern requirements for corporate governance. The ABC will not become any less independent because the government makes improvements to the board structure and the effective functioning of the board. The requirement for the ABC to be independent will remain in its charter and in its Editorial policies, as it should. An independent ABC is an important cultural institution in Australia. Indeed, the ABC board is required by law to maintain the independence and integrity of the corporation.
The proposed change will address an ongoing tension that has existed about the accountability of the staff-elected director. The difficulties arising from the position of staff-elected director have, in the past, been raised by departing board members. I note that one of those former board members has strongly supported this move by the government. The change is consistent with good corporate governance and the recommendations of the Uhrig review, which found that it was not in the interests of an effective and efficient board to have representative directors. That finding was also supported by a submission to the Senate inquiry by Professor Stephen Bartos from the National Institute for Governance. Professor Bartos was quite correct in his submission when he wrote that the ABC is expected to operate ‘in line with a normal corporate or commercial governance paradigm’.
The concept of a board director who is elected by a particular group does not fit with modern requirements for good corporate governance. Having a director on the board with divided loyalties creates problems of accountability and conflict of interest. The ABC is accountable to parliament and to the Australian people.
While this move is not an attempt to get rid of the current staff-elected director, Ramona Koval, whose second term expires in June in any case, making her ineligible for re-election, Ms Koval’s term has highlighted some of the anomalies and difficulties with staff-elected director positions. The Senate inquiry heard evidence which supported the view of the government that there should be no question or confusion about the constituency that ABC directors are accountable to. Written evidence provided by Ms Koval showed that she was making it clear to ABC staff that she was representing their views:
... representations I made as Director on your behalf ...
This is an unacceptable conflict of interest for a board member. A staff-elected director will always have a dual concern: the ABC and its staff, and the board. A staff-elected director who does not win staff approval will not be elected. Equally, a staff-elected director who demonstrates a certain political posture is more likely to be elected. That favour may have to be repaid.
However, the fact that this restructure is taking place at the end of Ms Koval’s term is proof that this is not about individuals. The board will still receive and consider regular independent advice from the ABC Advisory Council. The managing director is a full member of the board and a conduit between staff, management and the board. The appointment of the managing director is made independently from the government. The heads of the ABC divisions report regularly to the board, and divisional heads and their management teams take account of staff issues and concerns. The government believes that the ABC board and management will continue to take staff interests into account. The ABC produces an annual equity and diversity report and quarterly reports on audience comments and complaints. And, as some of the submissions to the Senate inquiry made clear, there are also three unions at the ABC to represent the interests of the staff.
Critics of the change are also wrong when they claim that only with a staff-elected director can the board receive direct input on the issues of program making and broadcasting. There is no requirement in the current provisions for a staff-elected director to be someone who works directly in programming or broadcasting. The current board includes a writer, a journalist and two former TV company directors. Furthermore, evidence which was heard at the Senate inquiry casts some doubt on whether a staff-elected director would bring tangible benefits. Rather than bring an intimate understanding of, for instance, ABC Editorial policies, the former director, Mr Quentin Dempster, of Stateline New South Wales, admitted that he had been found to have breached an important ABC rule more than 70 times in two years. If I can take senators back to March 2003 and the Iraq war, Mark Colvin from PM referred to Australian forces as ‘our troops in Iraq’. This brought a furious reaction from news boss John Cameron, who issued not one but two memos banning journalists from referring to ‘our troops in Iraq’ on the grounds that because the ABC did not own them they were not ‘our’.
Now this stand may have been defensible if the ABC had enforced its ban on ‘our’. But over the next two years ABC journalists referred to ‘our Anzacs’, ‘our diggers’, ‘our Vietnam involvement’ and a whole string of 650 other examples. You ask: what action did Mr Cameron, the news boss, take? None. Mr Cameron admitted to watching Stateline New South Wales ‘religiously’ but failed to notice more than 100 breaches of a rule he had been so adamant about enforcing—but only when it involved Australian participation in the Iraq war. And despite a grave warning in Mr Cameron’s March 2003 memo that repeat breaches of the ‘mandatory rule’ would impact on employment status, no action was taken against Mr Dempster, despite more than 70 breaches. Mr Dempster had been shown to be ignorant of an important editorial document at the ABC and of having failed to read two memos from Mr Cameron, and this was the ‘valuable insight’ he could bring to the ABC board.
While I am on the subject of ABC programs and the matter before us today, I will say something about last night’s Media Watch program. During the Senate inquiry into the amendment of the ABC Act, Ramona Koval and some other people who made submissions made the claim that, without a staff-elected director, ‘all the board members will be appointed by the government’. The previous managing director, Mr Balding, was not appointed by the government.

Senator Webber interjecting—

—The acting managing director, Mr Green, was not appointed by the government, and the next managing director will also not be appointed by the government, Senator Webber. What did we get from Ms Attard on Media Watch last night? She said:
As we reported a few weeks ago, the government has decided to abolish the staff representative, to keep the board exclusively for government appointees.
This is a false statement and the very kind of misreporting that Media Watch is supposed to expose.
That is not the only curious piece of ‘reporting’—and I use the term loosely—going on at the ABC these days. Richard Aedy, on Radio National’s Media Report, on the one hand stated as a matter of fact that Australia was being turned into a police state, while at the same time lamenting that journalists are not as sympathetic towards terrorists as they used to be in the good old days. According to ABC answers to questions at Senate estimates, the ABC is now officially of the view that the government’s much needed counter-terrorism laws are ‘draconian’. That is the opinion of a small minority of civil liberties types and perennial critics of the Howard government. It is not the view of the government, nor of the Australian Federal Police or a host of counter-terrorism experts. For the ABC to adopt the policy position of one side of a debate is a disgrace.
The ABC has been forced to admit that its reporters have presented accusations of mistreatment made by terror suspects as matters of fact. Lateline has a policy of always referring to the war on terror as the ‘so-called war on terror’. It gives a carte blanche platform to the divisive and partisan Robert Fisk, who also used an ABC platform to encourage the wild conspiracy theory that the United States itself was somehow responsible for the attacks of September 11.
The ABC program Four Corners has recently peddled the far left-wing view that the al-Qaeda terrorist al-Zarqawi is a creation of the United States. The ABC refuses to call an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber who blows up a cafe or bus full of innocent civilians a ‘terrorist’. The ABC still has as a guiding principle in its news and current affairs style guide the hackneyed old cliche: ‘Remember, one person’s terrorist is usually someone else’s freedom fighter.’ Whose freedom is Osama bin Laden fighting for? The Melbourne radio broadcaster Jon Faine recently interviewed an Indonesian apologist or supporter of the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah. During the interview, Mr Faine made this reference: ‘Mr Osama bin Laden’, obviously intending some respect to the terrorist bin Laden.
The ABC has been forced to admit to a range of breaches of its editorial policies and style guide which show that it takes sides or at least has created the perception that it takes sides with the following: left-wing political parties, David Hicks, left-wing American activists Cindy Sheehan and Scott Parkin, and the causes celebre of immigration activists. Just look at the way it always refers to immigration activists as ‘refugee advocates’. The ABC has been forced to admit a range of indiscretions in terms of promoting trade union protest activities in news bulletins, in contravention of ABC rules, including time and place of protest and even the 1800 number. All this when the ABC actually has a policy which bans reporters from using the expression ‘strike action’. Tony Eastley on AM presented Gough Whitlam’s view of the dismissal—that it subverted the Constitution—as a fact, not as the highly partisan and contested opinion that it is.
Furthermore, I am still waiting for the ABC management to provide a coherent answer to the many questions raised about the employment of one Lindsay McDougall, one half of Jay and the Doctor on Triple J breakfast. This person mounted an offensive personal campaign against the Prime Minister during the 2004 election, including putting together a musical compilation with one song titled Johnny Howard, take a gun to him. This venal behaviour was rewarded with part-time employment at the ABC. After the election, Mr McDougall then announced his decision to campaign hard to stop the coalition being re-elected in 2007. This is my paraphrasing. His actual words are not fit for this chamber. This led to the offer of a full-time position on Triple J and, ever since, Mr McDougall has exploited the opportunity to continue his partisan political crusade against the Howard government. Ministers and policies are regularly ridiculed, all at taxpayers’ expense.
The ABC had a wonderful opportunity at the time of the release of the Latham Diaries when five senior figures from the ALP, including its president, were interviewed on current affairs programs. They had a wonderful opportunity to ask the one really hard question that the Latham episode continues to pose for the ALP: what does the selection of Mr Latham as leader say about the judgment of the parliamentary Labor Party? Do you think that question was asked? Not once. Instead we got examples like Kerry O’Brien’s dorothy dixer to then party president Barry Jones, in terms of the way Mr Latham portrayed the ALP: ‘Is this the Labor Party you recognise?’
ABC programs make a whole range of attacks on the faith of Christianity but not other religions. The ABC provides a very biased coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a recent example of that claim, it stated that last month’s suicide bomb attack in Israel was ‘the first since Hamas won control of the Palestinian parliament’. That was a suicide bomb attack in which a Palestinian terrorist, dressed as an Orthodox Jew, blew up four innocent Israeli civilians who stopped to give him a ride. The ABC has officially taken the Palestinian side of the debate on the highly contentious issue of whether events at Jenin four years ago were an Israeli massacre. It hides the truth about the Hezbollah TV station, Al Manar. Australian soldiers serving our country in Iraq are on so-called ‘active service’, according to the ABC. TV presenters in Sydney were told not to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day because ‘the ABC doesn’t do World Aids Day either’. Evidence at estimates shows the ABC portraying Mrs Howard and Mrs Bush as racists.
The duty of the board is ‘to ensure that the functions of the corporation are performed efficiently and with the maximum benefit to the people of Australia’—that is, all Australians, not the sectional interests, some of which I have raised today. When the ABC news boss, Mr Cameron, was asked at Senate estimates about a journalist who had posed the question: ‘Do we’—that is, the ABC—‘need to get rid of the federal Liberal government?’ he was also asked whether it was the official policy of the ABC to get rid of the federal Liberal government. He replied that he would have to take the question on notice. We are still waiting for the answer. Judging from the activities of the ABC, the answer is clearly yes. If there is any threat to the independence of the ABC, it is not from the sensible and long overdue reform to the governance of the ABC board. It comes from the pernicious left-wing influence that permeates far too much of the ABC’s biased and unbalanced coverage.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-05-09,"—I am a bit taken aback by that contribution to the debate and I will leave the individuals who suffered such a personal attack to defend themselves. It was a quite extraordinary attack on individuals which, no doubt, will be pursued in the public domain. I rise to contribute to the debate about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006, which is before us in the Senate at the moment and which we on this side of the chamber know is a sad attempt by the Howard government to actually undermine the efficiency, integrity and independence of Australia’s national broadcaster—and that is perhaps what is reflected in the words of the previous speaker.
The ABC was established in 1932 and today it is one of Australia’s national icons. It began as a radio network, expanding over time to encompass television, print media and online services. It does not matter whether you live in metropolitan or rural Australia, you can see or hear the ABC. The Australia-Pacific television services even broadcast to Australians living in some overseas locations. During World War II, the ABC gained a reputation for delivering an authoritative and independent news bulletin to Australians across this huge continent. In the postwar years, the quality and quantity of ABC programming was expanded dramatically. Light entertainment, sports and talkback were added to the roster. In the fifties the ABC increased the number of journalists and broadcasters dedicated to coverage of rural affairs.
In late 1956 the ABC started regular television broadcasts from Sydney and Melbourne, broadcasting the Olympic Games from Melbourne. Then in the sixties and seventies we saw news and current affairs dramatically influenced by an expanding social and intellectual awareness in the community. In 1961 ABC TV started a weekly current affairs program, Four Corners, and a new, vigorous investigative style of reporting political and social issues began. 1967 saw the introduction of a new weeknight current affairs program, This Day Tonight, alongside its radio counterpart, PM. The era also saw such pioneering television shows as Six O’Clock Rock, Hitscene and Countdown, as well as The Science Show on ABC Radio.
As we all know, this is the era that produced arguably one of Australia’s greatest news and current affairs reporters, Richard Carleton, who spent a quarter of a century at the ABC, working on This Day Tonight, State of the Nation and Nationwide, and he fronted the Carleton-Walsh Report, which featured Richard’s unique political commentary. With his death on Sunday, Australia lost a great personality and a dynamic journalist. I am sure that everyone in this place joins together in expressing to his family our deep regret at his death.
The 1980s and beyond saw significant restructuring at the ABC. Indigenous affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs all expanded quite significantly. During its 74-year history, the ABC has helped to define and evolve Australia’s national identity. When the Howard government came to power in 1996, it immediately reduced the ABC’s operational grants by 10 per cent—an attempt to curtail the ABC’s political coverage via its news and current affairs divisions. By attempting to abolish the staff-elected director position, the Howard government again seeks absolute control over the ABC board and, as such, control over programming and policy.
The ABC, particularly in its current affairs programming, has been consistently open, honest and critical in its analysis of the Howard government, and I know that this rankles those sitting on the benches opposite. The staff-elected director is the only position on the ABC board whose appointment is completely transparent. Its abolition would open the way for yet another government-appointed director to the board.
Section 8 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 outlines the duties of the board:
It is the duty of the Board:
to ensure that the functions of the Corporation are performed efficiently and with the maximum benefit to the people of Australia;
to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation;
to ensure that the gathering and presentation by the Corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalism ...
It is my strong belief and the belief of those on this side of the chamber that abolishing the staff-elected director and deputy staff-elected director positions can have only one result: the ABC board will no longer be able to maintain the independence and integrity of the ABC. Abolishing the staff-elected position removes the only non-government-appointed member of what is already a politically stacked board. It has historically been the case that the staff-elected director is often the only person on the board with extensive broadcasting experience. So eliminating the staff-elected position on the board eliminates essential knowledge of the ABC’s core business.
One submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill had the following to say:
The ABC plays a critical role in our Australian society in being a truly independent voice in an environment where most of the media is owned and controlled by ‘Big Business’ and vested interests. Witness the ‘hype’ surrounding Kerry Packer’s death and the power wielded by the Murdoch empire.
It would be ironic if the one elected member of the ABC is cast aside in favour of yet another Government appointee. For the ABC to remain truly independent it needs to be a ‘voice of the people’, a role filled by the staff-elected director.
Let us make no mistake about it: the ABC is under attack from the Howard government. During Senate estimates last year, the ABC revealed that, in real terms, it has lost $51 million per annum from its budget since the Prime Minister came to office. The Prime Minister has an obsession with the ABC. The ABC’s funding cuts have had a dramatic impact on its ability to fulfil its charter obligations. This is particularly evident in the production of Australian drama. Production of local adult drama totalled only 20 hours last year—a major decline from the 102 hours broadcast in 2001.
ABC Rural has also suffered under the Howard government’s funding cuts. ABC local radio plays an integral part in the lives of regional Australians. It is often the only source of reliable news and information for people in rural and regional Australia, particularly during times of crisis such as bushfires. The ABC rural department’s flagship program, Country Hour, is now in Guinness World Records as Australia’s longest-running radio program, last year celebrating 60 years of rural broadcasting. The essential services that the ABC provides to rural Australians are under threat because the Howard government refuses to adequately fund the ABC.
The Howard government made a promise during the 2004 election to review the adequacy of the ABC’s funding. The minister appointed KPMG to undertake this review. The government has received KPMG’s report, but the minister refuses to release it. What has the government got to hide? Perhaps it found that the ABC is chronically underfunded. The Australian people deserve a world-class public broadcaster and they are entitled to a proper debate about the level of funding required to achieve that. Instead, this government stifles debate as it works towards its goal of destroying the ABC. Senator Coonan claims the report has not been released because it is a budget input. Australian taxpayers are not so easily fooled. They will be watching tonight’s budget announcement with keen interest. After 10 years of watching—
—Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, I raise a point of order. I fail to see what relevance these comments have to the matter before the chamber. We can all have the debate about funding et cetera at some other time and I am happy to have that. But I do not believe this is relevant to the matter before us.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I think Senator Ronaldson would be aware that those of us present on this side of the chamber sat through an extraordinary contribution from the previous speaker that had absolutely nothing to do with the specifics of this debate. If we are going to play the game of impatience then we can play it. We were very patient here during what was an extraordinarily insulting contribution, so we might just like to calm down.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: quite frankly, what the opposition choose to do when those on this side are speaking is entirely up to them. I again bring to your attention that I think this is totally irrelevant.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senators, this is a bill about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and it is a wide-ranging debate. There is no point of order.
—There has been speculation that the ABC may receive extra funding this evening, earmarked for producing local content programs. If this speculation turns into reality in tonight’s budget then it will certainly be a good thing for the ABC and long overdue. The government should be providing the ABC with the funding it needs to be a leader in the transition to digital TV in Australia. It should be providing the ABC with the funding it needs to boost coverage to underserviced areas of rural and regional Australia.
Earlier this year the government began softening up the Australian people to the idea of advertising on the ABC. The government went to the last election with a promise to maintain the prohibition on advertising. Does the government intend to honour this election promise it made to the Australian people? If not, why not? The Australian taxpayers are certainly entitled to know the truth about that issue as well.
With the introduction of this bill, the government has moved its attack on the ABC up another notch. Over the past 10 years the government has stacked the ABC board with its political mates, so much so that there is a clear political bias amongst the current board members. As a result, many Australians—particularly those living in rural and regional Australia, where the impacts of the government’s funding crunch have been particularly devastating—have lost confidence in the independence of the ABC.
The staff-elected position on the board of the ABC is the one and only appointment that the Prime Minister has no direct control over. Naturally, he is seeking to remove it. The staff-elected director is a valuable and important position on the ABC board. When one looks at the current board, the staff-elected director, as I said before, is often the only person with operational experience. The staff-elected director is often the only person with the skills, knowledge and background to question advice from the ABC’s executive. But the Prime Minister does not care about the future of the ABC. He does not care about appointing people to the board who have experience in public broadcasting. What he does care about is appointing his ideological mates to the board—people who have no understanding of the whole charter of public broadcasting.
Labor believes that vacancies should be advertised and a rigorous merit based selection process should be followed in appointing members to the ABC board. Certainly, under Labor an independent selection panel will shortlist suitably qualified applicants. Under Labor, the ABC will remain independent of the minister. If the minister does appoint a non-shortlisted candidate, he or she would actually be required to explain the reasons for that to the parliament and the Australian people.
Senator Coonan claims there is a conflict of interest for the staff-elected director. She believes the staff-elected director will place the interests of ABC staff ahead of the interests of the ABC as a whole. Frankly, that is an insult to ABC staff and it really demonstrates the government’s low opinion of the ABC. Another submission to the Senate inquiry succinctly summed up this insulting assertion: ‘There is another view: an elected board member has an operational perspective that those outside the organisation cannot have. This provides a more balanced view when deciding policy issues. It is important that decisions made by the ABC board are as completely informed as possible, since such decisions potentially affect all citizens.’
In the second reading speech to this bill, the minister said:
Despite the abolition of the staff-elected Director position on the ABC Board, the Government expects the ABC Board and management to continue to take the interests of staff into account in its deliberations.
On the one hand, the minister says the staff-elected director position must be abolished because an ABC staff member will take the interests of staff into account during deliberations, then on the other the minister asserts that the board will be expected to take into account the interests of staff after the staff-elected director position is abolished. You cannot have it both ways, Minister. Page 21 of the ABC’s 2005 annual report states:
A critical point has been reached. Unless adequate funding is secured for the coming triennium, the Board will be faced with a range of fundamental questions about the extent and quality of ABC programming and services.
The Howard government should join Labor in recognising the ABC as a national asset, not an opportunity for cronyism. It should also end its extreme industrial relations campaign and recognise that the staff-elected director of the ABC is not elected to the ABC board as a union delegate. The staff-elected director does not sit on the board—and is not elected to the board by the staff of the ABC—to put the industrial interests of staff to the board. That would be the managing director’s role.
The Senate inquiry heard no examples of actual or potential conflicts of interest from current or former staff-elected directors. It is an insult for the minister to claim that the staff-elected director is incapable of acting independently—as is required of all directors, not just the staff-elected director—in the best interests of the ABC as a whole. By using the Uhrig report as the sole reason for presentation of this bill to parliament, the government does a great disservice to both Professor Uhrig and the ABC. Unfortunately, Professor Uhrig’s terms of reference were completely distorted, leading to widespread criticism that Uhrig’s focus was misplaced. Former chairman of the ACCC Professor Allan Fels and journalist Fred Benchley both argued that the report was ‘basically a business wish list’. The Uhrig report focused on the need for effective dialogue with business, failing to highlight the need for protection of regulatory agencies from the threat of regulatory capture. It also failed to highlight the need for the scrutiny of statutory agencies through the Senate estimates process. So, unfortunately, Professor Uhrig and the ABC were failed by this government through incomplete terms of reference. It is in the best interests of the ABC and its charter, and the ABC’s obligations under that charter to the Australian people, that the staff-elected director’s position remain.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-05-09,"—Unless I am mistaken, I do not think that Senators Webber or Stephens were actually at the inquiry, but if you were then I offer my humble apologies. Given the fact that I actually have not heard them complaining about that comment, I assume that they were not. How Senator Stephens can then wax lyrical about what evidence was given at the committee, I am not entirely sure. But anyway, leaving that to one side, I actually was at that committee hearing, and I did not hear any semblance of evidence given that would indicate that there is any case for the retention of the SED—the staff-elected director’s position. I heard not one ounce of evidence that would substantiate that, and I think what we have seen clearly today is that the ALP is prepared to put good corporate governance to one side in an attempt to curry favour with the ABC staff and with certain ABC journalists. I think that is a very poor reflection on it.
I very strongly support the majority report by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. There are a number of matters I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate in support of that position. The first is that staff matters are the domain of the organisation, and they are not the domain of someone apparently representing them on the board. There is a complete structure within the ABC, right up to the managing director, for staff matters to be addressed by the organisation. If that fails, the unions—who appeared at the hearing—made it quite clear that they were there to represent the staff interest. Indeed, they were a little bit miffed when it was suggested to them that it might be the role of the staff-elected director. In fact, they were more than a little miffed with that accusation.
—We will have to see about that.
—Indeed, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells said, they will have to see about that. The other interesting point on this matter is that SBS does not have a staff-elected director. I have had no representations from the SBS staff that they believe there should be a staff-elected director, not one.
—It would not matter if you did.
—I will take the interjection. Surely if this matter is so important then we would have heard from SBS, either at the hearing or in an attempt to approach government members on the committee and say: ‘Look, we think we should have one; we’re supporting our colleagues at the ABC.’ There was not one word from SBS on this matter. The third matter is—and I have heard it from Senator Stephens and Senator Webber—the reflection on the current appointed board members: that the board is stacked, that its members are not independent, and that somehow the board is not operating in the interests of the ABC.
The greatest critic of this legislation, Quentin Dempster, who did appear—and, Senators Stephens and Webber, had you been there you would have heard these comments—acknowledged that there is no evidence that the board members are not independent. The person who came to those hearings determined to destroy this legislation admitted that the board members are independent. So, all of a sudden, one of your main arguments in defence of the SED is out the door because one of the main opponents of this legislation acknowledges that the board members are independent. In relation to independence, I will read a press release from ABC chairman Donald McDonald on 24 March. I will give the full quote so that there is a semblance of fairness:
I have worked with three Staff-Elected Directors and each has sought to make a contribution to the ABC Board—
well, so they should have—
Inevitably there has been a tension between the expectations placed by others on their role and their established duties as directors of a corporation.
The fourth point I want to raise with the chamber is that Mr Dempster acknowledged that the board members are not only independent, and therefore fulfilling their role, but also required by the legislation to fulfil that role. I will read from section 8 of the ABC Act 1983:

Duties of the Board

(1) It is the duty of the Board:
(a) to ensure that the functions of the Corporation are performed efficiently and with the maximum benefit to the people of Australia;
(b) to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation ...
This is the nub of the problem and I am afraid that this is where the ALP, in an attempt to curry favour with certain people within the ABC, as I said before, have failed to understand the basic principle of the argument in relation to this matter—that is, the threat to that independence: the compromise associated with the SED position. This was discussed at length in the Uhrig report and I will briefly again refer to that report. For those who might be listening or reading it later on, this question is about representational appointments—as in the staff-elected director’s position. I read from the report:
The review does not support representational appointments to governing boards as representational appointments can fail to produce independent and objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing.
Indeed, we had further evidence—and my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells referred to this—from Professor Stephen Bartos from the National Institute for Governance. I quote from a letter that he submitted to the inquiry.
That said, the Uhrig Report is an accurate reflection of commonly accepted practice in Australian corporate governance. In this country we have applied a model of governance that does not favour representative appointments. In my own work on public sector governance ... I also note the difficulties of representative appointments—
he quotes, and I presume this is from his work—
(“It can be difficult for a person appointed because of a link to a particular industry, community or lobby group to divorce themselves from the political role of representing that group to the public sector body to which they have been appointed. It will, however, be to the detriment of the good governance of that organisation…”).
That is further evidence of the foolishness of the ALP’s position in relation to this matter.
There is inherent conflict. The chairman of the ABC board acknowledges publicly that inherent potential for conflict. We had the resignation of one director because of the potential outcomes of the issue I raised before. Indeed, it was very interesting that at the hearing we had three staff-elected directors in one corner and one in the other corner. Those who were at the hearing will know who I am talking about. It was fascinating to hear the one who was not in the corner with the other three talk about his approach to the matters that were raised in relation to appropriate protocols to ensure that you do not have the resignation of directors because of their concerns about confidentiality issues and the leaking of board documents. That former director said that he could see no reason at all for appropriate protocols to be signed to enhance the good corporate governance of that organisation.
This is a folly of the ALP. As I said before, it is designed to curry favour with certain sections of the ABC. Good corporate governance determines that we proceed with this legislation. Indeed, I have some interesting comments from Michael Duffy, the former Minister for Communications, back in 1985, when he reinstated the ABC staff-elected director. As was indicated earlier, they did not have a staff-elected director from 1932 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1983. So this notion that we are ripping away a longstanding SED is absolute, patent nonsense. The big mistake that Michael Duffy made was to bring the SED into this legislation again. But he said in his second reading speech:
The provision does not widen the categories of the Corporation’s business activities; it modernises its corporate structure and enables it to join with the private sector in the furtherance of its activities in a more modern business like way.
The mistake that Michael Duffy made in 1985 was that he was prepared to bow to the demands of the ABC staff—unions, probably—and some representatives rather than putting in place the corporate governance structure that he gave lip-service to in his second reading speech. This legislation should go through. It is good legislation and I support the majority report.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2006-05-09,"—First of all, I say that the arguments that we have heard from the other side of the chamber are appalling in seeking to justify what is a blatant political act. Neither Senator Ronaldson, in his usual loud, aggressive manner, nor Senator Fierravanti-Wells addressed at all the substance of what the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 is about. I heard a lot of bagging of the ABC and the way in which it reports particular stories, but never once did Senator Fierravanti-Wells address or attempt to address in her contribution the issues of substance in this bill.
This bill has nothing to do with good corporate governance. If it did, we might treat seriously it and the arguments that were presented by some of the senators on the other side. But it has nothing to do at all with that. This is another instalment by the government in union bashing. The government have sought from 1996 and all the way through to systematically remove from any boards, government or otherwise, union representatives or representatives of workers—many of them were representatives of workers and did not represent unions in that context. The government have done it to the Austrade board, they have done or are now seeking to do it to the ABC and they have done it to a whole range of other boards. It has been a systematic part of the union-bashing agenda.
The Prime Minister struts the country, proudly arguing his credentials as a representative of the workers—Howard’s battlers—and looking after their interests.
—We did not put a million of them out of work.
—But he is not prepared, Senator Vanstone, to give them a voice in saying how their organisations or corporations should be run. In fact, he has quite deliberately set out to remove any voice they have in that respect. He has set out to restore absolutely the managerial prerogative as the central focal point upon which companies in this country are run, and this is simply another step in that process.
If the government were really serious about addressing the issue of good governance, it would end the practice of stacking the ABC board with its cronies. You only have to look at the list of people who have been appointed by this government to see the political bias of the individual. The current chairman is a very close friend of the Prime Minister. Michael Kroger is an ex-president of the Liberal Party in Victoria. Janet Albrechtsen—I do not think I need to explain her credentials; you only have to read her articles in the Australian to know what side of the political fence she is coming from. They are all appointments by this government to create a particular bias on the board.
Since 2003, Labor has argued that there should be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. What is wrong with that approach? What is wrong with having a situation where the appointments are open and transparent? What is wrong with having an approach where vacancies are advertised on clear, merit-based selection criteria? An independent selection panel should conduct a short-list selection process. The selection of the short list would be independent of the minister. If the minister does not appoint a short-listed candidate, he or she should have to table in parliament a formal statement of the reasons for departing from the short list. That is a reasonable proposition: to justify why you do not deal with the people who are put up as priority candidates.
They are only some of the issues that could be addressed by the government if they were serious about introducing good corporate governance into the ABC. But this is not about good corporate governance. This is about preventing people in the ABC from having a genuine voice in the way in which that institution is run. We know the pressures that are and have been exerted on that organisation internally. We know some of the dictates that have been issued by senior management in the ABC about the way in which reporting will take place. We know that there have been specific directives issued by the head of news and current affairs, a Mr John Cameron, as to how the government should be addressed and the particular language that should be used to refer to the government so as not to embarrass them. We know that the pressure on individuals at the ABC has been consistently turned up to force them to conform to a set of strictures which, I presume, are emanating from the board. And that has all been done in order to ensure that the ABC, when it presents news or current affairs in particular, presents it in a particular way to put the best possible face on the government.
That is what the agenda is about. Obviously one of the ways of ensuring that is to get rid of the independent voice of the board. I understand that the individual who turned up at the hearings, Quentin Dempster, has just been selected by the employees of the ABC to replace Ramona Koval as the staff-appointed director. I think that in his previous time in that position he did a reasonable job on behalf of ABC staff.
What the staff-appointed directors bring to the corporation is something the current management of the corporation does not possess in the main, and that is broadcasting expertise. There are two clear divisions in the ABC: there is the administrative or corporate division, which runs the organisation and is growing like a mushroom at the moment from what it used to be, and there is the other division, which contains the people who make the programs—the people who put the stories to air; the people who go out, collect the news, present the news and give Australians and Australia as reflective a message about what is happening in society as they can. I think they are operating under great difficulties but still provide as independent a message as you will get through any media outlet in this country.
It is very significant that staff are represented within the structures of the ABC. It is very significant that the ABC board does have that voice represented when it comes to make decisions about the way in which that corporation will be run, because without it there is a real danger that people whose lack of expertise in broadcasting, presenting stories and putting stories together will make decisions that make it difficult for the organisation to operate or that put bias into the nature of the reporting of that organisation. Having the independent director there, representing particularly the interests of the program makers, is a major brake against that sort of situation occurring.
Why do we want to get rid of them? Senator Ronaldson attempted to argue here—I would not say it was argued—that it is about good corporate governance. There is also an argument that, somehow or other, because Ms Koval would not sign a protocol she was not independent. I am not aware of any occasion when the staff-elected director on the ABC board has been told or instructed by a meeting of their peers that they had to act in a particular way. To my knowledge, there is no evidence of any such circumstance occurring. I do have a little insight into the ABC from time to time because of my relationships with people at the ABC, but I am not aware of any occasion at any time I have known people there when any of the staff directors have been issued instructions that they had to act in a particular way. They have been appointed by the staff, they have the goodwill of the staff and the staff expect them to act in the best interests of the organisation—and if they act in the best interests of the organisation then they would be acting in the best interests of the staff themselves. That has always been the approach that has been taken.
I know how much the minister, Senator Coonan, likes to please the Prime Minister. She has had a meteoric rise to fame since she jumped the fence from the moderates to the conservatives—to the Prime Minister’s faction in the New South Wales Liberal Party. She is now the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, and she is quite keen to please the Prime Minister in the way in which she handles her portfolio. But she cited the refusal of Ms Ramona Koval to sign the ABC board protocol in her attempts to justify the removal of the position.
Ms Koval has explained to the board and to the Senate committee that inquired into the bill that she sought independent legal advice in respect of the protocol, which she said was actually inconsistent with her legal obligation to act independently. She was actually being asked to sign a set of protocols which, as I understand it, her legal people were saying would be a restriction on her acting independently on the board. She was being asked to subscribe to something that would restrict her capacity to genuinely represent in an independent fashion the people who elected her to that position. I think it is perfectly justifiable that she refused to do so.
I just wish that some of the people who sit on the boards of directors of companies would read the companies act occasionally, reflect on what their responsibilities regarding good corporate governance are and act accordingly and take their position seriously in ensuring they act independently and on behalf of the shareholders of companies. If they did, we might not have had some of the fiascos that we have had in recent times with companies in this country. We certainly might not have had the fiasco we had with Westpoint, in terms of the super rip-off that has affected thousands of senior citizens who invested in that, thinking that they were laying a nest egg for the future, only for that nest egg to suddenly disappear. I wish that directors would sit down and think about acting independently and reflect on the requirements for them to operate as directors of companies or corporations in the same way that Ms Koval has.
The reality is that this is not about the leaks from the board. Who knows who leaks information from the board? The government are quite often keen to leak what happens in the cabinet room when it suits them. We already know three-quarters of what is in tonight’s budget. It has been in the papers for the last three days because the Treasurer has been telling us what is in it.
Why are we suddenly worried about a leak from the ABC board? How do we know that it was not the management of the ABC that leaked some of the stories about the dealings of the board? How do we know whether or not some of the people on the board did it deliberately to try and reflect the independent director in a bad light? No-one really knows. No-one can prove that Ms Koval or Mr Dempster—or whoever else is the independent director on the ABC board—was responsible for leaking, because there is no evidence. No evidence has been found or presented to suggest that any of the directors of the ABC board leaked any of the information that is supposed to have been leaked.
Quite frankly, the motivations behind this have nothing to do with the issue of good corporate governance. This is about removing what is seen by this government as another impediment to them being able to do what they want to do with the ABC. This is about another hurdle being pushed to the side so that they can move in and do whatever it is that they want to do with that organisation. That is what the agenda is here; that is what the agenda has always been with this legislation.
It is a pity that the government took a hardline decision. We know they took a decision in the cabinet room to get rid of workers’ representatives from organisations. I know that Tim Fischer, when he was Deputy Prime Minister, fought hard to retain the person on the Austrade board, because they were making a contribution. He had to fight vigorously to retain them. But most of the rest of them were shifted very quickly. This is an extension of that agenda. At heart, the government have an implied hatred for workers being organised and being represented independently. This is about ensuring that the managerial prerogative becomes the central focal point of how organisations are run in this country and that workers will go to work, do as they are told and accept it without any question.
As far as I am concerned, this amendment ought to be rejected by the Senate. I know it will not be; I know it will be carried; I know you will proceed to run your agenda at the ABC. People out there listening should be warned: if that happens, think carefully about the messages that you hear coming through your radio and television, because the truth is a whimsical thing these days in modern broadcasting.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-05-09,"—It is no surprise that we are here today looking at the attempt—and the successful attempt—by the government to remove the staff-elected representative from the ABC board. What has made me particularly angry is the fact that there has been an attempt to dress up what is clearly a political decision—and the government has every right to argue and present political decisions—to remove a director from the ABC board who is not appointed by the government. We have heard the extraordinary amount of passion which this particular decision is generating. In this chamber today we have had amazing arguments, which included things like people’s views about the whole way the ABC operates, interpretations of legislation and statements about what has led to the debate we are having today.
When the minister in March this year made the announcement that this was the intent and through the normal processes of the Senate there was formed a committee to look at the legislation, people in the community who are interested in the ABC again showed that they cared about decisions that impact on the ABC. In a very short time, over 50 submissions were received, mainly from people or organisations who had some particular interest in the ABC, such as people who had had the amazing privilege to serve on the board of the ABC in some capacity, some as staff-elected representatives and others who had other forms of involvement on the ABC board. When we talk about the ABC, a response from the community is generated. To some extent, the government was surprised by the degree of passion that came out in a number of the submissions and also in the direct commentary that was made during the gathering of submissions and in the giving of evidence.
It seems that every argument that is made about the role of the staff-elected representative on the board can be then turned around and used about the other members of the board, who are appointed by the minister. Some members of the government seem to think that there is some form of personal conspiracy because we do not always say that the managing director is elected by the other board members and not appointed by the minister, so let us get that on the table straightaway so that there is no allegation that we are misrepresenting the make-up of the ABC board. We know where the ABC board gets it basis to operate from: it is in the act, and we have had senators in this place talk about section 8 of the ABC Act, which clearly says that the board is there to work for the ABC. Then there are a whole lot of subsections which I will not go into, but people can examine them very easily and see what the legislation surrounding the formation of the ABC is all about. As for any other board in the country, there are particular expectations of and responsibilities given to those people who have the privilege of serving on the ABC board.
That is in another piece of legislation, which other members of this place are much more familiar with than I am, but I am going to quote from it to prove I have read it. It is the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, which is the legislation that sets out what people who are members of boards do—what their responsibilities are. That act requires that a board member of any body covered under the act must perform their duties on the basis that he or she:
makes the judgment in good faith for a proper purpose; and
does not have a material personal interest in the subject matter of the judgment; and
informs himself or herself about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent he or she reasonably believes to be appropriate; and
rationally believes that the judgment is in the best interests of the Commonwealth authority.
They are fairly direct responsibilities, and it is the responsibility of any person who wishes to serve on a board and is then fortunate enough to get that responsibility to know and to act within those constraints.
There are very clear penalties for any board member of any corporation who does not act according to those expectations. That seems to be the core point, because at the Senate inquiry there was no evidence that indicated that the board member on the current ABC board, or previous boards, who was appointed through a staff election had breached any of these requirements, nor was there any evidence, as we have heard from Senator Ronaldson, that any other board member who had been appointed by various ministers had breached those responsibilities. So what we had was amazing agreement, passionate agreement, that people who had the privilege to serve on the board of the ABC accepted their responsibilities, regardless of the process that led them to the position, and operated as they ought under board legislation as well as under the expectations of the ABC. There was, again, no evidence to indicate that any board member had breached their responsibilities.
However, because of the nature of the debate, because the minister had determined that there was a need to make this board more efficient by removing the one board member who is elected by the staff, the inference is that every single member of the board who had been elected through a staff process needed somehow to justify their performance. We had evidence given to the committee and statements in submissions that said it was necessary to reinforce the credentials, the credibility and the performance of every single staff-elected board member since this position was instituted in the early 1970s—we do know that a previous Liberal-National government in the Fraser years removed the position and then it was re-formed in the 1980s. Every single staff-elected board member—Marius Webb, Tom Molomby, Quentin Dempster, John Cleary, Kirsten Garrett, Ian Henschke and Ramona Koval—all had to somehow have their performance reinforced to prove that they had done the job and that they had been efficient.
I am not sure how many other board members served on the ABC boards over that time with these various staff-elected representatives, but there would have been many. I do not understand why their performance did not need to be justified and why their integrity did not need to be reinforced or questioned, but somehow those members who came through the process of staff election needed to be questioned about the role they played. The clear inference, by the way that this proposition has been brought before all of us, is that there is something not quite effective in any board member who has reached the position through a staff election. There is no evidence that that is accurate. In various submissions they have had numerous positions attributed to their actions, and I think that is a bit sad. I believe that a board should operate together and the fact that individual board members seem to have had attributed to their efforts particular positions in isolation, I think is a false judgment. I believe that every board member, being aware of their responsibilities and bringing their own experience, professionalism and expectations to the board table, works in concert to come up with a result.
However, it is clear on the public record that those members of the board who came through the staff election process all had exceptional qualifications in their professional work, in their ability to talk with other staff members and gain their support and, most particularly, in their commitment to their position as an elected representative on the ABC board. What I find most frustrating and most offensive in the process we are going through now is that that is being somehow tarnished and the role of these people is now being somehow questioned—the only way it is possible to have an effective, operational board of the ABC is to remove this particular position because of the way those people got their appointments. I find that false.
Where do we go? Of course the government has the numbers in the Senate. I hope that we will not see the kinds of personal attacks on the people who have served on the board that come out of a debate like this. It is clear that the Australian community wants members on the board of the ABC who get there openly, whose actions are transparent and who have a commitment to the ABC.
The Labor Party and the minor parties have put forward recommendations about alternative methods of ministerial appointment because there have been allegations, and we have heard them in the debate today, that governments of various flavours have had processes of appointing people to the ABC board—without any doubt about their effectiveness working there, because every minister would have that as the most important element of the decision-making process—that result in the appointment of people with varied backgrounds and from time to time very little personal experience of working in public broadcasting. That is not to say that they would not have the ability to acquire the skills and work very effectively on a board. But it is fair to say that people who are currently working in the environment, people who are now working in the ABC, would have the immediacy of the knowledge of the extra stresses, the kind of environment in which public broadcasting operates and the knowledge of the general activities that go on in the staff.
That is not to say that there is any confusion amongst the people who work for the ABC or those people who have been privileged to be elected by them to be staff-elected representatives on the board. They do not have any doubt about what their role should be. There was clear evidence to the committee that it was understood by the people who were staff-elected representatives to the board as well as by other people that they were not there to be some form of industrial representation or advocacy. I know from my own experience working in the public sector that there were numerous times when in the ABC itself there were differences of opinion over things that came out of board decisions and the expectations of various unions working in the ABC. But there was never any confusion about the staff-elected person on the board having any more responsibility than any other board member to look at the issues of staff entitlements. Hopefully, some of the members had very strong experience in the business world and understood human relationships and human resource management.
So the role of the board member was not in question. Nor was the expectation of the staff about the role of the board member. But this particular decision by the government to single out this representative position once again, as I have said, calls into question the integrity, the professionalism and the effectiveness of every single person who got onto that board by being elected by the staff. I find that very disappointing. It is also clearly not backed up by evidence of any decisions or processes that went on.
We have had read to the Senate as well as to the committee evidence put forward by Mr Donald McDonald, who talked about the tensions of board members, particularly those who were there through a staff election process. I believe that Senator Wortley said earlier that a certain degree of tension creates creativity. Indeed there is fact in that particular process. Naturally when you have seven, eight or nine people—depending on how many people actually turn up to the board meetings—sitting there debating such difficult issues as the ongoing struggle to maintain a strong public broadcaster in Australia, there will be tensions. There will be strong disagreements from time to time. But again I question whether drawing into the focus one particular board member on the basis of the process through which they achieved their appointment, and implying—if not directly and openly stating—that all tension in the ABC board has been caused by that particular board member, is patently false. But, again, the process we have before us of debating in this place indicates that that is the kind of message that has been given. I would hope that it is clear in whatever the government does say that there is no personal inference on any of the people who have served the ABC board so strongly.
The Senate inquiry minority report felt that there needed to be some comment about statements made about Ms Koval and the highly publicised decision about whether she would sign protocols or not. Ms Koval has made her position very public and it is on the public record. But it is sad that once again there was an attempt to attack her position and make that some form of cause celebre to indicate that she was not effectively fulfilling her role. But fulfilling the requirements of her job as an ABC staff-elected board member and the requirements of being on the board were not questioned or crossed by her decision not to sign those protocols. If there was a view by the board that her decision was inappropriate, then there were processes that could be followed rather than dragging through the whole process in the Senate any kind of inference that she was not fulfilling her role.
There is interest in this legislation. The government is always surprised by the degree of interest there is in the role of the ABC in the community. Certainly, there is interest among members of the staff of the ABC. We now know that Mr Quentin Dempster has just been successful in an internal election for the staff-elected member of the board. It may well be that he is never able to take up this term, but the volume of interest in the election was very high, and I think that reflects some of the commitment by people who work within the ABC to have this particular process maintained. It is not because of any view that this is somehow some special link that individual staff members have with the board but simply because, once again, the ABC in Australia has a managing process which involves having the staff-elected representative on the board with the same authority and expectation as every other board member, and in many ways that is personally empowering for all the staff.
We know that the government will pursue this particular process but we hope that this will not be the beginning of further attacks on the ABC. As Senator Murray pointed out today in his contribution, we know that there will probably not be support for various amendments that would look at changing the appointment process—numerous times these have gone up and numerous times they have been defeated. We want to maintain the special commitment that the ABC has to the people of Australia and the special privilege of all board members, regardless of how they get there, in maintaining the absolute independence and integrity of the public broadcaster. That is the commitment and the challenge to all members of the board. This diversion down a track, quoting a report that did not consider the ABC specifically—we know that; the evidence is there and I will not go over that again—and grasping the Uhrig report and pretending that that is the only basis for this decision colours the kind of trust that we hope would be in place if we are looking at an independent broadcaster. We have a challenge. I think it is sad that it is coloured by an attack on people who work in such a wonderful organisation. Please, Minister, when it comes to pushing through this legislation, make it very clear that there is no attack on any of the wonderful people who had the privilege of being staff-elected representatives on various ABC boards.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-05-09,"—I will take up Senator Moore’s invitation. There has never been from me any suggestion that the rationale for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 is about any particular person. I will in fact amplify that later on in my remarks. I hope I can conclude tonight. If I cannot, obviously I will seek leave to continue my remarks when possible.
I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate, whatever their perspectives. I acknowledge that there is a great deal of interest in this matter. The bill before the Senate amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 to abolish the staff-elected director and deputy staff-elected director positions. The position of staff-elected director is an unusual one amongst Australian government agency boards. Indeed, this is a significant part of the underpinning rationale for the government’s actions on this matter. In fact, at the ABC, interestingly, the position did not exist until 1975. It was abolished in 1978, reintroduced in 1983 and given legislative backing in 1985. The board of the other national broadcaster, SBS, interestingly and by contrast, does not include a staff-elected director.
The government is moving to reform the structure of the ABC board because the position of a staff-elected director is not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance and tension has surrounded the position on the ABC board for some years. The tension between the expectations of staff electing the director and the proper duties required of a director, I think, is clear. The potential conflict that exists between the duties of the staff-elected director, under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, to act in good faith in the best interests of the ABC and the appointment of that director as a representative of the ABC staff, elected by them, does of course throw up some conflict.
The election method creates a risk that a staff-elected director will be expected by those who elect him or her to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC where those interests are in conflict. In fact, as I understand it, Senator George Campbell said in this chamber that in his view the staff-elected director was there precisely for the purpose of representing the program-making staff. This matter was recognised—that is, the potential conflict and the undesirable consequences that that can give rise to—in the June 2003 Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, otherwise known as the Uhrig review. The review concluded:
The review does not support representational appointments to governing boards as representational appointments can fail to produce independent and objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing.
On a practical level, this has led to difficulties—and we do not shy away from the fact that there have been difficulties—in respect of board confidentiality. As has been well referred to in this debate and elsewhere, the current staff-elected director felt unable to agree to a revised board protocol that dealt with, amongst other things, the secure handling of confidential board information. This puts the staff-elected director in a conflicted position if there are expectations that confidential information made available to the director through their position on the board will then be made available to constituents, in potential breach of obligations to the ABC. I would have thought that this would be an untenable position for the board.
Tension surrounding the position on the ABC board has, as I have said, been manifest for many years. In 2004, in a very well-publicised example, this led to the resignation of a director of the highest calibre, experience and value to the ABC board, that being Mr Maurice Newman AC. Another former staff-elected director, Mr Henschke, confirmed during the recent Senate committee hearings that staff-elected directors are at times placed under pressure by staff to act in ways that are not consistent with their duties as directors. The government, then, is of the view that there should be no question about the constituency that ABC directors are accountable to. To resolve this problem, the government has decided to take the step of introducing the bill to abolish the staff-elected director positions.
A number of matters have been raised during the debate in the chamber and also in the hearings of the committee that looked at the bill. Senator Conroy, as I understand it, raised the issue that the findings of the Uhrig review that I referred to earlier in my remarks were not applicable to the ABC. The government does not agree with this assertion. The Uhrig review was given a broad brief and its findings are considered to be relevant across government. The terms of reference of the review were clear. I want to put on record a particular part of the review:
A key task was to develop a broad template of governance principles that, subject to consideration by government, might be extended to all statutory authorities and office holders. ... the review was asked to consider the governance structures of a number of specific statutory authorities and best practice corporate governance structures in both the public and private sectors.
Although the Uhrig review itself focused on particular agencies, its principles are considered generally applicable and all statutory authorities are being considered in relation to those findings. The proposed change in the bill is consistent with the Uhrig review’s conclusions about representative appointments. The position is also endorsed by Professor Stephen Bartos, who is a director of the National Institute for Governance. Professor Bartos said in his submission to the Senate committee that the removal of the staff-elected director ‘is consistent with the current corporate governance approach found in most Australian companies and increasingly in public sector bodies’.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-05-09,"—Tonight I wish to speak about the law in Australia and what I refer to as Western values. The purpose of this address is not to cast judgment or to set people against others. However, we need some debate about where current values are leading our society and the need for standards so that we are seen as an inclusive, generous and just society. At this time I would also like to acknowledge the work of Reverend Ian Morgan, whose autobiographical account of his survival as an RAF bomber pilot in the Second World War was quite remarkable.
It is the prevailing attitude today that civil liberty consists of the freedom to exercise the senses of the body and the mind without moral restraint, as long as such an exercise does not impinge on the enjoyment of others. Since the Second World War, offences once chargeable under the civil and criminal law in this country have either been legalised, allowed under licence, categorised for adult showing or tolerated. For example, foul language and violence of all kinds are shown on TV, pornography is widely available, gambling other than on a racecourse is licensed and used as a means for raising government revenue, euthanasia is openly advocated, adultery is no longer the basis for divorce and no-fault divorce has been instituted.
Up until the Second World War most of these things were considered to be in violation of civil law and against the good consensus of society. The fact that they are now legalised, tolerated, practised, accepted and encouraged is causing many people to question the direction in which our nation is heading. Some say Australia has sown the wind with respect to the decline in moral values and standards and is now reaping the whirlwind of rape, domestic violence, teenage pregnancy, family breakdown, child abuse, murder, armed robbery, burglary, delinquency by juveniles who do not know the difference between right and wrong, as well as vandalism.
Furthermore, we are seeing increased rates of white-collar crime, corporate crime, insider trading, massive tax evasion, embezzlement, computer and internet fraud, and money-laundering at high levels in our society. We also see corporate fraud ruining the lives of hundreds of Australians, stripping them of their life savings. We see boards of directors walking away from agreements because they think they can get a better or a higher deal elsewhere.
All these ills are symptomatic of a decline in values in Australian society. Legislation not based on ethical principles cannot solve what is in essence a moral problem, but running parallel to that is the fact that you cannot legislate for honesty. So the problem is that, where there are no fixed laws or principled conduct, the establishment of a stable society I believe is impossible—whether it be in a single nation or a group of nations.
I remind honourable senators that it was the decline in the values of morality and justice, and the ensuing chaos, that led to the falls of such great empires as the Greek and Roman, and that gave rise to communist totalitarianism under Stalin and to national socialism under Hitler, along with the excesses of those regimes. It is a matter of history, both ancient and modern, that whenever values of decency have been forsaken economic and civic chaos has resulted, followed by war in some cases, insurgency in others, often dictatorships and sometimes wars between nations.
I will take a moment to discuss Australian attitudes to such issues. Australia is a multicultural society and a multireligious one as well. In a multicultural society there cannot be differing systems of law to suit each culture because then there is no consensus concerning a system of principled law. Australia is now a nation with mixed ideas of what constitutes decent values. Everybody wants moral politicians making morally justifiable law, but any suggestion that we define those standards is routinely howled down.
So I remind you that the traditional and ancient Judaeo-Christian moral principles are multinational and suitable to be taught and practised by all nations—being suitable for multinational observance in the sense that they are also multicultural. Traditional principles, as they have been established under English common law over several centuries, do not destroy or interfere with indigenous culture, nationality or religion but regulate the conduct of societies in accordance with moral principles, which I believe are universal.
I think this debate is also relevant to the rise of the Family First Party. They are obviously a section of the electorate deeply concerned about the decline in family values in Australia. However, my concerns go beyond the family, important as it is, to every aspect of Australian life. There is also a message for Australian churches here. A lot of the traditional mainstream churches have seen attendance plummet, while Bible-believing churches, those who are not afraid to preach concrete values and standards of behaviour, have seen their attendance move in the opposite direction and skyrocket.
As I finish, I ask my fellow senators to consider: do we want a nation where absolute truth is in decline and where right and wrong are pragmatic values to be changed at whim? Do we want to discard the standards and principles which have made countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States such havens for liberty and freedom?
