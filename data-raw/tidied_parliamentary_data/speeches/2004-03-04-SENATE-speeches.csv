"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-04,"—I have had a couple of representations—and I am sure that they have gone to other members—from legal commentators or members of the legal community and I want to simply ask the minister about those and the criticisms contained in those on the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organ-isations) Bill 2003. The first is from Mr Joo-Cheong Tham, an associate lecturer in the School of Law and Legal Studies at La Trobe University. It is headlined `Opposition to the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill' and begins:
I am an associate lecturer at the school of law and legal studies. Since the September 11 attacks in America I have intensively researched Australia's counter-terrorism laws. I have also participated in the debate surrounding these laws and appeared at the various parliamentary committees inquiring into such laws.
He goes on to say that he understands that the bill is about to be debated and that the Labor Party will support it. He then says:
This bill, if passed, will allow the proscription of organisations simply by virtue of the federal   Attorney-General being satisfied that the organisation is `directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of terrorist acts'.
He goes on to say:
I urge you and your party to maintain its firm opposition to this bill for the following reasons: (i) the bill is unnecessary because the government presently has the power to proscribe organisations. The Criminal Code Act 1995 presently empowers the government to proscribe an organisation if such an organisation has been identified by the United Nations Security Council as a terrorist organisation. More importantly, the government has at its disposal extensive proscription powers. Under part 4 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 the Foreign Minister, if satisfied that an organisation is engaged in terrorist acts, can list it with the result that the assets of this organisation become frozen. Such freezing invariably means that the listed organisation is shut down. My research into the proscription regimes in Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America clearly demonstrates that the banning powers available under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 are the broadest found in the anglophone countries. This is simply because this act does not define the meaning of terrorist acts; it leaves it to the Foreign Minister to apply his subjective understanding of what constitutes a terrorist act or terrorist organisation in the banning of individuals and organisations. Unsurprisingly, the breadth of this regime has led to extensive usage. To date 342 individuals and 141 entities have been banned under this regime. For instance, Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba have been banned under this regime for more than two years.
Before going on to the next point in Mr Joo-Cheong Tham's letter, I ask the minister: isn't it so that the government presently has the power to proscribe terrorist organisations? What advantage over those present powers is built into the current legislation? ",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-04,"—I understand that the legislation that Senator Brown refers to is in regard to the financing of organisations. That is something quite different to what we are talking about here. What we are dealing with here is the membership of organisations. The legislation Senator Brown refers to deals with the financing of organisations. I understand that the penalty involved there entails a maximum of two years imprisonment. I will correct that if that is not right, but I understand it to be the case that that is the maximum. It deals with financing. It is a very different piece of legislation to what we are dealing with here. You really cannot compare them. It is like comparing apples with pears.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-04,"—Not so. As the associate lecturer in law at La Trobe University says:
To date 342 individuals and 141 entities have been banned under this regime. 
The second point he makes is:
The bill is unnecessary because membership and participation in a terrorist organisation are already illegal. 
This countermands what the minister has just said. The associate lecturer goes on:
Under the Criminal Code Act 1995, membership and other forms of participation in organisations judicially determined to have engaged in terrorist activities are criminal offences, punishable by severe penalties, which in some cases can be up to 25 years of imprisonment.
The only question left is: is the minister saying that the advantage of this bill is that it gets around the courts?",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-04,"—When Senator Brown says that these organisations have been `banned', they have been proscribed as organisations that you cannot finance. Senator Brown most probably will take issue with that, and prefer the advice of the associate lecturer at La Trobe University, but I can tell Senator Brown that that is the advice that the government has. The legislation he is talking about deals with the financing of terrorist organisations. What we are talking about here is something quite different. We are talking about the membership—someone who is a member of a terrorist organisation. They are two different pieces of legislation dealing with two different aspects of counter-terrorism.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-04,"—Unfortunately, the minister was not listening, so I will go to the second point again. Joo-Cheong Tham makes the point:
Under the Criminal Code Act 1995—
which we are dealing with here—
membership and other forms of participation in organisations judicially determined to have engaged in terrorist activity are criminal offences, punishable by severe penalties, which in some cases can be up to 25 years imprisonment.
So the point the minister makes is not valid. The point I made is that this law is aiming to get around Australia's judicial system. That is the point—and that is why it is obnoxious. The third point in this letter is that the bill confers arbitrary executive power: 
The bill, if passed, will confer arbitrary power on the federal government. First, the power is based on vague criteria. Second, it can be exercised on the basis of secret and untested evidence. Third, the applicable standard of proof is merely on the balance of probabilities and not the `beyond reasonable doubt' standard that customarily applies to criminal proceedings. Moreover, the bill only provides meagre review mechanisms. The key mechanism provided is a review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Such review, however, is likely to be ineffectual. It is limited to questions of legality, and does not extend to the merits of the decision to proscribe. Further, the courts have demonstrated a traditional reluctance to examine questions of national security after an executive decision has been made. The fact that this bill would confer arbitrary executive power was well recognised last year by Senator John Faulkner, the Australian Labor Party spokesperson for home affairs, when he said that `proposals to erode our freedoms and our rights— 
—A very fine fellow, too.
—I hear an interjection which I would agree with. The quote is:
 `proposals to erode our freedoms and our rights will ultimately erode our security as well. For this reason we do not accept, and will not accept, the government's executive proscription bill. We will not accept a regime of secret proscriptions of decisions in closed rooms of such significance and potentially destructive power in the hands of one person and one person alone. To have that kind of power exercised by one person in secret, particularly a member of the government executive, is not acceptable in a democratic society and should never be allowed on the statute books'. 
The fourth point in this letter is:
The bill, in conferring arbitrary executive power, risks undermining fundamental freedoms. The mere presence of such arbitrary executive power threatens to undermine political freedoms by chilling political activity. More than this, the arbitrary nature of power conferred by the bill means that its exercise is liable to lead both to mistakes and abuse. In either case, fundamental liberties like the freedoms of political thought and association are put in jeopardy. Any proposed anti-terrorism measures should be justified as being necessary in the campaign against terrorism. Moreover, it should not unduly trespass on rights and freedoms. This bill fails grievously on both counts and should be rejected.

I draw the committee's attention to a letter from the Law Council of Australia. It may help the progress of the committee if the letter were to be incorporated into Hansard. This letter is signed by Mr Bob Gotterson QC, who is the President of the Law Council of Australia. It says:
I write in relation to the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisation) Bill which has been the subject of recent public comment. 
The Law Council of Australia views with concern the recent developments in relation to this Bill, including an agreement between the two major parties to support the Bill on condition of a number of legislative amendments. 
It remains the Law Council's considered view that the new proscription powers contemplated by this Bill should be open to court supervision, to ensure the power is discharged effectively and fairly. Although a number of additional safeguards have been negotiated between the major parties, they do not address this basic concern. While the importance of an adequate legislative framework to respond to terrorist threats is undeniable, the Law Council has serious reservations in regard to this particular legislative development and its potential consequences both for basic rights of the citizens of Australia and for members of the legal profession who may be called upon to defend them.
I will be asking the minister to comment on both those key points. The letter goes on to say:
To summarise our view, exercise of the proscription power should be conditioned upon court action, preferably as a pre-condition to exercise of the power. As an alternative the power could be exercised provisionally for a limited period, say 30 days, with any extension of the period subject to court sanction.
As you will be aware, the powers contained in the Bill will allow the Federal Attorney-General to proscribe groups as `terrorist organisations' under Commonwealth criminal law.
The letter goes on to criticise the powers in the bill. I draw attention to a paragraph further down the letter, where it says:
While it is unlikely that any organisations truly involved in terrorist activities would seek the benefit of such judicial review, it would be an effective means of ensuring that people exposed to serious criminal liability through erroneous or unjustified listing of terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code would have the benefit of some measure of a priori judicial protection. On the other hand, making proscription a purely Executive act has been described by Dr Jenny Hocking in a submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considering earlier proscription proposals as: 
“subversive of the rule of law in its failure to allow for a trial in this aspect, it breaches the notion of equality before the law in its creation of groups for which the usual judicial process does not apply and it breaches absolutely the separation of powers in even allowing for such a use of Executive power.”
The letter goes on to say:
The Law Council urges caution in any expansion of the Attorney-General's power to list groups as `terrorist organisations' or to otherwise proscribe organisations under Commonwealth law. Any such power should be subject to opportunity for prior judicial review, and affected citizens should be afforded natural justice and due process as part of this exercise of Executive power. We have suggested an alternative of provisional exercise subject to court sanctioned extension. This alternative would facilitate immediate proscription where that might be needed in the national interest but would subject any continuation of the proscription to court sanction.
Finally, the Law Council speaks for members of the Australian legal profession who may be called upon to defend people affected by the proscription powers under consideration. In this regard, the Law Council seeks assurance that the proscription process will not abrogate or interfere with established legal protections such as the privilege against self-incrimination and legal professional privilege. While the protection of Australians against acts of terrorism must remain a paramount concern for the Commonwealth, as well as State and Territory governments, any revisions to the legislative framework for this protection should not interfere more than is absolutely necessary with fundamental legal protections currently enjoyed by Australians.
I trust you will give this matter your serious consideration.
I ask, indeed invite, the minister and Senator Faulkner to comment on either of those letters from the legal community.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1

He has not indicated that to the opposition, I note. I have not seen them. I think I made my position on this very clear in yesterday's debate. I accept that there are some differences between Senator Brown and me on this, apparently. As I said to Senator Brown yesterday, it is time for him to accept that he has won this argument with the government that the opposition and other senators have had. It is time to claim victory. One of the great things in politics, Senator Brown—not that I know much about providing advice to people—is that you have to know when you have won. I do not win very often. In my experiences in politics I have not had too many wins. But when I do win something I try to recognise it, claim victory and move on.
I am very happy to read the letters. I look forward to seeing them. They raise important issues and, as you know, I am very interested in them and I will look at them closely.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-04,"—It is incumbent on the government to get up and say something. As far as the comment from Senator Faulkner is concerned, I am not winning anything here. We are losing and this nation is losing. 
—You just do not re-cognise it.
—You can lead a horse to water.
—That is the point. It is serious and the minister might take it seriously. The fact is that this is a massive invasion of the rights of Australians. This is, for the first time in the history of parliamentary procedure that I am aware of, the granting of the powers of the courts and the parliament to an individual. It is a very serious matter. I will ask the minister specifically about the last paragraph in the letter from the Law Council, to wit:
In this regard, the Law Council seeks assurance—
from the government and/or the opposition—
that the proscription process will not abrogate or interfere with established legal protections such as the privilege against self-incrimination and legal professional privilege.
Does the minister give that assurance?",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-04,"—The assurance I can give is that the law will be administered in an appropriate manner and according to the legislation which has been enacted. The Law Council itself recognises that in some circumstances there have been changes to the law in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination and professional privilege—perhaps not so much the latter, but in relation to the legislation there have been provisions which deal with that. We will not deal with those here but I will just say to Senator Brown that the Attorney-General has a copy of this letter and, I understand, is replying to it. I have no further comments to add. I have outlined the government's position quite clearly. It is obvious Senator Brown disagrees with the government's position and will no doubt express that in the usual manner.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-04,"—Here we are in this chamber debating a critical piece of legislation. That reply from the minister says that the Attorney-General, who is totally empowered beyond the law to label community organisations as terrorists and to arrest individuals who are members of those organisations in Australia in the future on the basis of very vague definitional parameters, is writing back to the Law Council of Australia, presumably implying that the response to my question about this letter will be given to the public after this debate takes place. That is not satisfactory. We are here to determine on the basis of the information available and in debate whether this law should pass or not.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-04,"—So we have it that the government and the opposition have voted against the chamber being furnished with a letter from the Attorney-General responding to the Law Council of Australia on the important matters that I read out. That is a new low in a debate on such an important issue. We have a right, in this chamber, to be informed on the matters that are being raised. We have a right to know whether the time-honoured protections for people in the legal community are upheld in this law and there is no evidence that they are. We have a right to know that this law is of itself essential, because the argument is that terrorist organisations can be and have been put out of action in the past and will be in the future.
What is happening here is that the opposition is abrogating its responsibility and the government is bringing in a draconian law which has no place on the statute books of Australia. It is a disgraceful situation. The denial of the committee of a letter from the Attorney-General—a critical letter, an absolutely pivotal letter in this argument in the committee, a letter which is going to appear after this debate takes place—is a further hallmark of the descent into a loss of proper parliamentary control and review, which is the direction that laws are taking under this government. I could ask about other specific matters in that bill, but my questions are not going to be answered. The minister did not answer that one; he is not going to answer any more. He has the numbers. Labor has caved in and agreed to it and there the matter is going to end, but we will vigorously oppose this legislation and look at what opportunities there are further down the line to remove the repugnant components of it.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-04,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 4168:
(1)	Page 4 (after line 3), at the end of Schedule 1, add:
Intelligence Services Act 2001
5 Subsection 28(2)
Omit “7 members, 3 of whom must be Senators and 4 of whom must be members of the House of Representatives”, substitute “9 members, 4 of whom must be Senators and 5 of whom must be members of the House of Representatives”.
6 After subclause 14(4) of Schedule 1
Insert:
	(4A)	The Leader of the Government in the Senate must nominate at least one Senator who is a representative of a recognised political party that is represented in the Senate and does not form part of the Government or of the Opposition.
I referred to this amendment when I spoke earlier in committee about the concerns we Democrats have with the professed robust safeguards the minister speaks of. These are robust safeguards which the opposition consents to but which we challenge. One of those alleged robust safeguards is the purview which the minister has advised and referred to in terms of the role which the joint intelligence committee has in reviewing a listing and in reporting that to the parliament. But that body—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—is not in any real sense a parliamentary representative body, because it does not represent the parliament fully.
This amendment seeks to ensure that there is a more diverse and more representative composition of that committee. The committee itself is established under the Intelligence Services Act. That act provides that there must be seven members of the committee, four from the House of Representatives and three from the Senate. The members from the House of Representatives must be nominated by the Prime Minister after consulting with the Leader of the Opposition. The nominated members are then appointed by resolution of the House. Similarly, in the Senate, the Senate members are nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who must first consult with the leaders of recognised political parties which do not form part of the government. In making these nominations, the Leader of the Government in the Senate must give consideration to the desirability of ensuring the representation of various political parties. Despite the fact that there is currently nothing in the legislation to prevent the appointment of senators who are not members of either the government or the opposition, no such senator has yet been appointed.
It is our view that, given the crucial role which the joint committee will now play in relation to the proscription of terrorist organisations—its purview role, as the minister has referred to it—it is time to ensure that this committee is more representative and more diverse. It is our view that this will help to ensure and to provide for greater accountability of the government's power to proscribe terrorist organisations. We believe that it is too dangerous simply to leave the scrutiny of the legislation to major party representation, to the government and the opposition—both of whom, we would argue, have questionable records on antiterrorism measures.
This amendment provides that the Leader of the Government in the Senate must nominate at least one—but is not limited to one—senator who is not a member of either the government or the opposition. That is designed to ensure that the joint committee is not as exclusive as it currently is. It enables members of the crossbench to apply the same level of scrutiny to the activities of the joint committee as we do here in this chamber. The first part of the Democrat amendment is more of a pragmatic amendment which recognises that the government and the opposition are unlikely to want to give up one of their current places on the committee in order to facilitate this. What we are seeking to do here to facilitate that outcome is to ensure that the new requirement for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to nominate a senator from the crossbench occurs in that way. The amendment increases the number of members of the committee by two, thus enabling the opposition to retain their current number of members and ensuring that the government will retain a majority of the committee, as is required by the legislation. Our argument essentially is that, if parliamentary scrutiny is to be the primary accountability mechanism in relation to the proscription power, it is important that we ensure that it is genuinely parliamentary scrutiny and not simply, as it stands at the moment, scrutiny by the opposition.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-04,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 imposes severe and unreasonable new penalties on union officials and employees for noncompliance with commission or court orders under the Workplace Relations Act. There are a number of concerns about this bill, but I will start with its one-sided aspect. Whilst the bill talks about `officers or employees of registered organisations', in practice this simply means unions, and—whilst the government might have hoped superficially to demonstrate some level of balance—anyone who has practised in any way within the industrial relations field would understand that as a very obvious fact. Although registered organisations can and do include employer organisations, employer organisations do not engage in industrial action. Employers themselves engage in industrial action such as lockouts, but their employer organisations are not directly involved in such action and would not be affected by this legislation. This was confirmed by evidence to the Senate inquiry. The Australian Industry Group, for instance, admitted that they had never initiated industrial action. In answer to a question by Senator George Campbell about whether the offences in the bill were aimed at union officials or union employees, Mr Bennett, from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, replied:  
I think that is a fair description, yes. 
So on the government's own evidence, this bill aims to introduce severe new penalties for unions but it proposes nothing which might penalise employers engaging in illegal lockouts or other industrial action—a point I will come to later. It is appalling that the government has introduced 12 pieces of legislation into the parliament with one clear and consistent objective—to weaken the bargaining position of working Australians in negotiations with their employers. This government has consistently sought to intervene in workplaces relations issues on one side of the equation. That one side is obvious—that of the employers. I will come to that point later if I have the time. I hope also to address some of the comments made by Senator Santoro in his speech during the second reading debate on the immediately previous bill in this area. 
The one-sided imposition of new penalties on union officials and employees for noncompliance with commission or court orders under the Workplace Relations Act confirms once again this government's biased approach to industrial relations. The government is entirely unconcerned about any possible employer wrongdoing. Not only does it not care to adjust the legislation, but it does not care to enforce the current legislation—another point I will come to in a moment. 
The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations admitted to a recent Senate estimates hearing that it had initiated no prosecutions for nonpayment of employee entitlements with respect to the 2,419 complaints received from July to December 2003. It is no surprise that this legislation is only aimed at employees and officials of unions. Further, this bill is unreasonably punitive. The legislation potentially fines union officials and employees up to $2,200 for even the slightest slip with respect to a procedural direction or order of the commission. Being involved in a contravention triggers the punitive measures in the act, and this includes aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the contravention, inducing the contravention by threats, promises or other means, being in any way knowingly concerned or party to a contravention and conspiring with others to effect the contravention. A contravention can be of any order or direction of the commission or the Federal Court. Potentially, this could be as simple as procedural directions.
But of most concern is that the legislation provides for automatic disqualification from holding union office for up to five years for anyone who is fined under these provisions. That of course would deny union officials the right to earn a living if they get even a minor fine or a minor breach. There is no precedent for such far-reaching and extreme automatic disqualification. Similar provisions in Corporations Law apply only to a serious criminal conduct, in recognition of the seriousness of denying someone their livelihood. But of course the severity of these provisions is entirely consistent with this government's vehement hatred of unions. It believes anything is fair if it threatens and hurts unions, their officials or their ability to assist workers to bargain.
Another aspect of this legislation is that it will allow ministers to intervene in a way which could prolong disputes. This legislation allows the minister—not just the employer but the minister—to continue divisive legal proceedings long after disputes have been finished and the parties are trying to work harmoniously again. In this respect we know the government has form. The former minister, Mr Abbott, wrote to the automotive industry and told them that they were not muscling up enough in their negotiations on enterprise bargaining with trade unions, the AMWU in particular. Of course, we all remember Mr Reith's intervention, for instance, on the waterfront. Remember those images of dogs and men in balaclavas—this sort of provision would assist that further. 
I can recall the occasion some years back when I asked the department for their comprehension of how interventionist various ministers had been over time, and there had been no more interventionist minister in the industrial relations system than Mr Reith. This was under a government that has the rhetoric that we should allow the parties to sort these things out themselves. So its actions have been quite inconsistent with its rhetoric, but what its actions have demonstrated is that time and time again this government has sought to intervene on behalf of employers' interests. On the occasion I mentioned, the then Minister Abbott was very disappointed that his prophecy of rampant industrial disputation in the automotive industry in the context of some 1,400 enterprise bargains was not realised—the negotiations actually proceeded without industrial disputation. But with this legislation the government could intervene to inflame disputes even after a bargain has been struck. An interesting thing here is that the employers do not want these sorts of provisions; they fear the prospect of politicians getting involved in their affairs and they would prefer that that did not occur. Let us go to the little evidence to support the need for this bill.
—Where is the evidence for what you are saying.
—I will give you some evidence for what I am saying, Senator McGauran. I had some very recent evidence last week when we heard in the building industry inquiry from the Masters Builders Association of Queensland. It might shock you but in evidence before the Senate inquiry those employer representatives actually said, `We look forward to the prospect of Labor being able to institute its policy since 1996 to re-empower the commission to be able to be involved and settle disputes.' It is as clear and as stark as day. This is the problem with this government: it is not even going down the path of what sensible industrial practitioners say would help us effect what our industrial relations is meant to be there for and that is to settle disputes.
Let me go further to the little evidence to support the need for this bill. Legislation should not be brought before this parliament frivolously, and this is another bill that is doing just that. The Senate inquiry found that there was little evidence of a pattern of noncompliance with court or tribunal orders. Rates of industrial disputation—we hear about those time and time again from the government as well—are falling and the vast majority of industrial action complained about by the government is legally protected industrial action and would not be affected by this bill. The industrial action that is occurring is the legally protected industrial action within the system that this government created.
In the four-year period thoroughly examined by the department, it could only provide a list of 22 potential—and I stress potential—breaches of section 127 orders. Moreover, no finding of a breach was even made in a majority of these cases. Four years and 22 potential breaches, and no finding of a breach was even made in the majority of these cases. There are already a host of penalty provisions in the Workplace Relations Act as well as detailed provisions about what happens if commission or court orders are not complied with. But these apply, unlike these measures, to employers and to unions.
This bill rehashes provisions that were taken out of the government's Workplace Relations Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) Act 2002. They were taken out because they were totally unacceptable, and they remain totally unacceptable today. But dealing with these measures enables me to reflect on how Labor shares the Democrats' frustrations about a lack of a commitment by this government to the enforcement of employees' entitlements. The difference between our position and the Democrats' position, though, is that we do not believe a case has been made for a new regulatory body. We think the government should get more serious about ensuring that the current means of addressing these matters are being utilised, because there are already officers with clear responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Workplace Relations Act. They are the inspectors appointed under the act who are currently part of the Office of Workplace Services in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The office have a budget of $9.5 million per year, yet in the last six months of 2003 they did not launch a single prosecution in respect of any of the complaints they received during that period. So there is a regulator funded to the tune of almost $10 million per year. The question—and it is a very serious question for the Senate in this case—is: what are they doing? What are their instructions? Why are they not pursuing matters through prosecution? 
In respect of breaches of provisions of the act relating to industrial action by unions and employees, the evidence does not support the assertion that there is a problem. Labor do not believe that just because the government says there is a problem this means there actually is one. In fact, we have been encouraged by past conduct to conclude the contrary almost automatically. As I have already outlined, evidence to the Senate inquiry into this bill shows quite the opposite. Disputes are falling and almost all industrial action is legally protected.
Since I have some time remaining to speak to this bill, let me reflect on Senator Santoro's previous comments. Senator Santoro in his speech on the second reading on the earlier bill put forward that Labor, the Greens and, indeed, the Democrats could not claim a franchise for concern for the interests of workers and, indeed, for the role of unions. I thought it might be useful to run Senator Santoro through some of the history of these matters, of which I am sure Senator Murray is aware—certainly I am. Senator Murray, perhaps you and I are the only people who have been consistently through this process since about 1996.
—What about Senator Campbell? But he has left us.
—That is right. Now that we have Senator Abetz there is a new player, but obviously Senator Santoro needs to be informed in a few areas as well.
—Yes, but in a state parliament, Senator Abetz, and these issues have been matters of federal jurisdiction and the federal parliament for several years. When we dealt with the second wave of industrial relations reforms, the very comprehensive report that was produced by the Senate inquiry at that time reflected on a number of interesting issues. I have gone back to the joint statement that was prepared between the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party at that time, because I thought it gave us some very good issues to reflect on. At that stage we said:
The need to review the impact of the current Workplace Relations Act, as a major part of the Terms of Reference of this Inquiry, was agreed by all members of the Committee. It is therefore unfortunate that many important issues were not adequately canvassed in the Majority Report. 
The majority report was essentially the government report. It continued:
Labor and Democrat Senators agree that a number of matters need close consideration in the context of the operations of the current act. These include that;
	industrial relations law should include a social justice agenda—
There has not been much change there—
	all workers need to be covered by an industrial instrument.
	Australia meets its international obligations.
	the industrial relations system should be focussed on the prevention and settlement of disputes through negotiation in the first instance.
However, as we hear from employers time and time again, their ability to resort to the commission in the latter instance is what is becoming more and more problematic in how the system operates today. Senator McGauran, that was the example I gave you of the Master Builders Association in Queensland. It is their principle concern. Going back to the other principles that should be in place in the system, the list continued:
	the ability of workers to be able to balance their work and family lives must be promoted.
We know what little activity has occurred in that area, particularly since the interdepartmental committee leaked a report a couple of weeks ago. No activity has occurred. Even the interdepartmental bureaucrats are strongly recommending that to government, but there has been no action. The list continued:
	the needs of workers vulnerable to discrimination are adequately protected.
Unfortunately, this is not the case. There is one area where we have finally made progress—that is:
	adequate standards for Victorian workers are provided.
Finally:
	there is a strong and independent industrial relations commission.
So we have had one very small area of progress where we have removed the ghetto that existed for Victorian workers, but on all of the rest of those points we have had essentially no progress at all. Why is that, one might ask? The reason is the government's attitude. Let me remind Senator Santoro of some of the rhetoric that comes from those within his party. We cited this reference at the beginning of chapter 4, which related to issues pertaining to the standing of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Prime Minister said back in 1992:
As I've said before, I'm going to stab it ... in the stomach ...
He was referring to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This is the Prime Minister's attitude to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission: `I'm going to stab it in the stomach.' Yet, again, it does not represent the views that employers are arguing for. Their perspective was represented by Bob Herbert, who recently retired from the Australian Industry Group. This perspective was also put forward at the start of chapter 4 in this report. It stated:
Firstly, we do have a unique institution in this country. It has served us well for 100 years. You have to think long and hard about changing its role. We think that the balance that is now in the current legislation between conciliation and arbitration is about right.
But the government seeks to effect further changes. Why is that? There is another reference to chapter 8 that I thought was very interesting and perhaps Senator Santoro should contemplate this. Susan Halliday, who was appointed by the Prime Minister, John Howard, as the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, said this to a Senate inquiry in 1999: 
It is fair to say that many employers will say that they can now be trusted to manage their employees without a third party and, my goodness, I think I have even written that rhetoric. But the reality is that I know some who can be trusted and some who cannot, and often the ones who cannot are the ones where we have least coverage industrially to do something about protecting their workers, and that is what concerns me.
What concerned Susan Halliday on this occasion was that the government was quite happy to spout the rhetoric of a bargaining system when it knew that the bargaining system would leave some groups vulnerable. Where there was actually some industrial militancy, for instance, in the construction industry or the maritime industry, then it would seek to intervene. That is exactly what happens. There is no honesty in this government's industrial relations agenda. If it wants a bargaining system then let us have a fair one.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE WITH COURT AND TRIBUNAL ORDERS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-04,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 has provisions which first formed part of the Workplace Relations (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) Bill 2002 but were excised from the bill to facilitate its passage. We should recall that that bill is one of the only bills—apart from the youth rates bill, I think—which has been negotiated between the Labor Party and the government in the last eight years. These provisions were very much not to the liking of Labor then and are obviously not to the liking of Labor now.
The bill aims to ensure that officers and employees of registered organisations abide by the rulings of the Federal Court of Australia and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—an obviously commendable objective. But what does the detail say? Specifically the bill creates a number of new civil penalty provisions applying to the officers and employees of organisations who subvert an order or direction of a court or tribunal. It provides for the automatic disqualification of persons for five years—unless leave has been obtained from the Federal Court—from holding office, election to office or appointment to office if the court has imposed a pecuniary penalty on that person for matters outlined in the bill. It provides for the minister or a person authorised by the minister in writing to apply for a court order in respect of an alleged contravention of the civil penalty provision of the Workplace Relations Act. These are serious provisions and extend the powers under the act quite considerably.
We should note when we are debating these matters that there are already serious disqualification provisions in the Workplace Relations Act. It is not as if we are debating a situation where there is a void in the law or in the penalties. If we look at the current disqualification provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, they are, however, limited to offences that are criminal or relatively serious in nature. These include any convictions for fraud or dishonesty with penalties of imprisonment for more than three months, violence towards another person, intentional damage to property and a series of offences within schedule 1B. That series includes matters such as failing to comply with electoral official requests for information, interfering with ballots so as to commit electoral fraud, or threatening or discriminating against anyone seeking the conduct of an election for office. The Bills Digest correctly states that it is arguable that adding the failure to comply with civil obligation orders such as return to work orders will lower the threshold.
The government argues that this bill will provide more effective sanctions, yet we already have sanctions at section 178. The question is—and I think this was the theme of Senator Collins's speech—whether there are, if not intended consequences, unintended consequences which would severely limit the ability of union officials to do their job. That is the essential argument before us. We did touch upon the existing sanctions at section 178 in an earlier debate this week. The Democrats attempted to increase the penalties in section 178 in another bill, but both Labor and the coalition voted them down. There is an interesting swing around of positions on these things as we proceed through these bills. 
As I said in my speech in the second reading debate for the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003 yesterday, the Democrats do believe that the rule of law must apply and have supported, in many instances over the years, strongly enforcing the rule of law. If the law is being flouted and it is not a question of enforcement or the resources needed for enforcement, we will support stronger law. But increased sanctions must only be justified where there is sufficient evidence that a real and significant problem exists.
We are not presented with sufficient evidence, in our view. That does not mean that I am dismissing or condoning those defiances of the law that occur and the occasions where they occur. I am sensitive to the financial impact this can have on employers or industries. But ultimately it is the courts and sometimes the magistrates themselves rather than the judges that determine these matters. There have been instances where people who have damaged property have been brought before a magistrates court and have been either fined or let off, so the law is working. The question may be, of course, whether the penalties are adequate, but that is a different issue. We have to be realistic. We have to recognise that there needs to be a balance struck between preventing financial loss to the employer and causing the loss to employees of one of the weapons at their disposal, namely the weapon of direct action.
For the Democrats to even consider such a serious penalty as proposed in this bill, we would have to see evidence of rampant or repeat offenders of noncompliance of court and commission orders. As we have noted at other times, these matters are before the Senate committee inquiry into the Cole royal commission and its consequent legislation, and we do think that the conclusions of that committee should influence the view as to how much evidence there is of rampant or repeat offenders of noncompliance. We would urge the government to provide that committee with as much evidence on that front as possible. In a sense, this bill comes before it should and, in a sense, its considerations are also part of that bigger Cole issue. As discussed already in my speeches in two second reading debates to previous bills this week, the government has not provided us with sufficient evidence at this time, and we do not see that that evidence is in the public arena.
I want to briefly outline the concerns we have with the three proposed areas of the bill and then I want to go on to discuss the problems of the bill in the context of what I refer to as the bigger picture. I will start first with the scope of orders and directions for which offences and disqualification could apply. The proposed provisions of this bill apply to any order or direction of the commission or court. In their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, the ACTU argued that `orders and directions' were ill defined in the Workplace Relations Act and used loosely in the functioning of the Industrial Relations Commission. This, the ACTU argued, may lead to uncertainty, as parties will not know whether an order or direction of the IRC or a court is an order or direction attracting a civil penalty for noncompliance. 
If we are going to envisage a situation where serious penalties shall apply, the circumstances under which those penalties kick in do need to be carefully defined. This is especially the case, given that the IRC will often make recommendations to parties—for instance, to conference—with a suggestion that failure to do so may lead to them imposing an interim award on the parties. The policy problem, which the ACTU also raises, is that the application of the provisions to all orders and directions has the potential to impose onerous penalties for minor breaches—for example, a failure to comply with a procedural deadline. In response to this, the government have argued that commissioners surely would not impose a penalty for a minor breach. However, there is no guidance for commissioners as to what type of order or direction a penalty should apply to if breached, and it is with the penalties which might be on the cusp of falling one way or another that you need to be careful. We are therefore cautious about the effects of this provision. We do acknowledge that this area could possibly be tightened up to address these concerns.
With respect to the disqualification provisions, I note that the existing disqualification from holding office under part 4 of chapter 7 of the Workplace Relations Act applies only in cases of conviction for certain criminal offences, including fraud, intentional violence, certain ballot offences and offences in relation to the formation, registration or management of an association or organisation. This bill would extend the application of automatic disqualification to civil penalty provisions. Another area in which I have responsibilities is the Corporations Law. There is no similar provision in the Corporations Act, where it is the regulator who has to make out a case for disqualification. The government argue that disqualification can only occur for breach of these duties where the Federal Court, in its discretion, considers that the conduct warrants the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. As outlined above, the commission has no guidance as to what orders and directions penalties should apply to and, even if more guidance were given, automatic disqualification for a civil offence would still be very serious.
The government has argued that there is a process to appeal the automatic disqualification. I would like to point out here that, in the case of breaches of civil penalty provisions under the Corporations Law, the regulator, ASIC, carries the onus of satisfying the court that disqualification is appropriate. This should be contrasted with the proposal in the compliance bill that the onus and cost is on the disqualified person to convince the court that he or she should be given leave to hold office. Maybe the reason that those two are so different is that, in the case of the Corporations Law, at least we have the sanity of a national regulator, whereas in the case of industrial relations matters we have not so much insanity but a lack of wisdom which results in a dispersed inspectorate and a dispersed regulatory ability.
The final area of the bill relates to the minister gaining authority to seek orders. Currently, applications for orders for breaches of penalty provisions can be made only by the Industrial Registrar or an organisation. The government argue that the amendment is in recognition of the costs and delays that may be involved in enforcing orders and directions and that parties are sometimes pressured not to pursue available sanctions and remedies. However, the provision appears to be contrary to the government's espoused philosophy of keeping third parties out of industrial relations, which the Democrats have supported wherever it is appropriate. There does not appear to be a similar provision in Corporations Law. Again, instead, it is the regulator that pursues such matters. 
Instead of the employer having to pursue matters and to be put in some commercial and perhaps commercially political embarrassment, if I can use that phrase, we think there should be circumstances which would enable the Industrial Registrar to monitor the payment of a penalty and the compliance with an order and notify nonpayment or noncompliance to the Federal Court for further action. In other words, we advocate proper monitoring and automatic referral back to the very body which we think should enforce these laws. It is quite plain to us that there are circumstances in industrial relations behaviour where employees or employee organisations or employers or employer organisations can find themselves under some stress not to force an issue because of the commercial consequences. Frankly, it should be taken out of their hands, and we think the Industrial Registrar should be given a greater role to play in this.
In addition to the issues I raised earlier, I also think we should examine the big picture in considering this bill and indeed other workplace relations bills that are before the parliament. First, the Senate has to consider whether the proposed offence is justified and, importantly, what effect it will have on the legitimate role of unions and union officials, which is to protect the rights of employees and to pursue their interests. It is very important to maintain the ability of the men and women who are union officers, both paid and unpaid, to do an essential job without an unreasonable fear as to the risk of doing that job.
One has to wonder what impact this bill could have on the ability of union officials to perform their job and adequately represent employees. I am referring to what I think Labor might categorise as intended consequences, namely restricting their abilities even more, or unintended consequences, namely closing down what is a flexible and, in my view, a fairly well-operating environment. So how are union officials meant to represent members who want to renegotiate wages and conditions, and protest unconscionable behaviour, and who might face the situation of losing their job or being made redundant, or workers who have their working conditions unilaterally changed or who feel they need to apply pressure in terms of work and safety issues or whatever? How are they to behave when they are in fear of being disqualified from their positions? We must bear in mind, as I have said earlier, that we do have disqualification provisions for proper cause already in the act.
Everybody, even Labor, gets irritated with some unions and some unionists sometimes. But that is a part of life. In the end unions and employer organisations play an absolutely essential and valuable role in Australian society. We know that occupational health and safety, productivity, efficiency and good working standards are better on sites or in organisations or enterprises when unions and employers are able to work productively together. We know that compliance with the law occurs when these things are policed by unions and employer organisations. A World Bank report last year showed that in highly unionised areas there was less inequality, decreased wage discrimination against women and minorities, and improved economic performance. The great virtue of the Australian system is that industrial disputation is recognised as an essential part of the bargaining and market process, and parties to disputation have procedures and the opportunity to work matters through. So the bill is concerning if it shifts that balance, if it affects that outcome, and the government do themselves a disservice if they do not recognise those—perhaps unintended, perhaps intended—consequences. 
Yes, the bill does apply to registered employer organisations, but employer associations or organisations are rarely direct participants in industrial action—it has no practical effect on them. The bill has gone down the path of addressing an area but ignoring other areas. We are happy to discuss the principles that surround these matters, but I must return again and again to a theme I am trying to hammer home hard in the workplace relations and industrial relations arena, the circles in which I move and the environments in which I operate. I am a firm believer that we need one unitary system of industrial relations. We cannot have any system of industrial relations unless we have strong regulators which are able to enforce the law and are sufficiently resourced to do so.
In contrast to other sectors, where the national interest is paralleled by national laws with a national regulator, such as finance, where there is APRA and the Reserve Bank, Corporations Law where there is ASIC, competition law where there is the ACCC and tax where there is the ATO, in workplace relations you do not have the national interest served by a national law and you do not have a national regulator. My view is that many of the provisions and penalties of the existing act would be far better exercised and far better implemented if only there were somebody to enforce the law as it is at present. My concern is that the government keeps seeing a problem and introducing more law when the real problem is something quite different. The real problem is that no-one is enforcing the existing law. No-one is doing the job that has to be done right now to make sure that entitlements are paid, that wages and conditions are observed, that health and safety is looked after and that people do not defy court and commission orders and other principles. We really do have a strong act. The penalties can certainly be improved and, as you know, we voted for that to happen, although the bill went down overall. But I do have a serious concern that we are going in an antilibertarian direction when we should be going towards enforcing existing law and making sure we have the regulatory instruments to carry through the law as it stands.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE WITH COURT AND TRIBUNAL ORDERS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-04,"—May I say in response to that issue of a unitary system, where Senator Murray raises the issue about national matters and national issues, that the experience I have had is that disputes tend to be, unfortunately, local. Usually the best people to deal with them are those on the ground at that local dispute in the local area, rather than those dealing with them from a national perspective. That is not to say that there is not a need for uniformity or some way of ensuring that there are similar laws. But what I have mostly found in my experience—and it goes back some years now—is that in many instances these sorts of things are in fact local, and without local experience, local knowledge and local considerations taken into account when dealing with many of these things they are simply not going to be resolved. A dispute in Mount Isa is not going to be resolved if you have to fly from Mount Isa to Melbourne because the national office happens to be in Melbourne. But that aside, I do understand the direction in which Senator Murray is going.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 is designed to once again attack unions and otherwise try to provoke legitimate unions to respond to unworkable legislation. The bill seeks to provide a means by which the minister can seek financial penalties for noncompliance with orders of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Federal Court. It also provides a default disqualification of officers and employees of registered organisations who are fined as a consequence of the penalty provision mentioned. 
The reason for this bill seems to be that this element was not proceeded with at the time the Workplace Relations Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) Act 2002 was dealt with—and probably for good reason. I think the reason is as valid today as it was then: it is unnecessary and it is unworkable. This was highlighted back then. The arguments were put then, and I think that the reason the government dropped it then was that they were also persuaded that it was unworkable and unnecessary. It seems to me that in bringing it up again now Mr Andrews, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, either feels it necessary to have another tilt at the windmill or, alternatively, has riding instructions from Mr Howard to have another tilt at the windmill. In any event, he is tilting at the windmill.
The Bills Digest suggests a lack of compliance with orders issued under section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act as one reason. However, when you read the report on this bill by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee you see that very little evidence has been put forward to substantiate a provision as onerous as this being put in place to deal with those matters. The idea of an independent tribunal, the Industrial Relations Commission, is that it have the necessary powers within its own jurisdiction to enable it to deal with workplace relations, whether on a national basis—as Senator Murray might suggest—or at a local level.
The provisions are enforceable in the Federal Court under section 127(6) of the Workplace Relations Act anyway. The scheme of the federal act, which is similar to those of the states, has provisions which are designed to ensure that an independent tribunal has the necessary powers to both issue orders and enforce those orders and, if necessary, allow the participants in the system to consider whether or not Federal Court action should be taken. These matters rely on the parties to make judgment calls given the nature and length of the dispute and what the actual disobedience in relation to the dispute might be, rather than have a third party such as the minister decide—persuaded by other interests or other reasons—to act in relation to a dispute.
What the parties should be doing is getting over the dispute as quickly as they can and getting back to work—dealing with those sorts of issues rather than subsidiary issues whereby either party might have to deal with a minister who wants to enforce a particular order once the dispute itself has long gone. You might even have the ridiculous situation where both parties are asking the minister to desist, should this bill become law. You need to see that the parties are not left in the position of being unable to deal effectively with the dispute on their own terms, settle it and get on with their work where it is needed, letting the angst or anger that may have surrounded a particular matter slide into the background.
The reason for the additional provision is apparently that employers are, as the minister might put it, reluctant to enforce their rights in that court. It is suggested that the present law does not seem adequate. However, I think the onus is on the minister, if he is serious about putting this bill up, to be able to say: `Here is widespread disobedience in relation to orders. Here is a pattern of disobedience. Here is something that requires addressing.' There is none of that. That has been highlighted in the committee report, and I will refer to it should I have time.
In addition, it seeks to allow a person to go directly to the Federal Court seeking orders if the original order is not complied with, and the enforcement is available in the form of an injunction in the Federal Court. That is already there and available. The parties to the dispute are able to deal with it under the Workplace Relations Act. In circumstances where industrial action is being taken with the intent to coerce someone to make, vary or terminate a certified agreement—section 170NC—or is being taken during the life of a certified agreement—section 170MN—the parties may go directly to the Federal Court to seek an injunction. If the injunction is not complied with, a person may be exposed to a prosecution for contempt of court, which is punishable by fines or imprisonment. That is within the act as it stands. 
There are also common law actions available to employers. These are generally referred to as economic torts. They include interference with contract, intimidation, conspiracy and interference with trade or business by unlawful means if they take unprotected industrial action. So you would have to say that the scheme of the Workplace Relations Act is comprehensive. Now we have the minister saying, `Notwithstanding those provisions, I want to be an arbiter.' If Mr Andrews wants to be commissioner, I am sure the commission could invite him to come along or he could certainly put the cap on himself and go there. I do not think that is what he wants to be, but that is what he is setting himself up to be—or at least he will pass the enforcement provisions to his department. If he does not feel up to doing it himself in his own name, he wants the department to run around with a big stick.
The question is: why is the government pursuing this agenda? This bill has been around for some time. I think it was introduced back in February 2003. It was first introduced by Mr Abbott, who took over the reins from Mr Reith. I think I said the same thing then in relation to another bill as I have now. There was a unique opportunity for Mr Abbott to break with the past—to break with the views held by Mr Reith in relation to workers and workplace relations which were negative and wrong—and to start a reasonable dialogue about industrial relations and take a cooperative approach. Mr Abbott chose not to do that. That was his decision. There is nothing I can do about that. I think it was wrong, I think it was short-sighted and I think it was a very poor decision to make.
Mr Andrews has been offered the same choice. He has the same ability to take a cooperative approach in industrial relations and to do something different. He could say, `I am the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and I don't have to follow Mr Reith and Mr Abbott.' Unfortunately, it appears that he is going to fall into line and march to the same tune. It is a shame, but it is really not surprising, because all along the instructions have been coming from Mr Howard. When you see that pattern develop over time, I do not think you can jump to the conclusion that they all have the same view. I think they have been following the song sheet given to them by Mr Howard. It is probably time Mr Howard broke with the past and actually put the hat on himself and said, `Not only am I Prime Minister but I am also minister for everything.' That seems to be what the coalition allow him to do. It appears to be a particular Liberal tradition to be a follower rather than to strike out, do something more innovative, talk to people, be cooperative and deal with issues as they arise.
When you break down the reasons for the bill, I suggest they disappear. There is no reason to put forward this bill. It is not fixing an existing widespread problem. It is not fixing a slip in the legislation. It is not addressing a wrong that might exist. It is simply an onerous provision which is being placed before the Senate to highlight again how tough the coalition government is on workplace relations—or how tough Mr Andrews is. I do not think it actually proves that at all. At a minimum, you would expect that the government could demonstrate that the present powers are deficient or lacking in some way, but the explanatory memorandum does not go there. The government cannot, and have not in this debate, point to any great deficiency. The government have produced some rubbery figures about who has not complied with court orders, but that does not actually highlight what the issue is. They have simply plucked out figures and said, `Here is a number of court orders that have not been complied with.' But they have not provided a snapshot of the reasons, such as both parties disengaging from the order themselves, or the parties settling the dispute by deciding to not proceed with the orders because the primary aim was to get back to work or, in other words, to move on. 
It sometimes strikes me that this government has no workplace relations agenda. Some of these matters really came from consideration of the provisions of the earlier bill, the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999. It was colloquially referred to as the More Jobs Better Pay legislation. As I said earlier, it related in part to the registration of organisations, and it is now a separate piece of legislation here. That was also a favourite tactic of Mr Reith: if he could not get an omnibus bill, he would slice it up and deal with it in a piecemeal fashion to take the time of the Senate. I think the Liberals hanker for the days when workers were expected to tug their forelock and say, `Yes, Sire.' It seems to me that is the only reason you would seek the type of legislation that is now before the Senate. A number of bills have been introduced, all of them designed to provide some punitive measure against workers or their unions.
As I have said, we have many workplace relations bills before the Senate. The government has struck another hole. It is not simply a hole in the need for the bill but a hole in its legislative agenda. All these bills have been hanging around for some time, and I doubt if the government is particularly serious about any of them. The reason for the bill can only be either to fill the program as the government has no real legislative agenda or that the minister is trying to fill up the program on behalf of his colleagues because they do not have any legislative agenda. The only other possibility is that Mr Andrews is trying to make a name for himself and whip up a bit of hysteria amongst unions by doing a bit of union bashing. Perhaps I should give him a little more credit than that. Reith tried it and failed; Abbott tried it and failed. I do not think Mr Andrews would do it a third time, but it is always potentially open to him to consider it. Either way, I suspect Mr Andrews is hoping that recycling the ideological agenda of others might help. In fact, it is counterproductive and reflects badly upon him.
Industrial relations in Australia is in need of fairness, honesty and integrity—qualities which I think are lacking in the government. On the other hand, we have a government that promotes greed in the corporate world but that tries to enforce strict compliance in the workplace relations area, where the rules and legislation are designed to ensure that the work force is shocked into complying with the wishes of their bosses. The government is not really serious, in my view, about this bill. There are many other areas it could turn its mind to addressing rather than attacking unions or workplaces with this type of legislation. If the government were really serious, it could look at the corporate world and deal with that.
The real sting in this legislation is that the minister, it appears, wants to be an industrial police person. The bill states that the minister is to be the person to make an application under this part for a contravention of these provisions. The minister has, it seems, taken the view that the employers are incapable of engaging in constructive dialogue with their employees about structuring a win-win in the workplace. I think at the end of the day what Mr Andrews is really saying is that he has no confidence in the ability of employers to deal constructively in the workplace with industrial relations. There appears to be no great desire by the employers, or no stampede by the employers, to support Mr Andrews on this bill. 
I alluded earlier to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee report. The committee dealt with three bills, but its report on this bill states at paragraph 1.36:
Further, ACCI supports the provisions of the bill, but indicates in its submission that two amendments could be made to enable the Senate to endorse the bill—by limiting automatic disqualification to certain types of non-compliance or by providing for a general discretion to order disqualification.
What they are really saying, as to the main thrust of the bill, is that they would rather amend it than see it introduced in the form that it is currently in. The ACCI have indicated their view on these sorts of things and I do not think the bill finds general support among other employers. The government has been at pains to point out how necessary the bill is but I think on the whole it has failed to convince anyone that it is really necessary. It is likely that, given the opportunity, the minister will in his summing up plead his case, but I do not think he will be able to demonstrate that there is a need for this type of legislation, and the support that he might otherwise garner is not there to demonstrate its need either.
The bill does nothing to ensure that there is equity in the workplace. The bill does nothing to ensure there is integrity in the workplace. The bill does nothing to ensure there is even good-faith bargaining in the workplace. One of those areas dealing with good-faith bargaining is something that the minister could champion if the government so desired. In February, the Howard government decided to advocate in the wage case before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission a $10 a week increase. The states supported a $20 a week claim, which also had the backing of federal Labor. This case provides a stark contrast. On the one hand you have a government that says to workers, `What we want to do is introduce punitive provisions. What we want to introduce will ensure that you do not get a fair increase in wages.' On the other hand you have a government that says, `Trust us, we know what's best.' I think the writing is clear: this government has failed to deal with workplace relations and has failed to turn its mind to how to ensure that there is cooperation in the workplace.
When you look at comparisons with the corporate world, you see that this government has done nothing to rein in the greed and excesses that exist there. So on one hand you have the government saying, `Look, we don't want workers to get more than a $10 increase,' but, on the other hand, you have the ex-CEO of Southcorp, Mr Keith Lambert, who took home a $4.4 million package after only 18 months in the job; David Higgins, the ex-CEO of Lend Lease, who took home $8 million, despite his company recording a huge loss that year; and David Murray, who took home $2.5 million from the Commonwealth Bank, despite a slump of 24 per cent in the profits of the bank that year. I think the government sometimes misses the message, but the people in the community do not: they understand very well what those figures mean and how much those in the corporate world are getting away with in terms of corporate greed and excesses—and this government is doing nothing about it. They also know what this government is trying to do in industrial relations, which is counterproductive, hurtful and designed to ensure workers do not get a fair and even break. That position that the Howard government has adopted is not lost on the community. It does not sit well. It is a sad story when the government intervenes in the commission but does nothing about the corporate greed that runs amok.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-04,"—With the Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 we once again have before us another of this government's never-ending attempts to enact discriminatory and divisive antiworker legislation. It is part of the government's attack on trade unions on behalf of employers who want to squeeze and exploit the vulnerabilities of a work force prevented from organising and collectively bargaining by the antiunion laws being put in place by this government. It is also part of this government's attempt to whip up antiunion feeling in the lead-up to a federal election, trying to find a wedge with which it can divide the community and undermine the support for opposition parties. Over the weekend we heard the Prime Minister attack union action in Victoria, trying to paint the support of unions as a threat to the security of the economy. According to the Sunday Age, he warned of `industrial relations mayhem' if his government was tossed out at the next election. He said:
... you only have to spend a few days in Victoria and you pick up a heightened sense of concern about industrial relations, a feeling that the unions have too much power in this state and the State Government's not very resolute in dealing with them.
—And what about the teachers strike?
—That's right. I am sure that the power workers and their unions—the Electrical Trades Union and the Australian Services Union, who have recently been threatened with draconian essential services legislation by the Victorian Labor government—would question that allegation by the Prime Minister. So would the New South Wales rail workers and train drivers faced with a Labor government that has attacked train drivers and tried to shift the blame for a failing rail system onto the workers. I am sure the hospital nurses who had a stop-work meeting called by the Australian Nurses Federation at Moonee Valley racecourse in Melbourne this week would have a view different to the Prime Minister about the role of the Bracks Labor government. So would the New South Wales TAFE teachers who, along with students, are pursuing a campaign, led by the NSW Teachers Federation, against increased fees and attacks on public education by the NSW Labor government. They, despite opposition from the state government, will take industrial action next week—and the Australian Greens support them.
I am sure that the Australian Education Union, which led primary and secondary teachers yesterday in the teachers strike, a Victoria-wide strike, would beg to differ with the Prime Minister as the state Labor government attempts to make teachers work more for less. I take the opportunity to put on record the support of the Australian Greens for the teachers and the Australian Education Union as they defend their interests and the interests of students—and their parents—in the public education system. The system needs to be defended rigorously, as we see time and time again this government pouring public funds into private and non-government schools at the expense of public school education. We saw it again this week, with the government boosting funding for the non-government sector by $362 million. This is at a time when 70 per cent of students are in the public education system, yet we see this government providing the public education system with only 30 per cent of total federal funding for our schools sector. 
This government has been attacking, and continues to attack, public education. The Greens will always support the rights of teachers, unions and the public education system. We express our solidarity with the Victorian teachers and the New South Wales TAFE teachers and with the many students and parents who have been on the streets this week—and will be again next week—in seeking to stand up and defend a strong public education system in this country. 
The Prime Minister's agenda is clear. He wants to turn industrial relations into an election issue. He describes it as his job to `drive home the risk' of his government losing the next election. He can say what he likes. We have heard it all before. We heard it all with the government's attack on the Maritime Union of Australia and we continue to hear it with this government's multimillion dollar splurge on a royal commission witch-hunt against the unions in the building industry. But working men and women in this country will not believe the Prime Minister. His tired excuses and fear mongering are not working any more. He is running out of lies, and this bill—as well as other industrial relations bills before the Senate—will be seen for what it is: an illegitimate grab for unjustified powers to attack unions' right to organise.
It is not the first time that we have seen these provisions. The government tried to introduce these provisions as part of the Workplace Relations (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) Act 2000. The government withdrew the provisions at the time so as to ensure the support of the opposition in passing other elements of the bill. We should not be seeing deals on this bill, and I am glad that senators who have spoken in this chamber have expressed their opposition to this bill. Let me place on the record that I am proud of the Greens's opposition to the government on industrial relations and on a range of other matters.
—You oppose everything.
—Senator Abetz can add up as many times as he likes how many times the Greens have voted against the government, because I am proud of that record. I am proud to stand up against the attacks of the Howard government on workers and on those who come to this country to seek asylum. I am proud to stand up on a whole range of issues on which the Howard government is attacking working Australians, rather than supporting them, which is what we should see the government doing.
I will turn now to the detail of this legislation. The bill seeks to amend schedule 1B of the Workplace Relations Act in the following ways. Firstly, it requires the automatic disqualification for five years of persons—unless leave has been obtained from the Federal Court—from holding, from election to or from appointment to office if the court has imposed a financial penalty on that person for breach of provisions relating to the keeping of records, auditing and reporting to members.
Secondly, it seeks to create a number of new civil penalty provisions applying to officers and employees of organisations, including doing anything which would cause an organisation to contravene an order or direction of the commission or the court; doing anything which would contravene an order if it had been made against him or her rather than the organisation; contravening an order or direction applicable to the officer or employee; and, as an officer or employee of the organisation, being involved in any one of the above contraventions. 
Thirdly, it seeks to create a civil penalty provision applying to members who breach an order or direction applying to them. Finally, it provides for penalties of up to $11,000 for an organisation and $2,200 for an individual. The workplace relations minister has said in relation to this bill:
People of a mind to defy the commission or the court ... will face heavy fines and possible disqualification from office, if this government gets its way.
It is clear that the minister and the government want the power to wade into any industrial dispute and take the side of the employers against the workers. There is no semblance of impartiality or responsibility on the part of the government. It is our view that a balanced perspective on industrial relations should not support this approach. There is no need for this legislation—as the speaker before me indicated. The driving force behind this legislation is the government's desire to destroy Australian trade unions. They want another weapon with which they can go to war against working men and women in this country.
The disqualification provisions of this legislation are particularly draconian. Disqualification from office is a totally disproportionate penalty for a breach of provisions that are largely related to administrative requirements—such as failing to keep adequate records or failing to meet deadlines for distribution of material to union members. There is no attempt to relate the magnitude of the penalty to the magnitude of the breach of the act. It would mean that, even in cases where the court might have imposed a very small penalty, a union official would be automatically disqualified.
There are already harsh disqualification provisions contained in the act. Part 4 of chapter 7 applies to cases of conviction for certain criminal offences, including fraud, intentional violence, certain ballot offences and offences in relation to the formation, registration or management of an association or organisation. The bill would make disqualification automatic and, as I said, on the basis in many cases of minor civil penalties that have been imposed. It is clear that the government are not concerned about preventing minor administrative breaches; rather, their real agenda is about attacking union organisers and officials that resist employers' attempts to drive down wages and conditions. The government will use any barrier that it can place in the way of unions, regardless of the consequences for fundamental rights.
The International Labour Organisation's Committee on Freedom of Association is very clear on this issue. It states that even a criminal conviction should not be a barrier to union office unless it is a criminal act which, by its nature, is such as to constitute a real risk for the proper exercise of trade union functions. Clearly, minor civil penalties, whilst onerous for the recipient, do not justify disqualification. The ACTU, in evidence to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee, compared the provisions of the bill to provisions of the Corporations Act relating to the disqualification of company directors. They said:
... automatic disqualification of company directors and officers occurs only in the case of serious criminal offences, a significantly more limited application than the current section 277 of the WRA. In the case of breaches of civil penalty provisions, ASIC carries the onus of satisfying the Court that disqualification is appropriate. This should be contrasted with the proposal in the Compliance Bill that the onus is on the disqualified person— 
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE WITH COURT AND TRIBUNAL ORDERS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-03-04,"—The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 2004 and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Rotterdam Convention) Bill 2004 make provision for Australia to meet our international obligations on the importation, manufacture and export of active constituents or chemical products. In August last year the government announced that it had initiated the process of ratifying two treaties on the management of chemicals, those treaties being known as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade. The titles are certainly a mouthful, but these are very important international conventions we are signing up to.
Under these conventions, Australia is required to undertake certain action in relation to pesticides and industrial chemicals related to their importation, exportation, manufacture and use and is also required to establish certain provisions for the collection and use of information related to pesticides and other hazardous chemicals. In brief, these conventions put requirements on countries, particularly those that are exporting chemicals to other countries, to ensure that the appropriate information regarding their hazardous nature, their impact upon human health and other effects are communicated.
The amendments in these bills provide new penalties for not supplying the required information or for supplying misleading or false information. They also require that records be kept for up to four years. I understand that these are not catch-all information bills but relate to those chemicals identified in those international agreements. The Labor Party supports the government's decision to ratify these treaties and therefore we will be supporting the bills before us today.
The World Health Organisation has noted that during the 1990s about one million people across the world were poisoned and a further 20,000 died each year after coming into contact with dangerous pesticides. That is an alarming figure and it is certainly one we should be cognisant of to ensure that our environment and people, particularly those involved in agriculture, are not affected by the improper use of agricultural chemicals. Of course, all levels of government have an important role to play.
I recall that when I was a union official there were campaigns being run in the United States by Caesar Chavez, the leader of the US farm workers, who organised the farm workers in California. Many of them were very poor people, including immigrants from other countries, particularly South America. There were some terrible practices that went on in the agricultural sector over there, including the indiscriminate spraying of pesticides and chemicals whilst the workers were actually in the fields. Some of the actions that were taken by the employers at the time in seeking to prevent the union from trying to rectify these terrible practices included resorting to violence against the workers and the officials. I am glad to say that the efforts of Caesar Chavez to fix up the industry will long be remembered. 
The provisions of this legislation will certainly strengthen our reputation and position as a producer of safe and clean food. The use of chemicals and pesticides in Australia is substantial. Avcare, the peak industry body representing the agriculture and veterinary chemicals industry, estimates that the industry as a whole has annual sales of $1.9 billion and that it directly employs over 2,000 people. These people are employed in large and small businesses across the length and breadth of this country; many of them are employed in rural and regional Australia. There is, of course, a growing public debate in Australia and throughout the world on the use of chemicals and pesticides in the production of food. It is really a debate that cannot be ignored by farmers and by the manufacturers of chemical products. They must engage sensibly in this debate.
It is a fact that Australian agricultural production systems have been developed in the past with the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. In key sectors their use is important in maintaining the enormous gains in productivity that have been achieved over the past three decades. Chemical fertilisers and pesticides are important to the overall profitability of farm enterprises, and I believe it is fair to say that farmers' understanding of and skills in the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have improved dramatically over the past two decades. Farmers and their representative organisations have taken an active role in educating fellow farmers and workers about the use of chemicals and pesticides, and governments of all political persuasions at state and federal level have also played their part in improving awareness of the use of chemicals and fertilisers.
All governments must continue to play a strategic role in ensuring that, if chemicals and fertilisers are used in the production of food, they are used in a safe manner and in the national interest as well as in the interest of the farming community. I must say that Australia's position in the international marketplace is indeed a strong one. We have an image as a clean and green supplier and that has propelled international demand our way when things have gone wrong in other countries.
In conclusion, I want to highlight a shift in the attitude of this government to the quarantine regime in this country and the potential impact of that changed approach on rural industries and chemical use. In recent weeks the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has approved pork imports from a wide range of countries and has signed off on draft assessments that support the importation of apples and bananas.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The comments that Senator Forshaw is making have nothing to do with this bill and I would ask you to rule on a point of relevance.
—If the parliamentary secretary would be a little bit more patient, I am actually just about to mention the relevance in respect of the quarantine arrangements and the use of chemicals in the agricultural industry, which is entirely relevant to this legislation. It is clearly evident that the parliamentary secretary is embarrassed about her minister.
 (Senator Marshall)—Order! Continue, Senator Forshaw.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. There is strong opposition to these decisions by the minister, with significant question marks over the science on which they were based. If the minister has got it wrong and the industries have got it right then, clearly, importing these products may well introduce a number of diseases not present in this country. If that happens, clearly the use of chemicals and pesticides to combat such diseases will skyrocket. That of course will then be the end of our reputation as a clean and green producer of food. That is why the government must get its quarantine regime back on track. It must get science back into the debate. I would urge the parliamentary secretary to convey these views to the minister directly. I know that as a farmer herself she would be vitally interested in that.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-03-04,"—I would point out again that those recent remarks by Senator Forshaw have nothing to do with this bill. These bills are essential to fulfilling the Howard government's intention that Australia ratify both the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. These bills are a very important step for Australia to be making and they enhance Australia's credentials in this area. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-03-04,"—I rise to support the Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004—a very clipped title. It is a simple bill, however. It extends the life of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund established under the Native Title Act 1993 for a further two years, that is, from this year until 2006. The extension is necessary to ensure the committee's important work can continue for an interim period. It is also consistent with the committee's recommendations to the government on its future.
I concur with remarks made in the other place by the member for Fraser, Mr McMullan, and the member for Lingiari, Mr Snowdon, that consideration should be given to committee alternatives including the establishment of a joint standing committee by resolution of both houses of the parliament. As noted by Mr McMullan:
That is a matter that will, as a result of this amendment bill, be considered in the next term of the parliament.
It is a matter that I look forward to addressing as the minister for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs in the first Latham Labor government, in concert of course with the member for Gellibrand and next Attorney-General, Ms Roxon.
It is a matter of great concern to me that the government failed to consult the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on the proposal to extend the life of the native title committee. In fact the first request to ATSIC for advice on the proposal came from Labor. When the office of the Attorney-General was questioned on this matter Labor was told that the Attorney-General consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services, ATSIS, the prescribed agency created by Mr Ruddock on 1 July last year in some respects against the advice of the Australian Government Solicitor. I would point out that ATSIS is an administrative body not a representative body. I am not sure whether Mr Ruddock expected a pat on the back from Labor for consulting an executive agency of government—an administrative body not a representative body—but, if so, he will be a long time waiting. Mr Ruddock understands more than any other person in the country that ATSIS does not represent Indigenous interests. As I said, it is an administrative body. 
As a result of administrative changes introduced by Mr Ruddock as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ATSIC cannot issue directions to ATSIS on any matter. As an agency of the government, ATSIS undertakes the work of the government, and not ATSIC. That much is confirmed by the advice Mr Ruddock received from the Australian Government Solicitor in April last year. It is also confirmed by the recent advice to the ATSIC board from Mr David Jackson QC. I will explore this matter further at another time, but in the context of the current bill I want to note the government's failure to consult Australia's peak Indigenous representative body, a body which under the legislation is charged with providing advice to government. This body was not asked for any advice on this matter by the government. But Labor did seek advice from ATSIC. We understand that ATSIC does support the extension of the life of the committee and we are mindful of that in taking our decision to support this legislation.
I want to note another matter raised during the debate on this bill in the other place. The matter concerning the workability of the native title system relates to the role of native title representative bodies. We are all aware that these bodies have a crucial place in the native title system. During the debate in the other place, Mr McMullan said that it was desirable for the committee to have a close look at the support for these bodies. In the short time that I have had the responsibility for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs matters on behalf of the opposition, I have received numerous representations on funding issues associated with the operation of native title representative bodies, and I do hope that the extension of the committee's life will give it an opportunity to address these matters in some detail.
I commenced my remarks by noting comments made by Mr McMullan and Mr Snowdon relating to the future consideration of native title issues. In that regard, I foreshadow that Labor will support the second reading amendment to be moved by the Democrats, calling on the government to give consideration to the future of the committee no less than six months before its expiry. I must say I am looking forward to considering that matter in government. I am pleased to indicate Labor's support for the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>EXTENSION OF SUNSET OF PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-03-04,"—I also rise today to speak on the Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004, the purpose of which is to extend the operation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund until 23 March 2006. The Democrats support this bill. The committee has played a vital role in the parliament's oversight of the developments of native title, and its continued existence as a monitoring body, in my mind at least, is vital.
When the Mabo decision was handed down, many Indigenous people were heartened by the prospect that native title legislation would enable them to get a result that would deliver better legal protection of our cultures, especially in relation to significant sites and objects. We did not see that aspect of Mabo, certainly in how the legislation was formed, eventuate. Whilst we ended up with the Native Title Act, its amendments following the 1996 Wik decision have rendered it nonbeneficial in its effects on Indigenous people by licensing governments to racially discriminate against Indigenous peoples. So, in many ways, I regard it as a spectacular failure in delivering on its promise. When the Australian parliament enshrined the 10-point plan in law, it compromised the basic legal principle of equality before the law and undermined the goodwill and the potential for Indigenous advancement that had been embodied in the Mabo and Wik decisions. I think it reminded us of just how vulnerable Indigenous rights are and how erroneous the assumption of a level playing field is. 
The system is clearly flawed—which is no news to anyone in this chamber—but, having said that, it is important to state that there have been some important runs on the board in terms of native title outcomes over the last 10 years. This is particularly so for ordinary Australians, both black and white, who have had to grapple with native title issues at the local level. While good working relationships have been developed between Indigenous communities, local governments and other interest holders in some areas, there are many more stories of ongoing frustration and despair at the persistence of discrimination, historical denial and disrespect. It is therefore extremely important to make sure that the monitoring mechanisms remain in place to oversee the implementation of this act, the effectiveness of the various bodies that exist under the act and the progress of the agreements that are made under the act.
We have been assured by the government that native title is becoming settled and more bedded down. They say that recent decisions in the cases of Ward and Yorta Yorta have clarified many of the principles underpinning the act. They say that as the understanding of these issues strengthens so does the agreement making process. This is the rationale used for saying that there is no need for a parliamentary committee to continue its monitoring process for any more than the next two years and that a decision on any further extension of the committee's life would be up to the next parliament. I cannot agree with the government's assessment that everything is now settled down in native title. Sure, there are the success stories, but taken as a whole the anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise. Native title and its associated processes will be settling in for some time to come. I attended the national native title conference in Alice Springs last year, as did Senator Johnston—and I believe that he is still the chair of the joint parliamentary committee—and I think it was fairly clear from all of the stakeholders involved at that conference that there are still many issues that need to be resolved.
It is important that a committee such as the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund remains in existence as an ongoing review and monitoring body. I think this is especially important given the government's desire in another bill to assimilate the specialist position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into a generalist commissioner position. I personally consider this to be a retrograde step not only because of the social justice commissioner's important role in promoting respect and understanding of the human rights of Indigenous people—and, indeed, of all of us—but also because of their responsibility to examine legislation, or proposed legislation, and other enactments for their impact on the human rights of Indigenous Australians.
It is in this context that the social justice commissioner reports yearly on native title and, along with the existence of the joint committee, the role provides a vital monitoring mechanism for the operations of the act. If the government is also proposing to do away with the social justice commissioner, who looks at this question, then I think it highlights the need for someone else to look at it—and the joint parliamentary committee has that role. If the bill is not passed in this sitting, the committee will cease to exist on 23 March and this important monitoring mechanism will no longer exist. I personally regard the extension of the committee by another two years as arbitrary. Why not extend it by five years or six years, as has previously been done? It is a time frame that has been plucked out of thin air. Neither the former minister, Mr Ruddock, nor the government have provided any rationale for this decision. Hence, the Democrats are putting forward a second reading amendment. We will support the bill. I thank the opposition for indicating they will support the proposed amendment. I presume the government will also support the second reading amendment. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
(a)	notes the importance of ongoing review of the operation of native title legislation in Australia; and
(b)	calls on the Government to:
(i)	review the need to extend the committee for a further period, and 
(ii)	commence this review not less than six months before the term of the committee expires”.",SENATE,<title>EXTENSION OF SUNSET OF PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-03-04,"—Over the past 10 years, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund has played a significant role in providing appropriate parliamentary monitoring and oversight of the native title system. In extending the existing sunset provision for the committee by a further two years, the Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004 recognises the value of the work performed by the committee and will ensure that the committee is able to continue to play this role into the future. I thank senators in the chamber for their support for this legislation. The government will be supporting the Democrat amendment, and I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-04,"—The Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003 [2004] seeks to make a range of changes to the way in which the Australian Crime Commission operates. Senators may recall that the ACC was established to replace the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments. The purpose of the ACC is to collect and analyse criminal intelligence and to investigate federally relevant crimes. The original legislation proposed by the government raised some very serious concerns. However, significant improvements were made when the government chose to adopt 13 of the 15 recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The bill was further improved when the government supported amendments moved by the Democrats in the Senate. 
The bill before us contains a number of amendments designed to deal with practical difficulties which have arisen since the ACC commenced operations on 1 January 2003. Many of the amendments are minor and uncontentious. There are some which the Democrats welcome—for example, the addition of the intergovernmental committee to the list of bodies on which certain duties, functions and powers under state laws may be conferred. During debate on the original legislation, I expressed the serious concern of the Democrats that the primary oversight of the activities of the ACC—previously the NCA—was being transferred from the intergovernmental committee to the board of the ACC. While the IGC comprises elected ministers who are accountable to the parliament, the ACC board comprises a range of police commissioners and agency heads. This transfer of responsibility was significant because it was essentially a transfer of oversight from an elected ministerial group to an unelected board of police commissioners and public servants, which lacks the same level of accountability, certainly to the parliament. This was of particular concern, given that it included a transfer of power to authorise the use of coercive powers, and this was an issue raised by a number of submissions to the committee. For example, the Law Council of Australia noted:
The idea of a police force having a power to compel a person to attend a `hearing' and be compelled to provide answers is simply unheard of in Australia.
It further suggested:
The potential for police interest to dominate key decisions may undermine public and governmental confidence in the ACC.
Mr Denis Lenihan, a former CEO of the NCA, noted in his submission that, in determining whether an investigation or operation is a special investigation or operation, the ACC board must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matter are likely to be effective. He asked the question:
Is it not paradoxical—or even suspect—that persons from those very agencies whose methods have been ineffective will now be in the position of authorising the exercise of powers designed to remedy those defects?
During debate on the original legislation, I expressed the Democrats's view that we would like to see the power to authorise special investigations and operations retained by the IGC, and this remains our position. However, we do welcome the additional conferral of powers on the IGC through this bill. There is of course a retrospective provision in the bill, which dates back to the commencement of the original legislation. The Democrats have a long and proud record of opposing retrospective measures, particularly where they affect the rights and liabilities of individuals, although we do note on this occasion that the retrospective provision contained in item 17 of schedule 1 is essentially a transitional provision aimed at facilitating the transfer of power and operations from the NCA to the ACC. Item 17 will, for example, operate to ensure that any causes of action which a person may have had against the NCA will not be affected by the changes to the name and constitution of that organisation.
The explanatory memorandum explains that item 17 also fulfils an undertaking made by the Minister for Justice and Customs to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. That is because it will facilitate the transfer of telecommunications warrants from the NCA to the ACC. That issue was previously dealt with under the Australian Crime Commission establishment transitional provisions regulations, and the regulations and ordinances committee had expressed concern that it was contained in delegated legislation. 
In closing with these few remarks I will take the opportunity to express the Democrats' concern that we are yet to see the first annual report from the ACC. This issue was recently canvassed during budget estimates, and the ACC indicated that the delay has been caused by the requirement for the report to be signed off by the various stakeholders. The Democrats appreciate that the membership of the ACC is broad and that it encompasses different levels of government. Of course it is important that the annual report is agreed upon by all stakeholders; however, we do find the excessive delay in producing the report a little ironic, given that the primary justification for the establishment of the ACC was to institute a more efficient and effective regime.
At the time of the original legislation, it was unclear whether the establishment of the ACC would actually produce the gains and efficiencies claimed by the government. There is some reason now to doubt this. When the report is eventually released, it will provide an important insight into the operations of the ACC since its establishment and a vital tool to the parliament in ensuring the accountability of the new organisation.
The ACC has had some notable successes since it commenced operations. I note, for example, the seizure of some 735 firearms on 15 November last year, following a long-term investigation. I take the opportunity to reaffirm that the Democrats will continue to monitor closely the operations and effectiveness of the ACC. It is an organisation that exercises incredibly invasive powers, which I have previously discussed, so scrutiny is ongoing and important. Whilst we retain some of our original concerns in relation to this organisation, we will always be open to considering genuine proposals to improve the way in which it operates.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003 [2004]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-03-04,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003 [2004] and I table a correction to the explanatory memorandum. This bill will make some minor adjustments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The need for these amendments has been revealed through practical experience since the establishment of the Australian Crime Commission on 1 January 2003 and through the preparation of corresponding state legislation. The amendments are necessary to ensure that a workable legislative framework is in place to enable the Australian Crime Commission to effectively combat serious and organised crime across Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-04,"—The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 2003 makes a number of constructive changes to the administration and powers of the Industrial Research and Development Board, and the bill will be supported by the opposition. However, that is subject to the second reading amendment, which I will return to later in my remarks. This bill does not absolve the government from blame for the R&D stop-start problems that they themselves have created. They have caused a lot of uncertainty for many innovative small businesses and they should not be trying to shift the blame onto the Industry Research and Development Board. I hope this bill does fix those problems, but the problems should not have occurred. They occurred because of actions of the government, not of the board. 
The most arresting feature about Australia's research and development performance under the Howard government is that business expenditure on research and development has fallen nearly every year since 1996. Private sector expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP remains below what it was under the previous Labor government. This is directly contrary to international trends and experiences. It is an indication of how it is that we are slipping behind the rest of the world. This is not a sign of a modern, advanced economy. We must invest more in research and development because it is one of the key drivers of future productivity.
The OECD has noted the clear correlation between the increased intensity of business funded R&D as a percentage of GDP and productivity. The OECD has also observed that increases in the share of business R&D in the overall R&D effort of a country are also a key factor in productivity trends. Under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, this trend went up consistently. Under Labor, business expenditure on research and development rose steadily as a direct result of government policy designed to encourage such a trend.
Our general performance in research and development is also evidence of the Howard government's comprehensive failure to provide support to public sector research. Australian research under this government has fallen behind that of our international competitors. We have failed to invest in our wellbeing and in our future. Not even the much heralded Backing Australia's Ability reforms have proven effective in sufficiently turning around the problems emerging in this sector of the economy.
After the 2004 federal election, Labor hopes to be in a position to reverse this trend and to correct the government's failures. As we look at where we stand now by international standards in terms of private sector and commercial and public sector R&D policy, we can see a situation that desperately needs to be turned around. We need to have the courage to evaluate our own performance against the backdrop of global realities. That reality includes the fait accompli of what the government is trying to impose as part of the US free trade agreement. We ought to understand the broad-ranging implications of that agreement. It is a reality that includes the continuing buoyancy of the Australian dollar. Irrespective of the day-to-day trends, the continuing rise in the dollar has imposed considerable pressures on our competitive capacities, particularly for our exporters.
On the national scene we face many challenges and problems—not just economic challenges but environmental and social problems as well. We need to lift our research performance to address those issues. We will not advance the welfare of our citizens or the prosperity that they deserve unless we do. The bill before the parliament goes to private sector research performance. There are at least 23 individual companies, based in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and elsewhere, which all invest greater amounts in those countries than they do in Australia. We have a policy framework that does not encourage private sector investment, and the private sector is not responding well by international standards. We cannot expect a strong performance from business unless it has the resources available to do so, and that is where the government can intervene to assist. 
We cannot expect a strong business R&D performance unless the policy parameters are available to facilitate genuine collaboration between the public and private sectors with regard to research. I think it is important to evaluate where we stand with regard to these issues. If we look at public sector research agencies such as the CSIRO, the situation is, quite frankly, very poor. Many of our young researchers are being forced overseas. Many of our young researchers simply do not have access to the research infrastructure that is needed to ensure that they are able to perform at the top of their field.
Public research agencies are generators of strategic research. They simply do not have the capacity to deal with real world problems facing this country and Australian industry, whether it be in the environment, manufacturing, agriculture or advanced technology developments, simply because the money that is being provided is not sufficient to maintain capacity with regard to our research infrastructure. The recent mapping report, produced by the Chief Scientist, highlighted those difficulties.
The Howard government has fallen down in the discharge of its responsibility in public sector research funding and policy. In my judgment it has pursued an agenda that is far too narrow. It has given priority to short-term commercially orientated projects which, in many cases, have not produced the goods. It has neglected the crucial research areas of the social sciences and humanities. It has pursued competition, rather than encouraging collaboration which would maximise the effective use of scarce resources, including in particular precious human resources.
We have to face up to simple facts. We have a deteriorating research infrastructure in this country. Scientists are increasingly having to use patched up and makeshift equipment. Access to advanced IT facilities is far too limited. There are places in this country where our broadbanding capacity is 1,000 times behind that of our international competitors. University libraries are reeling from the effects of continuing funding cuts. They have had to cut back drastically on acquisitions and services. It is no wonder that our senior scientists and other scholars are heading off overseas at breakneck speed. They do not have to go to the United States. Countries like Singapore offer hugely more attractive research facilities than we can afford to provide. Increasingly it is the case that private firms are choosing to set up manufacturing in Singapore because we are not able to provide that research infrastructure in this country.
We have a weakening research capability. There has been a continuing downward trend in the research capability of many universities outside the select group of eight, of which four or five are performing extremely well. The government rammed through the Senate in the sittings last year a series of higher education measures that will leave regional universities and those in outer metropolitan areas so much the weaker. In a number of key institutions in the outer regions of Sydney and Melbourne, this funding package actually undermines their long-term financial viability. The University of Western Sydney and Victoria University of Technology have been badly hit by the changes that the government forced through the Senate last year.
There is an erosion of public research agencies such as the CSIRO. Last year they asked for a $120 million increase in their budget allocation, but they got $20 million. For three years in a row they have sought triennial funding to give them some security, some measure of confidence, but they have been knocked back. This year they are asking for $170 million. We will see how they go very shortly. If we look at our overall national investment in R&D in comparison with the United States, the United Kingdom or Canada, we are falling behind. We are slipping behind our major competitors in key international performance indicators, such as publications and the capacity to attract world leading scientists and researchers. Increasing numbers of our experienced researchers are obliged to work overseas. There is a wastage of our intellectual property, where increasing numbers of our great ideas are being commercialised offshore. We are exporting jobs as a result of our failure to turn good ideas into jobs in this country. 
We see a poor uptake of Australian inventions by Australian business in this country. There is an extraordinary break in the cultural understanding both in universities of business and in business of universities. The net result has been a loss of opportunities for innovation in products and services and for improvements in productivity. We see an extraordinary imbalance in the short-term and long-term research needs of our cooperative research centres, our universities and our public research agencies. We have a situation where, in particular, the humanities and the social sciences are essentially left out of the equation. If anyone in their right mind tells you that you can undertake major research in this country today without an interdisciplinary approach, then they are missing the whole point. How can you address the big questions like salinity by concentrating only on one aspect of a scientific inquiry? There is a whole range of social and other measures that need to be examined on issues such as that. We need to have the insights of psychology, organisational management, economics, foreign languages and business cultures. All of those things are left out of the current priorities that the government has set for its research spending.
We see a massive decline in the quality of maths and science teaching in our schools. We have a situation where there are far too few people being attracted to the enabling disciplines of science, engineering and technology within our schools and universities. We have a situation within our primary schools where it may well be that up to half of our teachers are not qualified in maths and science yet are taking children in those studies. How can you inspire and encourage people to take up these very important disciplines when the teachers are not properly qualified to teach them?
We have a problem regarding the atomisation of the relationships between research funding agencies and research institutions. Essentially, the approach to the funding of research in this country of the different agencies of government and our public institutions is extraordinarily disjointed. No wonder it is almost impossible for the private sector to understand how these things are actually funded when there is so little understanding apparent within the public sector itself, and particularly within the main managers of the public sector—the government. It is no wonder that we have a massive array of reviews under way by the government; some 10 separate reviews into research funding were undertaken last year by the government. Four or five key reports have been suppressed by the government and have been sitting on the minister's desk since October last year. No wonder these reviews have been undertaken in such secrecy—the government is beginning to hear the message that the situation with regard to research funding in this country is a long way short of what it should be. 
In the forthcoming months there will be a major debate in this country about the direction of research funding. We are looking forward to the government's statements with regard to Backing Australia's Ability II; we are looking forward to seeing just how much money is allocated. The department of education has given me an estimate that $1 billion per year will be required just to maintain the funding programs of the current Backing Australia's Ability. We look forward to seeing how much of that continues into the new period. We all understand that the financial cliff is approaching, because the money has not been put in the budget beyond the current forward estimates period.
Labor will put forward very strong alternatives to the way in which the government is proceeding. We will be seeking to encourage the public to take a far greater interest in these issues, because these are the key drivers of economic growth by driving productivity improvements. These are the keys to providing us with some protection from the shocks of the international marketplace. There are fundamental needs that require the reform of research funding and policy in this country. This bill tinkers; it is a tinkering bill. It is designed to fix a few problems of the government's own creation. That is why we are moving a second reading amendment to this bill, which I understand has the support of the chamber. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate notes the importance of research as a driver of economic growth and condemns the Government's failure to stimulate private sector investment in research and development and to adequately invest in public research and development”.",SENATE,<title>INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-03-04,"—I indicate formally that the Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendment that has been circulated in Senator Carr's name on behalf of the opposition. We certainly agree with the sentiments contained in that amendment. If I ever doubted the worth or power of second reading amendments, for me today has been   another reminder of how they can have an impact: the launch of the ALRC's review paper into gene patents and human health—of which I am sure most senators are aware—is the consequence of a second reading amendment I moved in 2002 to the human cloning legislation. That will be another significant debate in the science area, biotechnology in particular and more specifically the patenting of genes and gene sequences—something that members of this chamber know I have been rabbiting on about since 1996. Perhaps, as a consequence of this inquiry, we might actually have legislation in this field—if not debated then at least introduced—but, having said that, I do have a bill on the Notice Paper.
In relation to the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 2003, Senator Carr is right: we should be having a much broader debate in this country about the requisite funding for research and development and industry assistance, and of course related issues such as science, biotechnology, higher education and other things. The Democrats will be supporting the legislation today. We welcome the bill as it puts in place some necessary measures that will improve the operation of the R&D Start program. These measures are necessary as a result of government-created problems, as the previous speaker indicated, and specifically because of the fiasco with the R&D Start program that occurred in 2002 when the scheme was effectively closed down for eight months—that is, from April through to November of that year—because of an over commitment of funds.
As Senator Carr alluded to quite strongly, over the past 20 years Commonwealth investment in research and development through its agencies and universities has been in constant decline. Despite the efforts of this government through the Backing Australia's Ability program and in part the R&D Start program, Australia's business expenditure on R&D, or BERD, in 2002 had still not recovered from changes to the R&D tax concession in 1996. The changes to that tax concession were strongly opposed by the Australian Democrats for many of the reasons that have come through today. At that time, we predicted that it would have a deleterious impact on investment in R&D in this country, particularly on private sector investment in research and development. Unfortunately, those predictions came to fruition. 
The attempt by the government to arrest some of that decline through the Backing Australia's Ability measures—if a somewhat belated and inadequate response—was welcomed by the Democrats. At that time, I was happy to negotiate with the then minister, Dr David Kemp, to pass that legislation through the chamber with some badly needed improvements in relation to R&D definitions et cetera. People in the industry know what those changes were but, despite the attempts of that package to arrest the decline in R&D spending, we still have a long way to go.
In the year 2000, Australia spent 1.48 per cent of our GDP on R&D, ranking us 13th out of 22 OECD countries. However, our business expenditure on research and development was only 0.72 per cent of GDP, ranking us 15th—well below the OECD average of 1.56 per cent. We have failed to address that decline, and Senator Carr has indicated that we are going to need many more measures and resources. Certainly `son of Backing Australia's Ability' will be the next part of that process. Like the Labor Party, as they have indicated today, the Australian Democrats will scrutinise and monitor that process very closely.
A number of organisations have indicated their concern about the lack of money spent on research and development in this country and the lack of resources to develop the innovative culture to which we all aspire. The Academy of Science recently expressed their concern at the continual decrease in Australia's overall expenditure on research and development. It is clear that this government does not understand the economic impact that research and development can have, while other OECD countries are spending more on R&D. We only have to look at the EU, which recently announced a target of spending three per cent of GDP—three per cent of their gross expenditure—on R&D. At a time when they are doing that, the Howard government is freezing funding to R&D programs for up to eight months at a time and disrupting businesses who have been planning research investment based on the R&D Start program.
Last night a number of us met with Engineers Australia and, in particular, young engineers at a function. They were expressing to politicians—and certainly to me directly—their concern at the difficulty of recruiting graduate engineers in Australia, partly because of the shortage of students entering engineering courses but also because many graduates in Australia have decided to take high-paying jobs overseas. Senator Carr has also talked about the fact that we are seeing those graduates go offshore. This is still a very real problem. I know people have mocked the so-called brain drain, but it is a reality and something that needs to be addressed. There are a number of ways we need to address it. R&D funding is one way and the education sector as a whole is another, whether it is science teaching and science teachers in particular or, more broadly, encouraging a climate in which people can actually access education that is also publicly funded. 
Senator Carr also talked about the damaging—and in fact regressive—higher education reforms that passed this chamber last year and about the fees and charges that are sky-high at the moment. Yes, we are one of the highest charging countries in the industrialised world when it comes to public university education. I woke up this morning to see on the front page of my home town paper, the Advertiser, the headline `Full uni fee rise'. What does that mean? It means that Flinders University, an institution that has previously had quite a long held commitment to access and equity in higher education by resisting the temptation to raise fees, particularly in relation to full cost undergraduate fee paying courses, and that indicated previously that it was not necessarily going to introduce or increase fees by the 25 per cent that is now allowed for under the legislation that passed last year, is going to increase its fees. But what have we seen? In a confidential document, which I understand on ABC radio this morning Vice-Chancellor Edwards has pretty much confirmed, Flinders University is considering a full 25 per cent across-the-board fee hike. 
How duped are those Independent senators—the very senators who came into this place and gave us what amounted to as near assurances that Flinders University specifically was not going to introduce or increase its fees? When I talked about my concerns for my home state of South Australia, Independent senators indicated that South Australia was going to be okay. They alluded to some kind of information they had been given by vice-chancellors that the fee increases were not going to happen. How duped are they, and what shame they have brought on our state and other states? More importantly, what have they done to the hopes of aspiring students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds?
You cannot talk about research and development, you cannot talk about innovation and you cannot talk about an educated and enlightened society without first ensuring that you have very basic access to education—education that is accessible based on your brains and not your bank balance. How we have changed the culture in this country when it comes to these issues. We need a government that is serious about publicly funded education and we need a government that is serious about research and development funding—funding that will help drive our economy through innovation and provide younger Australians, such as those young engineers that I was privileged to meet last night, with employment prospects. Hopefully this bill, albeit described as a tinkering bill, will fix some of the problems. It will lead to a more effective and stable assistance mechanism for businesses to invest in R&D through improvements to the administration of the R&D Start program.
The second reading amendment is supported, and the concept of condemning this government for failing to stimulate private sector investment in R&D and adequately invest in R&D at a public level is something that we support. We will be testing this government's bona fides over the coming months as we deal with the second large announcement or instalment of the BAA funding. I look forward to hopefully seeing an increase in these measures but also a change in the culture. We are becoming a nation that talks about innovation but does not genuinely reflect that in the policy making and the funding mechanisms that we have.",SENATE,<title>INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2004-03-04,"—When I first looked at the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 2003, which is before the chamber, I wondered just what it was all about and why the government was going to the extent of introducing it when, for all intents and purposes, it had appeared for many years that the IR&D board was operating effectively. It was only upon taking a much closer look at the legislation that the underlying purpose of the bill became apparent: to clean up the fiasco that occurred in 2002 with the R&D Start program. I have spent many hours in Senate estimates questioning officials and the minister about why we got ourselves into a mess with the R&D Start program, and I have not been able to get a sensible answer from either the department or the minister as to why it occurred. We had to wait until a bill such as this was brought into the chamber to understand that it was an administrative fiasco within the department that led to the R&D Start program being frozen in that year. 
It is worth while going back to refresh the chamber's memory about what happened because, as Senator Carr said earlier, it had significant consequences for many of our small companies around this country. Expenditure on the R&D Start program is kept at $180 million a year and is supplemented from the budget. In April 2002 the R&D Start program was suspended due to what the government said was an overcommitment of funds. No new applications were considered, and new approvals were suspended until additional funding became available. The program resumed in November 2002—a freeze of some seven months. The minister at that time announced a review of the disbursement of the R&D Start grants by AusIndustry, and this bill is the direct result of that review.
The bill proposes to fix the problems that existed where the board was making decisions and allocating funds—certainly, in the government's view, allocating too many funds. That resulted in what the government claims was an overcommitment of R&D Start funding, leading to the disgraceful situation where from April to November no new applications were considered. It became farcical, because the minister at the time, when asked whether the R&D Start program had been frozen, indicated that it had not been frozen; it was just that no new applications would be considered. Moreover, as it transpired, those applications that had been lodged in the lead-up to and during that period had to be resubmitted. So many small companies in this country, which in many instances provide the impetus for research and development, were making plans and financial commitments on the basis that they would be eligible for R&D Start program funding, and then realised that they would not—that they were going to be left in the lurch.
This government has been doing a lot of analysis and stocktaking of the various programs that were introduced under Backing Australia's Ability. Most of those have spent very few funds and will, I think, be repackaged as part of this government's political agenda in the lead-up to the next election—again, without any additional commitment of funds. I wonder if any time has been spent trying to assess how many small companies in this country were effectively put to the sword because of the mismanagement of the R&D Start program during that period in 2002. I know of a few, but no-one has done a stocktake across the whole of our small business community to determine how many companies were seriously impacted by the mismanagement of that program.
This is a classic example of this government's approach to industry policy. I do not want to go into great detail about the many industry policy disasters there have been under this government. There was the COMET funding fiasco and the Syntroleum debacle. But I am concerned about a story I read in the paper this morning that said that Mitsubishi are now reconsidering their position and that they may well withdraw from this country. If that occurs, we will lose what was a very significant commitment to a new R&D facility in the auto industry in the city of Adelaide. This is another set of circumstances where we are seeing, on a continual basis under the management of this government, the withdrawal of R&D facilities across the board. We have seen BHP withdraw its R&D facilities and we have seen Telstra withdraw its R&D facilities over the period that this government has been in power. We now see the potential for another major facility—that run by Mitsubishi—to also be withdrawn. 
I want to comment briefly on what I think are two very significant indicators of whether a government's innovation policies are effective. They are business expenditure on research and development, and the current account deficit. This government has failed to encourage and sustain innovation by the private sector. The OECD average national R&D expenditure is 2.17 per cent of GDP. Australia's is a pitiful 1.48 per cent and is outranked by countries such as Iceland and Canada. When we look at business expenditure on research and development—or BERD, as it is more commonly known—it is even worse. When Labor left office, BERD was 0.87 per cent of GDP. This represented a 172 per cent increase in BERD compared to when Labor took government in 1983.
What has the government done since 1996? If you look at page 7 of the Bills DigestNo. 87 you will see that despite what this government says, it has not got the BERD up anywhere near what it was in its peak in 1995-96. We have asked again serious questions about what is occurring in this area. At the last estimates we were told of a new measurement that had been introduced, which I am still trying to get three economists to understand, to show that BERD has been increasing over that period. I forget the name of the way they measured it, but it was a chain measurement process that I certainly do not understand and, as I said, three economists have had a look at it and they do not understand. It is simply a way of playing with the figures to try to make them look better than they are. Within three years of coming to government the coalition's policies sliced BERD by more than 25 per cent. It has risen slightly since then but, as I said, it is still below the peak that it was at in 1996. The average annual rate of increase in BERD was 12 per cent in the 1990s, so the fact that BERD went backwards under the coalition in the 1990s is even more amazing.
What is the result of the government failing to support innovation? The end result is simple: a reduction in the competitiveness of Australian industry. Without constant innovation Australian manufacturers face great hurdles to export successfully. This decline in innovation, when coupled with an appreciation of the Australian dollar, has led to a series of record current account deficits. But what has the government done to both recognise this problem and take action to try and deal with it? It has refused to do anything, even to consider alleviating the pressures that Australian manufacturers are suffering as a result of the significant increase in the dollar in the past 18 months. This is despite the fact that one of the most significant industry associations in this country, the AIG, is saying that there is a massive problem. The result? A current account deficit of $1.69 billion in January and $2.55 billion in December 2003. In the seven months to January exports of non-rural and other goods were down by $5.6 billion. That is a 10 per cent decline compared to the corresponding period in 2002-03. Last year's current account deficit of $24 billion was the largest in our history, yet we have a government that simply sits back and does nothing to ensure that, when there are significant shifts like this, action is taken to ensure that the position of our manufacturers, our exporters, is not unnecessarily disadvantaged. 
As I said at the start, the Labor Party are supporting this legislation and, as Senator Carr has indicated, we are moving a second reading amendment. We have to keep in mind that this is simply plugging another gap in our innovation and industry policy fabric which is being caused by this government's ineptitude and incapacity to put in place a sustainable policy framework that will last over the long term and provide the framework within which Australian industries, Australian innovators, can get on with the job of developing and growing sustainable industries that will last into the long term.",SENATE,<title>INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-03-04,"—I seek leave to incorporate my remarks on the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 2003.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I am pleased to advise that under this Government Australia's innovation and R&D performance is impressive and growing.
Indeed, Australia's innovation performance has contributed to strong economic growth in recent years; 3.5% a year over the past five years.
Our productivity performance is also impressive—multifactor productivity grew by 2.8% over 2001-02
Businesses are recognising the value of R&D—business expenditure on R&D (BERD) rose 13% in 2001-02, up to $5.546 billion, with increases in all major sectors.
This is the highest level recorded and is the second successive year of significant increase.
Australia's BERD to GDP ratio also increased from 0.73% to 0.78% in 2001-02—a clear indication that the Government's R&D and innovation policies are working.
Industry associations such as the Australian Industry Group have commented favourably on the improvement in BERD, in recent years and point to the importance of innovation as a major competitive driver.
Government support for businesses undertaking R&D is extensive, and includes programs such as COMET, BIF, IIF, the Pre-Seed Fund, the Innovation Access Program, the Innovation Awareness Program, a variety of sector specific schemes and R&D Start.
The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation's recent report, Riding the Innovation Wave, The Case for Raising Business Investment in R&D observed that the Commonwealth set aside over $5.4 billion for expenditure on science and innovation in 2003-04.
The Government,, through R&D Start alone, has provided more than $1.7 billion support to businesses undertaking R&D since the program's inception in 1996.
The R&D Start Program is associated with many well known success stories, including Cochlear and Norwood Abbey.
The House of Representatives report concluded that the Government's introduction of programs such as COMET, BIF, IIF and R&D Start shows that `R&D policy over time ... has evolved in ways that much better meets the needs of SMEs'.
We are not resting on our laurels—we have recently taken stock of our science and innovation system, with the outcomes included in the report, Mapping Australian Science and Innovation. We have also reviewed a range of innovation programs under Backing Australia's Ability, and the Government is currently considering policy initiatives to improve Australia's R&D and innovation performance.
The Report on Mapping Australia's Science and Innovation, which was commissioned by the Prime Minister, found that Australia's science performance is among the strongest of all countries, and has been leading-edge in a number of scientific fields. It notes that Australia has invested heavily in `public good' research and that the commercial and non-commercial benefits of this have been considerable. 
The Mapping Report finds that Australia's level of government expenditure on R&D is relatively high by international standards. According to the Report, government support for science and innovation has become more strategically focused, “signalling strong policy interest and recognition of the links to economic, social and environmental outcomes”.
Australia's level of government-financed expenditure on R&D is high by international standards. In 2000 the Government invested 0.71% of GDP in public sector R&D, compared to an OECD average of 0.64%.
In 2000-01, Australia's total gross expenditure on R&D (GERD—the total expenditure on R&D, both private and public, within Australia) was 1.53% of Gross Domestic Product, compared to just under 1.0% in 1981. Gross expenditure on R&D as a proportion of GDP is now around 50% higher than in 1981.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-03-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Today we have finally seen the text of the free trade agreement between the United States and Australia, which has been delayed for the last few days. The key commitment that this government will not give about this text concerns this question: why won't you refer it to the Productivity Commission? If you are so confident that this deal is so good and there are so many `big bucks' in this deal, as Senator Ian Macdonald says, let us put it to the independent test: refer it the Productivity Commission. That is all it takes: one letter. But, no, what are this government intending to do? They are going to commission some economic analysis. You may think to yourself: why would they want to commission separate economic advice when all they have to do is refer it to the Productivity Commission and not pay a cent? So why do they want to set up their own tender process that will cost taxpayers extra money? You have to say the answer is very simple with this government. It is because they want to put in the fix. They want to control the terms of reference, they want to control the money and they want to control the outcome.
We know this because the Prime Minister has already said that he has got advice that this is a good deal for the economy. He has already said that before he has commissioned this new independent evidence. He therefore does not need to spend any money. He would not be able to set the terms of reference with the Productivity Commission, because if there is one organisation in this country that has modelled free trade agreements and has examined this issue up hill and down dale it is the Productivity Commission. 
The Productivity Commission do not need any advice from the government about how to conduct a review and what the terms of reference are; they have done it many times before. That is why we will not see this matter referred to them. They are truly independent, they have done it before and they do not need the government's help in setting the terms of reference. This economic advice that the government want to tender out is simply putting in a fix to give them the answer that they have already predetermined. So let nobody take any notice of the process that they are going through: it is a fix and we all know it is a fix.
What have they got to hide? There are a number of things that have come to light in the text today. Bear in mind that it is less than 10 hours since this text was actually released and it is 1,000 pages, so we are still working our way through it. What is the new information that has come up in the last 10 hours? We have seen extra detail on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We asked Senator Hill, `Give us some assurances, Senator Hill, because we would actually like to know them.' Of course, he did not because he has not read it. He has looked at it a couple of times in cabinet but he has not got a clue what is in it. That is typical.
What are the terms laid out in these side letters to do with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? What is this new appeals mechanism to do with the level of reimbursements? For those who are not familiar with trade jargon, the level of reimbursements is the taxpayer subsidy that goes to the US drug companies. So we asked a simple question today: `Tell us, Senator Hill, what is this new mechanism? Will it allow the US drug companies to increase the levels of subsidies from Australian taxpayers through the government to these US drug companies?' That is all we asked—a simple question—and he did not know the answer. In fact, he did not even understand the question, although it was a fairly straightforward question.
If we have agreed to a system that allows American drug companies to get in through the back door and get increased subsidies from taxpayers, that means every single Australian out there, because of this US trade deal, will be forced to subsidise American drug companies more than they are now. The Labor Party has made it quite clear from day one that that is unacceptable. If we have a situation where the US free trade agreement sabotages and undermines the PBS, then we will vote it down. We have said that from day one and we continue to say it today. So we asked a simple question today: just give us that assurance; just tell us that there is not going to be an increase in taxpayer subsidies to American drug companies because of this deal—and we got nothing, just blather. We saw that as soon as it got hard they wanted to take the questions on notice. He did not want to answer a simple straightforward question on the most politically sensitive issue in this document.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-04,"—We have seen today from Senator Conroy and his colleagues—both in question time and now in taking note of answers to questions—the Labor Party's true colours under the leadership of Mr Latham: they want to be wreckers; they want to drag down the Australian economy. We have seen today two lines of attack, if you could possibly call it that. One was on the free trade agreement, which is designed to boost Australia's economy, to create new opportunities for companies in Australia to sell goods into the biggest, most successful market in the world—new opportunities for thousands of products and services—and to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
Senator Conroy, after a couple of days in estimates committees, has been trying to find a reason to vote against it. His whole life is about trying to find a reason to vote against it. The Labor Party want to bring down the free trade agreement. They want to hurt the Australian economy and hurt the prospects of Australians who could have more jobs, more economic security, better quality lives and better opportunities because of the work the Australian government has done in negotiating access for thousands of goods and services into that US marketplace. But Labor want to oppose it. They are negative, carping, whining and whinging, and they are bringing things down. They are not building; they are wrecking. That is Labor's way.
The Labor Party say, `We might have done a better deal.' We remember the previous trade minister, Senator Cook, who is about to get to his feet. He would not have been able to do it. The previous government could not have achieved a free trade agreement because when the previous trade minister went away on trade missions he gave specific instructions to his entourage—his minders and the departmental officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—that he was not to be woken too early in the morning and that he could not have his first meeting until, I think, 10 o'clock. He needed to have a nice warm cup of tea first. He could not have a breakfast if he had had a dinner the night before.
Government senator interjecting—
—And he could only have four meetings a day. If Mr Vaile had done that he would still be over in Washington. I think Mr Vaile attended mass on three Sundays in a row and worked through the night, day after day. Senator Cook would not be back until 2008 if we had sent him to do the job. So Labor would not have got a free trade agreement—although, whatever else his hotel would had done, it would have made a lot of money out of cups of tea.
The other concern I have today is that the Labor Party is not only trying to bring down the whole Australian economy by opposing the FTA but also trying to bring down the economy of Christmas Island, a small but very important part of Australia. We have seen them attack Phosphate Resources Ltd just before Christmas by voting for, I think, a Green motion to oppose access by PRL to five very important new leases to ensure that the mining operations—the number one enterprise on that island—can go on for some years. Clearly, it is a crucial business for the island. It is a crucial enterprise that employs a great majority of the people on the island. Labor have said, `No, we'll join with the Greens and stop you getting access to further resources.' At a time when that company is under pressure because of the exchange rate and hot competition from other parts of the world in the phosphate market, what do Labor do? Labor belt them while they are down. While the government is there trying to help PRL get through a difficult stage in the world market by putting new port facilities and infrastructure on the island, they want to bring that company down.
The Labor Party are not content to bring down Phosphate Resources Ltd, an important company for the island; here they are today trying to destroy the other enterprise that this government is trying to get up—that is, the space station development run by APSC. It was always going to be very difficult to get that enterprise up. So what did the government say? Did we say, `It's all too hard. We're not going to help you. We won't build infrastructure and we won't give you support'? Of course we did not. We want to see a space facility built on Australian soil and Christmas Island is a very good place to build it. The Christmas Islanders are keen to see it built but Labor's approach is to drag that business down too and not to give them any support just when they need it. Right when they need bipartisan support from Australia to ensure that the Russians know that they have support and to ensure that investors from Korea and other places know they have support, what do Labor do? For short-term, pathetic political objectives, they want to drag that project down, and drag down the names of the McClintock family as well. It is a disgrace and it is typical of Labor. If it is typical of the new Labor under Latham then they have not really gone very far.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2004-03-04,"—I will put my record of meetings on the table against any minister in this government and I am pretty sure that the record of what I actually did will outshine the lot of them. There is an unfortunate strand running through parliamentary debate from the government at this stage of the political cycle, and that is that if you do not know the answer you bluster, shout down others, and try and drag red herrings across the debate. There is no better exponent of that in this chamber than the Leader of the Government, Senator Hill. We saw an example of bluster and shout-down today. He made a number of assertions in answers to questions about the free trade agreement which are just not true. I want to go through some of them—I will not have time to go through all of them, there were so many—and correct the record.
Firstly, he said that Labor should not obstruct the early entry into operation of this agreement. Labor has no intention of obstructing anything about early operation of this agreement, but through you, Mr Deputy President, I remind Senator Hill that there are two parties to this agreement. The other party is the US Congress and they have enshrined in their legislation a period of debate and consideration of up to five months. We have plenty of time in Australia to give this free trade agreement a proper examination because the Americans will not do anything for five months. They have to lay it on the table for 90 days and they have another 60 days to consider it. There is a reasonable possibility—it is a small possibility and I hope that it does not occur—that they may not deal with it at all if it becomes a contentious issue within the US presidential and congressional elections this year. So it is not true that Labor is obstructing anything; to say that is misleading.
Secondly, Senator Hill said that Labor had 13 years to make an agreement like this and did nothing. That is equally untrue and equally misleading. Labor set up the Cairns Group to negotiate trade liberalisation for farmers. Labor participated in setting up and delivering the outcome of the Uruguay Round. That round was not with one country; that round was with the whole of the world, including the biggest economy, the United States. Comparing the outcomes of the Uruguay Round to this feeble agreement is like comparing an elephant to an insect. We got the elephant; you got the insect. It resulted in real gains for all markets, including the sugar industry.
The other thing that Senator Hill said that is not true and is false and misleading is that we only believe in multilateralism. Labor believes multilateralism is the best way of achieving trade liberalisation because it affects everyone else. I remind the Senate that Labor concluded the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relationship, which is a template for all bilateral trade agreements for this country. It has stood the test of time. It is a truly comprehensive agreement that covers all elements of the joint economies and has succeeded in integrating them. It is not a partial agreement like the US one, where areas are off limits. 
Labor set up APEC. APEC is basically a trade configuration that covers 2.224 billion people in this part of the world and it has got the goals of free trade by 2010 and 2020. The question hanging over the trade debate is: `Why did the Liberal party led by Mr Howard neglect and sell out APEC, which covers 2.224 billion people, for a trade agreement with one country that covers 239 million people?' The benefits to Australia if we had concentrated on delivering free trade in APEC, as the Labor government obtained a commitment to do by 2010 for developed countries and 2020 for developing countries, would have been far greater. They would have dwarfed any outcome that has been achieved here.
Of course, Labor wanted to push ahead with joining CER to AFTA, the ASEAN free trade agreement. We now have a configuration with China talking to ASEAN of 10 plus one and China, Japan and Korea talking to ASEAN of 10 plus three. But, thanks to the bad stewardship of this government on trade matters, Australia is excluded from that. This is the fastest growing market in the world. This is the area where we send 49 per cent of our exports. This is the area where the potential to increase our exports is far greater than anywhere else—and what has happened? We are excluded from the deal because this government pursued another course of action where there are minimal gains, and they have got a minimal outcome. So let us not have from the government any reflection on the Labor Party's trade record. It has been far more devoted to achieving the real interests of this nation than anything that has happened here. That leaves me with just Mr Howard, and I may not have time to deal with him.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2004-03-04,"—In the questions asked of the government today in relation to the Asia Pacific Space Centre, the Labor Party clearly show that, when it comes to policies regarding space science and the space industry, they are lost in a black hole and have probably returned to the Dark Ages. It is interesting to recall what happened with regard to space science and industry policy when Labor were in government. In about their first seven years they spent $34 million in support of space industry initiatives and achieved absolutely nothing as a result of that expenditure. In marked contrast, in their latter years in government they ran Australia's space program down to nothing, to a big fat zero. I well recall in the budget estimates committees following Labor's last budget in 1995—fortunately their last budget for many years—asking questions about the space program and finding that in the forward estimates there was absolutely no provision made by the Labor government for space programs. It took the election of the Howard government in 1996 to restore some sanity to this area of policy, to make some funding provision for space programs and to start the much-needed revitalisation of the space industry and space science area in Australia which has occurred since that time.
This clearly demonstrates that Labor has absolutely no understanding of the importance to a 21st century economy of space science and the space industry, not only in terms of the direct benefits it offers in areas like agriculture, environmental monitoring and communications but also in the indirect flow-on benefits that a viable space industry provides. It is to the great credit of the Howard government that it is funding programs relating to the space industry. In my view, the government could do more in this area but the fact is that it has provided funds for space industry development as opposed to the former Labor government running those programs down to a big fat zero. That is a marked contrast between us and the opposition with regard to this issue. 
We see as a consequence Labor simply engaging in carping and error-riddled criticism. That has been evident today in their criticisms, as Senator Ian Campbell said a few moments ago, of the Christmas Island spaceport. It is a part of Australia that desperately needs support and encouragement and the government is providing that, yet all we get from Labor is carping criticism with regard to the possible winding up of the Asia Pacific Space Centre company. As I understand it, it is true that a notification of the filing of an application for a winding up order has been lodged with ASIC by that company, but it is also true that the Asia Pacific Space Centre continues to work towards obtaining investor funding to develop the spaceport on Christmas Island.
It is also true that the government, much to its credit, agreed to a $100 million strategic investment incentive package covering common use and space port infrastructure on Christmas Island. But, in contrast to what Labor used to do in government when they would provide funds and then not have any idea of what happened with those funds, this government has kept a close watch over the Asia Pacific Space Centre's efforts to obtain investor funds to establish the spaceport. Importantly, the government funds that have been allocated—the $31.4 million—have not as yet been paid because, quite correctly, the government laid down preconditions and milestones that had to be achieved by that company before any government funding would be provided to it.
As yet those preconditions have not been met. They relate to various aspects of the development of that program but they have not been met, so the taxpayers' money has not yet been provided to that company. The company's intended timetable has not been met because market conditions have changed since the project was initially planned. There is still the opportunity for that project to succeed, provided investor funds can be obtained in the current market conditions. The conditions set down by the government will ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted but, on the other hand, they will be available to give much needed support to this project and much needed support to the development of the facilities at Christmas Island as a great boost to that regional economy. So we see here quite a clear contrast between the Liberal-Nationals government on the one hand and the Labor Party on the other hand with regard to this very important area of policy, an area that is critical to any 21st century—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-04,"—I would like to speak today in this debate about the space scam at Christmas Island. I am gravely concerned about the way the Asia Pacific Space Centre project has been managed by the Howard government from day one. It is a great matter of concern to me. I know it is a great matter of concern to the Labor Party and it ought to be a great matter of concern to the Australian people—and I think that in due course it will be.
Here we have a situation where the government has extended access to $100 million of taxpayers' funds essentially for a project which may well never get off the ground. Labor support the joint use facilities. Obviously there is a need for a port on Christmas Island and there is a need to extend the airport. There is a need for roadworks. But that development has only partially begun. We also say that Labor strongly support the need for high-skill, high-wage industries such as the space industries, and we say they should be encouraged in this country. We also say, though, that this does not justify poor management by government. It does not justify dodgy administrative practices by government. It does not justify secret deals being done in such a manner that we see no real product coming out of the expenditure of very large sums of money. We believe there should be investment in research. We say that we should be investing in complementary industries that allow us to develop a competitive advantage. 
I do acknowledge Senator Minchin's statements that this is a risky business. I also acknowledge his direct personal sponsoring of the spaceport project. I know that speculative projects sometimes deserve backing. But that does not excuse the government for poor management. The Christmas Island spaceport project has been mismanaged by this government. It has been mismanaged by the Prime Minister, by the Treasurer in his use of the Treasury advance, by the industry minister—both the former minister and the current minister. Senator Minchin, in his capacity as the former minister and also in his capacity as the finance minister, has direct responsibility for this project. We know that over $100 million has been expended on this project insofar as they have been provided in the forward estimates and there is a capacity for this government to actually provide a taxable grant to APSC. We know that contracts on a deed have been issued which do not provide for a schedule of works to be completed. We do not see these sorts of contracts in any other major project.
Here we have a situation where the government has provided access to these funds conditional on a number of very perfunctory measures being undertaken, such as safety. Of course those things have to be done. These measures are not a schedule of works; they are not a formal process to ensure that proper milestones have to be met. Not even a space licence has been applied for. We do not have proper controls in this contract and we have a situation where the government cannot get out of the contract until December 2005, irrespective of the progress that is made. That leaves the money and the people of Christmas Island in limbo.
There are a couple of possibilities available to us as to why this occurred. Why did such a speculative project get support in an area where there is such congestion in the marketplace? Is it because the government was blinded by the prospect of involvement and the glamour of space? Was it because people were anxious to get their hands on a casino? Was it because of something much grubbier? Was it because serious questions were not able to be answered? For instance, was it because the Prime Minister came under undue influence by the then secretary of the cabinet, Mr Paul McClintock, whose father, Sir Eric, was on the APSC advisory board at the time? Was it because the Prime Minister was unduly influenced by his personal friend and political associate from the Liberal Party Mr John Longley? Was it because of Mr Borbidge's involvement? We do not know the answers to these questions but I am very concerned about this. Was it because of the lobbying of Senator Herron and other ministers in this government? What pressure was brought to bear to ensure this $100 million grant and this deed were put forward in such a way with so little concern for the normal milestones that should occur in these sorts of contracts?

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-03-04,"—Mr President, I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report that you have tabled of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Japan and the Republic of Korea.
Leave granted. 
—I move: 
That the Senate take note of the document. 
The delegation went to Japan and South Korea on behalf of this parliament from 8 to 19 December last year. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate. May I say, Mr President, how delightful it was to have the delegation led by you in all of the various meetings and engagements that we had with the various dignitaries and other important people whom we met in Japan and South Korea. Mr President, not only was it a delight; it was an honour to see the way you conducted a parliamentary delegation. The other members of the delegation were: the Senator the Hon. Nick Bolkus; Mrs Margaret May, the member for McPherson in Queensland; Mr Paul Neville, the member for Hinkler in Queensland; and Mr Brendan O'Connor, the member for Burke in Victoria. We were also accompanied by the Usher of the Black Rod, Ms Andrea Griffiths, and the President's private secretary, Mr Don Morris. It was a very hardworking group that made up the delegation. 
Japan and South Korea are exceptionally important countries for Australia. Whilst we were in Japan and South Korea we became aware of the enormous change that is evolving, given the strength of the Chinese economy. Iron ore and liquefied natural gas are two of the principal components of the economic rebuilding of the Japanese economy. LNG forms an absolutely crucial and vital part of day-to-day life in both South Korea and Japan, particularly Japan. Japan has nine nuclear-powered power stations and, in addition to that, very large power stations driven by Western Australian LNG produced at this stage by Woodside with, hopefully, Gorgon coming on line in the next 10 years.
So the connection between Australia and Japan and Australia and South Korea is one where we are a reliable supplier of important raw materials and energy resources to those countries. In South Korea we saw the level of drive that is being given to South Korea through the Chinese quest for the consumption of steel and for shipping. The effect of the Chinese `economic miracle', as I think one is bound to call it, has been to lift the Japanese economy—particularly the Japanese export sector—out of the doldrums, where it has been for more than 12 years. The South Korean economy continues to grow and remains one of the most vibrant in East Asia. 
With regard to the specific visits we undertook whilst we were in Japan and South Korea, at the Toyota factory, just out of Kyoto, it was quite remarkable to see the just-in-time industrial philosophy of the production line manufacturer. To see how raw iron ore, as produced in Western Australia by Hamersley Iron and Mount Newman Mining, is pressed out into car bonnets and car doors and to see the finished product all on one production line was simply astounding. We also had the delight of going to Kyoto, the old Edo capital of Japan, a most beautiful, fabulously clean and vibrant regional city and the host of the World Expo next year. I think the Expo will be sensational for the Aichi prefecture. 
Whilst in South Korea we visited POSCO Steel. At POSCO Steel we saw six blast furnaces taking raw material, predominantly from Australia and in the form of iron ore again, and casting it into steel slabs and then pressing it out into hot rolled coil. At the Daewoo car factory, towards the end of our delegation's visit, we saw the cradle-to-grave scenario of iron ore from Australia being turned into hot rolled coil steel and then being pressed out into car bonnets and car doors. It was quite an exceptional insight into that process. Being from Western Australia, I know what it is like at Mount Newman, Mount Whaleback, Tom Price and Paraburdoo. I have seen the raw ore on the train going to Karratha, Wickham and Dampier. Then to see it being loaded into the blast furnaces at POSCO and ultimately turned into motor vehicles is simply to see an industrial miracle. 
Further to this, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering at Busan employs 20,000 employees in the shipbuilding yard. We saw a 900-tonne capacity gantry crane. That is something that I had not imagined was possible. This crane can be seen for some many, many tens of kilometres away from the site. It has a huge capacity. The dry dock facility at Daewoo has the capacity to produce more than three 300,000-tonne ore tankers every five weeks. This is just a phenomenal engineering feat. These tankers are huge. To be able to produce more than three of them every five weeks when this huge dry dock is flooded is again a great credit to the achievement of the South Koreans since the devastation of the war in 1953. We also saw the newest North West Shelf joint venturers LNG transport ship that goes on line later this year. Lastly, as I have already mentioned, we saw General Motors Daewoo, a joint venture between General Motors and Daewoo. General Motors, through its Australian owned company, is managing and running the Daewoo car manufacturing plant near Seoul in South Korea.
The trip brought home to me and I am sure to the other members of the delegation the extent of the stress and strain of having insecure borders. The near proximity of North Korea to South Korea, which is a very vibrant, progressive democratic state, is something that has to be seen to be understood. We visited Camp Bonifas at Panmunjon. Many of us went to stand momentarily in North Korea. We saw the level of tension that is visibly in existence between those two countries. All of the young people aged 19 have to do 2½ years national service in the army in South Korea, so South Korea has many people under arms serving in its defence forces.
We also had the fascinating experience of visiting one of the four tunnels which were constructed surreptitiously by the North Koreans back in the 1970s and early 1980s. These tunnels extend for more than 20 kilometres. They are 300 metres below the surface and they were designed at an inclination to come out just in the near vicinity of Seoul. The intention obviously was to mount some form of insurgent attack via these tunnels. Knowing a little bit about mining, I can say that they would have consumed an enormous amount of explosive, not to mention the level of labour and resources required to construct them. Having walked along one of them for some three or four hundred metres I can say that it was an insight into the psyche of the North Koreans back when such a surreptitious and obviously aggressive undertaking was commenced. It did give the delegation an insight into the type of tension that exists on that border. There is simply a cease-fire. There has been no peace settlement. That is a fact that people should remember: it is simply a situation of a cease-fire, which has existed since 1953.
Lastly, it was a great honour also to attend the United Nations war memorial at Busan where you, Mr President, laid a wreath commemorating the 339 Australian casualties. It was most important for us and a very significant event for me personally as a relatively new senator. Thank you. 
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Japan and the Republic of Korea</title>,Delegation Reports,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-03-04,"—Tonight I want to talk about the fact that life on the land has been particularly difficult during the last several years with drought conditions gripping vast areas of our country. Indeed, these drought conditions have been so severe that last year the total national wheat production fell below 10 million tonnes. Tonight I bring to the Senate a good news agricultural story. Wheat growers have now completed this season's harvest and production has increased from 9.7 million tonnes to an expected 25 million tonnes. This has been a fantastic result for a vast number of our growers; especially those growers in my home state of Western Australia. I pause, Mr Acting Deputy President, to spare a thought for those growers in the northern parts of New South Wales and the north-west and the southern areas of Queensland where the struggle against low rainfall continues.
Western Australia has led the way with this season's result, seeing a crop of quite extraordinary proportions. This harvest has easily been the best result ever for Western Australia and highlights the successful combination of productivity, technology and innovation by farmers with a solid rainfall coming at the right time. At last count there had been a grain harvest in Western Australia of 14.7 million tonnes, which was triple the drought stricken yield of 5.2 million tonnes of last year and far exceeded the previous record of 12.2 million tonnes in the 1999-2000 season. 
CBH or Cooperative Bulk Handling, our grain handler in Western Australia, has estimated the final tally to be 15 million tonnes when the final deliveries of storage grain are taken to the receival points. Of the 15 million tonnes it is expected that 11 million tonnes will be wheat with the remaining four million tonnes coming from canola, barley and lupins. Western Australia's tally was more than double that of the next productive state, South Australia, with 6.5 million tonnes, followed by New South Wales with 5.15 million tonnes; Victoria with 4.5 million tonnes and Queensland with just a fraction over one million tonnes. 
What has helped Western Australian growers tremendously has been CBH's efforts in promoting the state's reputation as a grower of high-quality grain and in developing a close working partnership with the marketers of the various grain pools, particularly the Australian Wheat Board. This close and successful working and professional relationship has enabled grain cargoes to be sourced, assembled and shipped in record time. I am informed by CBH that three shipping records have been established so far this year in clearing the record harvest from ports in Western Australia, an achievement for which CBH and the Australian Wheat Board can be very proud.
CBH has shifted a total of 1,330,881 tonnes of grain from its four export terminals in Albany, Geraldton, Esperance and Kwinana during the hectic January period. On 5 February MV Oriental loaded a record 41,800 tonnes of wheat at the mid-west port of Geraldton, which is approximately 400 kilometres north of Perth. The previous record of 39,166 tonnes was achieved in December 1999. The third record saw a total of 574,379 tonnes of barley, lupins, canola, field peas and oats exported in January. The previous record was 459,477 tonnes, which was achieved in 1998.
Through these record shippings in December and January, we have seen the successful export of close to one million tonnes of grain with a value of approximately $200 million. The significance of this record shipping activity is that, with efficient throughput, CBH has been able to accommodate record deliveries, particularly from the south of the state, and to plan with confidence for the storage and marketing of next year's harvest. This planning is absolutely essential as, with another favourable season coupled with the overall trend of increasing yields, we could see a further increase in overall production.
The Chief Executive Officer of CBH, Mr Imre Mencshelyi, when reflecting on this year's harvest, said that in 1996 he confidently predicted that by the year 2005 Western Australia would produce a 15 million-tonne harvest. Of course, many were sceptical of such a prediction, especially last year when the total harvest did not even reach 10 million tonnes. So confident is Mr Mencshelyi with the capacity of CBH's capabilities, he is now aiming to have the organisation move to world's best practice by being able to receive a figure of 15 million tonnes in a 21-day period in Western Australia. He also confidently predicts that by the year 2020 Western Australia will be producing a harvest of some 25 million tonnes, equal to the total production achieved by the whole of Australia in this record year. This is a tremendous result for WA grain growers and it has resulted in a significant boost for the local economy, with growers already in receipt of a record $715 million by the end of January. This is $100 million more than payments received by farmers and growers at the same time in previous years. 
The Australian Wheat Board has in the last few weeks announced further heartening news for grain growers, with an estimated price for the benchmark Australian premium white wheat of between $190 and $200 per tonne and an estimated $220 to $230 per tonne for durum wheat. This news has been warmly received by growers who, despite the bumper harvest this year, have had niggling doubts about the Australian dollar—which has appreciated by 30 per cent since this time last year—and concerns that this appreciation would seriously erode returns that they would receive this year. Whilst they are not going to receive the high prices that they had received several years ago when the Australian dollar was at a record low, they are nonetheless relieved to hear that they are now going to receive a price that has not been discounted by the full 30 per cent of the appreciated value of the Australian dollar.
I must also commend and congratulate the Australian Wheat Board on its chartering skill in obtaining the necessary shipping tonnage in a maritime cargo market which has seen the runaway Chinese economy absorb all excess capacity in cargo tonnage, making life very difficult for all Australian exporters. Overall, I believe that this result is a credit to the Australian Wheat Board, which has marketed Australian wheat aggressively and positioned Australia as a reliable supplier of high-quality grain in what is a highly competitive and quite cut-throat market. Australia guards its reputation as a reliable supplier of high-quality grain to the world.
I pause to note that the AWB officers have recently acted very quickly and very professionally in addressing a particular problem that has arisen with a shipment of wheat to Pakistan. On 20 and 21 February, PASSCO, the buying arm of the Pakistani government, rejected the first two cargoes of a 150,000-tonne consignment of Australian wheat, claiming the wheat had not met quality specifications and particularly specifying that it was contaminated with a fungus called Karnal bunt. Karnal bunt is not known to occur in Australia and, in accord with AWB's rigid quality assurance controls, the wheat was tested before shipment and found to be disease free and above the specified quality standards. Thankfully, the Australian Wheat Board has a stringent quality assurance process, and I can assure senators that claims that the cargoes do not meet specifications can be completely repudiated.
This matter has been taken very seriously by both the Australian Wheat Board and the government, as Australia's worldwide reputation as a reliable supplier of high-quality grain is at issue. I understand that Australia's high commissioner in Pakistan, Mr Howard Brown, has made a series of high-level representations to senior Pakistani government figures underlining our concern at the rejection of the cargoes and the need to resolve the matter quickly, correctly and completely. Officials from the Australian Wheat Board and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry are now in Pakistan working with the Australian High Commission, the importer of the wheat and the Pakistani authorities to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.
There has been a high degree of continuing cooperation between the two governments in clearly establishing that Karnal bunt is not known to occur in Australia. On this occasion, the wheat was tested before shipment and found to be disease free and, importantly, above the specified quality standards for gluten and so on. The wheat was tested by the importer, whose samples were taken at the same time as PASSCO's, and found to be disease free and above the contracted quality standards. Thankfully, the Karnal bunt issue is close to resolution, as the Pakistani government, as recently as yesterday, has agreed to resample and retest the Australian wheat previously rejected against claims that the wheat had not met quality specifications and was contaminated with the fungus. 
In conclusion, I am extremely grateful that Western Australian grain growers have had a wonderful year after several seasons that have severely tested their mettle. The flow-on benefits to rural communities from a good year are considerable and provide the welcome shot in the arm that is needed to re-energise country towns and communities. From my visits to grain growing areas I am told that the order books are close to full for new machinery bristling with world's best technology. With farmers buying the latest and best machinery, they are steadily increasing their capacity to increase the yields from their crops. Hopefully we will be able to see Mr Imre Mencshelyi's prediction come to fruition with a future crop in Western Australia that reaches the 25 million-tonne figure.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Agriculture: Wheat</title>,Adjournment,29,1
