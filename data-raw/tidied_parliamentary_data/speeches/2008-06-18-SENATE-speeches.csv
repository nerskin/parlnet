"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—Where I left the debate yesterday was this: the Liberals are ditherers in respect of these committee references. They are not providing and will not provide an answer on what they will do and what they would prefer to do with these bills. What they are now doing is putting them off to the never-never because they do not want to deal with them now; they do not want to explain to the Australian public what their position on these bills is. Effectively, they are now abrogating their responsibility as an opposition to hold the government to account. They are not going to have the numbers post 1 July. So what they will then do is refer these matters to the next Senate so that they do not have to come to a concluded view, so they do not have to actually say, ‘What we stand for is X or Y.’ What they are actually going to say is, ‘What we’d prefer to do is give the minor parties, the Greens’—and of course not the Democrats—‘the ability to stand up and say what they believe in’—while the Liberals hide behind.
One of the bills, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008, is in a special category of its own because it does not have a reporting date. Its actual reporting date is some time off into the future, depending upon a whole range of packages coming forward. In truth, it is not a reference; it is an abrogation of their responsibility to refer a matter to a committee to consider and report back on to the Senate. They are not doing that.
This bill is an important bill for the Senate. It is an important bill for the government. We have had an argument about the bill’s issues for a very long time, and the bill provides certainty for a certain area of people who are on superannuation benefits or who might benefit from them. Here we have a referral of it to a Senate committee. That is undesirable as any delay in implementing the reforms in the bill would see the continuation of discrimination against same-sex couples and their children in acts governing the Commonwealth defined benefits superannuation scheme and in related taxation and regulatory acts. Say a scheme member died, for argument’s sake. Until the acts are amended his or her same-sex partner or the children of such a relationship will not be entitled to receive reversionary death benefits.
This cannot occur until the bill is passed and proclaimed. There will be a gap by which people could suffer detriment, and the opposition are not prepared to close that gap. What they are going to do is extend that gap, widening it to the never-never. Commencement of the legislation at the beginning of the 2008-09 income year will immediately extend the concessional tax treatment of death benefits to recipients under Commonwealth superannuation schemes. This bill covers the first stage of the reforms and is confined to superannuation. It is not a difficult issue for the opposition to come to grips with. There will be an opportunity for Senate committee consideration of the reforms more broadly. No-one is saying that the Senate should shut itself away from looking at reform packages as they come forward, but this one is a finite measure, it is a confined measure, it relates to superannuation and it should start by 1 July. There will be an opportunity for the Senate to look at the reform packages more broadly as they come forward when draft legislation covering the remaining reforms is introduced in the spring sittings.
There are of course significant legal and practical difficulties with backdating. The opposition might say, ‘Let’s just backdate it.’ Well, superannuation trustees are required to make payments under the law as it stands, not under what it might be in the future. If payments were to be made now, either to certain beneficiaries or to a deceased’s legal estate, it would be very difficult to unwind those payments at a future date when the law changed. In practical terms, when you are talking about reversionary benefits, you are usually talking about a fortnightly or, at the least, a monthly pension payment. The Rudd government is committed to giving people access to those benefits as soon as possible. Backdating this access will not help anyone meet their day-to-day financial considerations, yet that is the position that the opposition are now putting forward as a proposal by sending this off to the never-never. It should not be done, and they should make a practical decision to support the provisions of this bill from 1 July and not refer it. There will be time for greater consideration of all these bills in the future.
The changes to the Medicare levy surcharge represent a measure to be introduced for one simple reason: to remove an unjust tax slug on working families. That is what it is about. It is not a complex policy issue; it is about the removal of an unjust tax slug on working families. Opposition senators will be aware that this penalty on high-income earners to encourage them to take out private health insurance was first introduced in 1997. The penalty applied to people earning $50,000 and above. That was because of the very simple fact that, 11 years ago, $50,000 was seen as a little bit more than an ordinary income—and even a high income. Because of that simple fact Labor has acted now to ensure that working families are no longer hit with a tax penalty that was never meant for them. As a result, we now have the opposition, again, not ensuring that that would occur. They are referring the matter to a committee. They are not going to deal with it by 1 July; they are going to ensure that working families continue to get an unjust tax slug.
I will conclude with those matters. I will not use up all of the available time. This is an important debate. The opposition are being completely unrealistic about the proposals that they are now putting. They should be supporting the budget bills, supporting those bills that have a start-up date of 1 July, including the same-sex bills, because of the challenges that face those people who have superannuation. They should not disadvantage those people. They should also take the grand policy position of saying, ‘We actually do support changes to same-sex relationships; we actually do recognise that society has moved on.’ But instead they are going to refer the matter off to the never-never.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-06-18,"—Today we see the true colours of the coalition. I particularly want to concentrate on the decision of the opposition to block the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008. To delay the bill by more than 12 months reveals, on the one hand, all the opposition’s hypocrisy and willingness to sacrifice the health of our democracy on the alter of partisan politics. On the other hand, the government is committed to a transparent and accountable electoral system. To achieve this, we have introduced the bill that I have mentioned. This bill contains five urgent measures to address critical weaknesses in the act’s current funding and disclosure regime. These new measures include ensuring all donations over $1,000 to political parties and candidates are subject to proper public scrutiny and that donations are reported in a more timely manner.
The bill also bans overseas and anonymous donations and prevents political parties and candidates from making a profit from public funding. These measures are straightforward, they are positive, and they ought to be uncontroversial. But the opposition, under Dr Nelson, want to use their Senate majority to block these necessary and urgent reforms and send them to a committee until, at the earliest, the financial year after next—in other words, to send this bill into legislative limbo. They want one whole year—a minimum 12 months—to pretend to look at this simple bill. This charade clearly shows their contempt for our electoral system and their determination to turn their backs on any effort to clean up the system. It proves that the opposition clearly do not support transparency and accountability of our electoral laws. This proves the opposition do not want the Australian public to know who gives how much money to which party.
The decision to block this bill raises two questions for Dr Nelson. The first is: does Dr Nelson honestly think that less accountability, less transparency, less integrity benefits our democracy? The second is: what do Dr Nelson and the opposition have to hide? Clearly, the answer to the second question is: a lot of money and where it comes from. In marked contrast to Dr Nelson and the coalition, the government believe that reforming our political funding and disclosure regimes to ensure the Australian public knows where political parties and candidates get their money is both critically important and a matter of urgency. We want this bill to commence on 1 July this year. We want to start cleaning up these problems now. We want these measures in place for the 2008-09 financial year. There are strong reasons for acting now. There is no reason for delay on this bill.
The first measure in this bill will reduce the donation disclosure threshold from $10,500 to $1,000. This will mean that every political donation above $1,000 will be exposed to public scrutiny, as should occur in any electoral system with integrity. For 2004-05, when the donation disclosure threshold was $1,500, 1,286 donor returns were lodged with the AEC. For 2005-06, when the previous government raised the disclosure threshold to $10,000, only 317 donor returns were lodged. So just in the space of a year the number of donor returns subjected to public scrutiny dropped by three-quarters. And in 2006-07 the number of donor returns dropped again to 194, less than one-sixth of the number of donations disclosed when the threshold was $1,500 in 2004-05.
With this bill Dr Nelson had a chance to make a clean break with the pathetic record of the Howard government. He had an opportunity on this bill to show some leadership. He had the opportunity to demonstrate that he stood for transparency and accountability rather than obfuscation and secrecy, but Dr Nelson dogged it. By deciding to block this bill, Dr Nelson has shown his true colours. He has revealed that either he is, like Mr Howard before him, a sworn enemy of integrity in our electoral laws or else he is so pathetically weak he is a complete captive of the self-interest of the Liberal Party hacks and operators. One way or another, Dr Nelson and the opposition seem to believe the Australian public has no right to know when someone is attempting to buy political influence. They believe these backroom contributions should remain in the shadows. We in the government could not disagree more strongly. We think these donations should be exposed to the light of public scrutiny. From 1 July this year, all donations of $1,000 or more—an amount most Australians consider substantial—should be made reportable to the Australian Electoral Commission and disclosed publicly, and that would happen if the opposition decided to pass rather than block this bill.
It is worth taking just a moment to look back at the coalition’s record on donation disclosure thresholds. Before the Howard government’s changes to the Electoral Act in 2006, all donations over $1,500 had to be disclosed. As soon as the coalition got the numbers to have control of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, they produced a recommendation supported by those impartial witnesses, Liberal Federal Director Brian Loughnane and Nationals Federal Director Andrew Hall, that the threshold should be raised to $10,000. The ethical gymnastics the coalition majority had to engage in on this were amazing. It was death defying. The JSCEM report states:
... there is a need for transparency to reduce the potential for undue influence and corruption in the political system.
Yes, so far so good. But in the very next sentence they take a sharp right turn and leave the road of logic, saying the committee:
... believes that such transparency would still occur under higher disclosure thresholds.
Yes, that is right. The coalition-controlled JSCEM majority reported that they believed that hiding more donations would have no impact on transparency. They may be kidding themselves but they are not fooling us; they are not fooling the Australian public. It seems that the Liberal and National parties have a different definition of transparency to that of the Australian Labor Party but, more importantly, to that of the Australian public. They think it means hiding more of the cash flowing to political parties. Certainly, as their opposition to this bill shows, they think it is an optional extra for a healthy democracy. Well, the government does not. The government believes that transparency is essential to the health of our democratic system, and we believe also that the Australian public has a right to know who is funding political parties.
The second measure in this bill will remove the loophole whereby people can make donations of just less than the threshold to different branches and divisions of a political party and thereby avoid any disclosure obligations. Clearly, this loophole undermines the purpose of having a donation disclosure threshold in the first place. The government wants to remove this loophole from 1 July this year. The government wants to end this rort. The opposition, in stark contrast, supports these rorts continuing and supports them continuing into the never-never.
The third measure in this critically important bill places new reporting requirements on political parties and others who are involved in the political process. Political parties will be required to report after every six-month period rather than within the current 12-month period. The time frame for submitting these reports will also be reduced from 16 weeks to eight weeks, with the AEC publishing these reports as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. That change will address the scandalous situation that we have today. Just think of this: as I speak today, almost seven months after the last federal election, we still have no idea who gave what to political parties and candidates before and during that campaign. In fact, under the current system, the Australian public would not find out about these donations until February next year, 15 months after last year’s federal election. If the provisions of this bill that is being deferred or blocked or just abandoned by the Liberals had been in place for last year’s campaign, donations to the major political parties would now be public knowledge. I worry that only a party with something to fear or something to hide would want to block a bill that increases the number of donations that are reported and makes those reports more timely.
The fourth measure in this bill will ban overseas and anonymous donations. The government believes that money from overseas should not be able to purchase influence in Australia’s political system. Foreign donations lie outside the jurisdiction and the investigative powers of the Australian Electoral Commission. We can never be sure who is ultimately behind those donations. In a similar way, allowing political parties and candidates to accept anonymous donations undermines proper regulation of our electoral system. And in the past many political parties have accepted political donations from overseas. Yes, the Labor Party have. So have the Liberal Party. So, I understand, have the Greens and the Democrats. But there seems to be a very important difference here, because the Labor Party want to stop this practice as soon as possible. I certainly hope and believe that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens will join us to attempt to prevent overseas donations from 1 July this year. But the question for Dr Nelson and the opposition is: why do they not support banning overseas and anonymous donations right here and right now? This is something that other Western democracies did long ago, and I believe all senators would understand that their electoral systems are much better for it.
The fifth and final measure in the bill that the opposition is blocking ties public electoral funding to campaign expenditure. This will mean that political parties and candidates cannot make a profit from election funding. Most Australians would be appalled to think that anyone could stand for election to make a profit rather than make a difference, but that is what the law allows to occur today and the government is determined to put a stop to this practice. We want this bill passed now so that the Gippsland by-election is the last ever opportunity for anyone to abuse the electoral system, treating it purely as a source for profit. By blocking this bill, Dr Nelson and the Liberals stand united with anyone who wants to keep their snout in the trough of public funding.
The opposition pretends to question why the government has introduced this bill when we are also in the process of developing a green paper which looks more comprehensively at electoral reform. The answer is simple—even Dr Nelson and Senator Ronaldson should understand it if they were not being so deliberately obtuse on this—this bill addresses major shortcomings which have been identified in our electoral laws for a very long time. And, given the fact there is such awareness of these problems, it is incumbent upon any government—and I believe the parliament—to fix them. These problems must be fixed. They must be fixed and they must be fixed now. If the opposition supports accountability and transparency, if it believes in having integrity in our electoral laws, then it must allow this bill to be debated and it must vote for this bill. But, on the other hand, if Dr Nelson and the opposition block this bill then what they are doing is saying that they support secrecy, they support keeping hidden the shadowy attempts to purchase political influence.
If the opposition block this bill then they can only do so because they believe it is okay to rort the system and hide donations, that it is absolutely fine to sell out Australian democracy to the highest bidder, that abusing our electoral system to make money is just fine. That is what the opposition are on about. In short, if the opposition block this bill they will stand condemned for acting in self-interest rather than in the national interest, for sabotaging the chances to address critical and urgent shortcomings in our electoral laws, and for thumbing their noses at decency, integrity and transparency in our electoral system.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-06-18,"—I must admit I am disappointed with the performance of my opposite number today in relation to this matter. The first thing I will say is that Senator Faulkner knows full well that we are not blocking this bill. I thought it was unfortunate that he actually got to the stage where he was making this a partisan issue as opposed to a realistic debate on extensive campaign finance reform. And to talk about Dr Nelson’s role in this, regrettably, did not allow him the opportunity to then talk about the failed opportunities of Mr Rudd. I was not going to talk about it today but I will, given the matters that have been raised by Senator Faulkner, the minister responsible.
On 11 March there was one person in this place who had the opportunity to support comprehensive campaign finance reform. That was the Prime Minister of this country—the man who apparently is now interested in this, but only post Wollongong. Only post the sex and bribery scandal has the Australian Labor Party become involved in this debate. A notice of motion put up on 11 March in my name on behalf the coalition talked about comprehensive finance reform. Who supported it? Senator Bob Brown on behalf of the Greens supported that notice of motion; the Democrats supported that notice of motion; Senator Fielding supported that notice of motion. Who was the one person that failed to support a comprehensive motion in relation to campaign finance reform? It was the Prime Minister of this country.
The Prime Minister of this country snubbed his nose at campaign finance reform. The Prime Minister of this country made it quite clear that he wanted a knee-jerk response to the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal that precluded comprehensive finance reform. The opportunity was here for the Australian Labor Party and Prime Minister Rudd to support the Senate, the majority in the Senate—the coalition, the Greens, the Democrats and Family First. They failed to do so. I will not go through the full notice of motion, but it discusses disclosure amongst other things. I find it quite extraordinary what we have heard from the minister in here today—I love it, as someone said last night, when the poacher becomes the gamekeeper, as we have seen with Senator Faulkner. It is not lost on my colleagues and I suspect it is not lost on anyone else.
The Australian community needs to know that the minister himself has a green paper due for release in July and one of the specific matters to be raised is disclosure. On 29 May, the minister said:
Parliamentarians, political parties and any number of people involved in the political process are trying to ensure that they have my ear on this. But my focus has been to work with agencies on the green paper. I accept that a consultative approach is important. I can assure you I will be giving opportunities for the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and other political parties to have an involvement here and express views.
Minister, what you have failed to explain to the Senate today is why you have got this quite specific piece of legislation coming forward now when you have got a green paper that quite specifically refers to disclosure. In fact, you have two green papers in relation to these matters driven again by the non-government parties in this place, driven by those of us who actually want substantial and comprehensive campaign finance reform. You have these two green papers but you come in today and insist on one particular piece being pulled out of it—to cherry pick it—for your own domestic political purposes, so you can be seen to be doing something in response to the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal. This is not proper process. If you were serious about this, Minister, you would let your own green paper process determine the outcome of this campaign finance reform.
The joint standing committee, as you are well aware, Minister, is looking at this quite comprehensive and substantial reference from the Senate in relation to campaign finance reform. As the Leader of the Greens has said before, we need to have everything on the table. I agree entirely with him. We need to have this on the table. With talk about involvement of community and involvement of political parties, why would this minister pull out one particular aspect of campaign finance reform? It is for cheap political purposes. It is to respond to a position that his state colleague, Premier Iemma, has found himself in, where there have been substantial abuses of the process—appalling abuses of the process. This minister, at the bidding of the Prime Minister, has plucked out one particular part of campaign finance reform and put it on the table to be seen to be doing something.
This is the same minister who has a green paper in relation to the very issues that we have been chastised about today. It beggars belief that the minister can come in here today and invoke some sanction against the Leader of the Opposition when he has only, through the Senate, refused to endorse a reference in relation to campaign finance reform. And they lack the integrity to even divide over it. It was all done under the table over the other side—whisper, whisper, ‘We won’t divide on this, but we are going to put it on the record that we oppose it.’ What a lack of intestinal fortitude that was. It is either good enough to divide on or it is good enough to support. You just want to put it on the record by saying, ‘Look, we oppose it.’ If you were so serious about it, why did you not divide on it? Why did the Chief Government Whip not divide on this as opposed to doing it under his breath? What a complete and utter lack of intestinal fortitude.
Minister, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, you have green papers in relation to disclosure and other matters. If you are serious about this, why not follow the lead of the Senate—the Greens, the Democrats, Family First and the coalition—and have comprehensive finance reform discussion? Why not let the committee that since 1983 has been addressing these matters do its job? It is chaired by the government. It has representatives from all the major and minor political parties. They are the ones whom we have entrusted with the decision-making process in relation to electoral matters since 1983. Why is it that this government now refuses to endorse the integrity of that committee? The reason it has broken the rules on that is that this is a matter in which it believes it requires something to be done to cover its own back in relation to the appalling activities of certain members of the ALP in New South Wales.
What Senator Faulkner failed to disclose to the Senate today was that three members of his own executive, Mr McClelland and Mr Griffin in the other place and Senator Conroy, actually supported an increase in disclosure levels to $5,000. Why weren’t we told that today? Why didn’t Mr Rudd, through Senator Faulkner, acknowledge to the Senate that his own party supported an increase in the disclosure levels to $5,000? Why weren’t we told that today? Why wasn’t Mr Rudd prepared to acknowledge, through Senator Faulkner, that his own party had supported an increase in disclosure levels?
—What’s he talking about?
—What I am talking about, Minister, is your own party. Three members of your executive wanted to increase disclosure to $5,000, and you have the gall to come in here today and attack the Leader of the Opposition in relation to disclosure levels. What an utter disgrace!
I am not going to take up the full time available. The opposition is quite clear on this. We put forward a comprehensive notice of motion in relation to campaign finance reform. We invited the rest of the Senate to join us in relation to that. To their very great credit, the Democrats, the Greens and Family First took up the invitation to support those comprehensive terms of reference. The Australian Labor Party refused to do so. In his first test in relation to comprehensive campaign finance reform, the Prime Minister of this country refused to act. He was given the opportunity; he refused to act.
This minister acknowledges that he has two green papers that are to be brought forward in July and September. The first one relates to the very matter that we are discussing today. Why would you bother having a green paper and then bring in legislation? Again, it beggars belief. One would have to look at the motives behind it to see why it would be done. There is only one motive; it starts with W—it is Wollongong. It is this desperate Prime Minister’s attempt to be seen to be doing something.
We categorically reject the allegations made today. We challenge the Labor Party to finally take up the challenge that, with the minor parties, we have put through to have comprehensive reform. We challenge the Australian Labor Party to let the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters do the work it has been doing on a bipartisan basis since 1983. We challenge the Australian Labor Party to stop playing games with campaign finance reform, to join the rest of us in getting something serious done and putting it on the table and to stop bringing into this place piecemeal bits of legislation that it has cherry-picked for its own cheap political purposes.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-18,"—The Australian Greens do not support the prospect of an obstructionist Senate. However, we have always believed that the Senate has a crucial role in the Australian bicameral parliament as a house of review. In essence, the debate this morning is about that role. In the coming years we are going to do everything we can from the crossbench to review initiatives in the Senate—those from the government in particular because it is the elected government of the country but also those that arise from the coalition or the cross-benchers—and to improve those initiatives in the interests of the Australian people.
We will also be an innovative component of this Senate. We have a large list of legislative initiatives on the board and there will be more from the Greens. We do not see ourselves as being simply arbiters between the government and the coalition except in the role of getting better outcomes on behalf of the nation. We see the Greens’ role also as being innovators where the big parties fail to take initiatives which can benefit Australians as a whole. Of course, that means in the fields of social justice, the environment, the enhancement of democracy, which we have just heard some of the debate about, and achieving a more peaceful world, particularly on an increasingly dangerous planet threatened with overpopulation, environmental degradation and the spread of and increased expenditure on extraordinary armaments.
We have a proposal from the opposition—which has the majority in the Senate and which can, no matter which way we vote on this matter, presumably prevail through the use of those numbers in the coming two weeks—that eight measures being proposed by the government be sent to committee and effectively delayed some months, until at least the resumption of Senate sittings at the end of August, with the new Senate and the return of the balance of power to the crossbench.
In the matter of the electoral reform that Senator Faulkner and Senator Ronaldson have been debating, there is a proposed delay of at least one year before it comes back to the Senate. The Greens will not be supporting a delay on this matter, which was extensively canvassed in the parliament by current senators in 2006, when the Howard government brought its reforms into play and the Greens opposed them. Labor’s move to restore the previous situation is one that we support. Innovation in the area of electoral reform, which is badly needed, is something that we will back. So we will not be supporting the initiative from the opposition in that regard.
I can say, however, that we will support the sixth matter, which is that the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) Bill 2008 and the National Fuelwatch (Empowering Consumers) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for report by September this year. We Greens have been very strong in advocating publicly much greater action by the government—after 11 years of failure by the Howard government—to deal with the matter of transport in Australia and getting a better prospect of future ability for Australians to move to and from work and across the country in an age of increasing oil costs and threatening climate change. Our emphasis has been for there to be much greater investment in fast, efficient, cheap public transport.
The government’s budget fails on that score. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, 75 per cent of the transport budget goes into greater expenditure on roads—tollways in particular—and a lot of the 25 per cent that goes into rail and other forms of transport will simply go to the coal industry to help it export more coal to be burnt elsewhere around the world to magnify the problem of climate change. We believe that problem should be tackled in part in this country by a reorientation of our transport systems to concentrate not on getting coal to export facilities but on getting people to work on time cheaply and efficiently, no matter where they might live in this country. People need to be able to travel with a world-standard public transport system—a big difference from the situation now. The country lags right at the back of the field at the moment.
So we will be supporting a look at the competing arguments, which have raged in the public arena, about the proposal for Fuelwatch. Let the Senate get the competing points of view and the factual information, particularly that deriving from Western Australia, and report back here by September so that we can have some resolution of this initiative which the government says is going to reduce fuel prices. The opposition ostensibly says—and I hope I am not misrepresenting the opposition; someone can correct me if I am—that Fuelwatch will actually increase fuel prices. We do not have a resolution of that. Let the Senate have an inquiry to determine that particular matter. That is part and parcel of the committee system—to look at just such matters as that, gain the information from the public and report back to the Senate so that we can much more wisely vote on the matter.
My colleague Senator Nettle will speak shortly on the first matter, which is to do with the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008. The opposition, while in government, did nothing on this enormous injustice in federal law for 11 years. It seems a matter of concern to us that, through this process, the opposition wants to delay government action which is imminent now.
There are some tax bills listed here that fix anomalies or otherwise improve delivery of fairness in taxation. There is the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008. The Greens believe that cost recovery is a reasonable thing. The government is looking at recovering $9 million to $14 million from the pharmaceutical corporations that use the services involved here. This is a system that delivers $6 billion in benefits to Australians, who have arguably the best pharmaceutical system in the world. It is envied by many other countries. Cost recovery from the big corporations for the work that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee does in assessing drugs being brought into that system and therefore subsidised by the government is not only reasonable; it is long overdue.
The Greens support the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008. We have looked at it and we have assessed it. It will come down to a political decision rather than one made on the basis of facts to be derived from any Senate inquiry. I am sure the opposition has really made up its mind on that matter, and so have the Greens.
I will just go to the last matter again, which is the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008. To put it simply, the Howard government amendments in 2006 turned a political donation system which we think was unsatisfactory into one which was much worse in terms of accountability and transparency for Australian voters. This bill goes back at least to that 2006 situation. We support the measures and believe they should happen now and not wait for another year for the review of the committee looking into the 2007 election. Mind you, that committee has a lot on its plate and we will be expecting great things from it. We support the government’s move here and we think the opposition should support it as well. The matter, as I said earlier, was debated extensively in 2006. This is an obstruction by the opposition, using its numbers before the turnover of the Senate. It is something that may be rectified in the new Senate. That will come down to the crossbench, I presume, and some new initiative from the government after we resume in August.
I finish by saying again: the Greens intend to consider matters brought before this Senate rigorously, with great responsibility and with recognition that we are not just a debating chamber taking political points of view; we owe it to the Australian people to get outcomes. What we see here today is a move by the opposition, which still has the majority numbers, to prevent outcomes which are reasonable in the main. We will support the opposition in the Fuelwatch reference to committee, but in regard to the other seven matters we will oppose the initiatives from the opposition.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Brown, just to clarify with you, at the moment the intention of the Senate is to deal with all the matters together. If you need to request that the matters all be dealt with separately, or simply that one matter be dealt with separately, you should do that now.
—I am sorry. I was under the impression that we would be dealing with them separately. In that case, I ask that No. 6, the Fuelwatch matter, be dealt with separately.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-18,"—I will not detain the Senate for long because our whip will have principal carriage of these matters. I want to make remarks with respect to three main issues that concern me in this debate. The first is relevant to my own portfolios of tax and accountability, and that is the presence of tax bills in this reference. As you know, the Democrats are very strong supporters of the committee system and believe that it is a great aid to intelligent legislating in this chamber. We do support matters being referred to committees, but what we have with these tax bills is an indication of an ongoing problem that has been there in previous years. I would particularly urge the Manager of Government Business and also the Manager of Opposition Business to think about this issue. We have the budget and then, from the Senate perspective, we have the Senate estimates. The tax bills are considered in the House in their two-week sitting period when it is Senate estimates and then they arrive in the Senate to be considered in the final two weeks of June sittings. Often they need to go to committee, they are complex, they are technical, they raise issues of policy and there are often big financial consequences to them. The two-week June sitting period is insufficient to examine those bills through committee. The consequence is that they get referred out to August. But often they are time sensitive—namely, they relate to a financial year and so on. It is because the budget is jammed up against the sitting period which is just prior to the end of the financial year.
Somehow that process needs to be worked out whereby the Senate can get an instant reference when those bills hit the House in those two weeks when we are in estimates, so they have got time to go to committee and so on. I have no objection at all to the coalition referring these tax bills away—although, like my whip, I find their wording odd when they say ‘report not before’ a particular date, which seems to be awfully bad English. Another one says ‘report not before’. It seems unusual to me. Committees should be able to decide when they report, providing it is by a certain date. Leaving that aside, there is the issue whereby tax bills which arise from the budget should be able to go to committee and be considered in time for this period. I urge the Manager of Government Business to convey to the Senate and perhaps the Senate Procedure Committee some mechanism whereby the Senate could have a reference immediately they hit the House in the two weeks sitting after the budget. That is the first issue I wanted to raise.
The second issue I raise refers to item 1 of this notice of motion, concerning the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008. Firstly, there is no reporting date for that reference, and also the reporting date for the reference at No. 8 is so far out as to be ludicrous. What we see here is procedural filibuster. This is filibuster by committee; it is putting off to the never-never something you do not want to happen. I think it is outrageous. I do not complain overly much about matters being referred to committee if people feel strongly about it, but to have a nonsensical reporting date which is not relevant to the issue at hand simply because you do not like, or want to deal with, the issues concerned is, I think, a blight on the opposition. I do hope they have the sense to come back to this chamber with a date for reporting on item 1 and to bring forward the date for reporting on item 8.
I feel so strongly about this that I would urge the government to bring back the Senate in July for the specific purpose of changing the dates of reporting. Let us put it to the Senate when the coalition no longer controls it. I do know that the previous government brought back the entire parliament once to change ‘a’ to ‘the’, which was profoundly unnecessary. But in this case I would urge, in the interests of great equity and great urgency, the government to consider the Senate being brought back to change those dates. This is an outrageous abuse of the Senate process and is a filibuster by committee.
The other thing that I want to say with respect to the same-sex bill is that, again, I have no objection to the larger issues being discussed, but there are time sensitive matters concerned with that bill and it should have been dealt with by the end of June. I want to associate myself strongly with the contribution made by the Democrats Whip, Senator Bartlett, yesterday on this matter. I thought that his remarks were entirely appropriate and accurate. It has been my view for a long time that, although there are some wonderful advocates for equality, equity and fairness within the coalition, those with homophobic tendencies still carry the day and are fighting a rearguard action in these matters. I would urge the coalition to start to deal with this matter, which does arouse, it seems, great antagonism within their ranks, on a conscience basis. Let us get it out of the road on a party basis; let it be dealt with on a conscience basis. I am absolutely certain that on that basis Liberal, Labor and the minor parties will join together to pass these sorts of bills. They are long overdue, and the rearguard action being fought by those with these prejudices needs to be defeated and put aside. I feel very strongly about a matter of continuing injustice in that area.
The third item I want to deal with is the political donations area. I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the Special Minister of State, who is here in the Senate. I want to commend him for his courage and his advocacy in being able to persuade his party to take some quite adventurous and quite courageous steps towards greater accountability in the political donations area. I have no objection whatsoever to the reference, which I support, to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for the whole matter to be looked at more broadly and widely. That is not at issue. What is at issue is this particular bill, which deals with matters that have been extensively discussed previously by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and in this chamber—and have been reviewed.
Members of the Senate might not all be aware that I have sat as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters since 1996, so I know what it is about. Members of the Senate might also not recall that I moved, eventually with the support of Labor, a reference for a wholesale review of political donations to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Members of the Senate might not recall that the committee was so slow that it was held over—it was indeed another filibuster by committee, I might say—from one parliament to another and eventually reported. But the fact is, there was a major report on the entire area of political donations by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in recent years. There is no senator in this chamber who knows more about how hard it is to get reform in this area than I—
—I might pick a bone with that one, Senator.
—although I do acknowledge and recognise that I have had warriors on my side, such as Senator Faulkner, and I am pleased to see Senator Ronaldson joining in. Hopefully he means what he says and actually does support wholesale reform. But that is with regard to the entire architecture. What we are dealing with here are the specific pillars that will support the political donations structure whilst that broader review goes on—the broader review through COAG and the broader review through JSCEM. I think that the way in which this reference has been framed is deceitful, because it attempts to conceal the real motive, which is to delay reform that, if enacted, would clean up and improve our political donations regime.
So I want to indicate that I and the Democrats are strongly opposed to referring this bill, at No. 8 on the Notice Paper—the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008—to JSCEM until 30 June 2009. We would support a short reference within the Senate if that was necessary. We would even support, although we would regret, a reference through to August. But a reference through to June 2009 is just a disgraceful and deceitful reference, in my view, which conceals the real motive—and that motive is that this reform is absolutely, fundamentally, thoroughly and completely resisted by the coalition. It would be far better to put the bill to the vote and have it defeated on the floor. That would be far more honest than this process of reference.
I hope, with those remarks, that you will gather that I feel there is a long-term issue with the way in which tax bills are presented at the end of year which needs, I think, to be addressed through Senate procedures. I hope, Minister, that you are taking that on board and will carry it through to the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure. It is an issue. We have the budget and then we have just these two weeks to deal with the tax bills. We do need more time to refer. Secondly, I do hope that these same-sex superannuation reforms are dealt with far more expeditiously, and thirdly I wish strength to the arm of the minister in getting his political donations reforms through.
—I have already spoken in the debate. My point of order is to request, if I could, that under standing order 84(3) the eight questions that are before the chair be put separately. Senator Brown has already raised this in relation to at least one of the matters. I request, in relation to order of the day No. 2—these matters that have been adjourned from yesterday on eight separate questions—on behalf of the government, that they be put under standing order 84(3) and that those complicated questions be divided and put separately.
—On the point of order: the Manager of Government Business and I had discussions about this yesterday, and I agree with that course of action.
 (Senator Bartlett)—My understanding is that under standing orders any senator can request that questions be put separately, and that shall be done.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2008-06-18,"—I want to speak on the reference of Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 to the never-never, which is the opposition’s proposal in relation to this matter. I will start by reading out a letter, which I received some time ago in relation to proposals by the ACT to introduce civil unions legislation. I will read the letter from this individual and then discuss the impact that this legislation would have on him. He wrote to me two years ago and said:
I am a 58-year-old gay man who has been living in Canberra with my partner (of a similar age) for the past 14 years.
We are both ex-serviceman. His was a long career in the army, mine a short one as a National Serviceman from 1969 to 1971.
We have both worked extensively in the Australian Public Service; in my case, in Social Security, Health and Veterans Affairs portfolios for many years.
Each of us has at various times held Top Secret security clearances either in the military or in sensitive public service portfolios.
Both of us have lived the majority of our lives in situations where our relationship was considered to be criminal in one state or another.
Throughout my partner’s military career he kept his sexuality utterly secret, since the alternative (till the early 1990s) would have been summary discharge from the Services. I was more fortunate in that the public service reformed its attitude a little earlier.
Governments were happy to accept our contribution to the national good, but for many years they did so on the condition that we lied about our personal lives and pretended to be something we were not. As for entitlements, we were expected to be grateful for not being arrested.
Those days of hypocrisy and persecution are largely past. But whilst all Australian states and territories have now decriminalised same-sex relationships, we are not accorded recognition by social security, superannuation, health and taxation systems controlled by the federal government. Though we pay for our share, we don’t receive our share. And our schools are still reluctant to teach kids that gay sexuality is ok, and many teachers turn a blind eye to victimisation and bashing.
I have once experienced being the target of gay-hate violence. Half a dozen thugs with baseball bats attacked me just a few years ago here in Canberra. If I weren’t both lucky and prepared to stand up for myself, I would have died that night. Some of my friends have been less fortunate.
The continued existence of this sort of anti-gay violence is due in great measure to those who seek to impose on the entire community their narrow view of what is ‘moral’, and who seek to use gays as scapegoats to blame for society’s ills. I recall all too well the attempt by some religious groups in the 1980s to blame gay men for HIV/AIDS and to cynically use HIV as a weapon to try to drive society back into the sectarianism and hypocrisy that characterised the 1950s.
Certain religious groups still have no hesitation in promoting the most appalling and dishonest anti-gay propaganda in the name of ‘family values’. But as I recall, the Nazis also claimed to be committed to family values, and were equally intolerant of freedom of choice. Tens of thousands of homosexual men were interned by the Nazis, and many of them perished in concentration camps. It was not the first time we have been used as scapegoats by political and religious fanatics, nor was it the last time.
I consider myself to be a highly moral and principled person, a quality I attribute to the nurture of my late parents. My family have always been absolutely supportive of me and my partner, and my siblings often travel to stay with us at Christmas or new year.
I have made (and am continuing to make) a significant contribution to the society in which I live. Those with whom I have worked have always respected my contribution and have had no difficulty with the fact that have I am an openly gay man. Likewise, those with whom I am involved in amateur sport at ACT and national levels respect me for my contribution and my honesty, not because I am or I am not gay.
I am proud to be an Australian, and thankful that over the past 30-40 years our country has gradually become a fairly tolerant and welcoming place for most people.
But every step of the way over the past thirty-forty years attempts to remove the punitive and discriminatory laws that made me and my partner second-class citizens have been met by ideological bigots claiming that to remove such discrimination would somehow damage the rights of those who suffered no such ill-treatment. What poppycock.
I’m truly sick of the whingeing and whining that comes from the religious conservatives every time someone obstructs a little of their pathological crusade against gay men.
The proposed ACT legislation does not equate civil unions with marriage. To complain, as the Attorney-General has done, that it implies ‘equality’ shows just how much influence religious bigots have over a supposedly secular federal government.
Living in Canberra I am also sick of the disadvantage every ACT resident endures. Namely, having substantially less representation in federal parliament than Tasmania which has hardly more population than we do, and having our legislation and planning decisions threatened or overturned by federal government bully-boys.
Whether on this issue or any other, it is intolerable that Australian citizens in the two territories do not have true self-determination in the manner that people in the states do. Those of you who come from states might care to think how you would feel if the federal government could over-ride your state’s laws.
As I said, this letter relates to the ACT legislation, but he continues:
My partner and I still have our military service medals. Sometimes I wonder if we should send them back, since our contribution to the military service of this country is apparently not considered sufficiently worthy to accord us the entitlements that most people take for granted.
He continues on the ACT legislation in particular and goes on:
It’s high time the federal parliament stopped avoiding the issue of its discriminatory laws. We are all citizens and there should not be one law for my brother and a different law for me.
He says:
I am happy to take unpaid leave from my job to come and see any MPs or Senators at Parliament House, so that they can meet in person one of the many people who has had to fight tooth-and-nail all his life to get some measure of fairness from governments. Someone who for most of his life was arbitrarily classified as a criminal, denied the protection of the law, and refused the entitlements that my siblings are given automatically.
He concludes the letter by saying:
I sincerely wish you and your family the same peace and security that I seek to have accorded to myself and my partner.
I wanted to read that letter out because that is just one of many individuals who have a right to their entitlements—entitlements that other people in heterosexual relationships have. These are people who are public servants in this country would have that discrimination removed if this piece of legislation is able to pass in our parliament. I recall when this legislation was first proposed that the opposition said that they would be supporting it. Yet now we are in a situation where they are proposing to refer it to a committee with no reporting date. I want to know what opposition members are going to say to people such as this gentleman about whether or not they deserve their entitlements.
The issue to do with interdependent relationships is an issue that has been talked about many times in this chamber. Some change has been made and there is more change that needs to be made. But simply because one group of people—people in interdependent relationships—are being denied entitlements does not mean that we should deny other groups of people their entitlements as well. People in same-sex relationships have had their entitlements denied to them forever. That discrimination has not been removed.
There has been discussion and public debate about the removal of this discrimination for decades. Discussion about removing this discrimination has probably been going on for the whole of my life and longer. So for the opposition to say, ‘We need a bit more time to think about this,’ is just extraordinary. I am 34 years old and I reckon for the whole of my life there has been discussion on this issue about removing these entitlements. I do not really think that sending it off to a committee is going to change the nature of that discussion or indeed parties’ views in relation to that discussion. In fact, we heard the Leader of the Opposition say that the opposition would be supporting these reforms. So why does the legislation need to be sent off to a committee which has absolutely no reporting date? The opposition are saying that they want this matter dealt with and that the committee should not conclude until all issues relating to same-sex entitlements have been dealt with.
One of the issues that I have talked about a lot in this chamber in relation to same-sex entitlements is that of recognising same-sex marriage. I like to be optimistic, generally, about the removal of discrimination, but I am not holding my breath waiting for both of the two major parties in this country to accept that same-sex couples have the right to be recognised under the law that people in other relationships do. Are the opposition really saying that they want all reforms that relate to same-sex couples sent off to a committee until everything that relates to same-sex couples has been dealt with? Does that mean this has to wait until both the major parties decide that they want to support same-sex marriage—as I believe they inevitably will, as we see more and more countries doing that around the world.
This reference is quite extraordinary, saying, ‘We want this matter dealt with in a committee until all these matters have been resolved.’ There are many matters that relate to same-sex discrimination. HREOC identified many and the government have identified more; there are others that were dealt with by HREOC and there are others, such as the issue of marriage, which the government are not proposing at this point in time to make a change to as well. So it is just extraordinary to be proposing that the legislation be sent to a committee, where it will stay until all these matters are dealt with. It is just not acceptable to treat same-sex couples, or indeed the parliament, in this way.
The government—for all their many failings that I might point out on another occasions, and indeed have—indicated prior to the election that this was an issue on which they were going to move, that they were going to remove the discrimination that was identified by HREOC. We heard the Leader of the Opposition say, when the government introduced the legislation, that the opposition would be supporting it. Why can’t these people—like the gentleman who wrote the letter I just read out—have their entitlements? Why should their entitlements be sent off to the never-never land where maybe, down the track—if finally both the major parties get with the program and recognise same-sex marriage—they can deal with it? It is just not an acceptable way to operate.
Senator Bartlett moved yesterday to put in a reporting date that relates to the same-sex superannuation legislation. That reporting date is Tuesday next week, which would allow this legislation to be dealt with. I join him in supporting this particular proposal, and the Australian Greens will be dividing and voting to ensure that the same-sex superannuation legislation has a short committee, reporting on Tuesday of next week, so the legislation can be dealt with and so that it can be in place by 1 July, which is the government’s intention in relation to this legislation. If it is not supported, we will not support this indefinite reference for all same-sex matters.
The need to remove this discrimination is an issue that many of us in the parliament have given many speeches on, and very little action at all has occurred. That was because of the failure of the Howard government, the now opposition, to move in this arena. The one instance that Senator Bartlett pointed to last night in relation to same-sex superannuation, which did include interdependence, is probably the only example we can point to where we saw some action from the Howard government on this issue. Finally, after all this time, we now have an opportunity to remove some of that discrimination, and the opposition are proposing to send it off into the never-never. Well, that is not acceptable. The Greens will never support that, because the Greens do not support discrimination.
For us, this is a matter of principle. We do not think people should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality. We do not think that certain public servants and certain members of the military should not be able to access the entitlements that their colleagues can simply because of their sexuality. That principle, for the Australian Greens, applies right across the board. That is why it includes marriage. We take the principal position of not supporting discrimination. It is one of the really fundamental elements on which civilised Western democracies all around the world are based—not supporting discrimination. We in Australia are a long way off being able to hold our heads high on this matter, because we still have so many areas of federal law where people are discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality.
Here is an opportunity being presented to us. We finally have a government that in one small arena is saying, ‘Let’s just remove this little bit of discrimination,’ and the Greens say: ‘Yes; thank goodness! About time!’ It is not like it is not something that we have been debating for, as I say, my entire life. It is not something that needs to be sent off to a committee so that the details can be pored over. I understand Senator Bartlett outlined in the chamber yesterday all of the inquiries into these matters in the past. It is a matter that needs to be dealt with. That is why a short inquiry that enables us to look specifically at this bill and to pass the legislation before the end of this financial year, so that it can come into effect by 1 July, is appropriate. The Greens are joining Senator Bartlett in moving an amendment to bring in a reporting date so that on Tuesday next week we have a report about superannuation for same-sex couples.
There are issues that relate to that legislation that we would like to deal with. One issue that I would like to see dealt with in a short Senate committee is that this legislation does not require the discrimination to be removed in private superannuation firms; it deals specifically with Commonwealth public servants. It deals with judges, veterans and Commonwealth public servants but it does not deal with other same-sex couples throughout our community who have their superannuation in private superannuation firms. It allows private superannuation firms to, if they choose to, remove the discrimination but it does not actually require them to.
Certainly the impression that the gay and lesbian community has been left with as a result of the advocacy by the former opposition, now government, the Labor Party, is that they were intending to remove the discrimination that same-sex couples face in the community in their entitlements—in things like superannuation. So it is disappointing for the Australian Greens to see that this government legislation does not in fact require private superannuation firms to stop discriminating against same-sex couples. It allows them to, if they choose to, remove that discrimination but it does not require them to do so. So, even if this legislation were to pass, we would still see same-sex couples who had their superannuation in private superannuation firms facing discrimination.
So there are genuine matters to do with this legislation that the Greens would like to see an inquiry into. I would like to understand how many same-sex couples with superannuation in private superannuation firms would continue to be discriminated against in relation to their entitlements were this legislation to pass. There are matters that we think are important to be discussed in a committee context. They are matters that we think can be dealt with within the timetable that the government has outlined. That is why we do support sending this to an inquiry—so that we can look at some of those matters and can also raise, as we have many times before, the issue in relation to interdependent couples. But we do not support sending this legislation off into the never-never, which is what is being proposed by the opposition.
We will be joining Senator Bartlett in moving the amendment to say: let’s have a report back next Tuesday; let’s have a short period of time for an inquiry to look at some of these matters. Yes, they are really important matters. I would like to see more discussion on the issue of why people in same-sex relationships cannot have discrimination removed by private superannuation firms but I am prepared to have a shorter inquiry so that we can see this change come into place. That is what we are going to be supporting. But we will never support a proposal which is about continuing discrimination, and that is what the opposition is proposing. We need to remove discrimination not just in relation to Commonwealth public servants and their superannuation but in all areas of federal law where same-sex couples are discriminated against. Get with the program, guys! Countries all around the world have been removing this discrimination. Countries around the world are recognising that, particularly in relation to areas like marriage, we need to remove discrimination. As I said before, I am an optimist; I think we will remove that discrimination in Australia. But I am not going to wait to remove all of the other areas of discrimination until both the major parties get on board with removing discrimination in relation to marriage, and that to me is what the opposition is proposing to do. It is just extraordinary. We cannot support it.
The Greens, as I said before, do not support discrimination. We want that removed. This bill is an opportunity for us to remove just one small arena where discrimination exists—in relation to superannuation and death benefits for Commonwealth public servants. We are going to seize this opportunity with both hands. We want to support this. We do not want to be told by the opposition that, perhaps because of the internal homophobia that they are dealing with within their party, they want to send it off to the never-never. That is no good. We have had 12 years of your homophobia holding back this removal of discrimination. Now is the time we need to remove that discrimination. The Greens want to be a part of that. The Greens will be a part of that. We will be supporting the removal of discrimination in all areas of federal law, including in marriage, and we do not want the opposition trying in a last-ditch effort to send off this discrimination, to say discrimination and homophobia can continue to be a priority for the opposition. That is not acceptable. The public have voted against that, and we need to see this discrimination removed. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-06-18,"—At the outset I totally reject the comments of Senator Nettle on the reference of the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 to the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We are not attempting to send any of this into the never-never not to be dealt with. This reference clearly puts the pressure on the government to bring forward those related bills that it said it would which relate to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. As we know, if you deal with legislation which is closely related to other legislation on its own without consideration of other provisions in other pieces of legislation, you can well end up with unintended consequences.
Senator Nettle said the Greens are vitally concerned with antidiscrimination—as is the coalition. But we want to get it right; that is the difference. We do not want to rush it through in two weeks. We do not want to have a one-day, Friday, committee, as is suggested by the Democrats amendment. We want to make sure that we get an opportunity to consider the other bills which will be closely related to this bill. In an endeavour to make it abundantly clear to those who have misunderstood this, I can foreshadow an amendment by the coalition that the committee have a reporting date of 30 September or after consideration of these other related bills, whichever is the sooner. That makes it absolutely clear that we are not in the business of sending this into the never-never; nor were we. What we are saying is that the committee can report by 30 September or after having received these other related bills, whichever is the sooner.
What that does is put the pressure right back on the government, which has been espousing its antidiscrimination stance, and it says, ‘Okay, you go to work, as you say you are hard workers and it is all 24/7, and let’s see some bills come back when we come back to the Senate at the end of August. Let’s see these related bills so that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs can consider those bills with the same-sex relationship bill and ensure that we get it right.’ We in the coalition are not about rhetoric; we are about achieving an outcome which is equitable, appropriate and also one that works. If we take this in a piecemeal fashion, we will have unintended consequences. Senator Nettle cited the example of a person who was complaining about discrimination by social security in relation to same-sex couples. That is precisely one of the issues we will be looking at. We will be looking not only at superannuation but also at the impacts on taxation, social security and other areas of Commonwealth legislation. So I can foreshadow that the coalition will be moving that amendment to make it absolutely clear that we want the time to consider this legislation carefully with other related legislation and that there is a finite term to that consideration. We had always intended that. But we the coalition are not the government. It is the government that has to bring forward those other bills, and now the pressure is on the government to do that.
I turn to some other comments made by the government in what was a desperate attempt to try to deny that this is anything but an appropriate course of Senate scrutiny. Senate Evans referred to ‘economic vandalism’ by the coalition. I stress again that many of these measures were not even mentioned in the election policies of the government. Some of them are not even budget measures. The Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 is not a budget bill, nor is the electoral reform bill in the first instance. There are other measures which require close scrutiny.
In relation to the luxury car tax, I remind the Senate that during estimates hearings it became apparent that the department concerned had not even been asked to do any modelling. It was the same with condensate—a $2.5 billion measure but no modelling was asked for. In relation to the Fuelwatch initiative, no less than four departments advised the government against that course of action. So this government brings forward these measures, for which in some cases no modelling has been sought and for which you have overnight drafting of a bill which departments briefed against, and this government then says that for the Senate to ask for scrutiny of the bills is obstructionist and economic vandalism.
It is the government that is guilty of a total disregard of proper process in putting together what is complex legislation, particularly in relation to the finances of this country. That is where the blame lies. It is with the government because of its negligence in putting together these packages without any aforethought, without any consultation and, in one case, in complete defiance of the advice of no less than four departments. If you are talking about economic vandalism, you have only to look to this budget. What you have is net increased expenditure of around $15 billion and an increase in taxes of $20 billion in round terms. If that is not economic vandalism when the government says we are experiencing inflation, then I do not know what is.
All we are asking with these references is that the Senate committees charged with these references have appropriate time to carry out the scrutiny of those respective bills and that the stakeholders who have such a vital interest be given an opportunity to make submissions to those committees. We also have the completely rigged figures from the government in relation to how much all this will cost. It started out at a loss of around $300 million. Now it is down to $220 million. I demonstrated yesterday that, after the briefing by Treasury, it is abundantly clear that an amendment to the excise bill dealing with condensate could easily take care of the related back excise that is dealt with on a monthly basis. You could extend that to two months or three months on a one-off basis if you wanted to. That would take away the $180 million that the government is talking about. Just one small amendment would take away that potential loss to revenue. So the government is certainly misleading the Australian community when it says that delaying that particular bill will cost $180 million; it will not. When you take that out of the $220 million, you really are getting down from the original figure at which the government started, the $300 million.
Remember that these are the people who strung together overnight, in 30 hours of drafting, the Fuelwatch initiative in complete contradiction to the advice of four departments. This is a government that brings to the Senate chamber complex taxation legislation—dealing with condensate, a $2.5 billion measure; the luxury car tax and Fuelwatch—for which it did not even carry out any modelling or consultation with the private sector. Well, it is for the Senate to do that. We, as a responsible opposition, have an obligation to do that and we are giving the Australian community the time to make submissions and to offer that much needed scrutiny of bills which could have a potential detrimental effect on this economy and, in other cases, unintended consequences, such as those to do with the same-sex relationships bill, and, on the electoral reform bill, something which could be considered in complete isolation from other potential reforms which the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters would consider in relation to the recent election we have just experienced. Senator Ronaldson superbly outlined the arguments in relation to that and I will not go into them.
This is a chance for the Senate to demonstrate that it is a house of review, that it does take these things seriously and that simply referring these bills to Senate committees in a two-week turnaround period is not sufficient. As I said earlier, we have agreed to those essential bills which are much needed and which involve a large amount of money. We have agreed to them being dealt with in this fortnight, with a one-day Senate hearing. That is appropriate for those bills; for these bills, it is not. The opposition’s amendment in relation to the same-sex bills is one which will provide certainty—if there are any who had that doubt—and which will put it beyond doubt that we want this dealt with, but we want it dealt with in consideration of those other bills which the government has promised will be forthcoming.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-18,"—Mr President, the Senate is being asked to agree to an unspecified date before November. If we are going to proceed with the matter, I suggest that the senator specify the reporting date that he wants the Senate to consider.
—If I heard the amendment correctly, Senator Fielding moved that it should be before November. If it is before November, the date would have to be 31 October or before.
—I just want to comment on the process here. We can make a determination on this, but it is inappropriate that the Senate be asked to deal with an amendment like this outside the debate.
—Senator Brown, because Senator Fielding has moved the amendment and you have already spoken, you can only take a point of order or seek leave to make further comments.
—I haven’t spoken on the amendment.
—Yes, you did. You spoke a few minutes ago. You are allowed to speak only once. After he moved the amendment you stood on your feet and spoke. The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Fielding be agreed to.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Mr President, although I supported the motion for an earlier date, I did not support the division. I do not know anyone else who supported the division.
—I was sure I heard two noes. I will put the question again. The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Fielding be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye and those against say no. I did hear two ayes. Is a division required?
—No.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-06-18,"—I have circulated a speech for incorporation on the Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008, which I believe has been accepted. I therefore seek leave to incorporate the speech which was distributed by our whip to all other whips.
—Is leave granted?
—I personally do not have it, but I will take your word for it, Senator Eggleston, and grant you leave to incorporate it.
Leave granted.
—The speech read as follows—
In the matter of public interest debate today I would like to make some brief and very general remarks about the legislation partially deregulating the Wheat Industry which has been before the Senate this week.
I support the intention of this legislation because it will I believe enable more flexible marketing of wheat which will be of particular benefit to wheat growers in my home state of Western Australia whose wheat is largely sold to the export market.
WA is the largest producer of wheat with a harvest amounting to 37 per cent of Australian’s crop, and more importantly WA is also the largest exporter of wheat in the country even though WA only has 18 per cent of growers.
In fact, unlike growers in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, where most of the wheat grown is sold to the domestic market, the growers in WA largely specifically grow for the export market, as to a lesser extent do those in South Australia.
Because of this WA farmers have a different perspective about the means by which wheat is sold on the international market to growers in the eastern states.
For growers in the eastern states international sales through the single desk structure under the auspices of AWB were a means of disposing of the wheat left over from domestic sales. AWB paid the 80 per cent of the value of the wheat put into the single desk system up-front, providing a strong financial incentive to remain with that system.
Many WA wheat farmers on the other hand have sought some flexibility in marketing and have sought to have the ability to market outside the single desk system, with the objective of enhancing their returns.
This largely meant they were seeking to sell wheat via the WA company CBH, which has flour mills in South East Asia but was not able to purchase wheat from the Western Australian wheat farmers whose wheat CBH collected and stored: surely a bizarre situation.
WA wheat farmers also wished to have the capacity to sell wheat on spot markets in areas such as the Gulf and other parts of Asia which, under the previous regulated marketing system, they were unable to do. This was because the single desk policy gave AWB the right of veto over other exporters. The AWB of course in the interests of protecting its monopoly, was not interested in giving CBH or other exporters the right to sell their wheat independently of the single desk arrangement.
Marketing monopolies such as the single desk of AWB were more common in Australian in the past before Australian trade practices were opened up to competition.
Examples of some of the marketing monopolies which existed in Australia in the era of protection and which now have been abolished include:
Dairy - abolished in 1974
Egg export - abolished in 1984
Wool - abolished in 1991
Meat - abolished 1998
According to the I.P.A. the World Trade Organisation, Doha round of trade negotiations requires the abolition of many state trading enterprises around the world. Some examples of such trading enterprises include: In Canada: The Canadian Dairy Commission and the Canada Wheat Board, in Japan: Japan Tobacco, Japan Food Agency, and in New Zealand: Apple and Pear Marketing Board, New Zealand Dairy Board.
So as trade liberalization spreads around the world, single desk operations such as AWB are being phased out opening markets to more competition and the prospect of enhanced returns to growers as the world market is freed up.
This is an important point to emphasise, namely that there is never only one buyer on the International scene and having attended meetings with marketers in Perth, it would be seem clear that freeing up the process of marketing to new players will potentially see Australian wheat sold into countries where it has never gone before.
One of the arguments which has been raised against this new legislation is that the Ralph Committee conducted a vote on the question of deregulation of wheat exporting and a majority of wheat growers opposed the concept.
However, with respect, it has to be re-emphasised that wheat is grown on small farms in the Eastern states for the domestic market with international sales just being an add on bonus through the single desk requirement to buy all wheat presented to it, with an 80 per cent up-front payment for that wheat being made to these domestic growers. But according to ABARE, 80 per cent of the national wheat crop is produced by big farming operators chiefly in WA where wheat farms are much larger (up to 3 times) than those in NSW and Victoria. WA produces 37 per cent of Australia’s wheat although it has only 18 per cent of the growers and as already stated the WA wheat crop is largely for export.
There are some 18,000 growers in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, who regard selling wheat for export to the AWB as merely cream on the cake of their domestic sales compared to about 11,000 in WA and South Australia, which both have high levels of exports. Accordingly the Ralph Committee assessment of the opinions of wheat grower’s nation wide about changing the export system by abolishing the single desk was preordained to produce a majority in favour of no change.
Had the Ralph Committee allocated votes on the basis of one vote per tonne of wheat exported the result would not only have been a fairer indication of the opinions of growers actually involved in export but would no doubt have been in favour of change.
This bill is based on the South Australian Barley Exporting legislation which has worked well and that history should allay a lot of the fears which have been expressed about the impact of the bill.
The bill does not propose laissez faire total deregulation of wheat exports but is a step in the process of liberalizing the wheat export system providing as it does a licensing system for exporters and the opening up of bulk grain facilities for competition.
In conclusion, I welcome the legislation because it will provide greater marketing opportunities for wheat growers in my home state of Western Australian and also is a further step in the liberalization of Australian trade practises.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-06-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Crossin today relating to the budget surplus.
Today we have seen in the Senate, both this morning and now at question time, the government seeking to dissemble in relation to the issue of referring matters to Senate committees. Whilst this coalition had a very proud record of sending over 100 bills to Senate committees whilst we had the numbers in the Senate and in government, those opposite said that we were abusing the Senate, that we were not referring enough bills to Senate committees. That figure of 100 in our last year of government was the highest ever referral in the Senate’s history. Today, when Labor are in government, we have witnessed the fact that the crocodile tears that they shed in opposition were just that—crocodile tears. They were not genuine, they were not sincere because, as soon as they get the opportunity, they want no Senate scrutiny whatsoever in relation to the important matters that confront this parliament.
What matters do we in the coalition want to refer to Senate committees? The unfortunate history of the short term of this Rudd government is this: a government in disarray, making policy on the run. For example, increasing the tax on alcopops was announced as a health measure, and that had not even passed through the health department. Then there is condensate tax. Do they get advice from the resources department on that? Is there any modelling? No. There is an increase in luxury car tax. Is there anything by way of modelling from the industry department or indeed from Treasury? The answer is no. The one area where they did seek advice from their departments was of course Fuelwatch, and do you know what they did, Mr Deputy President? They rigorously ignored that advice. So here we have a government that either make decisions based on no advice whatsoever or deliberately reject the advice that they receive. This is the government that came into power asserting, through its now Prime Minister, that all their policy decisions would be evidence based. Alcopops? Wrong; every credible medical organisation repudiates the Labor government’s assertions. In relation to the luxury car tax there is complete and utter repudiation by the automotive industry and sector; in relation to condensate, in relation to Fuelwatch—the list goes on and on.
And so, Mr Deputy President, guess what! We as a coalition have said that, in those areas where this government has not sought advice from departments and in those areas where the government has deliberately ignored the advice, on the rare occasion it has sought it, it would be a good idea to protect our fellow Australians by allowing these matters to be looked at by a Senate committee in its inquiry. Of course we have hubris by the tonne being spouted forth by the Leader of the Government in this place—it is spooky to think, as a side reflection, that he was actually Acting Prime Minister of this country. That is a spooky thought; but, thank goodness, it was only for a short period of time. This man comes into this chamber with all the hubris that two shoulders could bear, all the arrogance that could be personified in one person, and says, ‘We are the government. We demand that everything be put through as we demand.’ Can I remind the honourable senator what he said in this place on 14 June 2005:
... the Senate has both a right and a responsibility to debate and review legislation—this legislation and all other legislation that comes before the parliament. That is what Australians expect from this chamber.
We happen to agree with that assertion, and that is why we are submitting certain measures to Senate committees. We invite Senator Evans and the Labor Party to step down and aside from the hubris and allow the Senate to do its work.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2008-06-18,"—Well, well, well. It is not really a surprise that this opposition is so gutless in its approach to Labor’s budget. We have a budget that has already been through two weeks of intense Senate estimates scrutiny. We have a process, a commitment and a mandate to take this budget through the Senate in the next fortnight, and now we have the Liberal Party deliberately vandalising the budget—it cannot be described as anything less than economic vandalism—by denying the government the capacity to maintain the revenue we need for our budget surplus but at the same time passing the aspects of the budget that will support communities. It is an exercise in the most blatant political gutlessness and economic vandalism that this place has ever seen. It is quite phenomenal to hear Senator Abetz—and no doubt there will be others—talk about arrogance and hubris, when we spent 11 years arguing with the opposition, the former government, about the rights of the Senate to scrutinise bills. I do not think there was ever an attempt at economic vandalism such as this by the former Labor opposition to undermine the then coalition government’s budget.
The Labor budget is all about putting downward pressure on inflation by making the sorts of provisions we need to make the Australian community a strong community—but most of all we need to maintain that surplus. It is an extraordinary feat, when you think about the balance that this budget has struck in a very tough economic climate. It is a climate that we inherited from the former government, knowing that inflation rose and rose and rose under the coalition government. We find ourselves today trying to manage the difficulty on behalf of those millions of Australians who are struggling with a mortgage. This is the legacy of the coalition government to the people of Australia. Today we have seen the opposition move motion after motion to defer aspects of revenue-raising bills that relate to our finely attuned budget by referring them to Senate committees, which will have the effect of denying Labor the opportunity to complete our budget in its holistic form.
The coalition, which once proudly claimed its economic credentials, is completely forgoing its purported legacy—which I certainly do not agree with anyway, given the state of the economy—in an absolutely cheapest of the cheap political stunt. Effectively what the coalition parties have told the people of Australia today is that the cheap politics they are prepared to deploy in this place are more important than Australian families and their ability to manage their mortgages. That is the core of the issue that we are debating here today. I am surprised at the coalition senators, but I suppose they have no choice but to come in here and try to take some assertive line with this, because they have no political cover. The whole world now can see the shallowness of any claim this lot have to any economic credentials at all. It is not about economic credentials, economic stability or forward thinking for this lot; it is about cheap political stunts.
As I mentioned, the Liberal Party is undermining our capacity to deliver the $22 billion surplus. The delay of these bills does have an immediate and direct effect on this surplus, and that will have the direct and immediate effect of putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. I think the actions by the coalition today will stand in history as having taken another great big swipe off the surface of any cover that they may have had in terms of their economic credentials. I suppose it is a taste of what is to become the character of the now opposition on the other side of this chamber.
It is also interesting to note that, since we know that the numbers in the Senate will be changing, it is not like this lot have got the courage of their convictions to actually vote against these measures in the forthcoming two weeks of debate. They do not want to do that; they just want to defer them. That is why we describe it as economic vandalism. It is not even about the courage of their convictions, because clearly they have none.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2008-06-18,"—That was a truly awful speech, but I still think it was bad luck that Senator Lundy was not made a frontbencher in the government. I am sure that her speech-making form will improve in coming months to prove me right. I have heard a lot of wild claims, but few more wild than the claims that I heard today in Senator Lundy’s effort. Let us go back and put a few facts on the table. There is a budget surplus of $22 billion. How did that surplus arrive? It arrived through the very hard work of people like Senator Minchin and Peter Costello. The Labor Party had very little to do with this massive surplus. In fact, given their spending and their capacity to spend, one thing we can say is absolutely certain is that that surplus will continue to erode over the years.
The proposition that somehow this surplus was an outcome of Labor government policy is a complete farce. This surplus is the outcome of policies which were put in place by the Howard and Costello government, during which, I might say, so many tax bills were opposed by the Labor Party.
—You were squandering the surplus.
—I could present to this chamber a list of the taxation bills that were voted against by Senator Ludwig and Senator Lundy and indeed all the people on that side. For Senator Lundy to get up here in this chamber and complain about the performance of the senators on this side is a farce.
What have we done? We have referred eight or so bills to Senate committees for further examination and scrutiny. The Labor Party has said, ‘Isn’t this absolutely frightful?’ because this means by the farcical figures that the Labor Party puts out—no-one else’s figures—some $300 million will be lost out of a budget surplus of $22 billion. If the Labor Party wishes it some of the bills can be backdated, so I believe this figure is complete nonsense. To be lectured by Senator Lundy on responsible management of the economy is simply extraordinary. Senator Lundy was a great referrer of bills to Senate committees. I used to note as I came into this chamber, day after day, there would be Senator Lundy making sure that bill after bill was referred to Senate committees.
Senator Ludwig, think about the bills for A New Tax system, which we promised in the election and which the Labor Party opposed with enormous vigour. Not only did you send the legislation for A New Tax system to one committee, you sent it to four committees. Those committees sat on each of the bills for three months or so. We had 12 months of committee hearings into A New Tax system. In the end, they were budget bills based on a clear election promise. What happened? The Labor Party fought it to the very end and voted against it, because, as Senator Ludwig said: ‘This is going to lead to a recession. This is going to lead to cuts in the income of working families.’ Do you remember saying all those things, Senator Ludwig? And what has happened? The Labor Party have become great fans of the GST.
I regret to say that we are seeing some of the greatest examples of hypocrisy that I have ever seen in this chamber. This was the party that specialised in voting against budget bills; this was the party that constantly referred budget bills to Senate committees. So for them to come in and lecture us that we in some way are not acting responsibly has no merit whatsoever, especially after the scrutiny that was given to the GST bills. Just think of the dire consequences that the Labor Party predicted if those bills were ever passed. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-06-18,"—One is tempted to ask the almost rhetorical question as to when the last time was that an opposition that controlled this Senate attempted to thwart the deliberate economic intent of the government of the day by not opposing, by not objecting to, by not rejecting a series of budget bills which seek to implement the electoral commitments of the government of the day. The answer is not in years and years but in decades and decades. The real question is what is the government attempting to achieve in this series of budget bills? The answer is this: we are seeking to pass a series of bills that respect and give effect to a range of commitments to a level of 100 per cent that were given to the Australian people, and approved and endorsed by the Australian people in late November of last year. We went to the Australian people on a policy of economic reform and we put a policy based around fiscal conservatism, which the relevant Treasury spokesman at the time repeatedly explained as large budget surpluses.
Why did we give a commitment to maintain large budget surpluses over the period of our government? It was because we knew that we had inherited a somewhat dire economic situation. Interest rates were on the rise and it was projected that they would continue to rise. We were fearful on the basis of advice from economic experts that inflation was going to take off. And as everyone in this Senate knows, if inflation becomes embedded in an economic system, it has the potential to harm and to destroy the economic welfare of millions and millions of people. We took the hard decision and explained it to the Australian people, and the Australian people endorsed large budget surpluses so that there would be a reduction on pressure to raise interest rates and there would be sufficient funds in the economy to meet necessary demand. At the same time, we had a raft of responsibly costed measures that went to a range of issues. Those matters were the subject of detailed scrutiny and examination for the best part of two whole weeks at Senate estimates, where the opposition had the opportunity to examine line by line a range of current and future government programs that went to the issues relating to spending and outlays. So they did that and they had the opportunity to receive information.
Now, in the last two weeks of the current sitting period, when the opposition still control the Senate, they use their numbers to not reject government measures—because they do not have the guts to come out and say, ‘We are going to reject those measures’—but, instead, to go down the easy path and postpone those measures. And they say that is something that has occurred in the past, that it gives the opportunity to examine legislation and that it gives the opportunity to have proper scrutiny. But what they do not explain and what they do not attempt to excuse is the wanton damage—as explained by others—that they seek to impose upon the Australian economy and on Australian taxpayers by delaying the necessary receipt of taxes for at least a period of three months to a value of almost $300 million. Not for the good reason that the particular policies are not worthwhile; not for the reason that the programs have not been endorsed; not for the reason that the particular issues have not received the support of the Australian people. No, they are not going to reject them outright when the opportunity comes. They intend to delay those measures, simply to go on a series of roadshows around Australia to re-examine—not examine—a range of measures which have been the subject of detailed and lengthy scrutiny. It is nothing other than an abuse of the Senate process to wantonly harm the current government’s budget, which was only some seven months ago endorsed by the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-06-18,"—I have heard something today that I have never heard before: a brand new economic thesis. The thesis from Senator Evans is this: Senate committees put upward pressure on interest rates, parliamentary scrutiny puts upward pressure on interest rates and the desire of a democratically elected parliamentary chamber to provide proper scrutiny puts upward pressure on interest rates. It is an economic thesis I have never heard before and I wonder if this thesis has been put to the Secretary to the Treasury or the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Has this thesis been run past them? If it were, they would laugh at the absurdity of the proposition and they would laugh at its hypocrisy.
When the coalition was first elected to office in 1996, the Australian Labor Party bequeathed it a $10 billion budget deficit. They bequeathed $96 billion in government debt. The hypocrisy is in the fact that Labor opposed each and every measure the former government introduced to bring the budget back into balance. Some budget measures actually took us three years to get through the parliament because Labor said the savings were unnecessary. Labor said that we were taking a baseball bat to the economy. Labor said that we would king-hit the economy with our budget measures. And that was in a situation where there was a genuine inflation crisis; where there was a real fiscal crisis, not a manufactured crisis. We did balance the budget but with no help from Labor. We balanced the budget and we left Labor a budget surplus.
What is Labor’s charge against the coalition? That we left a budget deficit? No. That we left government debt? No. That we left an inflation crisis? No. Even the RBA governor says there is no inflation crisis. Yes, there is a problem and, yes, there is a plan to address it, but there is no inflation crisis. Labor’s charge is that the referral of bills to Senate committees is an abuse of the opposition’s numbers. What rot! Many of these measures were never flagged by Labor during the election campaign. Labor cannot cite mandate theory here. Labor made no mention in its election campaign of a luxury car tax, no mention of a means test for the baby bonus, no mention of a means test on family tax benefit part B, no mention of an increased tax on premixed drinks, no mention of an increase in the passenger movement charge, no mention of an increased tax on condensate and no mention at all of raising the threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge.
What the opposition are doing is what should occur in the Senate. But let us not take our word for it; let us hear what Senator Evans himself has to say. Senator Evans told this chamber in June 2005:
… the Senate has both a right and a responsibility to debate and review legislation—this legislation and all other legislation that comes before the parliament. That is what Australians expect from this chamber.
He went on:
It is our responsibility to provide an alternative view of legislation, to speak out when we think things are wrong and to fight for those people whose interests we represent.
That is what we are doing: we are speaking out; we are fighting for the interests of the people we represent. Our track record in government on referring bills to committees was laudable. In 2006, the first full year of the coalition’s Senate majority, the coalition in government supported the referral of more than a hundred bills to Senate committees for inquiry. This was the highest number of bills ever referred to committees in a calendar year and double the average number of bills referred to committees when the ALP was last in government. When the ALP was in government it was constantly demanding that bills be referred to committees. It was constantly demanding that there be more scrutiny. We are applying scrutiny. The government does not like it. It is our job as an opposition and it is the job of this chamber to review legislation to see where we can improve that legislation. Many of these measures were never flagged during the election campaign and they require greater scrutiny than those measures that were. We will provide that scrutiny. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-18,"—Sitting on the crossbench, as the Australian Democrats have done for over 30 years, you get a different perspective. The Democrats are unique as a political party in that we have always been in a position of permanent opposition or, if you like, separate from the continuing gladiatorial contest between the two major parties. When you sit on the crossbench and look across at the government and opposition of the day making their accusations, it is sometimes pretty hard to remember which side is on which bench. The script tends to be the same; it is just that the people swap from one side to the other and then make the accusations in reverse across the chamber.
Much of what we have heard from the Liberal opposition today matches what the Labor opposition used to say, and much of the defence and counterattack from the Labor government matches what the previous Liberal government used to say. I think that is why we get continual assertions from both sides about dishonesty and hypocrisy. Broadly speaking, people are right: there is a lot of hypocrisy. But what the role of cross-benchers has always been, and needs to continue to be even once the Democrats are gone, is to cut through that hypocrisy and cut to the basic matters.
I should make clear to the Senate, and anyone else who has been following this debate, that the Democrats did not oppose the coalition’s referrals of most of the bills that have been deemed to be budget related when we voted on that earlier today. Whilst we probably felt that some could have been dealt with next week, I think the general principle that, if a matter is complex, if it is fairly recent, and you have to make a decision about whether or not it becomes law, it is best to examine it properly, look at all the consequences and, most importantly, give the community and those with expertise in the community the opportunity to have input so that the Senate can make an informed decision. I accept that. Even though it is clearly inconvenient to the government of the day, whoever they are, to have to delay these things, it is valid to properly examine them for a reasonable length of time. The Democrats’ concern about some of the committee referrals that occurred this morning was that, in some cases, that was not for a reasonable length of time, that the attempt was being made to refer other bills that were not budget related for excessive amounts of time, clearly to try to prevent them from being addressed at all in this chamber. It is a real travesty that that was voted through by the coalition using their numbers—in most cases, I note, with the support of Senator Fielding.
The point needs to be made, nonetheless, that it is grossly absurd for the coalition to now argue that they showed some commitment to transparency in the committee process when they were in government. The public pick up on this. You can throw your misleading statistics around about having a record number of bills referred to committees in your first year of having control of this place but, as has been rightly pointed out, the coalition did misuse and abuse their majority in this place. We are seeing the final throes of that in this fortnight. Quite clearly, one of the key reasons why you lost government was that you abused your majority and pushed things through without proper scrutiny, thus allowing unpopular and extreme legislation to get through because it was not modified and examined properly, and also that people recognise and can see grotesque arrogance and perversion of due process when it happens.
It is not whether you send off 10 or 100 bills; it is whether or not the referrals are appropriate and whether people get the chance to examine them. We had Senator Kemp giving the example of the taxation legislation. Yes, it was examined by four committees over a prolonged period of time—not for a year, but for about six months—and the coalition kicked and screamed and whinged about it all the way along. They did not say, ‘Yeah, sure, great idea’; they complained every inch of the way. And if they had had the numbers, as they did later on, the tax package would have got the same treatment that Work Choices got, that Telstra got, that the Murray-Darling water package got and that the Northern Territory emergency intervention legislation got: it would have been pushed through in the space of a week. That is what would have happened. And you would have kicked and screamed if anyone had suggested otherwise and said we were holding up budget measures and preventing the government from implementing their mandate. We all know the arguments but we all can sniff hypocrisy when it is being put forward. And that is what is being done on this occasion. (Time expired)

It would assist in achieving clarity and certainty if the interpretation section of the principal Instrument (section 4) were amended to include this definition.

Instrument CASA No 222/07 made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988


Instrument No. CASA 364/07 made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988


Instrument No. CASA 445/07 made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988


Instrument No. CASA 450/07 made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988

These instruments allow certain aircraft to operate with a reduced number of cabin attendants. The committee is seeking advice from the minister on the level of consultation undertaken prior to the making of these instruments.

Migration Amendment Regulations 2007 (No. 14), Select Legislative Instrument 2007 No. 356

This instrument makes various amendments to certain visas and visa subclasses in the principal Regulations. The amendments made by Schedule 1 to this instrument commence retrospectively. They reintroduce the power of the Minister to grant refunds of certain visa application charges. The amendments are intended to correct an error introduced by a previous set of amendments, and are of beneficial effect. The explanatory statement provides no advice about the mechanisms by which applicants who became entitled to a refund during the period of retrospective operation will be made aware of their right to request a refund.

Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill:

Unit Pricing (Easy comparison of grocery prices) Bill 2008

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

Family First introduced the Unit Pricing (Easy Comparison of Grocery Prices) Bill 2008 to save families  money by making it mandatory for supermarkets to display a per unit price, such as per kilogram or per litre, on all grocery items sold.
A recent Family First survey uncovered that in one supermarket:
a Pauls 3 litre milk container was actually more expensive per litre than a Pauls 2 litre milk container
a Coles lkg tin of fruit salad was .32% more expensive per kg than the smaller 825g
a 600g jar of Vegemite costs 50% more per kilogram than the 150g jar.
The cost of. food a big part of every family’s budget and unit pricing will help Australians save money at the checkout. By making it mandatory for supermarkets to display unit pricing on grocery items it will provide families with fair and transparent pricing so they can get the best value for their dollar. It is often hard to calculate which items are cheapest with different sizing making quick and easy comparison difficult on a busy shopping day. The bill sets out a der\tailed national, unit pricing scheme. An inquiry would allow feedback from families, community groups and industry.

Possible submissions or evidence from:

Consumer Action Law Centre, Coles, Choice, Aldi, Queensland Consumers Association, Australian Retail Association, Woolworths, National Association of Retail Grocers (NARGA) and various others such as welfare, consumer and community advocate groups.

—I am just a bit confused. You cannot move an amendment to an amendment.
—No, I dropped that out.
—You are amending the report?
—I did say that, ultimately.

—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 2 September 2008”.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—It is in respect of the evidence bill.
—Senator Ludwig has now moved his amendment.

Senator Parry interjecting—

—Senator Parry, this is real musical chairs. It is becoming very confusing in the running of the debate in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—I appreciate that, Mr Deputy President. I seek leave just to make a brief statement.
Leave granted.
—I do apologise to the chamber. The amendment was put on my colleague’s desk. We will be opposing the amendment by Senator Ludwig and we will be proposing an amendment that will read that ‘it report not before 25 September 2008’, for the same bill. I just foreshadow that, and I know you have an amendment before the chamber.
—I will take that as foreshadowing an amendment. We need to deal with Senator Ludwig’s amendment first. I call Senator Ludwig.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—Thank you, Deputy President. I do not want to make it any more confusing than it is, but the situation is this. The Selection of Bills Committee report would be amended by the opposition to refer the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 to a committee to report at the date that Senator Parry outlined, as I understand it. The government will not oppose the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, but we do think that a report at the end of September is unacceptable. We think an earlier reporting date would be preferable, and that is 2 September 2008.
—The amendment before the chair at this stage is Senator Ludwig’s amendment for a reporting date of 2 September.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-18,"—Can I say that the opposition did try to sort this out with the minister’s office. We asked for a reporting date of 25 September simply because, although this legislation is not controversial in a party-political sense, it is extremely complex legislation which proposes alterations to the rules of evidence in 11 particular respects. It is my view that, in order to do the scrutiny of the bill justice, it is necessary for that committee, which is already burdened with other weighty inquiries in the near future, to have a little more time.
This is not intrinsically urgent. The uniform evidence legislation arises from a report of the Australian Law Reform Commission which was delivered in 2006. It is not credible to say that any mischief would be done by the postponement of the operation of the amendments to the Evidence Act by another three weeks in order to give the Senate the opportunity to scrutinise what are very technical amendments, which have attracted not a lot of public comment but a great deal of attention from the bar and the professional associations, who will no doubt want to make submissions to the inquiry and have them considered properly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2008-06-18,"—I just want to say that the Democrats do not have a problem with the proposed longer inquiry. I do not think anyone has actually sought our views or felt a need to liaise with us, given that this is an issue post 1 July, but I would like to acknowledge that we have had some concerns with some of the matters that are contained within that legislation. I think it was initially popped into the non-controversial legislation category and was due to be debated on Thursday of this week. So we are glad to see this referred to committee. Obviously it is much of a muchness now as to whether or not it reports as proposed by the government or indeed by the opposition, but I do not think a few extra weeks would be a particular problem. Having said that, I will not be there to do the debate, but I am actually very glad that we are not going to be dealing with this through a ‘non-controversial’ lunchtime period, because I think that the legislation deserves more analysis, more scrutiny and potentially some debate and amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—by leave—I will just make a few short comments about this bill in response. The government are clearly of the view that we would prefer to have the bill dealt with in non-controversial legislative time and the bill pass by 1 July. There is no mistake about our position on that. Faced with the position that the opposition do not agree with that and have shifted the date to some time late in September, we took the opportunity of arguing, as we are doing now, that an earlier reporting date would at least make the legislation available earlier.
The reason is that the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is, in truth, largely technical in nature. A number of amendments have been made to address developments in case law. The bill also seeks to promote harmonisation in evidence law between Australian jurisdictions. The bill is based on the model evidence bill endorsed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, SCAG, in July 2007.
Considering the nature of the proposed amendments and the consultation processes that were conducted to develop the evidence reforms to this point, the referral, in our view, is not warranted. The consultation included an 18-month review on the operation of the uniform evidence laws regime, conducted by the Australian, Victorian and New South Wales law reform commissions. That is the 2005 ALRC report Uniform evidence law. The Law Reform Commission found no major structural problems with the evidence acts or with the underlying policy and made recommendations to finetune the evidence acts. Numerous consultations were held in every state and territory, and 130 written submissions were considered.
Commonwealth, state and territory jurisdictions worked cooperatively to develop a model evidence bill to implement a majority of the Law Reform Commission recommendations. During the development of the model evidence bill, an expert reference group provided advice on the model bill. New South Wales have already enacted changes to the Evidence Act 1995 based on the SCAG endorsed model evidence bill and are waiting for the Commonwealth bill to be passed before they can commence their act.
There may be some comment from the opposition that this bill does not address the implementation of a general confidential relationship of privilege beyond journalists or the provision extending client legal privilege and public interest immunity to pre-trial hearings. Of course, it is appropriate that the government consider these issues relating to privilege as it develops its response to the Australian Law Reform Commission report Privilege in perspective, which was tabled earlier this year. Journalist shield laws are also being considered separately by the government.
The extension of the compellability provisions to same-sex couples may attract, as we have seen today, some attention. These issues are in fact better examined in the context of the examination of the second same-sex relationships bill 2008, relating to the removal of same-sex discriminatory references in a variety of Commonwealth laws. I thought it was worthwhile putting that in context for the opposition, particularly the shadow Attorney-General, to help them understand our position. We do not agree to the reference. However, faced with the reality of the numbers in this place, we are trying to seek cooperation to find at least an early reporting date so that we can meet the New South Wales requirements and they can bring their legislation into place. I understand the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs does have a heavy workload. I have served on that committee in the past and it is not unusual for it to have a heavy workload. That is recognised. I am confident that the legal and constitutional committee can adequately deal with this in the time available to ensure that the New South Wales laws are not unduly delayed.
—Before we proceed, is it easier if we proceed by way of the consideration of Senator Ludwig’s amendment to allow you to move your amendment, Senator Parry, or do you want to speak in the debate? I am not trying to curb the debate. What looms as the easiest way?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—by leave—I was just going to make a simple explanation, if I can, in relation to the comments of Senator Ludwig. It is just important to note that our Selection of Bills Committee meeting on 17 June this week was moved to a different timeslot. We were rushed out of the chamber to a meeting. We considered some 42 pieces of legislation at that meeting. When you are dealing with that much legislation, sometimes the scrutiny of every individual piece of legislation is not what it should be. The particular bill was originally listed in the non-controversial portion of the report but, after examination and reflection after the meeting, we came to the conclusion that it needs to be referred, as we have discussed. I just wanted to set the background as to why it was not dealt with in the Selection of Bills Committee meeting in the first instance.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-18,"—by leave—This should never have been thought to be a non-controversial piece of legislation merely because, as I said before, it might not be controversial in a party-political sense. It certainly needs detailed scrutiny for the very reasons Senator Ludwig adverted to—that is, it is a highly technical bill. A bill that affects the conduct of criminal and civil trials in relation to a range of important evidentiary rules is of the first importance. Senator Ludwig, who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber, may not be aware that the bill has been heavily criticised in some respects by, for example, the New South Wales Bar Association. Given the far-reaching effect upon the liberties of the subject and the conduct of the judicial system of some of the recommendations of the ALRC which are adopted by this legislation, it is the very sort of bill which needs proper scrutiny by this chamber. Nothing that has come from Senator Ludwig has persuaded me that there is any time line or deadline, whether emanating from New South Wales or any other jurisdiction, which necessitates consideration earlier than a reporting date of 25 September.
—I think I have been very tolerant of the debate backwards and forwards. I think we should really crystallise this debate by putting Senator Ludwig’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—We have actually gotten out of order. I need to withdraw my amendment, though it was nevertheless important to have this debate to set out our position. I will withdraw my amendment so that Senator Parry can put his amendment. We can then at least set the record straight for the Clerk of the Senate. I am sure he would be pleased if we do that.
—You are withdrawing your amendment, Senator Ludwig?
—I am. We will simply vote against Senator Parry’s amendment.
—Is leave granted to withdraw?
Leave is granted.
—Unanimity has broken out!",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—As an amendment to the Selection of Bills Committee report that we are considering now, I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report not before 25 September 2008”.
—Senator O’Brien, you can now close the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2008-06-18,"—I trust that I will not cause someone to seek leave to speak again in this debate. It has almost been a debate by leave. The reality is that this report, which I presented, has been circulated for some time. You will see that in item 3, the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is clearly delineated as a bill that is not to be referred to committees. The process of the committee was to go through the bills and ask for a determination that a bill be referred, not be referred or be deferred. So there are three options in that process. There was a very clear decision that this bill not be referred. That does not deal in any way with the rights of any senator to request that a bill not be dealt with in non-controversial legislation time. That is a different question.
I understand that it was communicated to the government that the opposition were happy to have this bill dealt with in that time this Thursday. I see Senator Brandis is shaking his head, but that is the information that I believe had been conveyed to the government. There may have been a breakdown in communication somewhere, but the reality is that the committee’s report is an accurate reflection of the meeting of the committee and that, at no stage during the meeting of the committee, was it suggested in any way that this bill might be referred or deferred. My recollection is that it was determined that it not be referred. Clearly very late in the piece, someone’s attention has been drawn to concerns which may have existed before the meeting but certainly were not drawn to the attention of the meeting. For the purposes of the processing of legislation before the committee, one can accept that from time to time matters slip through unnoticed but, on the other hand, there is a responsibility on all parties to bring to the meeting a position on what they wish to be done with legislation. That is so that, when this report comes before the chamber, we do not get into this sort of situation. That is so that it is an accurate reflection of the parties’ positions in relation to legislation so that the Selection of Bills Committee report can be adopted and we can process the necessary references and determine that bills not be referred in the way that is normally the process.
—I understand that Senator Parry seeks leave. It is a bit unusual.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—I appreciate the chamber’s indulgence. I will be very brief. Senator O’Brien is correct. The way the committee report reflects it is accurate. However, I did indicate that the committee time had changed. Due scrutiny of the entire list is a little bit more problematic when the committee time changes at short notice. There were over 40 matters discussed at that committee meeting. To have everyone digest and understand the complexities of each of those pieces of legislation or those bills is difficult in itself. I indicate that the Greens and the Democrats were also present at that meeting and did not raise any issue with that particular bill. The complexity of that particular bill had escaped the notice of all parties. I want to just indicate that, whilst we like to facilitate the processes in the best way we can, we have had a slightly disrupted week for a variety of reasons. That committee was one of those occasions, with a change of time and a large volume of bills to be considered.

a Pauls 3 litre milk container was actually more expensive per litre than a Pauls 2 litre milk container
a Coles lkg tin of fruit salad was .32% more expensive per kg than the smaller 825g
a 600g jar of Vegemite costs 50% more per kilogram than the 150g jar.
The cost of. food a big part of every family’s budget and unit pricing will help Australians save money at the checkout. By making it mandatory for supermarkets to display unit pricing on grocery items it will provide families with fair and transparent pricing so they can get the best value for their dollar. It is often hard to calculate which items are cheapest with different sizing making quick and easy comparison difficult on a busy shopping day. The bill sets out a der\tailed national, unit pricing scheme. An inquiry would allow feedback from families, community groups and industry.

Possible submissions or evidence from:

Consumer Action Law Centre, Coles, Choice, Aldi, Queensland Consumers Association, Australian Retail Association, Woolworths, National Association of Retail Grocers (NARGA) and various others such as welfare, consumer and community advocate groups.

Leave granted.
—I do apologise to the chamber. The amendment was put on my colleague’s desk. We will be opposing the amendment by Senator Ludwig and we will be proposing an amendment that will read that ‘it report not before 25 September 2008’, for the same bill.

—I will take that as foreshadowing an amendment. We need to deal with Senator Ludwig’s amendment first. I call Senator Ludwig.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—Thank you, Deputy President. I do not want to make it any more confusing than it is, but the situation is this. The Selection of Bills Committee report would be amended by the opposition to refer the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 to a committee to report at the date that Senator Parry outlined, as I understand it. The government will not oppose the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, but we do think that a report at the end of September is unacceptable. We think an earlier reporting date would be preferable, and that is 2 September 2008.
—The amendment before the chair at this stage is Senator Ludwig’s amendment for a reporting date of 2 September.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-18,"—Can I say that the opposition did try to sort this out with the minister’s office. We asked for a reporting date of 25 September simply because, although this legislation is not controversial in a party-political sense, it is extremely complex legislation which proposes alterations to the rules of evidence in 11 particular respects. It is my view that, in order to do the scrutiny of the bill justice, it is necessary for that committee, which is already burdened with other weighty inquiries in the near future, to have a little more time.
This is not intrinsically urgent. The uniform evidence legislation arises from a report of the Australian Law Reform Commission which was delivered in 2006. It is not credible to say that any mischief would be done by the postponement of the operation of the amendments to the Evidence Act by another three weeks in order to give the Senate the opportunity to scrutinise what are very technical amendments, which have attracted not a lot of public comment but a great deal of attention from the bar and the professional associations, who will no doubt want to make submissions to the inquiry and have them considered properly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2008-06-18,"—I just want to say that the Democrats do not have a problem with the proposed longer inquiry. I do not think anyone has actually sought our views or felt a need to liaise with us, given that this is an issue post 1 July, but I would like to acknowledge that we have had some concerns with some of the matters that are contained within that legislation. I think it was initially popped into the non-controversial legislation category and was due to be debated on Thursday of this week. So we are glad to see this referred to committee. Obviously it is much of a muchness now as to whether or not it reports as proposed by the government or indeed by the opposition, but I do not think a few extra weeks would be a particular problem. Having said that, I will not be there to do the debate, but I am actually very glad that we are not going to be dealing with this through a ‘non-controversial’ lunchtime period, because I think that the legislation deserves more analysis, more scrutiny and potentially some debate and amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—by leave—I will just make a few short comments about this bill in response. The government are clearly of the view that we would prefer to have the bill dealt with in non-controversial legislative time and the bill pass by 1 July. There is no mistake about our position on that. Faced with the position that the opposition do not agree with that and have shifted the date to some time late in September, we took the opportunity of arguing, as we are doing now, that an earlier reporting date would at least make the legislation available earlier.
The reason is that the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is, in truth, largely technical in nature. A number of amendments have been made to address developments in case law. The bill also seeks to promote harmonisation in evidence law between Australian jurisdictions. The bill is based on the model evidence bill endorsed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, SCAG, in July 2007.
Considering the nature of the proposed amendments and the consultation processes that were conducted to develop the evidence reforms to this point, the referral, in our view, is not warranted. The consultation included an 18-month review on the operation of the uniform evidence laws regime, conducted by the Australian, Victorian and New South Wales law reform commissions. That is the 2005 ALRC report Uniform evidence law. The Law Reform Commission found no major structural problems with the evidence acts or with the underlying policy and made recommendations to finetune the evidence acts. Numerous consultations were held in every state and territory, and 130 written submissions were considered.
Commonwealth, state and territory jurisdictions worked cooperatively to develop a model evidence bill to implement a majority of the Law Reform Commission recommendations. During the development of the model evidence bill, an expert reference group provided advice on the model bill. New South Wales have already enacted changes to the Evidence Act 1995 based on the SCAG endorsed model evidence bill and are waiting for the Commonwealth bill to be passed before they can commence their act.
There may be some comment from the opposition that this bill does not address the implementation of a general confidential relationship of privilege beyond journalists or the provision extending client legal privilege and public interest immunity to pre-trial hearings. Of course, it is appropriate that the government consider these issues relating to privilege as it develops its response to the Australian Law Reform Commission report Privilege in perspective, which was tabled earlier this year. Journalist shield laws are also being considered separately by the government.
The extension of the compellability provisions to same-sex couples may attract, as we have seen today, some attention. These issues are in fact better examined in the context of the examination of the second same-sex relationships bill 2008, relating to the removal of same-sex discriminatory references in a variety of Commonwealth laws. I thought it was worthwhile putting that in context for the opposition, particularly the shadow Attorney-General, to help them understand our position. We do not agree to the reference. However, faced with the reality of the numbers in this place, we are trying to seek cooperation to find at least an early reporting date so that we can meet the New South Wales requirements and they can bring their legislation into place. I understand the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs does have a heavy workload. I have served on that committee in the past and it is not unusual for it to have a heavy workload. That is recognised. I am confident that the legal and constitutional committee can adequately deal with this in the time available to ensure that the New South Wales laws are not unduly delayed.
—Before we proceed, is it easier if we proceed by way of the consideration of Senator Ludwig’s amendment to allow you to move your amendment, Senator Parry, or do you want to speak in the debate? I am not trying to curb the debate. What looms as the easiest way?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—by leave—I was just going to make a simple explanation, if I can, in relation to the comments of Senator Ludwig. It is just important to note that our Selection of Bills Committee meeting on 17 June this week was moved to a different timeslot. We were rushed out of the chamber to a meeting. We considered some 42 pieces of legislation at that meeting. When you are dealing with that much legislation, sometimes the scrutiny of every individual piece of legislation is not what it should be. The particular bill was originally listed in the non-controversial portion of the report but, after examination and reflection after the meeting, we came to the conclusion that it needs to be referred, as we have discussed. I just wanted to set the background as to why it was not dealt with in the Selection of Bills Committee meeting in the first instance.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-18,"—by leave—This should never have been thought to be a non-controversial piece of legislation merely because, as I said before, it might not be controversial in a party-political sense. It certainly needs detailed scrutiny for the very reasons Senator Ludwig adverted to—that is, it is a highly technical bill. A bill that affects the conduct of criminal and civil trials in relation to a range of important evidentiary rules is of the first importance. Senator Ludwig, who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber, may not be aware that the bill has been heavily criticised in some respects by, for example, the New South Wales Bar Association. Given the far-reaching effect upon the liberties of the subject and the conduct of the judicial system of some of the recommendations of the ALRC which are adopted by this legislation, it is the very sort of bill which needs proper scrutiny by this chamber. Nothing that has come from Senator Ludwig has persuaded me that there is any time line or deadline, whether emanating from New South Wales or any other jurisdiction, which necessitates consideration earlier than a reporting date of 25 September.
—I think I have been very tolerant of the debate backwards and forwards. I think we should really crystallise this debate by putting Senator Ludwig’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-18,"—We have actually gotten out of order. I need to withdraw my amendment, though it was nevertheless important to have this debate to set out our position. I will withdraw my amendment so that Senator Parry can put his amendment. We can then at least set the record straight for the Clerk of the Senate. I am sure he would be pleased if we do that.
—You are withdrawing your amendment, Senator Ludwig?
—I am. We will simply vote against Senator Parry’s amendment.
—Is leave granted to withdraw?
Leave is granted.
—Unanimity has broken out!",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—As an amendment to the Selection of Bills Committee report that we are considering now, I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report not before 25 September 2008”.
—Senator O’Brien, you can now close the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2008-06-18,"—I trust that I will not cause someone to seek leave to speak again in this debate. It has almost been a debate by leave. The reality is that this report, which I presented, has been circulated for some time. You will see that in item 3, the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is clearly delineated as a bill that is not to be referred to committees. The process of the committee was to go through the bills and ask for a determination that a bill be referred, not be referred or be deferred. So there are three options in that process. There was a very clear decision that this bill not be referred. That does not deal in any way with the rights of any senator to request that a bill not be dealt with in non-controversial legislation time. That is a different question.
I understand that it was communicated to the government that the opposition were happy to have this bill dealt with in that time this Thursday. I see Senator Brandis is shaking his head, but that is the information that I believe had been conveyed to the government. There may have been a breakdown in communication somewhere, but the reality is that the committee’s report is an accurate reflection of the meeting of the committee and that, at no stage during the meeting of the committee, was it suggested in any way that this bill might be referred or deferred. My recollection is that it was determined that it not be referred. Clearly very late in the piece, someone’s attention has been drawn to concerns which may have existed before the meeting but certainly were not drawn to the attention of the meeting. For the purposes of the processing of legislation before the committee, one can accept that from time to time matters slip through unnoticed but, on the other hand, there is a responsibility on all parties to bring to the meeting a position on what they wish to be done with legislation. That is so that, when this report comes before the chamber, we do not get into this sort of situation. That is so that it is an accurate reflection of the parties’ positions in relation to legislation so that the Selection of Bills Committee report can be adopted and we can process the necessary references and determine that bills not be referred in the way that is normally the process.
—I understand that Senator Parry seeks leave. It is a bit unusual.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-06-18,"—I appreciate the chamber’s indulgence. I will be very brief. Senator O’Brien is correct. The way the committee report reflects it is accurate. However, I did indicate that the committee time had changed. Due scrutiny of the entire list is a little bit more problematic when the committee time changes at short notice. There were over 40 matters discussed at that committee meeting. To have everyone digest and understand the complexities of each of those pieces of legislation or those bills is difficult in itself. I indicate that the Greens and the Democrats were also present at that meeting and did not raise any issue with that particular bill. The complexity of that particular bill had escaped the notice of all parties. I want to just indicate that, whilst we like to facilitate the processes in the best way we can, we have had a slightly disrupted week for a variety of reasons. That committee was one of those occasions, with a change of time and a large volume of bills to be considered.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-06-18,"—As I was saying yesterday, the Rudd Labor government is fixing the problems created with housing affordability under the previous coalition government. We now have a Minister for Housing, Tanya Plibersek, backed up by departmental capacity in the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The previous government did not even have a housing department, nor a minister for housing. That is how concerned they were over the affordability issue facing working Australians. They just did not care; they were so out of touch. I think it has been demonstrated since the last election that the coalition still have not learned—they are still arrogant, they are still out of touch, and they have not listened to the Australian people.
On this side of the house, the Rudd Labor government have got clear goals in pushing policy forward. We want more Australians to own their own homes. We want enough housing supply to meet the demand. We want first home buyers to have a bigger deposit when they are able to buy their first home. We want a more affordable rental market that attracts private sector investment. We want to reform the system of public and community housing, and we want to halve the rate of homelessness. Homeownership is not just about ensuring people have a place to live; homes are also financial assets. For many Australians, their home is their largest asset, accounting for, on average, 55 per cent of their wealth. Owning a home gives us the certainty of a roof over our heads when we retire, making it a little easier when we do retire. But, even more importantly, it certainly helps those that are reliant on a pension.
I am confident that these measures will help young Australians realise the dream of homeownership, and I am proud to be part of a government that is willing and ready to address the real issues that are facing our country like petrol and grocery prices, the housing crisis and the health system. We had 12 years of neglect from the former government, and they left us with a legacy of inflationary pressures on all Australians, particularly working Australians. It has been left to the Rudd Labor government to come in and clean up the mess that was left by the former Howard coalition government. The Australian government under Kevin Rudd has a vision for Australia’s long-term future. This legislation is an important part of that vision, and I commend the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-18,"—The Democrats support the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills, and that is a matter of record. As recently as a couple of days ago in speaking to a Senate committee report, I spoke on this issue of providing more support to people in the area of housing. The proposal for the first home saver accounts is a welcome one.
It has been a long-standing concern of mine and the Democrats that there has not been adequate attention paid at the national level to provide more assistance to people to help them deal with the housing affordability crisis, nor has enough attention been paid at the national level to try and reduce the problem of housing affordability as a whole. I am sure the government is not suggesting that First Home Saver Accounts on their own will be the solution to the difficulties that first home buyers face, but I do think they will provide some assistance for some people. Anything that helps move things forward should be supported, but it should not be done so uncritically. I think that is the key part of this area, and it is still one of the unanswered questions with regard to the federal government. It is indisputably a positive thing, that they now have a minister specifically responsible for, and focused on, housing issues. It is also indisputably a positive thing to have greater resources attached to the bureaucracy at the national level to support the minister—people who are specifically focused on and have responsibility for housing issues.
One of the problems that we have had in the past—in part because that has not existed—has been a lack of data and a lack of examination of the consequences of measures. That must apply to this new measure. We need to closely monitor how it operates, not just in terms of how many individual people access it and then uncritically wave a flag and say, ‘All of those people have now been helped by this account,’ without any examination of the wider issues. We also need to try and assess the consequential impacts of this account. Some of these things are hard to nail down precisely, but I think we need to make an effort.
One of the valid criticisms of the First Home Owner Grant has been that it was potentially inflationary—I think undoubtedly inflationary. In some areas all it has done is provide some extra capacity for demand to push up the price in terms of available housing. That issue was addressed in the recent report by the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability. I remind the Senate and those interested in this issue that it is a very worthwhile and unanimous report. I would encourage people to study and examine it. The same possible consequence can potentially be one amongst other consequences that occurs as a result of this measure.
Personally I would like to see, as I stated in this place the other day, the First Home Owner Grant scheme being wound back, targeted much more precisely, means tested and applied to lower cost housing only—rather than being open to all comers whatever their income, their resources and the cost of the house they are buying. We should be targeting these measures at people that need assistance rather than providing grants or tax breaks for people that are already doing well. That is something that I think also needs to be monitored with regard to the first home saver accounts.
Certainly there is some criticism—perhaps ‘concern’ is a better word—that this measure might end up providing more taxpayer subsidies to people who are well-off than those who are less well-off. That is not necessarily in itself a reason not to do it, but I think it depends on the extent of that disparity. Let us not forget that what we are doing through this process is dedicating some tax expenditure to assisting people to afford homes. In the past we have suffered from massive amounts of money going in and purportedly being spent on housing measures without any real assessment of whether or not they are effective in terms of value for money for the taxpayer, in terms of affordability, in terms of not making the problem worse and in terms of being targeted at those most in need.
We have not done a lot of those assessments in the past. We certainly have not done them for the First Home Owner Grant, and that has been a problem—that we have not even had the data there to make the assessment. People have had to speculate to some extent. I think the concerns as a consequence of those speculations are valid, but it has been quite unsatisfactory. We have had sizeable amounts of public money spent through that grant without a lot of effort put into gathering the data about how it is applied, what its impacts have been, whether it has gone to people most in need, whether it has had a positive or a negative net effect on housing affordability and all of those sorts of things. When we are giving tax breaks to people we need to closely assess the total cost, the net impact and the benefit for individuals and for the public.
It is on a totally different scale and in a different context, but nonetheless I think it is valid to draw the comparison with the capital gains tax exemption on the family home. That is something that, according to the report of the Senate committee inquiry into housing affordability that was tabled the other day, is estimated to cost as much as $20 billion a year. That is an estimate, and, frankly, I am still astonished that there is so little effort put in by Treasury and others to more accurately measure the extent of that tax break. Whatever it is—whether it is $20 billion or substantially less—it is a hell of a lot, and it is a lot more than the money provided for public housing, for the First Home Owner Grant and rent assistance. If you add all of those, the result is still nowhere near the cost of that single tax exemption. I know no-one from either of the major parties is going to suggest that that tax exemption be scrapped. I use it simply to point out that an exemption in itself is not necessarily a good thing and certainly not necessarily the most cost-effective thing. That exemption is clearly far more beneficial for people who are well-off. It is a regressive tax break. It may have other social good attached to it, but we should at least be clear about the pluses and minuses.
The same should apply to this legislation. On balance it is definitely a plus. One extra reason I think it is a plus is that it reinstitutes a savings culture, which has disappeared to a large extent in recent times, for a range of measures. It is now much more easy to access a housing loan without having saved a sizeable deposit. People can use the aforementioned home owners grant and just whack it straight onto a deposit or, in some cases, use it in lieu of a deposit. That is good in terms of helping people purchase a house, in terms of the immediate consequence, but if it means people taking on board more debt than they can really manage then you are probably not really doing them a favour in the long run. You also are potentially creating unhelpful consequences for the overall cost of buying a home. If you have more money available and able to be borrowed than people can really afford, that can have the effect of unhelpfully and excessively stimulating demand, and that just makes it more difficult for everybody. So I think the impact of encouraging a savings culture through this is significant on its own, regardless of all of the other impacts the legislation may have. I know it is not the only measure the federal government is putting forward with regard to housing and purchasing a home, or indeed housing more broadly.
I welcome this and the other measures that have been put forward. I still think a lot more needs to be done, I might say, and done quite urgently. Some of that involves taking decisions that are potentially politically difficult. But, when you compare that to the enormous hardship that a lot of Australians are suffering at the moment because of the high cost of housing, particularly the high cost of renting, you see that those difficult political decisions need to be confronted. It was the refusal to confront those over the years that led us to the mess we are in today. We support the legislation and we hope that its impact and effects are monitored closely.",SENATE,<title>FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-06-18,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Mr President, I rise to speak to the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills.
The purpose of this bill and the related legislation is simple: it is designed to help many Australians realise the dream of owning their own home.
As we know the cost of housing has skyrocketed over the past decade ... that-the dream has become more and more remote for families, couples and singles around the nation ... more and more of a struggle for many people just wanting a modest place to call their own...a place to call home.
It doesn’t seem that long ago in my home state of South Australia that $250,000 would buy an extremely well-appointed house in Adelaide or an inner-city suburb.
The real estate pages make it clear that these days a similar property would fetch anywhere between $500,000 and $800,000.
A 3-bedroom unit that sold for $102,000 in 1995, was snapped up at $321,000 in 2007.
The picture is clear. It’s tough for people trying to break into the market in 2008.
Median Adelaide house prices for the March quarter this year, according to the Real Estate Institute of South Australia, were more than $350,000.
Eight years ago, in March 2000, the median price for a metropolitan house was around $130,000.
The reality is, that would-be first homebuyers still are battling to gain a foothold on the path to owning their own home.
In the bills before us today, ...
The Government is honouring a promise to the Australian people to work for better housing affordability ... to bring the dream back within reach.
The main bill before us establishes First Home Saver Accounts, which are low-tax accounts aimed at giving aspiring homebuyers a boost.
The accounts are an uncomplicated, tax-effective means by which Australians can save up for their first home, resulting from the partnership of low taxes and Government contributions.
They aim to give a hand to those working hard and saving hard for their first home.
The Government will add 17 per cent on the first $5000 put in by individuals, meaning that through the scheme, a couple on average incomes will be able to save a deposit of more than $88,000 after five years.
That’s up to $12,600 more towards the cost of a home than the same couple would save using an ordinary deposit account, naturally dependent on returns.
As an added benefit, the First Home Saver Accounts will provide young people with a real incentive to save.
This is not only a Government determined to reform, revamp, repair and re-energise a society ...
The Rudd Labor Government is a government that, unlike its predecessor, believes in listening to the people who elected it ... and working towards a better, fairer, more inclusive nation for the young people of today and tomorrow.
This Government believes in working with the Australian people ... that’s why, after broad consultation, this policy has further been improved.
The resultant legislation makes for a program that is more straightforward—and, crucially, fairer.
Among these changes for the better, we’ve removed the $1000 upfront contribution and the link to residency.
This will make it simpler for people who don’t currently have savings, to open an account and get a foot in the door of home ownership.
In another sensible, simplifying move, the Government has moved to an overall indexed account balance limit of $75,000, rather than the $10,000 annual contributions limit previously proposed.
Another important aspect of the scheme is that parents and grandparents will be able to put money into accounts for their children and grandchildren.
And parents who want to open an account for their child also will benefit from the removal of the required $1,000 upfront deposit.
These factors will see further benefits to those saving for their first home.
The second bill in the package, puts forward consequential amendments needed to establish the First Home Saver Accounts.
These amendments largely relate to tax and corporations law.
Individual contributions to the First Home Saver Accounts are not taxed as they come out of participants’ income after tax.
The government’s contributions to the accounts will not be subject to tax.
There are other tax savings, too, with these special new accounts.
Withdrawals to buy a first home will not be taxed, while earnings on the accounts will be taxed to the account provider at 15 per cent.
With a regular account, the individual account holders would be taxed on any earnings at their marginal income tax rates.
To ensure those taking part don’t misuse the accounts, the third bill in the package establishes the First Home Saver Account Misuse Tax, which will be applied to recoup any benefits improperly obtained.
Overall, these bills give people striving for their first home a chance to gain this important asset.
They will give Australians a chance to take part more fully in society and to build more economic and social stability for themselves and their families.
I commend these bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-18,"—First of all, I thank the various senators for their contribution to this debate. The introduction of the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills marks an important new beginning in housing policy in Australia. Homeownership is important to the wellbeing of Australians, and the accounts will help more Australians to once again realise the dream of homeownership. The biggest barrier to homeownership is saving for the deposit. First home saver accounts will provide a tax-effective way for Australians to save through a combination of a 17 per cent government contribution and a low 15 per cent tax rate on earnings. For example, a couple who were both earning average incomes and putting aside 10 per cent of their income into individual first home saver accounts would be able to save more than $88,000 after five years. That is almost $13,000 more than they otherwise would have.
The government’s First Home Saver Accounts initiative is part of our responsible approach to economic management, as it encourages young Australians to save. The government is investing around $1.2 billion over four years in the First Home Saver Accounts policy, including administrative costs. This is part of a package of measures, costing $2.2 billion over four years, to boost housing supply and assist those most in need, namely first home buyers and renters on low and moderate incomes. This includes the Housing Affordability Fund, which will assist local governments to reduce the cost of providing new housing related infrastructure and improve planning processes; the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which will provide investors with incentives to construct rental housing for low- and middle-income households with rents 20 per cent below the market level; and a better approach to land release with the identification of surplus Commonwealth land which could be developed into additional new housing. Through these measures, the government is taking the initiative to provide housing affordability for all Australians.
I would also like to clarify some points raised by opposition speakers in relation to the bill. It was suggested that the first home saver accounts do not allow for fluctuating incomes. That is not correct. In order to withdraw money from a first home saver account, contributions of at least $1,000 must be made in each of at least four financial years. The requirement is not that contributions must be made in the first four financial years or even four consecutive financial years. Individuals will not have their accounts closed if they are unable to contribute for a year or two. If an individual finds themselves in a position where they are unable to contribute for a year or so, their account will remain open. When they are again in a position to be able to contribute, they may do so. The government contribution will be paid on any amount of personal contributions up to a maximum of $5,000 per year. It is not necessary to contribute a minimum of $1,000 to receive a government contribution. There is no requirement for an individual to hold an account for four years before they receive a government contribution.
A speaker referred to comments made about the level of complexity of the first home saver accounts in response to the consultation paper issued by the government in February 2008. The government has listened to industry and the community. The final policy design announced by the government in the 2008-09 budget has simplified the overall operation of the first home saver accounts for individuals, account providers and the tax office. These changes will make it easier for account providers to offer the accounts and for account holders to understand how they operate. The most important of these changes is the flat 17 per cent government contribution on the first $5,000 of personal contributions, which has streamlined and simplified the contribution arrangements. First home saver accounts will receive significant tax concessions, along with government contributions designed to assist individuals to save for their first home. Given these benefits, it is important that there be laws and compliance measures in place to ensure first home saver accounts are being used solely to assist with the purchase of a first home. The government has worked with the potential providers to ensure compliance costs are minimised.
Once again, I thank those who contributed to this debate. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-06-18,"—The Senate is considering the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2008. This bill increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for individuals and families and the low-income threshold of the Medicare levy surcharge to ensure that low-income individuals and families will continue not to be required to pay the Medicare levy or surcharge. The arrangements to ensure that low-income families are not inadvertently required to pay the Medicare levy, by linking the low-income threshold to the consumer price index, have been in place since the Medicare levy itself was introduced, by the Hawke government, in 1984. The taxable income levels below which no Medicare levy is payable are regularly adjusted to take account of the movements in the CPI. Different low-income thresholds are set for individuals, couples, families and pensioners who are under age pension age.
The bill proposes that the low-income exemption threshold be set at $17,309 for an individual without dependants and whose income does not exceed this amount. The threshold for a pensioner under the age pension age will commence at $22,922. An escalating scale of levels of the low-income threshold will be introduced for families, according to the number of children and/or eligible dependent students in the family unit and according to the level of income. The opposition supports this bill, consistent with the bipartisan approach which has been taken to ensure those on low incomes are not required to pay the full levy.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-18,"—I thank Senator Colbeck and other senators for their contribution to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2008. The bill will increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families in line with increases in the consumer price index. The low-income thresholds and the Medicare levy surcharge provisions will similarly be increased. These changes will ensure that low-income individuals and families will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy or surcharge. I note that indexation of the Medicare levy has enjoyed bipartisan support for a number of years. The bill will also increase the Medicare levy threshold for pensioners below age pension age to ensure that where these pensioners do not have an income tax liability they will also not have a Medicare levy liability. The amendments will apply to the 2007-08 year of income and later income years. Again, I would like to thank Senator Colbeck for his contribution.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-06-18,"—I did intend to speak and I am sorry I did not make it to the chamber in time. I seek leave to have my speech in the second reading debate incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy surcharge) Bill 2008.
Although this Bill relates strongly to another Bill—the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008, the Senate is not considering them jointly.
The changes in these Bills are intended to make sure that low income individuals are paying the right amount, given their circumstances, when it comes to levies and surcharges.
Since its introduction Medicare has always been part-funded by a Medicare Levy.
And there has always been a low income cut-off threshold below which no levy is payable.
These thresholds have always been regularly adjusted to take into account increases in the CPI. This adjustment has never been contentious and has enjoyed support across the Chamber.
And the Democrats support it again. As we support the proposed increases to the thresholds for the Medicare Surcharge levy.
The Medicare Levy Surcharge was brought in by the Howard Government in 1996. This additional 1% surcharge on taxable income only applies to those people that are classed as ‘high-income’ earners and that do not have private health insurance.
The Howard Government brought this extra tax in as part of its rescue package for the private health insurance industry.
As we all know, when it was first introduced the threshold for the Medicare Levy Surcharge were set at $50 000 for individuals and $100 000 for couples and families.
The current Government is proposing to adjust these thresholds to $100 000 for individuals and $150 000 for couples and families.
This is a notable jump in the threshold values but as they have not moved for 10 years that is to be expected. These thresholds have not changed since they were first introduced. They have been frozen for a decade. When most other similar measures have been adjusted for the changing circumstances, these have stood still.
Indeed if we want to avoid this situation arising again in the future – where more and more people get caught up and have to pay this extra tax until the Government of the day brings in a big change to the thresholds so that they can look magnanimous - then it would be sensible to put in place a system that regularly adjusts the Medicare Levy Surcharge thresholds in line with CPI as we do for the standard Medicare Levy.
The Democrats would welcome amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008, when it eventually comes before the Senate which do exactly that.
Threshold limits should be set at the right position so that they target the right people and they should be adjusted regularly to take into account changing circumstances.
It is true that the proposed changes to the Medicare Levy Surcharge thresholds have attracted some criticism.
The Private Health Insurance Industry and the AMA have been highly critical of these changes—suggesting that there will be a dramatic reduction in the number of individuals either taking up or maintaining their private health insurance.
In contrast the Australian Private Hospitals Association sees private health insurance membership `growing strongly’ in the next few years.
It is interesting to note that the proposed acquisition by health insurer BUPA Australia of its competitor MBF remains on-track, despite the announced changes to the Medicare Levy Surcharge—suggesting that longer-term damage to private health insurance is not envisaged by all in the sector.
It is possible that some people will make different decisions about private health insurance because of these changes.
But there are still several disincentives to stop individuals from opting out of private health cover or delaying taking out membership of private health insurance.
The Rudd Government has left untouched the Lifetime Health Cover Loading and the 30% private health insurance rebate introduced by the previous Government.
Lifetime Health Cover Loading in particular is a nasty stick that the Howard Government introduced and research has shown that between 42% and 75% of the overall increase in PHI membership that resulted from the Howard Government’s industry rescue package was because of Lifetime Health Cover Loadings.
It has been suggested that if people drop out of private health insurance because of the changes to the thresholds this will put more pressure on our public hospitals.
However, there is little evidence to suggest that these measures take pressure off the public health system.
Research indicates that those people who enrol in private health insurance in response to the so-called incentives that the Howard Government introduced
the 30% rebate, Lifetime Health Cover Loading and the Medicare Surcharge
actually behave more like people without private health insurance.
That is, they use public hospitals rather than private ones so that they don’t have to pay the out-of-pocket expenses that they would be subject to if they used their private health insurance.
Also individuals who purchase private health insurance in order to avoid the ‘penalty’ of the MLS tend to be young and healthy and tend to have low rates of hospital use in any case.
The reality is that private health insurance has always been primarily the domain of the wealthier parts of the population.
The increase in the number of people with private health insurance because of the various carrot and stick incentives was mainly in the richest 20%. Among the poorest 40% of the population there was little if any impact on the number of people who could afford PHI—even with the rebate.
And the less well-off continue to stay out of PHI.
If some people exit the private health insurance system because of changes to the Medicare Levy Surcharge thresholds or do not enter it in the first place, this is a better reflection of their attitude to PHI in any case.
The opposition keeps trumpeting that they are advocates for choice for Australians.
If that is true then they would support the changes proposed in these Bills.
Increasing the thresholds for the levies gives more people a real choice about whether they want PHI—about whether they think it is value for money.
Fewer people will be forced into it by penalties.
The Democrats only wish that the Rudd Government had the courage to tackle the other so-called reform measures introduced by the previous Government.
Despite costing billions of dollars every year and almost universal agreement among health experts that the rebate, and indeed private health insurance, is inequitable and inefficient, the Rudd Government seems intent on continuing with the 30% rebate.
And there has been no indication of their intent with regard to the Lifetime Health Cover Loading.
The Democrats have moved amendments in the past to undo both of these measures.
That doesn’t mean the Democrats are opposed to a private health sector.
Private health services are an important part of our system but funding private sector providers directly—rather than going through the inefficient and inequitable private health insurance industry—would still provide support to the private health sector and it would save the administration costs.
It would also give the Government some control over costs—something that private health insurance has not been able to do.
As far back as 2004 the OECD paper examining private health insurance in Australia reported that private funds do not exercise control over the quality, quantity or appropriateness of care provided and private health insurance has led to an overall increase in health utilisation as there are few limits on expenditure growth. This situation has changed very little in subsequent years.
There is a wealth of evidence that demonstrates that the larger the private health sector the higher the overall health costs to the community.
If the Rudd government intends to continue supporting the Howard Government’s private health care liabilities, it has a responsibility to make sure that costs are contained.
It also has a responsibility to limit the use of taxpayer subsidies.
Measures such as the PHI rebate do not improve access to health care—either in the public or private system—they are simply a subsidy for the PHI industry—a subsidy worth billions of dollars every year.
Much of this money does not make it to the private hospitals—which is why a direct subsidy to private hospitals is a more efficient and equitable means of supporting private health care delivery—and would save millions of dollars a year
Private health insurance will continue to play a part in people’s health choices should they wish to pay for it but the Government has a responsibility to ensure that our public system is well funded and accessible by all.
We do not want to go back to a time when people had to have private health insurance to make sure they could get decent services.
Nor do we want to see even greater erosion of the principles that underlie our health system.
Universality of access on the basis of need not ability to pay has been an underlying principle of the National Medicines Policy, the PBS and Medicare since their inception.
Yet the precedent set in this year’s budget for means testing PBS listed items and Medicare benefits raises serious concerns about what direction we may see health care reform take under the Rudd Government.
There are tough questions that need to be addressed about the rationing of health care but these are debates that should be had with the community.
And they should be had out in the open—not introduced by stealth.
If the Rudd Government intends to move away from universality and towards a means tested public health care system, this should be made explicit.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-06-18,"—I rise to speak about the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. One of the disturbing aspects of this bill and, in fact, much of the legislation that has been put forward by this government is the fact that it is subject to means testing. A means test, quite frankly, is a very mean test. Some people who went in to the previous election expecting to be able to benefit from particular election promises or the continuation of existing policies would have voted accordingly. They have been let down by what I regard as an uncaring and mean government. A means test is an example, in this particular bill, of a mean government because it is a secret test. It was a test that was sprung on the public subsequent to the election last year. It is pretty clear that the Rudd government won office under many false pretences. It took policies to the election and it failed to disclose the complete nature of the policies. It changed them immediately afterwards—we have had numerous examples of this.
To the members opposite, I repeat the words of Mr Abbott in the other place, ‘If a business went public with this policy without the secret fine print, the business would now be before the courts of this country for breach of contract,’ because the fine print has made an enormous difference to what is going on here.
The move to a 50 per cent rebate is certainly welcome. However, it is going to present hard-pressed operators of childcare services with an opportunity to increase their prices. I note the flamboyant rhetoric about using every means at the government’s disposal to prevent that from happening. However, when pressed, it just seems to be more smoke and mirrors and there is very little that the government can do to prevent it. The government maintains it has a mandate for this and so the opposition do not intend to oppose the aspect of the bill with regard to the 50 per cent out-of-pocket childcare costs. However, we are concerned about families who are going to have to pay increasing childcare fees, because we believe that operators will put their fees up in anticipation of the government’s future contribution in this regard. I shall leave my comments there.
