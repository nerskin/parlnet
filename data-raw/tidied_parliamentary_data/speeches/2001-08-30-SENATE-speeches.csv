Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 27 June 2000, the Senate referred the following matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges, on the motion of the chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, Senator Chapman:
Having regard to a letter dated 22 June 2000 to the President from the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and, if so, whether a contempt was committed by any person in relation to that disclosure. 
The President gave precedence to the matter on 26 June 2000. Between 12 and 14 February 2000, the Weekend Australian and the Australian featured articles by its national business correspondent on an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, into a company known as Yannon. No prosecutions had resulted from the long-running investigation. The Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities sought and received a confidential briefing on the investigation. The briefing was preceded by a written submission from ASIC which the committee agreed, on 7 February 2000, to receive on a confidential basis. This submission formed the basis of the articles.
The Senate Standing Committee on Privileges conducted an intensive inquiry into the matter, including a public hearing on 25 May 2001. All details of these proceedings are included in the report and the accompanying transcript and documents. The committee was unable to discover the source of the disclosure, not least because neither the journalist nor his publishers revealed the identity of the person or persons who divulged the information. As the committee made very clear early in its dealings with the Australian, it understood the journalist's need to keep his source confidential. It is a pity that news organisations do not have a comparable understanding of the need for parliamentary committees to protect their own informants. 
The committee has nonetheless concluded that the disclosure to the journalist was improper and probably deliberate. The committee has no doubt that the improper publication of the articles in the Weekend Australian and the Australian, based on the confidential submission to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, was deliberate. These conclusions have led to seven formal findings, which are set out in paragraph 60 of the report, and culminate as follows:
That the person or persons who disclosed the information to the national business correspondent has/have committed a contempt of the Senate.
That Nationwide News Pty Limited, the publisher of The Weekend Australian and The Australian, as the organisation responsible for the actions of its employee the national business correspondent, has committed a contempt of the Senate.
Given the serious nature of these contempts, the committee has recommended the following penalties:
(a) In respect of the person or persons, if ever discovered, who disclosed to the national business correspondent of The Weekend Australian and The Australian—either a fine at the maximum amount of $5,000 authorised by the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, or that the Senate initiate a prosecution for an offence under section 13 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.
(b) In respect of Nationwide News Pty Limited—that the Senate resolve to administer a serious reprimand to Nationwide News Pty Limited as publisher of The Weekend Australian and The Australian, and that such a resolution be transmitted to the publisher by the President of the Senate.
In light of these findings and penalties, the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities is required, under standing order 82, to give at least seven days notice of a motion to determine that a person has committed a contempt or that a penalty be imposed. I therefore now seek leave to give notice of a motion.
Leave granted.
—I give notice that, on Monday, 17 September 2001, I shall move:
(1)	That the Senate endorse the findings at paragraph 60(a) to 60(g) of the 99th report of the Committee of Privileges.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-08-30,"—I present the report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on the examination of the annual reports for 1999-2000, together with the Hansard report of the committee's proceedings, submissions received by the committee and comments on adverse mentions in evidence presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Just as Senate legislation committees do, the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund also reviews annual reports. The native title committee is entitled to take a broad approach to its powers and duties in this regard under the Native Title Act 1993; that is, in its examination of annual reports since March 1995 the committee has conducted what might be regarded as performance audits of the Native Title Tribunal, the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. The report I tabled today covering these annual reports continues with the objective of reviewing the performance of those bodies. In so doing, the committee reports comprehensively. For example, the Senate may wish to note that this inquiry into three annual reports required four public hearings and, in addition, some 20 submissions were received. The Native Title Tribunal is now well established as a significant statutory authority. In 1999-2000 it maintained 215 employees and had an operating expenses budget for the year in excess of $23 million. The tribunal occupies an important place in national affairs as a consequence of its role on aspects of land management across the states and the territories.
The committee has commented in previous reports on the tribunal's workload and, at the close of the reporting period, although 241 claimant applications had been discontinued or combined with others, there remained 539 claimant applications awaiting resolution. Notably, the tribunal has indicated that more resources will now be available for the mediation of claimants' applications, and this is a very welcome development. 
One matter that has continued to concern the committee, however, is the use of consultants by the tribunal. In the reporting period, the tribunal engaged 49 consultants with a total expenditure of almost $2 million, which represented an increase of 12 extra consultants and almost $900,000 in expenditure over 1998-2000. The committee believes in the principle that tribunal members should be engaged to do the work of members and that, when there is a shortage, that should be the subject of advice from the tribunal president to the Commonwealth government, so that adequate numbers of staff and members can be appointed. However, that said, the committee does record its impression that the tribunal is a most professional authority performing its functions well.
The tribunal has also performed an important service in assisting with the introduction of a new regime for the developments affecting land use; that is, the provision of indigenous land use agreements, which were introduced as a result of the amendments to the act in 1998. I should note that the committee has recently concluded its inquiry into the ILUA regime and expects to table a report later in this session. The tribunal was of considerable assistance to the committee during that inquiry.
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund was established to assist indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it. In 2004, the Commonwealth allocations to the land fund will cease. Should the target balance not be met by that time, a top-up payment will be made to bring the account to $1.106 billion, indexed from 1994. The value of the fund at 30 June 2000 was more than $784 million. ATSIC's 1999-2000 report contains the land fund report as an appendix. Importantly, in the reporting period, an amount of $50,712,000 was drawn down to the Indigenous Land Corporation, and similar amounts are to be drawn down to the ILC from the fund indefinitely. The ILC's operations then are funded from the land fund. Whereas the land fund annual reports are contained in an appendix to the ATSIC report, the ILC itself presents its own report. As I have already said, an amount of almost $51 million was drawn down to the ILC in the year 1999-2000.
The ILC's recent history must be described as unfortunate and very troubled. In the reporting period, the board approved the purchase of only 18 properties, a significant decline on the 69 properties approved in the previous year. While the ILC has attributed this decline to the land needs process of planning, it causes the committee considerable concern, and it is a matter that will be monitored in the future. Further, two inquiries affecting the ILC were commissioned during the year 1999-2000. Firstly, the then minister, Senator Herron, commissioned an inquiry by Stephen Skehill into the behaviour of ILC directors. Secondly, the ILC board requested an inquiry, completed by Mr Andrew Rogers QC, into the purchase of two cattle stations in Western Australia. Regrettably, the Skehill inquiry arose from a request by four ILC directors for the minister to terminate the appointment of the ILC's chairperson, Ms Sharon Firebrace. Ms Firebrace subsequently also made a variety of allegations concerning directors.
While Mr Skehill's report was delivered to the minister on 1 December, the findings have not been made public. The Skehill report deals with sensitive and complex matters, and the committee has not been able to examine them. Nevertheless, the committee notes Ms Firebrace's admission that the minister suggested on three separate occasions that she should stand down from her position. In these circumstances, regrettably the committee seriously must question Ms Firebrace's claims about the causes of dysfunction within the ILC during her two-year term of office, which expired in August this year.
With regard to the Rogers inquiry, I understand the report has been completed but has also not been released. However, Mr Rogers has released a statement in which he confirmed that he had found no evidence to support the allegations of criminality and serious misconduct in relation to the purchase of those two cattle stations. Importantly, the committee has concluded that, in the course of its inquiry, it may have been misled by Ms Firebrace about two separate matters. These conclusions will be referred to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges.
In summary, the committee has been very concerned about the unfortunate performance of the ILC over the past two years. Many of the events that have affected the ILC and its programs have been widely made public, and this is to be regretted. However, there is reason to believe that the ILC's performance has affected the delivery of benefits to indigenous people by way of land ownership. The committee is very hopeful that the newly appointed chairperson and general manager will direct the ILC into a more positive performance. I commend the native title committee's 18th report to the Senate.

That this bill be now read a second time.
I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Bill continues the Government's commitment to improving the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students, particularly in the key areas of literacy and numeracy.  
This Bill provides for the 2001-2002 Budget measure, that announced $33.3 million over the period 2001-02 to 2002-03 to continue strategic assistance in schools and support literacy and numeracy research.  The bill amends the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 which authorised funding for the 2001 - 2004 funding period. 
The funding will commence in January 2002, with the bulk ($23.9 million), provided as grants to education authorities through the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme (SAISO).  The remaining funding ($9.4 million) is to be provided under the Grants for National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects Programme to support strategic national research and development initiatives.
The bill also ensures that the Government's commitment to maintaining special education per capita funding levels is honoured.  A minor increase in funding of $760,000 for special education per capita funding will ensure that the full level of `Strategic Assistance' funding required is available so that independent schools are not disadvantaged by the new arrangements for special education per capita funding introduced in the Act.  
The bill also increases funding to Strategic Assistance to non-government school students to correct a technical error in a previous update of funding amounts from 1999 final prices to 2000 final prices changing the per capita amount from $527 to $561.
This Bill continues the significant contribution of the Commonwealth towards implementing  the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for Education, to support the National Goal `that all students should have attained the skills of numeracy and English literacy such that every student should be numerate, able to read, write, spell and communicate at an appropriate level'.
Literacy and numeracy for all is the key social justice issue in education.  Through the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme the Commonwealth is making a significant financial contribution towards improving the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students and is working with education authorities to ensure that the public reporting of student literacy and numeracy outcomes drives change and improvement in this vital area.
The National Literacy and Numeracy Plan provides for assessment of all students by their teachers as early as possible in the first years of schooling and early intervention for those students identified as having difficulty.  Schools Ministers have agreed to national benchmarks in literacy and numeracy in Years 3, 5, and 7 against which all children's achievement can be measured and reported.  Importantly, the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan also provides for professional development for teachers.
The commitment to improving literacy and numeracy through the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan is already showing results.  In 1997 the National School English Survey showed that some 27% of Year 3 students failed to meet a minimum acceptable standard of literacy.  Nationally comparable data on Year 3 Reading released in March 2000 showed that in 1999, the percentage of Year 3 students not achieving the minimum standard had fallen to around 14%.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-30,"—I move:
That the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 18 September 2001.
The matter before the Senate is a motion standing in the name of Senator Ian Campbell to refer the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 to the relevant legislation committee for report back to this chamber on 18 September next—in other words, a process that would allow the matter to be further debated and hopefully resolved by the Senate and, therefore, the parliament. 
It is a very important piece of legislation. The bill is aimed at addressing two critical challenges facing Australia's refugee protection arrangements and our ability to effectively contribute to international efforts to protect refugees. First, the continuing influx of unauthorised arrivals to this country is a tangible indicator of increasingly sophisticated attempts to undermine the integrity of Australia's refugee determination process. The evidence is clear and growing that large numbers of these people have had, but have disposed of, identifying documentation before arriving in Australia. The smuggling operations which are providing this travel often give to these arrivals highly detailed information and coaching on appropriate claims, country knowledge and Commonwealth assessment procedures to maximise their chances of successfully gaining a visa. We cannot lose sight of the fact that refugees will be amongst those people travelling to Australia without authority, but it is critical that Migration Act powers to test these claims effectively match the challenge being posed by organised and sophisticated attempts at national identity and claims fraud. 
The second major challenge lies in the increasingly broad interpretations being given by the courts to Australia's protection obligation under the refugees convention and protocol. The convention does not define many of the key terms it uses. In the absence of clear legislative guidance, the domestic interpretation of our obligations has broadened under cumulative court decisions so that Australia now provides protection visas in cases lying well beyond the bounds originally envisaged by the convention. These generous interpretations of our obligations encourage people who are not refugees to test their claims in Australia, adding to perceptions that Australia is a soft touch.
These matters have been the subject of extensive and ongoing public debate for very many months, and the increasingly generous interpretations provided by the Federal Court, in particular, have been matters of widespread discussion and, I think, increasing concern. A decision made only recently by the Federal Court which effectively said that lack of career satisfaction could constitute persecution is simply the latest high-water mark of the extent to which the courts will go to water down, or make broadly available, entitlements that were never envisaged by the convention or, indeed, the Australian parliament. So it ought to be quite clear that we are confronted here with not only a very important set of measures designed to tighten and strengthen the integrity of our migration system, but matters that have been looked at very carefully by those in our region and in other places who seek to exploit any sign that Australia is a soft touch.
Previously we had thought there were some 2,000 boat people—overwhelmingly organised and orchestrated by professional people smugglers—who were heading to our shores wanting to seek asylum, presumably via Christmas Island or nearby places in the first instance; but those operations have been put on hold. The number now seems to be closer to 5,000, so there are very significant implications for the way in which Australia behaves in the current crisis and the way in which we indicate to the world our attitude when handling future matters. It is quite clear that the reason we have not had this additional 2,000 on our doorstep right now is that they are waiting and watching to see not only how the current impasse is resolved, but the extent of Australia's determination to take a stand on this issue.
That is why it is incredibly disappointing to find that the opposition parties in this place have signalled their intention to join with the Australian Democrats to effectively oppose the debating of this bill, to frustrate legislation passing through the parliament. You can shake your heads as much as you like but we all know that adjourning this matter to a references committee for report back on 16 October is simply saying that you are squibbing the issue. You do not want to debate these important issues; you do not want to do anything to assist the Australian government or the Australian people to resolve very difficult issues. It is incredibly disappointing, because only yesterday we had Mr Beazley starting off his statement in the House by saying:
In these circumstances, this country and this parliament do not need a carping opposition; what they actually need is an opposition that understands the difficult circumstance in which the government finds itself, and to the very best of my ability I will ensure that that situation prevails.
I am sure that not even Mr Beazley pretends for a moment that you can look at the current crisis in isolation. You simply cannot quarantine it from all the other activities that are going on around us or the ways in which people smugglers are marshalling their forces to make an even greater concerted assault on Australia's shores.
You have to ask yourself why on earth the Labor Party would be adopting this stance. These issues have been in the public arena for months and months. The Labor Party has not indicated any basis for concern about the proposals. In fact, it has generally tried to indicate sympathy for the approach that we are taking, and a recognition of the need. I can understand why Senator Bartlett would have quite a different view of the world, and he has been consistent in that. I do not think it is a view that has a great deal of support in the Australian community, but one respects his right to stay out there on the margin and argue what many would regard as an extreme case. But that is not where the Labor Party has been on this issue.
The Labor Party has, until now, indicated considerable sympathy for the approach that the government is taking. For example, I heard Senator Ray say last night not only that Mr Ruddock has an incredibly difficult job but that Australia could not allow people to queuejump and push further down the queue—because of the operations of professional people smugglers—those who have genuine claims and might be wallowing in refugee camps in Pakistan.
That is a sentiment with which the government agrees. We do not for a moment pretend that there are not appalling refugee situations occurring in many places around the world. Australia's well-earned reputation as a very generous receiver of those with genuine refugee claims should be maintained. In the Indochinese war and through the problems that arose from that, in terms of refugees, I think Australia's reputation was second to none. We have not resiled from that situation. We continue to be a very compassionate nation.
Where you can identify serious problems, however, where you can see that the court's interpretations are not only increasingly out of touch with the Australian people's view of the world but also moving a long way away from the refugee convention's general intent, and where the UNHCR itself has said that these measures do not constitute any breach of our obligations under the refugee convention, it is clearly a matter that the Australian government is entitled to pursue, and to pursue quickly.
These are not issues on which you can simply take your time and have nice interesting and longwinded debates in committee processes and the like, or in fact—as I think the Labor Party strategy is—defer any further legislation until after the next election. That is not an outcome open to us, for the simple reason that the eyes of the world, and particularly those of professional people smugglers, are on every action we take. If they see signs that we are going to have gridlock for the next three or four months, then they will be in like Flynn. They will take that as a very positive incentive to pursue their activities. I know that when one people smuggler was interviewed on SBS not long ago he said just that. He said, `The moment the Australian government actually takes steps to turn back boats or tightens up its regime, we will have to rethink our strategy.' And that is exactly what is going on now. We all know and understand that. That is why I cannot for a moment imagine that, when Mr Beazley talks about the difficult circumstance in which the government finds itself, that does not apply to all of these issues. It is simply not possible to quarantine it to the current vessel, the Tampa.
Against that background it is very disappointing. Mr Sciacca said on radio last Tuesday, for example:
At the moment the people smugglers, as you call them, think that Australia is in fact a fairly soft touch. They think that as long as they can get here, we are going to allow them all in.
The Labor Party knows this. The official spokesman is saying we have a reputation as a soft touch. And you will clearly enhance that reputation big-time if you send a signal that the parliament is not prepared to tighten up the regime. In other words, it is business as usual. All the incentives that have got them to the point where they are circling Australia will continue to operate, and you will simply escalate the problem.
One has to ask why it is that the Labor Party seems to have embarked on this strategy. We got some indication of it yesterday from remarks by not only Mr Hollis but also Mr Quick. I would not take anything that Andrew Theophanous said at face value, but he claimed there are at least 10 Labor backbenchers who are now unhappy with their own party's stance. A report states:
Mr Quick said, `There is a bit of disharmony among the backbenchers but I guess each person makes up their own mind. I wouldn't call it a revolt. Labor's decision to block the laws was not aimed at heading off a revolt,' but conceded some backbenchers were upset.
That may well explain why we had last night's extraordinary display, within a matter of hours of the Leader of the Opposition indicating that he was prepared to put party politics to one side. It does look very much, on the face of it, as though Labor's strategy in relation to this legislation is driven by a desire on the part of Mr Beazley to appease his internal critics. In other words it is, `Go along. Do a deal with the Democrats. Basically take the soft option. But don't do what you know needs to be done.'
It is not as if you have been out there arguing the moral case against these provisions. It is not as if you have in any shape or form indicated why we do not need to tighten up the current legal regime. What you have done is to send all the signals to the contrary. You have said that you understand the problem, that action needs to be taken. But all of a sudden, out of the blue, what do we find? A determination to avoid your responsibilities; that is what it boils down to, and that is the tragedy of weak leadership. That is where you have this albatross around your neck. You have a leader who always looks for the easy way out, who is never prepared to get in there and take the tough decision—without quite knowing where it might lead. We are all in uncharted waters on this issue, and it is very difficult. But at the end of the day people expect you to display leadership. You are not here to be a shallow reflection of public opinion or to do your best to keep the faction together, or to find a lowest common denominator or simply put it off until such time as, you hope, the whole issue goes away. You are here to display leadership.
In the context of what is happening in our northern waters at the present time, I would have thought that the Labor Party would fully recognise the importance of this bill being passed as quickly as possible. Referring it off to a legislation committee gives you an opportunity to exhaustively analyse it for a couple of weeks, to go through it as much as you like, to get legal and other advice. Why on earth do you need to refer it beyond that to 16 October? It is simply so that you can avoid taking the hard decision. There is no other way to interpret your actions. That is why I think it is so disappointing that Mr Beazley is once again putting political compromise ahead of the national interest.
We simply cannot stand by and allow gridlock to occur. We cannot provide ongoing strong messages to unauthorised arrivals—and those who are contemplating coming here to take advantage of our generosity—that we basically cannot make up our minds, that we are torn, because we are not. You know and we know what needs to be done. That is why I think you are inviting very serious retribution. You know that your actions cannot withstand the scrutiny of proper public assessment because they will be seen for what they are: political attempts to divert from having to face this decision. You are simply trying to avoid it as much as possible while being seen to do the right thing.
The opposition's failure to support these measures will certainly make it much more difficult to deal decisively with the entry of unlawful arrivals. It will provide all the wrong signals. It will provide incentives all the while that Australia does have in place a determination process that accords refugee status to undeserving applicants, to applicants who destroy documentation, to applicants who refuse to swear on oath to their respective deity, to applicants who are determined to abuse the system and take it all the way to the higher courts of this country. The flood will continue.
Labor do not disagree with any of that, as I understand it. They know the system is being abused and rorted. They know that very considerable sums of public money are being spent on these claims being endlessly pursued. They know that people in detention camps are not for a moment prepared to accept the verdict of the umpire. Some of the detainees have been refused on multiple occasions, yet they are determined to stay here because they think that the decision makers will crack. That is what they are banking on. They are banking on people like the Labor Party making the situation all too difficult for decisive action to be taken and for the proper signals to be sent. Whilst that continues, we will have this current crisis, and it will be an ongoing crisis. It is one that I think has to be handled very carefully and compassionately. We are certainly doing all we can in the current circumstance of the Tampa to ensure that humanitarian, medical and other assistance is available. You have to temper that compassion with the need to ensure the integrity of your system. Unless we do that—unless we block the loopholes, unless we tighten up what is clearly a legal system that is out of control—we simply invite all of those unwanted abuses to continue. 
So it is a matter of great disappointment to the government that the Labor Party seems to have capitulated, once again, to a few people inside the tent—no doubt from Senator Carr's faction—who think there may even be political advantage in this but who generally do not want to stand up to be counted. That is how the Labor Party will be judged, and I think that is what this debate is all about. We will be vigorously opposing attempts to refer this matter off to a point where no sensible resolution of this matter can be achieved, and we will continue to expose the Labor Party for its weakness and the pusillanimous conduct of its leader.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,14,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-30,"—There was at least one point Senator Alston made during his contribution that I would definitely agree with wholeheartedly—although there is possibly not too much more that I would agree with—that is: we are not here to be a shallow reflection of public opinion; we are here to display leadership. On issues as crucial as this one, I think it is important to stand up and be counted and show leadership rather than simply try to surf along the short-term wave of—using the minister's own words—a shallow reflection of public opinion.
The minister spent most of his time debating the legislation and its so-called virtues. I could respond to that, but the motion before the Senate is about whether we should refer the legislation off to a committee so that we can discuss, assess and provide opportunity for input from other people into the legislation's so-called virtues and any flaws that it may have. I would have to say that after witnessing the government's astonishing and disgraceful effort last night, trying to railroad through one of the most draconian and far-reaching pieces of legislation that we have seen in this place with no consultation with absolutely anybody—not even in this place let alone in the Australian community—it makes the Democrats, and I imagine others in the community, much more apprehensive about the virtues, and the potential flaws, that may be contained in this legislation.
Despite the minister's statement that this issue has been the subject of extensive and ongoing debate over many months—obviously the issue in the broader sense of asylum seekers and refugees has been part of community debate in a range of areas for much longer than that—the specifics of this legislation have not been the subject of community debate. The legislation itself was introduced into the House of Representatives only two days ago. That is the first time it has seen the light of day. The first signal that it was even likely to happen was a press release from the minister probably about two or three weeks before that, which outlined what his intentions were. Certainly even those intentions caused a lot of apprehension amongst those in the community and in the Democrats, but I think even more concerning is the need to examine how they will actually be implemented in a legislative sense.
If you look at the justification the government used for introducing its disgraceful bill last night—the legislation is almost certainly unconstitutional, undoubtedly breaches the refugees convention and many others, and the government is trying to exempt itself from other domestic laws all under the pretext of ensuring that it could get just one ship out of Australian waters—one can only wonder what may be contained in this particular legislation, what amount of unbelievable overkill may be contained within its pages. It is appropriate to extensively examine such a matter.
We are at a crucial, very significant and pivotal stage in the future direction of the debate around these issues, not just within Australia but potentially internationally. This legislation has international significance. Obviously it has domestic significance as well and the Democrats give great weight to that, not just because of its linkage to international law, the refugee convention and the civil and political rights convention and other measures of international law which until recently Australia has proudly upheld and promoted but in terms of the general direction of international approaches to what is a global problem. As the house of review, the Senate has a heavy responsibility. Last night we saw the immense, almost priceless value of having a house of review in this parliament which is not dominated by the executive, a second chamber which is able to show leadership and not simply cave before an alleged wave of short-term public opinion, to assess legislation and recognise its draconian content, its dangerous precedent and its incredible attempts to increase the power of the government of the day over and above the power of the courts or the general community.
If this debate were presented in the context of the government trying to make a giant power grab and basically taking away the rights of the rest of the community, the response from the public would be very different. Once the parliament gives support to such a move, we are failing in our duty and putting ourselves in a position where the community can be very concerned about national sovereignty. The words `protecting our national sovereignty' have been thrown around with great puffed chests in recent days. The core of our national sovereignty is our political, civil and legal rights as citizens of this country and as members of the global community. We need to ensure the protection of those rights. That is why the Democrats are moving to amend this motion, to send the legislation to a references committee. This is not an unprecedented step. Indeed, there is another bill on another area before the same references committee at the moment. Certainly, bills have been sent to references committees in the past when it has been felt they are broad in scope and have flow-on consequences. This bill has flow-on consequences for diplomatic and international law relations and international human rights which are much broader than what might be seen as a narrow amendment to the Migration Act. In that context, it is appropriate to send it to a committee which will take a broader view.
Legislation committees perform a valuable job but are often referred to as the `tick and flick' committees, where you flick the bill off, give it a quick once-over on a Friday afternoon and flick it back to the Senate the next week. That is appropriate for certain bills, but when they are of the magnitude and significance of this legislation, particularly in the context of what happened last night and over preceding days, where we clearly have a government sending out every signal that they are quite willing to breach any number of domestic laws, international laws and basic standards of human rights and humanitarian decency, it is no wonder that there is great apprehension among legislators in this place about the need to step back from the short-term political storm and examine it in more detail and, hopefully, in a cooler way without some of the political rhetoric that has bounced backwards and forwards about it. It is not just us as legislators who are apprehensive but those in the community who have the expertise in this area, who have legal expertise and who have experience with the people affected.
Let us not forget that the bills we pass in this place—certainly bills like these—are not just amendments to laws to deal with political issues; they are amendments which impact on individual human beings. This situation involves some of the most vulnerable human beings within our country's borders, and internationally. In such a context we have a duty and a responsibility to examine these issues properly, to show leadership and to let the political stones and arrows bounce off and fly over our heads while we provide the opportunity for input from those in the domestic community and internationally about what the consequences and ramifications may be; not just how the law will operate if this bill were passed but flow-on diplomatic and international consequences. For a government that talks so much about the need to engage internationally, we have done a hell of a lot of damage to our international reputation in the last few days. The Democrats certainly do not want to be part of increasing the damage in terms of how we are seen in the eyes of the world and how we engage with the rest of the world. That has flow-on consequences as well, not just in humanitarian treatment of refugees and displaced people but in economic areas, trade and every aspect of international communication that you can think of.
The bill is wide ranging and crucial. I seek to send it to a references committee so that there can be proper examination. To contrast it with what happened last night, in the space of a couple of hours we were able to get legal opinion from a few people with expertise in the Law of the Sea and related conventions, and domestic and constitutional law. They were able to point to any number of concerns about that bill, in some cases it was to point categorically to major flaws and in others to at least raise significant questions. The purpose of a committee hearing is to examine those questions. It is not just assertion versus assertion; we examine the questions in more detail and we get to cross-examine departmental officials from the immigration department or from Foreign Affairs or the Attorney-General's Department—those in the community with expertise in the law in this field, those with the expertise in humanitarian principles and those on all sides of the debate who have concerns about how we best address the issue of asylum seekers and displaced people, which is a global problem, not just an Australian problem.
I will not respond in the broader context of the debate to what the minister went on about: the farce that Australia is a soft touch and all these myths that the government insists on promoting. They can be dealt with another day. This motion is to refer the bill to a committee, not to debate the bill itself. Suffice to say that the suggestion that Australia is a soft touch is farcical in the extreme. It is completely contradicted by the facts about how other civilised and developed countries address the issue of asylum seekers and the numbers of people that they deal with. Some of them have to deal with numbers greatly in excess of those Australia has to cope with.
There is no truth in the statement that we are somehow a soft touch. The last few years, with our mandatory detention regime and other aspects, have shown that there is no doubt that that is not the case. It is simply an indication of the government's political game playing. Their performance last night, with that extraordinary piece of legislation, and indeed their performance over the last few days, in which they have dug Australia into an appalling hole with no apparent escape route and left hundreds of asylum seekers in a desperate situation, gives the Democrats and many others great reason to be concerned about the government's motives and the government's agenda with this legislation and with any other matter that touches on refugees. That makes us far more determined to give absolute scrutiny to this legislation. If yesterday's episode had not happened, we might have been a little bit more willing to believe that there was some genuineness in the government's desire to seek a balanced outcome in some of these issues. But, after yesterday's episode, I do not think we have any hope or expectation of a balanced approach from the government on this issue, so it is crucial that the legislation that is put forward is given proper scrutiny. Hence, we should not only send it to a references committee but give sufficient time to all those in the community, including the international community, to provide input into the detail of this legislation and the many related issues that it touches on. I now move the amendments that I have circulated in the chamber:
Omit “Legislation Committee”, substitute “References Committee”.
Omit “18 September 2001”, substitute “16 October 2001”.
These amendments are to send the bill to a references committee and to extend the reporting date until 16 October. I believe that the amendments are appropriate in both the political circumstances of the moment and the legislative circumstances surrounding this bill.
It is an important issue. If the Democrats specifically wanted to ensure that this bill never saw the light of day then we would try and put it off until November or December, which we could do, and obviously the election would intervene. But we are willing to allow it to be brought back into this place in the same sitting in which it was introduced and less than two months after it was first introduced. That is still a very quick turnaround for a significant piece of legislation, particularly one with potentially major ramifications, whether legal, political, diplomatic, humanitarian or economic.
Any number of consequences may flow from this bill. The Democrats are certainly keen to ensure that we play our role as legislators and show leadership in the face of short-term political firestorms in scrutinising this properly and not just bowing down in the face of immediate pressure to rush this through to address a problem. I think even the way that the so-called problem is described leaves a lot to be desired, and the facts surrounding it are much disputed as well. There are a lot of differing opinions that need to be put forward about the so-called problem that we are addressing: the nature of it, whether it is as major as has been suggested and of course the best way of dealing with it. You do not deal with questions of that magnitude by rushing something through without proper scrutiny, particularly in the context of the political debate that is happening at the moment.
So I have moved the amendments as circulated in the chamber. I do believe it is an important issue, and I will certainly urge all those in the community with an interest in this issue to contribute to the examination of this legislation. It requires proper input from those with expertise in the many areas that are touched on by this bill, and that can be done only through the proper process of a genuine, extensive committee inquiry rather than a rushed, tick and flick type examination. That is why the Democrats have moved these amendments, and I commend them to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,14,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-08-30,"—The opposition will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Bartlett to refer the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 to a Senate references committee and to extend the date for the committee to report back to the chamber. There is a very simple reason why we are supporting these amendments—and it is important legislation—and that is that the legislation only saw the light of day on Tuesday of this week. The legislation, which was foreshadowed by the minister on 13 August, just 2½ weeks ago, has not yet been debated in the House of Representatives. It has not even reached this chamber. I know many people in our community have commented as a result of the minister's media release announcing that the legislation would be forthcoming, but not all of them have made informed comment. They have not been able to make informed comment, because they did not know what the bill contained.
Let me give you an example of what is not informed comment. It is the editorial from the West Australian newspaper of 15 August headed `New refugee definition useful'. I will quote a small part of it:
A criticism that has been levelled at the Government is that it wants to change legislation because it thinks the courts have been too liberal in interpreting the convention, that it doesn't like the umpire's decision.
The courts interpret and apply laws. The Parliament makes laws on behalf of the people. If the Parliament accepts that some laws are inadequate or do not serve the public interest properly, then it can change or add to them and its members will be answerable to the electorate for their actions. This is a continuing process and has nothing to do with any so-called umpire.
For the benefit of the editorial writers of the West Australian, the courts do not rule on refugee matters in this country. Our laws do not allow that. It is an administrative decision and we in this parliament have defended that administrative decision. The courts certainly are involved in the decisions, but it is for the courts to rule on points of law as to whether or not the tribunals—the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as the Refugee Review Tribunal—erred in law in making a determination on whether or not a person is a refugee. The courts do not rule, although they have tried to—and Senator Alston would probably be aware that some judges of the Federal Court have endeavoured in times past to determine whether or not an individual is a refugee. There was an appeal to the Full Federal Court, and I think there has even been a High Court decision on the matter.
If an editorial of a major newspaper can make a fundamental error like that, how many others in our community can make incorrect definitions of what the bill contains when they have not seen the bill? I must confess, because of all the other matters that have been happening during the course of this week, that I myself have not had the time yet to cast my eyes over the bill and see whether or not the bill reflects what is contained in the minister's media release of 13 August this year. The minister detailed that there would be some 13 points of issue contained in the bill. I cannot say at this time whether or not the opposition parties would be supportive of these points. I certainly have not looked at the bill and I do not think we have been involved in the discussion on this. 
I know for a fact that on this occasion I have not been offered a briefing on the contents of this bill. I have been offered briefings in the past on other legislative matters coming before the chamber and, when I have been able to, I have accepted those briefings in order to be better informed in preparation for debates in the parliament. But on this occasion I was not offered a briefing at all, and I am unsure as to whether or not our spokesperson on immigration matters has been offered a briefing and, if so, whether or not they were able to avail themselves of the briefing. 
Irrespective of what Minister Alston says, we are not speaking in opposition to this. Our record and our credentials over 5½ years in opposition in this place have proven that we have supported almost all of the government's legislation. We have not supported everything. We have participated in the development of legislation and, through the course of our participation, have improved the legislation. Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, I can do no better than refer you to debates in the chamber yesterday—just 24 hours ago—when, through our intervention in a bill dealing with detainees and the control of matters within Australia's detention centres, our amendments—amendments that we participated in the development of—helped, aided and improved the legislation that is going to govern this very important issue. 
There are matters contained in the minister's press statement which, when you read them at face value, obviously a responsible opposition would be supportive of. The minister's statement reads:
“It is unacceptable that people who are able to pay a people smuggler and make their way through several countries where they may avail themselves of protection, are getting a more favourable outcome than people languishing in the most appalling circumstances in refugee camps around the world,” Mr Ruddock said.
A simple search of the Hansard will find me having said similar words on a number of occasions in this place. The more recent example of that was on Tuesday of this week during the debate on an emergency item. I had good news for my constituents who were able to get Kurdish Iraqi relatives into the country—they thought their relatives were dead, but a wife and five children are coming into Australia now their tickets are issued. These people had been waiting for years and years and did not have the money to pay the people smugglers to jump in front of a queue. I think on that occasion I also spoke about the fact that there are queues in the refugee determination area. 
Another matter that the opposition would be supportive of at face value, quoting the minister's press statement, is this:
“Australia has a strong commitment to its international obligations under the Refugees Convention framework,” the Minister said, “but it is critical that we continue to support this important work on all levels—by targeting fraud and misuse of Australia's domestic refugee protection arrangements as well as making vigorous efforts to help address refugee problems at their source, and I will be making further announcements in relation to these matters in due course.”
We would be supportive of that, and we are eager to hear how the minister is addressing those problems at source. During the current controversial matter that we are involved in with the Tampa and the 400-odd people who are on that ship in Australian territorial waters off Christmas Island—if it is still in Australian territorial waters—we find the Prime Minister has not yet made contact with the President of Indonesia to try to resolve these matters.
—How do you know?
—If you know, tell us. If contact has been made, tell us. What I would really like to know, though, Senator Calvert, is why has contact not been made? I am only a simple backbencher in this place, but I have played a little bit of a role in helping on these matters—the agreement between Australia and the People's Republic of China, dealing with the unlawful arrival in this country of people from China. I played a little bit of a role in the development of that memorandum of understanding—a tiny bit of a role—but it is there. We had a problem with persons of Chinese nationality coming into Australia, but we do not have that problem any more because we addressed it at source—exactly what Minister Ruddock is saying in this press statement. I have not had the opportunity, as I said earlier, to look at the bill and see what is contained in the bill to address the problem at source. We need to do this. The chamber does not have the time to do this, so we need a committee of the parliament to do it, to talk with officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and see what provisions are contained in this bill to attack the problem at source. That is something that the committee will look forward to doing.
There are others in the community who will want to have an input into the contents of this bill—what the bill means and how the legislation will operate. I refer to the churches in Australia, many of whom have been very vocal on this issue and none of whom, I would suggest, would claim me to be their representative in this place in putting forward their views. Nonetheless, when they do put a view forward to a committee that I am on, they will know that they will be at least listened to and that they will be listened to with a degree of decency and dignity. There are others. The law societies of Australia have got very strong views on these issues and want to be heard. The Refugee Council of Australia, the peak refugee body of Australia, will want to, I know—and I have not spoken to them on this particular matter—put a view forward to the parliament on the provisions of the bill and the principles contained in the bill. They will be able to do that when they have had a chance to see the bill. 
If we do what the government has suggested—that is, refer this matter to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and report back on 17 September—in that time the Refugee Council of Australia will have to get a copy of the bill; read and digest the bill; put it through their internal processes, with all the organisations that make up the Refugee Council of Australia; try to put forward a unified opinion on suggestions for amendments, for change, for opposition, for improvement; express their opinion on the bill; and then develop a submission. And all that would have to be done in time for the committee to get together to meet and to hear them in public and then give the committee an opportunity to, among other things, listen to views, take account of the views of bodies such as the Refugee Council of Australia and then present a report to the parliament on Monday, 17 September. 
We have to do all that in the absence of the chair of the committee. Senator Marise Payne—a very good chair of the committee, a very decent human being, a very decent individual—on behalf of the parliament, has a very important role to play in East Timor with the elections that are soon to take place. Senator Payne will not be able to address this matter until some time next week, and then you have to put a timetable on it.
—When does she get back?
—I am not sure, Minister.
—I can tell you—Saturday.
—Saturday.
—Tell her next week.
—She's coming Saturday.
—I am not sure on that. I know that, in order to facilitate another inquiry the committee is involved in, we did look at possibly having hearings in Darwin this coming weekend and Senator Payne was not able to do that, but I cannot speak on behalf of Senator Payne and I do not want to misrepresent her in any way either because we work together.
Another key person on the committee is the deputy chair of the committee, me. Next Tuesday I have to leave this country to go to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso to represent Australia at the Interparliamentary Union conference. I have a keen interest in this and I want to be part of it. If the government wanted us to be part of it, they would have approached us, at least since Tuesday or probably even since 13 August, and said, `We have something we really want to address and we want to make it the best possible legislation that we can,' and I would have cancelled the trip to Ouagadougou and all the arguments that are going to go on there. But, no—no approaches have been made. Why haven't the approaches been made? I guess you will find the reason in the minister's speech in moving this forward.
The minister did not talk about the merits of the legislation, of what could be gained by a Senate committee inquiring into the bill—no. The minister played politics. The minister played wedge politics. Why did he do that? The government have been in office for 5½ years and at the end of 5½ years we find that the situation of dealing with refugees in this country is absolutely out of control. I am not only instancing what is happening off Christmas Island at the moment. One can go to any of the detention centres, in particular the larger ones—Curtin and Derby in Western Australia—and see the problems. You can go to Woomera, the largest of them, where the detention centre is on amber alert because of the high feelings and the potential for disturbances in the detention centres. You can go to Villawood where they recently put up a very high security fence which was breached by 23 individuals not so long ago. After that, some individuals—also 23 and it was probably the same minibus—tunnelled their way out through the drainage system. If that was not bad enough, they were then walking out the front door. The system is in crisis. Why is it in crisis? Because the government have taken their eye off the ball on this issue. They have taken their eye off the ball and there are statistics to prove it. 
Since unlawful boat arrivals started in 1989 with the Pender Bay off Broome in Western Australia in November 1989, some 13,000 persons have arrived by that method off the coast of Australia—1,000 of them just last week. 10,000 of those people have arrived in the last five years during the life of this present government—10,000 of them. Why, if there is a problem with our refugee determination system, are you bringing in this legislation just weeks and months before an election? Why did you need legislation yesterday on detainees? Why did you need legislation a couple of weeks ago on the matter of people escaping from legal detention custody? Why has a bill been sitting on the Notice Paper since December 1998 dealing with judicial review and not progressed any further? Because you have let the situation get out of control.
We are willing to sit down with you and work to get the best resolution possible for Australia from a humanitarian and compassionate point of view. We want to put laws in place that are good laws, that take into account the human rights of those people who are in need, lawfully, of protection from this country. We are still willing, despite the happenings of the past few days and the wedge politics that have been played. We are still willing to do it and we will do it. We want to do it properly and we want to consult widely in doing it. With the passage of this amendment, we want to refer this bill to the committee and give the community of Australia ample opportunity to come to the committee and have their views tested in front of the committee. I know that the government side on the committee will be well represented. I mentioned Senator Payne earlier, but Senator Coonan is also a member—another very decent human being who will look at laws with compassion and with humanity—and you can be assured that the job will be well done. 
The community of Australia need time to look at this legislation. They need time to formulate views on the legislation, and the committee itself—a committee of the parliament—needs an opportunity to give weight to those views and to develop a report which the parliament can look at, which the minister can look at and which his department can look at. If it is improving the laws that are being put in place in this country, that will be to the benefit of not only the parliament but also good governance in this country and the community of Australia. I endorse the amendments moved by Senator Bartlett.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,14,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-30,"—I will speak very briefly. I was waiting patiently for Senator McKiernan to explain why it is that Labor takes this extraordinary position. I acknowledge his longstanding interest in immigration and refugee issues. He asked why we need the legislation, but just after that he told us that the situation is absolutely out of control. That is why you need the legislation and that is why you need it urgently and that is why you could have facilitated its passage at a time when we could start to deal with the problem. 
You say that this is important legislation and was only introduced on Tuesday. You know that these issues have been festering for months. You know there have been a whole series of Federal Court decisions that have shown that the courts have a completely different view of the world. I do not understand your point about the West Australian editorial. You seem to think that the judges do not have a role in determining refugee status. Of course they do. Judges constantly redefine and interpret definitions in such a way that you can hardly recognise what you thought was the original intention. Senator Cooney earned a living out of it. The most recent example is where the courts can accord refugee status to someone who cannot find job satisfaction in their country of origin or someone who claims that, because a family member was killed by a crime gang, they are afraid of going back home. The courts are out of control on this issue. 
You have not advanced any substantive reason why these matters cannot be dealt with over the next fortnight. I find it extraordinary to hear you say that the churches, the Refugee Council and the Law Council all need time to get hold of the legislation. If they did not all have this bill by Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning I would be staggered. That is what they are in the business of doing. They would have gone over this with a fine toothcomb. They would be ready to go for a committee hearing any time next week. 
I must say in passing that I am disappointed. My understanding was, from information given to me, that the Australian Democrats had indicated, until today, a preparedness to have this matter disposed of in the next sitting fortnight. Of course that is perfectly doable. The Democrats themselves knew it. They have now chosen, for some obscure tactical reason, to effectively ensure that legislation will not get through the parliament this year. Labor of course is playing the same game. It is extraordinary that Senator McKiernan cannot say whether Labor supports this. It does not advance any objections. It is just the usual sort of disingenuous nonsense about needing more time to trawl over the detail. That is exactly what you could do in the next fortnight. That is exactly what the interested organisations are used to doing.
—Ouagadougou!
—I know it does not suit your convenience, but my advice to you is that I would not play the Ouagadougou card. I doubt very much that you will get a great deal of sympathy out there in the community for the proposition that somehow it is inconvenient to you because instead of going to Timbuktu you have got to go to Ouagadougou. The reality is that there are plenty of other people ready, willing and able to dispose of this matter as expeditiously as possible. All that Senator McKiernan has really done is reveal the Labor strategy, which is to ensure that nothing happens. The lowest common denominator is the weak leadership that is so characteristic of Mr Beazley, and it is a very unfortunate day for Australia.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Bartlett's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,14,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-30,"—I move:
That the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 18 September 2001.
The matter before the Senate is a motion standing in the name of Senator Ian Campbell to refer the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 to the relevant legislation committee for report back to this chamber on 18 September next—in other words, a process that would allow the matter to be further debated and hopefully resolved by the Senate and, therefore, the parliament. 
It is a very important piece of legislation. The bill is aimed at addressing two critical challenges facing Australia's refugee protection arrangements and our ability to effectively contribute to international efforts to protect refugees. First, the continuing influx of unauthorised arrivals to this country is a tangible indicator of increasingly sophisticated attempts to undermine the integrity of Australia's refugee determination process. The evidence is clear and growing that large numbers of these people have had, but have disposed of, identifying documentation before arriving in Australia. The smuggling operations which are providing this travel often give to these arrivals highly detailed information and coaching on appropriate claims, country knowledge and Commonwealth assessment procedures to maximise their chances of successfully gaining a visa. We cannot lose sight of the fact that refugees will be amongst those people travelling to Australia without authority, but it is critical that Migration Act powers to test these claims effectively match the challenge being posed by organised and sophisticated attempts at national identity and claims fraud. 
The second major challenge lies in the increasingly broad interpretations being given by the courts to Australia's protection obligation under the refugees convention and protocol. The convention does not define many of the key terms it uses. In the absence of clear legislative guidance, the domestic interpretation of our obligations has broadened under cumulative court decisions so that Australia now provides protection visas in cases lying well beyond the bounds originally envisaged by the convention. These generous interpretations of our obligations encourage people who are not refugees to test their claims in Australia, adding to perceptions that Australia is a soft touch.
These matters have been the subject of extensive and ongoing public debate for very many months, and the increasingly generous interpretations provided by the Federal Court, in particular, have been matters of widespread discussion and, I think, increasing concern. A decision made only recently by the Federal Court which effectively said that lack of career satisfaction could constitute persecution is simply the latest high-water mark of the extent to which the courts will go to water down, or make broadly available, entitlements that were never envisaged by the convention or, indeed, the Australian parliament. So it ought to be quite clear that we are confronted here with not only a very important set of measures designed to tighten and strengthen the integrity of our migration system, but matters that have been looked at very carefully by those in our region and in other places who seek to exploit any sign that Australia is a soft touch.
Previously we had thought there were some 2,000 boat people—overwhelmingly organised and orchestrated by professional people smugglers—who were heading to our shores wanting to seek asylum, presumably via Christmas Island or nearby places in the first instance; but those operations have been put on hold. The number now seems to be closer to 5,000, so there are very significant implications for the way in which Australia behaves in the current crisis and the way in which we indicate to the world our attitude when handling future matters. It is quite clear that the reason we have not had this additional 2,000 on our doorstep right now is that they are waiting and watching to see not only how the current impasse is resolved, but the extent of Australia's determination to take a stand on this issue.
That is why it is incredibly disappointing to find that the opposition parties in this place have signalled their intention to join with the Australian Democrats to effectively oppose the debating of this bill, to frustrate legislation passing through the parliament. You can shake your heads as much as you like but we all know that adjourning this matter to a references committee for report back on 16 October is simply saying that you are squibbing the issue. You do not want to debate these important issues; you do not want to do anything to assist the Australian government or the Australian people to resolve very difficult issues. It is incredibly disappointing, because only yesterday we had Mr Beazley starting off his statement in the House by saying:
In these circumstances, this country and this parliament do not need a carping opposition; what they actually need is an opposition that understands the difficult circumstance in which the government finds itself, and to the very best of my ability I will ensure that that situation prevails.
I am sure that not even Mr Beazley pretends for a moment that you can look at the current crisis in isolation. You simply cannot quarantine it from all the other activities that are going on around us or the ways in which people smugglers are marshalling their forces to make an even greater concerted assault on Australia's shores.
You have to ask yourself why on earth the Labor Party would be adopting this stance. These issues have been in the public arena for months and months. The Labor Party has not indicated any basis for concern about the proposals. In fact, it has generally tried to indicate sympathy for the approach that we are taking, and a recognition of the need. I can understand why Senator Bartlett would have quite a different view of the world, and he has been consistent in that. I do not think it is a view that has a great deal of support in the Australian community, but one respects his right to stay out there on the margin and argue what many would regard as an extreme case. But that is not where the Labor Party has been on this issue.
The Labor Party has, until now, indicated considerable sympathy for the approach that the government is taking. For example, I heard Senator Ray say last night not only that Mr Ruddock has an incredibly difficult job but that Australia could not allow people to queuejump and push further down the queue—because of the operations of professional people smugglers—those who have genuine claims and might be wallowing in refugee camps in Pakistan.
That is a sentiment with which the government agrees. We do not for a moment pretend that there are not appalling refugee situations occurring in many places around the world. Australia's well-earned reputation as a very generous receiver of those with genuine refugee claims should be maintained. In the Indochinese war and through the problems that arose from that, in terms of refugees, I think Australia's reputation was second to none. We have not resiled from that situation. We continue to be a very compassionate nation.
Where you can identify serious problems, however, where you can see that the court's interpretations are not only increasingly out of touch with the Australian people's view of the world but also moving a long way away from the refugee convention's general intent, and where the UNHCR itself has said that these measures do not constitute any breach of our obligations under the refugee convention, it is clearly a matter that the Australian government is entitled to pursue, and to pursue quickly.
These are not issues on which you can simply take your time and have nice interesting and longwinded debates in committee processes and the like, or in fact—as I think the Labor Party strategy is—defer any further legislation until after the next election. That is not an outcome open to us, for the simple reason that the eyes of the world, and particularly those of professional people smugglers, are on every action we take. If they see signs that we are going to have gridlock for the next three or four months, then they will be in like Flynn. They will take that as a very positive incentive to pursue their activities. I know that when one people smuggler was interviewed on SBS not long ago he said just that. He said, `The moment the Australian government actually takes steps to turn back boats or tightens up its regime, we will have to rethink our strategy.' And that is exactly what is going on now. We all know and understand that. That is why I cannot for a moment imagine that, when Mr Beazley talks about the difficult circumstance in which the government finds itself, that does not apply to all of these issues. It is simply not possible to quarantine it to the current vessel, the Tampa.
Against that background it is very disappointing. Mr Sciacca said on radio last Tuesday, for example:
At the moment the people smugglers, as you call them, think that Australia is in fact a fairly soft touch. They think that as long as they can get here, we are going to allow them all in.
The Labor Party knows this. The official spokesman is saying we have a reputation as a soft touch. And you will clearly enhance that reputation big-time if you send a signal that the parliament is not prepared to tighten up the regime. In other words, it is business as usual. All the incentives that have got them to the point where they are circling Australia will continue to operate, and you will simply escalate the problem.
One has to ask why it is that the Labor Party seems to have embarked on this strategy. We got some indication of it yesterday from remarks by not only Mr Hollis but also Mr Quick. I would not take anything that Andrew Theophanous said at face value, but he claimed there are at least 10 Labor backbenchers who are now unhappy with their own party's stance. A report states:
Mr Quick said, `There is a bit of disharmony among the backbenchers but I guess each person makes up their own mind. I wouldn't call it a revolt. Labor's decision to block the laws was not aimed at heading off a revolt,' but conceded some backbenchers were upset.
That may well explain why we had last night's extraordinary display, within a matter of hours of the Leader of the Opposition indicating that he was prepared to put party politics to one side. It does look very much, on the face of it, as though Labor's strategy in relation to this legislation is driven by a desire on the part of Mr Beazley to appease his internal critics. In other words it is, `Go along. Do a deal with the Democrats. Basically take the soft option. But don't do what you know needs to be done.'
It is not as if you have been out there arguing the moral case against these provisions. It is not as if you have in any shape or form indicated why we do not need to tighten up the current legal regime. What you have done is to send all the signals to the contrary. You have said that you understand the problem, that action needs to be taken. But all of a sudden, out of the blue, what do we find? A determination to avoid your responsibilities; that is what it boils down to, and that is the tragedy of weak leadership. That is where you have this albatross around your neck. You have a leader who always looks for the easy way out, who is never prepared to get in there and take the tough decision—without quite knowing where it might lead. We are all in uncharted waters on this issue, and it is very difficult. But at the end of the day people expect you to display leadership. You are not here to be a shallow reflection of public opinion or to do your best to keep the faction together, or to find a lowest common denominator or simply put it off until such time as, you hope, the whole issue goes away. You are here to display leadership.
In the context of what is happening in our northern waters at the present time, I would have thought that the Labor Party would fully recognise the importance of this bill being passed as quickly as possible. Referring it off to a legislation committee gives you an opportunity to exhaustively analyse it for a couple of weeks, to go through it as much as you like, to get legal and other advice. Why on earth do you need to refer it beyond that to 16 October? It is simply so that you can avoid taking the hard decision. There is no other way to interpret your actions. That is why I think it is so disappointing that Mr Beazley is once again putting political compromise ahead of the national interest.
We simply cannot stand by and allow gridlock to occur. We cannot provide ongoing strong messages to unauthorised arrivals—and those who are contemplating coming here to take advantage of our generosity—that we basically cannot make up our minds, that we are torn, because we are not. You know and we know what needs to be done. That is why I think you are inviting very serious retribution. You know that your actions cannot withstand the scrutiny of proper public assessment because they will be seen for what they are: political attempts to divert from having to face this decision. You are simply trying to avoid it as much as possible while being seen to do the right thing.
The opposition's failure to support these measures will certainly make it much more difficult to deal decisively with the entry of unlawful arrivals. It will provide all the wrong signals. It will provide incentives all the while that Australia does have in place a determination process that accords refugee status to undeserving applicants, to applicants who destroy documentation, to applicants who refuse to swear on oath to their respective deity, to applicants who are determined to abuse the system and take it all the way to the higher courts of this country. The flood will continue.
Labor do not disagree with any of that, as I understand it. They know the system is being abused and rorted. They know that very considerable sums of public money are being spent on these claims being endlessly pursued. They know that people in detention camps are not for a moment prepared to accept the verdict of the umpire. Some of the detainees have been refused on multiple occasions, yet they are determined to stay here because they think that the decision makers will crack. That is what they are banking on. They are banking on people like the Labor Party making the situation all too difficult for decisive action to be taken and for the proper signals to be sent. Whilst that continues, we will have this current crisis, and it will be an ongoing crisis. It is one that I think has to be handled very carefully and compassionately. We are certainly doing all we can in the current circumstance of the Tampa to ensure that humanitarian, medical and other assistance is available. You have to temper that compassion with the need to ensure the integrity of your system. Unless we do that—unless we block the loopholes, unless we tighten up what is clearly a legal system that is out of control—we simply invite all of those unwanted abuses to continue. 
So it is a matter of great disappointment to the government that the Labor Party seems to have capitulated, once again, to a few people inside the tent—no doubt from Senator Carr's faction—who think there may even be political advantage in this but who generally do not want to stand up to be counted. That is how the Labor Party will be judged, and I think that is what this debate is all about. We will be vigorously opposing attempts to refer this matter off to a point where no sensible resolution of this matter can be achieved, and we will continue to expose the Labor Party for its weakness and the pusillanimous conduct of its leader.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-30,"—There was at least one point Senator Alston made during his contribution that I would definitely agree with wholeheartedly—although there is possibly not too much more that I would agree with—that is: we are not here to be a shallow reflection of public opinion; we are here to display leadership. On issues as crucial as this one, I think it is important to stand up and be counted and show leadership rather than simply try to surf along the short-term wave of—using the minister's own words—a shallow reflection of public opinion.
The minister spent most of his time debating the legislation and its so-called virtues. I could respond to that, but the motion before the Senate is about whether we should refer the legislation off to a committee so that we can discuss, assess and provide opportunity for input from other people into the legislation's so-called virtues and any flaws that it may have. I would have to say that after witnessing the government's astonishing and disgraceful effort last night, trying to railroad through one of the most draconian and far-reaching pieces of legislation that we have seen in this place with no consultation with absolutely anybody—not even in this place let alone in the Australian community—it makes the Democrats, and I imagine others in the community, much more apprehensive about the virtues, and the potential flaws, that may be contained in this legislation.
Despite the minister's statement that this issue has been the subject of extensive and ongoing debate over many months—obviously the issue in the broader sense of asylum seekers and refugees has been part of community debate in a range of areas for much longer than that—the specifics of this legislation have not been the subject of community debate. The legislation itself was introduced into the House of Representatives only two days ago. That is the first time it has seen the light of day. The first signal that it was even likely to happen was a press release from the minister probably about two or three weeks before that, which outlined what his intentions were. Certainly even those intentions caused a lot of apprehension amongst those in the community and in the Democrats, but I think even more concerning is the need to examine how they will actually be implemented in a legislative sense.
If you look at the justification the government used for introducing its disgraceful bill last night—the legislation is almost certainly unconstitutional, undoubtedly breaches the refugees convention and many others, and the government is trying to exempt itself from other domestic laws all under the pretext of ensuring that it could get just one ship out of Australian waters—one can only wonder what may be contained in this particular legislation, what amount of unbelievable overkill may be contained within its pages. It is appropriate to extensively examine such a matter.
We are at a crucial, very significant and pivotal stage in the future direction of the debate around these issues, not just within Australia but potentially internationally. This legislation has international significance. Obviously it has domestic significance as well and the Democrats give great weight to that, not just because of its linkage to international law, the refugee convention and the civil and political rights convention and other measures of international law which until recently Australia has proudly upheld and promoted but in terms of the general direction of international approaches to what is a global problem. As the house of review, the Senate has a heavy responsibility. Last night we saw the immense, almost priceless value of having a house of review in this parliament which is not dominated by the executive, a second chamber which is able to show leadership and not simply cave before an alleged wave of short-term public opinion, to assess legislation and recognise its draconian content, its dangerous precedent and its incredible attempts to increase the power of the government of the day over and above the power of the courts or the general community.
If this debate were presented in the context of the government trying to make a giant power grab and basically taking away the rights of the rest of the community, the response from the public would be very different. Once the parliament gives support to such a move, we are failing in our duty and putting ourselves in a position where the community can be very concerned about national sovereignty. The words `protecting our national sovereignty' have been thrown around with great puffed chests in recent days. The core of our national sovereignty is our political, civil and legal rights as citizens of this country and as members of the global community. We need to ensure the protection of those rights. That is why the Democrats are moving to amend this motion, to send the legislation to a references committee. This is not an unprecedented step. Indeed, there is another bill on another area before the same references committee at the moment. Certainly, bills have been sent to references committees in the past when it has been felt they are broad in scope and have flow-on consequences. This bill has flow-on consequences for diplomatic and international law relations and international human rights which are much broader than what might be seen as a narrow amendment to the Migration Act. In that context, it is appropriate to send it to a committee which will take a broader view.
Legislation committees perform a valuable job but are often referred to as the `tick and flick' committees, where you flick the bill off, give it a quick once-over on a Friday afternoon and flick it back to the Senate the next week. That is appropriate for certain bills, but when they are of the magnitude and significance of this legislation, particularly in the context of what happened last night and over preceding days, where we clearly have a government sending out every signal that they are quite willing to breach any number of domestic laws, international laws and basic standards of human rights and humanitarian decency, it is no wonder that there is great apprehension among legislators in this place about the need to step back from the short-term political storm and examine it in more detail and, hopefully, in a cooler way without some of the political rhetoric that has bounced backwards and forwards about it. It is not just us as legislators who are apprehensive but those in the community who have the expertise in this area, who have legal expertise and who have experience with the people affected.
Let us not forget that the bills we pass in this place—certainly bills like these—are not just amendments to laws to deal with political issues; they are amendments which impact on individual human beings. This situation involves some of the most vulnerable human beings within our country's borders, and internationally. In such a context we have a duty and a responsibility to examine these issues properly, to show leadership and to let the political stones and arrows bounce off and fly over our heads while we provide the opportunity for input from those in the domestic community and internationally about what the consequences and ramifications may be; not just how the law will operate if this bill were passed but flow-on diplomatic and international consequences. For a government that talks so much about the need to engage internationally, we have done a hell of a lot of damage to our international reputation in the last few days. The Democrats certainly do not want to be part of increasing the damage in terms of how we are seen in the eyes of the world and how we engage with the rest of the world. That has flow-on consequences as well, not just in humanitarian treatment of refugees and displaced people but in economic areas, trade and every aspect of international communication that you can think of.
The bill is wide ranging and crucial. I seek to send it to a references committee so that there can be proper examination. To contrast it with what happened last night, in the space of a couple of hours we were able to get legal opinion from a few people with expertise in the Law of the Sea and related conventions, and domestic and constitutional law. They were able to point to any number of concerns about that bill, in some cases it was to point categorically to major flaws and in others to at least raise significant questions. The purpose of a committee hearing is to examine those questions. It is not just assertion versus assertion; we examine the questions in more detail and we get to cross-examine departmental officials from the immigration department or from Foreign Affairs or the Attorney-General's Department—those in the community with expertise in the law in this field, those with the expertise in humanitarian principles and those on all sides of the debate who have concerns about how we best address the issue of asylum seekers and displaced people, which is a global problem, not just an Australian problem.
I will not respond in the broader context of the debate to what the minister went on about: the farce that Australia is a soft touch and all these myths that the government insists on promoting. They can be dealt with another day. This motion is to refer the bill to a committee, not to debate the bill itself. Suffice to say that the suggestion that Australia is a soft touch is farcical in the extreme. It is completely contradicted by the facts about how other civilised and developed countries address the issue of asylum seekers and the numbers of people that they deal with. Some of them have to deal with numbers greatly in excess of those Australia has to cope with.
There is no truth in the statement that we are somehow a soft touch. The last few years, with our mandatory detention regime and other aspects, have shown that there is no doubt that that is not the case. It is simply an indication of the government's political game playing. Their performance last night, with that extraordinary piece of legislation, and indeed their performance over the last few days, in which they have dug Australia into an appalling hole with no apparent escape route and left hundreds of asylum seekers in a desperate situation, gives the Democrats and many others great reason to be concerned about the government's motives and the government's agenda with this legislation and with any other matter that touches on refugees. That makes us far more determined to give absolute scrutiny to this legislation. If yesterday's episode had not happened, we might have been a little bit more willing to believe that there was some genuineness in the government's desire to seek a balanced outcome in some of these issues. But, after yesterday's episode, I do not think we have any hope or expectation of a balanced approach from the government on this issue, so it is crucial that the legislation that is put forward is given proper scrutiny. Hence, we should not only send it to a references committee but give sufficient time to all those in the community, including the international community, to provide input into the detail of this legislation and the many related issues that it touches on. I now move the amendments that I have circulated in the chamber:
Omit “Legislation Committee”, substitute “References Committee”.
Omit “18 September 2001”, substitute “16 October 2001”.
These amendments are to send the bill to a references committee and to extend the reporting date until 16 October. I believe that the amendments are appropriate in both the political circumstances of the moment and the legislative circumstances surrounding this bill.
It is an important issue. If the Democrats specifically wanted to ensure that this bill never saw the light of day then we would try and put it off until November or December, which we could do, and obviously the election would intervene. But we are willing to allow it to be brought back into this place in the same sitting in which it was introduced and less than two months after it was first introduced. That is still a very quick turnaround for a significant piece of legislation, particularly one with potentially major ramifications, whether legal, political, diplomatic, humanitarian or economic.
Any number of consequences may flow from this bill. The Democrats are certainly keen to ensure that we play our role as legislators and show leadership in the face of short-term political firestorms in scrutinising this properly and not just bowing down in the face of immediate pressure to rush this through to address a problem. I think even the way that the so-called problem is described leaves a lot to be desired, and the facts surrounding it are much disputed as well. There are a lot of differing opinions that need to be put forward about the so-called problem that we are addressing: the nature of it, whether it is as major as has been suggested and of course the best way of dealing with it. You do not deal with questions of that magnitude by rushing something through without proper scrutiny, particularly in the context of the political debate that is happening at the moment.
So I have moved the amendments as circulated in the chamber. I do believe it is an important issue, and I will certainly urge all those in the community with an interest in this issue to contribute to the examination of this legislation. It requires proper input from those with expertise in the many areas that are touched on by this bill, and that can be done only through the proper process of a genuine, extensive committee inquiry rather than a rushed, tick and flick type examination. That is why the Democrats have moved these amendments, and I commend them to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-08-30,"—The opposition will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Bartlett to refer the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 to a Senate references committee and to extend the date for the committee to report back to the chamber. There is a very simple reason why we are supporting these amendments—and it is important legislation—and that is that the legislation only saw the light of day on Tuesday of this week. The legislation, which was foreshadowed by the minister on 13 August, just 2½ weeks ago, has not yet been debated in the House of Representatives. It has not even reached this chamber. I know many people in our community have commented as a result of the minister's media release announcing that the legislation would be forthcoming, but not all of them have made informed comment. They have not been able to make informed comment, because they did not know what the bill contained.
Let me give you an example of what is not informed comment. It is the editorial from the West Australian newspaper of 15 August headed `New refugee definition useful'. I will quote a small part of it:
A criticism that has been levelled at the Government is that it wants to change legislation because it thinks the courts have been too liberal in interpreting the convention, that it doesn't like the umpire's decision.
The courts interpret and apply laws. The Parliament makes laws on behalf of the people. If the Parliament accepts that some laws are inadequate or do not serve the public interest properly, then it can change or add to them and its members will be answerable to the electorate for their actions. This is a continuing process and has nothing to do with any so-called umpire.
For the benefit of the editorial writers of the West Australian, the courts do not rule on refugee matters in this country. Our laws do not allow that. It is an administrative decision and we in this parliament have defended that administrative decision. The courts certainly are involved in the decisions, but it is for the courts to rule on points of law as to whether or not the tribunals—the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as the Refugee Review Tribunal—erred in law in making a determination on whether or not a person is a refugee. The courts do not rule, although they have tried to—and Senator Alston would probably be aware that some judges of the Federal Court have endeavoured in times past to determine whether or not an individual is a refugee. There was an appeal to the Full Federal Court, and I think there has even been a High Court decision on the matter.
If an editorial of a major newspaper can make a fundamental error like that, how many others in our community can make incorrect definitions of what the bill contains when they have not seen the bill? I must confess, because of all the other matters that have been happening during the course of this week, that I myself have not had the time yet to cast my eyes over the bill and see whether or not the bill reflects what is contained in the minister's media release of 13 August this year. The minister detailed that there would be some 13 points of issue contained in the bill. I cannot say at this time whether or not the opposition parties would be supportive of these points. I certainly have not looked at the bill and I do not think we have been involved in the discussion on this. 
I know for a fact that on this occasion I have not been offered a briefing on the contents of this bill. I have been offered briefings in the past on other legislative matters coming before the chamber and, when I have been able to, I have accepted those briefings in order to be better informed in preparation for debates in the parliament. But on this occasion I was not offered a briefing at all, and I am unsure as to whether or not our spokesperson on immigration matters has been offered a briefing and, if so, whether or not they were able to avail themselves of the briefing. 
Irrespective of what Minister Alston says, we are not speaking in opposition to this. Our record and our credentials over 5½ years in opposition in this place have proven that we have supported almost all of the government's legislation. We have not supported everything. We have participated in the development of legislation and, through the course of our participation, have improved the legislation. Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, I can do no better than refer you to debates in the chamber yesterday—just 24 hours ago—when, through our intervention in a bill dealing with detainees and the control of matters within Australia's detention centres, our amendments—amendments that we participated in the development of—helped, aided and improved the legislation that is going to govern this very important issue. 
There are matters contained in the minister's press statement which, when you read them at face value, obviously a responsible opposition would be supportive of. The minister's statement reads:
“It is unacceptable that people who are able to pay a people smuggler and make their way through several countries where they may avail themselves of protection, are getting a more favourable outcome than people languishing in the most appalling circumstances in refugee camps around the world,” Mr Ruddock said.
A simple search of the Hansard will find me having said similar words on a number of occasions in this place. The more recent example of that was on Tuesday of this week during the debate on an emergency item. I had good news for my constituents who were able to get Kurdish Iraqi relatives into the country—they thought their relatives were dead, but a wife and five children are coming into Australia now their tickets are issued. These people had been waiting for years and years and did not have the money to pay the people smugglers to jump in front of a queue. I think on that occasion I also spoke about the fact that there are queues in the refugee determination area. 
Another matter that the opposition would be supportive of at face value, quoting the minister's press statement, is this:
“Australia has a strong commitment to its international obligations under the Refugees Convention framework,” the Minister said, “but it is critical that we continue to support this important work on all levels—by targeting fraud and misuse of Australia's domestic refugee protection arrangements as well as making vigorous efforts to help address refugee problems at their source, and I will be making further announcements in relation to these matters in due course.”
We would be supportive of that, and we are eager to hear how the minister is addressing those problems at source. During the current controversial matter that we are involved in with the Tampa and the 400-odd people who are on that ship in Australian territorial waters off Christmas Island—if it is still in Australian territorial waters—we find the Prime Minister has not yet made contact with the President of Indonesia to try to resolve these matters.
—How do you know?
—If you know, tell us. If contact has been made, tell us. What I would really like to know, though, Senator Calvert, is why has contact not been made? I am only a simple backbencher in this place, but I have played a little bit of a role in helping on these matters—the agreement between Australia and the People's Republic of China, dealing with the unlawful arrival in this country of people from China. I played a little bit of a role in the development of that memorandum of understanding—a tiny bit of a role—but it is there. We had a problem with persons of Chinese nationality coming into Australia, but we do not have that problem any more because we addressed it at source—exactly what Minister Ruddock is saying in this press statement. I have not had the opportunity, as I said earlier, to look at the bill and see what is contained in the bill to address the problem at source. We need to do this. The chamber does not have the time to do this, so we need a committee of the parliament to do it, to talk with officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and see what provisions are contained in this bill to attack the problem at source. That is something that the committee will look forward to doing.
There are others in the community who will want to have an input into the contents of this bill—what the bill means and how the legislation will operate. I refer to the churches in Australia, many of whom have been very vocal on this issue and none of whom, I would suggest, would claim me to be their representative in this place in putting forward their views. Nonetheless, when they do put a view forward to a committee that I am on, they will know that they will be at least listened to and that they will be listened to with a degree of decency and dignity. There are others. The law societies of Australia have got very strong views on these issues and want to be heard. The Refugee Council of Australia, the peak refugee body of Australia, will want to, I know—and I have not spoken to them on this particular matter—put a view forward to the parliament on the provisions of the bill and the principles contained in the bill. They will be able to do that when they have had a chance to see the bill. 
If we do what the government has suggested—that is, refer this matter to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and report back on 17 September—in that time the Refugee Council of Australia will have to get a copy of the bill; read and digest the bill; put it through their internal processes, with all the organisations that make up the Refugee Council of Australia; try to put forward a unified opinion on suggestions for amendments, for change, for opposition, for improvement; express their opinion on the bill; and then develop a submission. And all that would have to be done in time for the committee to get together to meet and to hear them in public and then give the committee an opportunity to, among other things, listen to views, take account of the views of bodies such as the Refugee Council of Australia and then present a report to the parliament on Monday, 17 September. 
We have to do all that in the absence of the chair of the committee. Senator Marise Payne—a very good chair of the committee, a very decent human being, a very decent individual—on behalf of the parliament, has a very important role to play in East Timor with the elections that are soon to take place. Senator Payne will not be able to address this matter until some time next week, and then you have to put a timetable on it.
—When does she get back?
—I am not sure, Minister.
—I can tell you—Saturday.
—Saturday.
—Tell her next week.
—She's coming Saturday.
—I am not sure on that. I know that, in order to facilitate another inquiry the committee is involved in, we did look at possibly having hearings in Darwin this coming weekend and Senator Payne was not able to do that, but I cannot speak on behalf of Senator Payne and I do not want to misrepresent her in any way either because we work together.
Another key person on the committee is the deputy chair of the committee, me. Next Tuesday I have to leave this country to go to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso to represent Australia at the Interparliamentary Union conference. I have a keen interest in this and I want to be part of it. If the government wanted us to be part of it, they would have approached us, at least since Tuesday or probably even since 13 August, and said, `We have something we really want to address and we want to make it the best possible legislation that we can,' and I would have cancelled the trip to Ouagadougou and all the arguments that are going to go on there. But, no—no approaches have been made. Why haven't the approaches been made? I guess you will find the reason in the minister's speech in moving this forward.
The minister did not talk about the merits of the legislation, of what could be gained by a Senate committee inquiring into the bill—no. The minister played politics. The minister played wedge politics. Why did he do that? The government have been in office for 5½ years and at the end of 5½ years we find that the situation of dealing with refugees in this country is absolutely out of control. I am not only instancing what is happening off Christmas Island at the moment. One can go to any of the detention centres, in particular the larger ones—Curtin and Derby in Western Australia—and see the problems. You can go to Woomera, the largest of them, where the detention centre is on amber alert because of the high feelings and the potential for disturbances in the detention centres. You can go to Villawood where they recently put up a very high security fence which was breached by 23 individuals not so long ago. After that, some individuals—also 23 and it was probably the same minibus—tunnelled their way out through the drainage system. If that was not bad enough, they were then walking out the front door. The system is in crisis. Why is it in crisis? Because the government have taken their eye off the ball on this issue. They have taken their eye off the ball and there are statistics to prove it. 
Since unlawful boat arrivals started in 1989 with the Pender Bay off Broome in Western Australia in November 1989, some 13,000 persons have arrived by that method off the coast of Australia—1,000 of them just last week. 10,000 of those people have arrived in the last five years during the life of this present government—10,000 of them. Why, if there is a problem with our refugee determination system, are you bringing in this legislation just weeks and months before an election? Why did you need legislation yesterday on detainees? Why did you need legislation a couple of weeks ago on the matter of people escaping from legal detention custody? Why has a bill been sitting on the Notice Paper since December 1998 dealing with judicial review and not progressed any further? Because you have let the situation get out of control.
We are willing to sit down with you and work to get the best resolution possible for Australia from a humanitarian and compassionate point of view. We want to put laws in place that are good laws, that take into account the human rights of those people who are in need, lawfully, of protection from this country. We are still willing, despite the happenings of the past few days and the wedge politics that have been played. We are still willing to do it and we will do it. We want to do it properly and we want to consult widely in doing it. With the passage of this amendment, we want to refer this bill to the committee and give the community of Australia ample opportunity to come to the committee and have their views tested in front of the committee. I know that the government side on the committee will be well represented. I mentioned Senator Payne earlier, but Senator Coonan is also a member—another very decent human being who will look at laws with compassion and with humanity—and you can be assured that the job will be well done. 
The community of Australia need time to look at this legislation. They need time to formulate views on the legislation, and the committee itself—a committee of the parliament—needs an opportunity to give weight to those views and to develop a report which the parliament can look at, which the minister can look at and which his department can look at. If it is improving the laws that are being put in place in this country, that will be to the benefit of not only the parliament but also good governance in this country and the community of Australia. I endorse the amendments moved by Senator Bartlett.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-30,"—I will speak very briefly. I was waiting patiently for Senator McKiernan to explain why it is that Labor takes this extraordinary position. I acknowledge his longstanding interest in immigration and refugee issues. He asked why we need the legislation, but just after that he told us that the situation is absolutely out of control. That is why you need the legislation and that is why you need it urgently and that is why you could have facilitated its passage at a time when we could start to deal with the problem. 
You say that this is important legislation and was only introduced on Tuesday. You know that these issues have been festering for months. You know there have been a whole series of Federal Court decisions that have shown that the courts have a completely different view of the world. I do not understand your point about the West Australian editorial. You seem to think that the judges do not have a role in determining refugee status. Of course they do. Judges constantly redefine and interpret definitions in such a way that you can hardly recognise what you thought was the original intention. Senator Cooney earned a living out of it. The most recent example is where the courts can accord refugee status to someone who cannot find job satisfaction in their country of origin or someone who claims that, because a family member was killed by a crime gang, they are afraid of going back home. The courts are out of control on this issue. 
You have not advanced any substantive reason why these matters cannot be dealt with over the next fortnight. I find it extraordinary to hear you say that the churches, the Refugee Council and the Law Council all need time to get hold of the legislation. If they did not all have this bill by Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning I would be staggered. That is what they are in the business of doing. They would have gone over this with a fine toothcomb. They would be ready to go for a committee hearing any time next week. 
I must say in passing that I am disappointed. My understanding was, from information given to me, that the Australian Democrats had indicated, until today, a preparedness to have this matter disposed of in the next sitting fortnight. Of course that is perfectly doable. The Democrats themselves knew it. They have now chosen, for some obscure tactical reason, to effectively ensure that legislation will not get through the parliament this year. Labor of course is playing the same game. It is extraordinary that Senator McKiernan cannot say whether Labor supports this. It does not advance any objections. It is just the usual sort of disingenuous nonsense about needing more time to trawl over the detail. That is exactly what you could do in the next fortnight. That is exactly what the interested organisations are used to doing.
—Ouagadougou!
—I know it does not suit your convenience, but my advice to you is that I would not play the Ouagadougou card. I doubt very much that you will get a great deal of sympathy out there in the community for the proposition that somehow it is inconvenient to you because instead of going to Timbuktu you have got to go to Ouagadougou. The reality is that there are plenty of other people ready, willing and able to dispose of this matter as expeditiously as possible. All that Senator McKiernan has really done is reveal the Labor strategy, which is to ensure that nothing happens. The lowest common denominator is the weak leadership that is so characteristic of Mr Beazley, and it is a very unfortunate day for Australia.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Bartlett's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-08-30,"—I rise to indicate that the opposition will support passage of the Wool International Amendment Bill 2001. The bill expedites the final stage of the long task which has been going on over some 10 years or more now of selling down the wool stockpile. The original position was that this process was to be completed by the end of this financial year—that is, by the end of June 2002—at which time the wool growers, the shareholders of WoolStock Australia Ltd, would be paid out their final payments. As I am sure honourable senators are aware, the stockpile has been sold in recent weeks. This legislation will expedite that final winding-up and bring forward the payment of the final cash distribution to the wool grower shareholders. 
We support that process, but we cannot help but note in passing that the government here has obviously an ulterior motive, and that is to expedite this process so that wool growers would be receiving their final payments probably just before the election is held. No doubt the government will seek to cash in—excuse the pun—on that coincidence of events. Nevertheless, we support the legislation because it will mean that the growers will be paid. Indeed, we will be taking the opportunity during the election campaign to highlight the many other deficiencies this government has demonstrated in this process of bringing about the sale of the stockpile.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2001-08-30,"—I wish to support the Wool International Amendment Bill 2001 obviously, because it is of great importance to Australian wool growers. Time is short, and I do not have a speech to incorporate. There are a couple of points I would like to make. One of them is about the role Senator Crane has played in this whole debate. I was expecting to follow him. He is not speaking because of the time constraints, but he has played such a constructive role in the finalisation of the wool industry woes and has done so since before 1990 when he entered the Senate. Senator Ferris is here as well, and I know she is going to incorporate her speech. All of us who have been involved in this debate over the last few years are surprised that the finalisation of this has come at a time of non-controversial legislation, that after all the pain that the wool industry has been through over the last 10 years we now pass this final liquidation of wool stock, which is owned by Australian wool growers now, in a non-controversial way. 
The industry that we are talking about is so very important for Australia. Wool is still our second largest rural export. The towns and communities that depend on wool are spread right across the Western Division, the pastoral divisions of Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. They have seen great distress over the last 10 years. It is the first time in 30 years that we have a free market. The psychological impact of that is extremely strong, the commercial aspect of it is extremely strong and, in a bipartisan sense, the political aspect of it is extremely strong. For those three reasons—apart from all the other personal reasons, including the 70,000 wool growers out there, who are good people and who require a free market for their product to be sold—this is good legislation. It is good to see their money returned. I will make some further comments on this in the adjournment debate when we come back.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-08-30,"—Because of the constraints of time I seek leave to incorporate my remarks in Hansard. 
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
The bill before us today coincides with one of the most significant achievements in the history of our wool industry—the sale of the last bale of stockpile wool three weeks ago.
At its height the wool stockpile was so huge that if every bale was placed next to each other it would have stretched from Brisbane to Perth. It has therefore been a remarkable achievement by WoolStock Australia to have sold over a million bales of wool over the past two years, with minimal impact on the wool market.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Don McGauchie and other members of the WoolStock board for their efforts in ensuring the removal of the stockpile.
The bill before us today enables WoolStock to wind up early and make its final cash distribution to shareholders. This is a company liquidation we can all be happy with and the sooner it occurs the quicker shareholders will be able to receive their share of WoolStock's funds. To date $200 million has been distributed to WoolStock's 96,000 shareholders with a further $300 million available now that the stockpile has finally gone.       
The Australian wool industry is historically one of our most important industries, contributing around 7% of the gross value of our agricultural production and $3 billion in export income in 1999-2000.  
In South Australia, wool is our eighth largest export worth $234 million to the State.
As we are all aware, for the past 10 years the Australian wool industry has struggled under the economic weight of the stockpile. The Wool Reserve Price Scheme was established in 1970 with the aim of setting a base price for wool in Australia.   
When the Australian Wool Commission merged with the Australian Wool Board in 1973, prices for wool were set at a sustainable level. However increases in the floor price eventually put the price well above sustainable levels, and the market became overblown with thousands of bales of wool.
The Reserve Price Scheme eventually collapsed when the stockpile peaked at 4.7 million bales in 1991, with an associated debt of $2.8 billion.
Wool International was established in 1993 to dispose of the wool stockpile and repay the Commonwealth Government-guaranteed debt accumulated under the Reserve Price Scheme.
Legislation was passed by the Coalition Government in 1997 to transfer surplus equity from the stockpile to woolgrowers who paid the debt management component of the wool-tax between July 1 1993 and June 30 1996. 
In 1998 the Government announced that Wool International would be privatised to give ownership and control of the wool stockpile back to the growers. WoolStock Australia was registered as a trading organisation on July 1 1999. The stockpile comprised 1,005,000 bales with a net debt of $196.2 million at the time.
Wool prices are currently among the highest recorded in a decade with cash income for specialist woolgrowers in 1999-00 42% higher then the average income over the period 1996-97 to 1998-99.
For the first time in more then 30 years, wool will be traded freely without the stigma of a large stockpile hanging over the industry.
The future for Australia's wool industry is looking much more optimistic, with a costly lesson learned about wool marketing. So, it is vital that this bill be passed as quickly as possible so that shareholders can receive their payments and not be liable for the additional expense of keeping WoolStock running any longer than it should.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2001-08-30,"—I thank the honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Wool International Amendment Bill 2001, particularly the senator on my side who agreed to incorporate in Hansard her comments. This does expedite the final stage in the decade-long task of selling down the wool stockpile. In response to Senator Forshaw, I am sure that Senator Forshaw would not begrudge the final payment to wool shareholders, who have been through a decade of management of this issue and who at least now have the gratification of seeing it finalised. I thank Mr Donald McGauchie and the members of the WoolStock board for their important role in selling down the stockpile. There have already been two payments made, with a third distribution, as you rightly remark, expected in coming months. When the final distribution is made after the remaining wool is sold and the necessary procedures are taken to determine the surplus equity in WoolStock, those growers will reap further benefits. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-08-30,"—The opposition will support the passage of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. This bill does what its title sets out—that is, amends various offence provisions contained in legislation within the portfolio area of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In that respect, it brings those provisions in each of those pieces of legislation into harmony with chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code provides a set of general principles relating to criminal responsibility and a standard approach to the formulation of Commonwealth criminal offences. The legislation before the chamber today brings all of that other legislation within the AFFA portfolio area into harmony with the Criminal Code.
I do not wish to go into the specific impacts of this bill in detail. They are set out of course in the second reading speech, and my colleague in the other place the shadow minister, Mr Gavan O'Connor, also spoke in some detail on those areas. I draw the attention of honourable senators to his speech in that regard. But I cannot let the occasion pass without noting the contrast between the way in which this bill is being dealt with and the way in which certain legislation that came before the parliament last night was dealt with. The reason this bill—which is of a serious nature, relating to standardising criminal offences and criminal responsibility—is non-controversial is that the opposition has had the time to examine the legislation in proper detail and then in turn be able to debate it, if necessary, properly in this chamber. That of course is a notable contrast to the way in which the government has acted in the last 24 hours. I only wish that maybe the government would think about its approach and return to the normal sorts of courtesies that are applied to the opposition and other members of the parliament when dealing with very important legislation. With those remarks, I indicate that the opposition is prepared to support this bill.",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2001-08-30,"—I will let those remarks of Senator Forshaw pass, but I would have thought that six hours of debate in the Senate last night on the bill to which he was referring would have allowed every senator who wished to express an opinion on that to actually do so. However, with regard to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, these changes will provide certainty, clarity and consistency as to how the offences in this portfolio's legislation operate. They will also make the prosecution of offences more efficient. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-08-30,"—I will not delay the committee for long. The International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, as we know, deals with international maritime conventions. That sparked a little interest in me because, as I was reading through the list today, I was also having a perusal of report No. 384 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. In particular, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to pages 88 to 92 because they have a lot of relevance to what we have been discussing recently—last night and elsewhere. There is some overlapping responsibility, but I do not claim total overlapping responsibility, from what is said in this report and what is contained in the legislation. On page 88 there appears the heading `United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea'. The report goes on to describe the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. There is another section covering boat people arriving in the north and north-west of Australia, one on the problems of Australia, et cetera, and then the solution to the problems. I raise this because paragraph 6.24 of the report states:
The Committee concludes that `pushing boat people back to sea' is not a viable option. Australia cannot ignore its international responsibilities. Instead Australia must work within the conventions and contribute to solving the problem at its source.
There is a lot of other valuable material in this Public Accounts and Audit Committee report. You all know how tardy I am: I have only got around to reading it today. Apparently it came out two to three weeks ago. I thought: `These are fairly wise words here. These are words that are consistent with exactly what this government was doing until 6.50 last night.' I cannot find anything in this wisdom in the report that the government was not doing up to that point. But then we were suddenly confronted with legislation that went through the House of Representatives on party lines and was defeated in this place.
I thought I would have a look at who signed off on this report. I note that there is a dissenting report, but the dissenting report does not go to this section of the report. A couple of Labor members that dissented somewhere along the line did not choose to dissent on this, so the remainder of the section—pages 88 to 92—is unanimous. Mr Bob Charles, the member for La Trobe, signed off on the report. Yet I notice that last night he is recorded in the other place as having voted for the Border Protection Bill 2001. How could that be? What happened in the two or three weeks? I thought I would see who else was on the committee. There was Senator Helen Coonan. I recall her interjecting on me and saying some nasty things last night. What happened in the three weeks? What did they put in the water up here that suddenly caused a 180 degree turnaround?
Senator Brian Gibson was on the committee. I distinctly saw him voting on this issue 180 degrees differently. Of course, I have to acknowledge that Senator Crowley, Senator Hogg and Senator Andrew Murray voted on the issue and, guess what, they voted consistently with the views that they had put into this report. Then we have Uncle Arthur—Senator John Watson. I distinctly recall him voting last night for the draconian bill—in committee we are obviously talking to the long title of the bill—and against the views that he had put in this report, which I again recommend; that is, pages 88 to 92.
Mr Kevin Andrews was a member of the committee and he concurred with what was in the report. What happened in the car ride from Bulleen to Tullamarine that made him change his mind? Maybe Mr Andrews picked up Mr Petro Georgiou in Barkers Road and took him on to Tullamarine. Perhaps they discussed the issue and changed their minds. There was Peter Lindsay. It was a long flight down from Herbert. Did he change his mind on the way down? I am only asking what happened on the road to Damascus. They put these views down and then suddenly they all changed their minds. The Hon. Alex Somlyay signed off on this unanimous section of the report. There was Mr Stuart St Clair. I did not even know he could write, but nevertheless he signed off on it.
—Senator Ray, I would ask you not to reflect upon anybody in either this place or the other place.
—Certainly I will resist trying to reflect on anyone in any place. 
—How many was that?
—How many from the coalition? We have got Mr Bob Charles—you can keep count with me.
—One.
—That is one. Senator Helen Coonan—that is two. Senator Brian Gibson is three. Senator John Watson would be four. Mr Kevin Andrews would be five. Mr Petro Georgiou would be six. Mr Peter Lindsay, seven. Mr Alex Somlyay, eight. Mr St Clair, nine. Is it just a coincidence—great minds thinking alike? What happened between putting this report down and that horrible piece of legislation last night? I really wonder what happened. I call on them—and I do not expect the parliamentary secretary at the table to respond on their behalf because her name is not here—to explain themselves. Did they vote against their conscience last night? Didn't they read this report when they signed it off, or did they think they would just get into a bit of low grade, sleazy gutter politics and go along with what their leader had determined? Most of them had not even read the legislation. Most of them had not even seen a copy of it. We will not go over all that old ground.
It is interesting, as we consider the international maritime conventions legislation, that this apt report from one of the finest committees of the parliament unanimously put forward some sensible views saying that we had to keep our international obligations. Remember that we believe, even up until this very moment, that this government has kept to its international obligations in regard to the treatment of those on board the Tampa. We do not dispute that. But what should be followed is the formula set down in this report and not a bit of cheap electoral opportunism.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MARITIME CONVENTIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech

Senators may recall that we Democrats had some slight concerns with this legislation last week, and there was goodwill across parties to allow us to explore some suitable amendments which I have distributed here today. They relate essentially to the prevention of pollution from ships. Firstly, several sections are being amended so that the level of discretion given to an inspector to require the discharge of substances from a ship to a prescribed facility is constrained. The Democrat amendments provide that the discretion of the officer must be based on a reasonable belief that the discharge of a substance to a prescribed facility is necessary in order to avoid a discharge at sea. In doing this, we Democrats ensure that the environmental purpose behind this provision is more clearly stated. 
Secondly, the Democrats are amending section 10 in order to avoid any misunderstanding of this provision. As written, section 10 could have been read as permitting the discharge of oil residues into the sea where the discharge is being made to an onshore reception facility. It could also have been read to permit discharge of oil residues between vessels at sea. We believe this Democrat amendment will remove any doubts that either of these discharges is permitted. Again, we are aiming to ensure that the intent of environmental protection is clear and unambiguous. The amendments have been circulated. I understand there have been informal discussions and cooperation from the other parties. I thank senators for their goodwill.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MARITIME CONVENTIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-08-30,"—The opposition supports the 10 technical amendments moved by Senator Greig on behalf of the Australian Democrats. In doing so we note the following. Amendments (1) and (2) act upon advice provided by the Parliamentary Library. That advice foreshadowed a possible problem with the interpretation of the proposed subsection 10(2). These amendments deal with an issue raised by end note 54 of the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest No. 147 2000-01. In short, there is a possibility that pollution of the sea in the course of a discharge of oil residues to a reception facility may be a valid defence for a polluter. Labor and, I understand, the government concede that there is a risk with the suggested interpretation and that a clarification of the offence would put this beyond doubt. After a careful re-read, we consider that the change of words in the new subsections 10(1) and 10(3) from the existing requirement to retain oil residues to a prohibition on their discharge into the sea makes the exception for discharge to a reception facility unnecessary. The first two amendments clarify the interpretation to ensure that no loophole can undermine the intent of the bill.
In relation to amendments (3) through to (10), these amendments are in response to the issues raised by the Democrats about the wide powers of a prescribed officer on a ship which needs to discharge oil, sewage or garbage. While there are probably other circumstances in which this power needs to be applied, the main situation seems to be where, following an inspection, the ship's necessity to discharge oil, sewage or garbage on board already in the available storage space for these things—and taking into account the length of the voyage to its next port of call—would be determined. The Democrat amendments change the various provisions dealing with oil and oily substances, liquid substances, sewage and garbage to limit the prescribed officer's discretion in these circumstances. The opposition can appreciate that these changes will assist to clarify this issue for the purposes of interpreting the legislation, and for that reason the opposition will be supporting amendments (1) through to (10) as moved by Senator Greig on behalf of the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MARITIME CONVENTIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-08-30,"—The opposition is prepared to agree with this proposition but in doing so we think it is important to state a few things publicly. The management of this legislative program is nothing short of a joke. The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001  is an extremely important piece of legislation, which the opposition is supporting. There is a second reading amendment that could have been dealt with quite quickly. The second reading debate had gone through quite a number of speeches last night. I understand that the Democrats are concerned about aspects of the bill but, nonetheless, this matter could have been dealt with on the basis of the advice that was tendered by the opposition to the government prior to the commencement of non-controversial legislation. If it were not for the grandstanding of Senator Alston, this situation would not have been necessary. He had the opportunity to deal with this matter prior to the movement to non-controversial legislation and failed to do so. As a senior member of the government, he should have had some understanding of the significance of this particular legislation. 
Equally, the actions of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, in unilaterally changing the position this morning on the question of certain documents that Senator Kerry O'Brien understood were to have been accepted as being tabled, cost this chamber 1½ hours of its business time this morning. What this cumulatively points to is the fact that there is no management of the government's program currently at work—certainly we have not seen any evidence of it. You would expect a bit better in what may well be the last sitting day of this parliament. It is quite clear that the government is seriously contemplating the possibility of an election. From the comments that have been made around this chamber, behind hands, that is what the government is saying. That is why this bill has to be dealt with now. You would have thought that, in that context, the government would have shown a little more interest in ensuring that important pieces of legislation were dealt with in a timely and effective manner. But it is quite apparent that there is no discipline there. There is no concern for these issues.
It is a bit ironic, surely, that it is the opposition that has to draw the government's attention to the ways and means by which it can actually secure legislation of this importance—yet, of course, the advice of the opposition is treated contemptuously by senior members of the government, who clearly are more interested in the presentation of their personal agendas than in the resolution of quite important matters such as this innovation bill, which is quite significant for the higher education sector in this country. With those few remarks, I support the government's motion.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2001-08-30,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Is the Assistant Treasurer aware of figures from the Insolvency and Trustees Service Australia that show that in the three months from April to June this year business bankruptcies increased by 117 per cent on the same period last year? Is he aware of comments by a personal insolvency expert, Mr Paul Leroy of Hall Chadwick Chartered Accountants, that this surge in bankruptcies was a result of GST liabilities catching up with small businesses that were forced by circumstances to delay earlier payments? Does the Assistant Treasurer agree with Mr Leroy that, `These figures are a reflection of the suffering of small business owners and sole traders, the mums and dads and families'?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Small Business</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1,question
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2001-08-30,"—Madam President, I will ask a supplementary question. As Senator Ray pointed out, it is probably not worth it, but the Assistant Treasurer wasted a fair degree of his response time with a load of waffle. I ask the Assistant Treasurer, given that he did not address the question: how can small business have any faith in the Howard-Costello government when, on 18 May 2000, Mr Costello said, and senators should pay attention to this, `I don't think anybody will go to the wall as a consequence of the GST'; when, at the Senate estimates hearings in June, officials of Mr Costello's department blamed the rise in bankruptcies on small business itself and not the GST; and when the Liberal Party has been rorting its own GST by creaming off input credits when no GST was paid?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Small Business</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-08-30,"—I thank Senator Murphy for his question, because it does allow me to put a number of important facts on the record. The first clear and important fact I would put on the record is that it is surprising that, after all this time, when we are probably in the bell lap as we move towards an election, the Labor Party still stands up and attacks the GST. Essentially, one would have thought it surprising because the Labor Party has adopted the GST as part of its policy.
—It has not.
—Senator Cook is a lone voice in the wilderness. I do not think anyone else in your party believes that, Senator Cook. Certainly the shadow Treasurer, Mr Simon Crean, does not appear to accept Senator Cook's view of this. Senator Cook has, I regret to say, a little bit of form in the past in misleading the Senate on various key issues.
—No, no, no.
—Yes, yes, yes, I am afraid, Senator Cook. So let me just make that point. If there are people listening to this, I think they should be aware that what we are seeing is an exercise in hypocrisy by the Labor Party. If they did not like the GST and did not think it was good for Australia, what do you think the Labor Party would do? The Labor Party would say that the GST would be abolished. Of course, that is absolutely not what they are saying.
—Roll-back
—Senator Sherry says `roll-back'. Well, I make the offer for the 23rd time: if Senator Cook wants to pass me a note saying we will have a debate in this chamber on roll-back, I will be the first person here. The challenge goes out again, for the 23rd time: if the Labor Party wants to debate roll-back, I will be the first in the chamber and we will have a good debate on that, but whatever happens—
—Senator Kemp, I remind you of the question.
—The question concerned the GST and I am drawing some important conclusions. There have been various figures released on bankruptcies.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to the remark just made by the minister. He is drawing certain conclusions, he says. The question is about bankruptcies caused by the GST, and the standing orders make it quite clear that, in answering a question, the person answering the question shall not debate it. That is what the standing orders say. I put it to you, Madam President, that the minister is in fact debating the question. The only way that he could not debate it is by actually answering the question on GST bankruptcies. By canvassing this wide field of arguments, he is debating it. As a consequence, he is in breach of standing orders and, as a consequence, he should be sat down.
—It was a long preamble, but I have drawn the minister's attention to the question and advised him to continue answering the question.
—Thank you, Madam President. In fact, I think the Hansard will show that I was now dealing with the specifics of the question. There are some figures I have here which I would like to share with Senator Murphy and the Senate. The figures I have are that business related personal bankruptcies in 2000-01 are 12 per cent lower than for the 1998-99 financial year. This comparison shows a single year comparison. You can draw many conclusions from a single year comparison but, if I was going to extend that, I would say that, if the GST was to blame for the increase in personal bankruptcies, you would expect the 2000-01 figures to be higher than for any recent year. The truth is—and this is the advice that I have received, Senator Murphy—that the 2000-01 figures are significantly lower than those registered two years ago. This shows a very different picture to the picture that Senator Murphy tried to paint before this chamber. What we are seeing, I think, from the Labor Party—well, perhaps as my time is on the wing, if Senator Murphy would be kind enough to ask me a supplementary question, I have some further information I would like to share with him.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-08-30,"—That sounds to me like a Senator Peter Cook special question: utterly confused, wrong in most places and a pathetic attempt to make a political point. Labor senators stand up and attempt to make political points, and they get a little upset when I make a response which may have an overtone of politics to it. But, let me tell you, small business people are petrified of the Labor Party. One hundred per cent of you are trade union bosses. They are petrified of you people, and the last thing they want is to have a Labor Party in government, 100 per cent composed as it is of trade union bosses. You cannot get a job in this parliament in the Labor Party if you are not an active member and functionary of the trade union movement.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-30,"—by leave—With reference to Senator Greig's return to order motion of 9 August 2001 for the release of all documentation relating to the southem bluefin dispute, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, has considered it carefully. In reaching his decision, Mr Downer has consulted his department and sought legal advice. Mr Downer has accepted legal advice that he is not able to comply with Senator Greig's request, on the grounds that it would not be in the public interest to do so. The government's firm belief is that disclosure of such documents, most of which are of a highly classified nature, could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the international relations of the Commonwealth. 
Two years ago, Australia was in dispute with Japan over Japan's then experimental fishing program. At the advice of the arbitral tribunal, we entered negotiations with Japan to resolve the dispute. In keeping with intemational practice, those negotiations were confidential to the parties. This confidentiality is critical to maintaining trust between the parties and enabled proposals to be made in the course of the negotiations without prejudice to respective legal positions. Without that confidentiality, a satisfactory resolution of the dispute would have been difficult to achieve. The absence of that confidentiality would have had a negative impact on Australia's capacity to work effectively with Japan in the Commission on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Legal professional privilege has also been used by the government for the purposes of exempting documents relating specifically to legal proceedings. The government believes that the release of such documents would also have an adverse effect generally on Australia's relationships with Japan.",SENATE,<title>JAPANESE FISHING BOATS: SOUTHERN BLUEFISH TUNA</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1,speech

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-08-30,"—I spoke to this report of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services earlier in the week. I want to restrict my comments tonight to one aspect of this report. When I spoke previously, I mentioned the controversial aspect of the report that provides immunities to both officers and agents of ASIS in certain offences committed within Australia. This is a very controversial area, obviously, when you are offering immunities to people. When the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 was originally drawn up, this section was fairly tightly drawn. Nevertheless, the select committee still had some minor concerns. As I have previously said, it was a pleasure to cooperate with ASIS, ASIO and the Inspector-General in discussing and teasing out these issues. ASIS was able to come back with a very clever formulation that assuaged the concerns of everyone on the committee. We had proper process. We had a select committee of eight coalition members, six Labor members and one Democrat member. Through a bipartisan and cooperative approach, we were able to establish and define the areas of immunity.
You can imagine my disgust when I looked at a bill that was presented to this parliament last night that had an immense section of immunities in it, ill defined and the most widespread ever to be put into legislation in this country—not discussed between political parties and not teased out as to where the boundaries lay. For instance, clause 7(1) of the Border Protection Bill 2001 states:
Proceedings, whether civil or criminal, may not be instituted or continued against the Commonwealth in respect of action taken under section 5 or 6.
But, even more sweeping, clause 7(2) states:
Proceedings, whether civil or criminal, may not be instituted or continued against an officer who takes action under section 5 or 6, or a person who assists in taking action under section 5 or 6, if the officer or person acts in good faith.
I do not know where you are permitted to break the law `in good faith'. If you look at the definition of `officer' in the proposed ASIS bill—I am comparing the proposed ASIS bill with the Border Protection Bill 2001—the proposed ASIS bill defines `agent' and `officer'. In the Border Protection Bill, an officer can be:
(a) the Secretary, or any employee, of the Department—
that could be any one of 80,000, right down to the most junior cook—
(b) a person who is an officer for the purposes of the Customs Act 1901—
that could be several thousand—
(c) a member of the Australian Federal Police or of the police force of a State or internal Territory—
that could be another 20,000—
(d) a member of the police force of an external Territory—
very small I admit—
 e) a member of the Australian Defence Force.
I included those with the Department of Defence—60,000 and 16,000. This is an officer—not a person but an officer. So you have this immense number of people who are able to use force, in good faith, who are all exempted from civil and criminal proceedings. Why would we do that when, in another context, we narrowly define it, we pour over the semantics of it, we agonise over it and we get it right? Why would we suddenly produce a bill carte blanche like this other than for the reason it was not given the proper scrutiny that it should have been given? There were no negotiations—we know that—there were no discussions and there was no chance for a committee to look at it. In the case of the Labor Party, we could not even get the Labor Party caucus together to look at it, given the timing. It is my understanding—and I will stand corrected—that the coalition party room did not have the explanatory memorandum available to them when they approved this particular piece of legislation.
So it really is A Tale of Two Cities. It is a tale that says that, when a government maturely considers legislation, it will draft it precisely, the checks and balances will all be accorded and when it goes to a committee it will be further refined and developed in a cooperative and bipartisan atmosphere. This is the way things should work. Politics is, for the most part, an adversarial system, but we do demark certain areas where we would like to see bipartisanship develop for the good of the country. More often than not these tend to be in the foreign affairs, defence, immigration and multicultural areas.
I thought in terms of bipartisanship we were in pretty good shape, until 6.40 last night. Even then, it could have been saved by a bit more tolerance, some pause, some delay and some consideration of that legislation, bearing in mind what other committees had done in different circumstances—and I refer to the ASIS report that is before us at the moment. We could have developed a set of protocols that was acceptable. After all, we are told that already all of these powers exist, that this is only—what is that wonderful term; I have forgotten it already—`an abundance of caution', one of those wonderfully politically correct terms that only a President Nixon or a Prime Minister Howard could have come forward with. No, I am being unfair to Prime Minister Howard. That would not have been his phraseology; it would have been from someone in the Attorney-General's Department. I will not go so far as to say that John Howard would have invented such a term.
I always remember that when Lebanon was invaded in 1982 the operation was termed `Peace for Galilee'. The government is developing this sort of terminology: `an abundance of caution'. I do not take much comfort from a government that will use and abuse us in one process and then seek our cooperation, which is freely and generously given by a diverse group of people, to develop the appropriate solution, when in almost the same circumstances we get this wildly authoritarian view that hundreds of thousands of people—and I am not exaggerating, when you look at the definitions of `officer' and `person'—will be able to break the law provided that they do so in good faith. The government do not say who establishes whether it is in good faith.
There is this blanket exemption, this equivalent of a 16th century papal indulgence, offered in the legislation yesterday. Yet in the ASIS legislation that presents itself here—and which will pass this chamber, I hope, expeditiously—you will find a carefully crafted set of indemnities, ones that are relevant and necessary if we are to properly support the security agencies of this country. In these circumstances we know that we have to cede some of our tendencies towards civil liberties and counterbalance them with the national interest.
But when you are doing a stitch up, all of that apparently goes out the window—no checks and balances; no thought given to a carefully crafted piece of legislation; just taking a sledgehammer to a peanut. I almost feel that I have been used by serving on the committee that produced this report, when in similar circumstances where bipartisanship is supposed to exist all we get is the absolutely authoritarian overkill that we saw in the legislation that was rejected last night.",SENATE,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BILL 2001</title>,<title>Report of Intelligence Services Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-30,"—I was listening to what Senator Ray had to say about this report and how he related it to the legislation that came in last night, and I must confess that when he was asking questions about what the legislation before us last night was all about it did occur to me that it would be appropriate to say some things about it in the context of how matters were dealt with in respect of the ASIS matter. Mr Acting Deputy President, ASIS and ASIO are, as you know, intelligence gathering organisations with a tradition of keeping things secret in the intelligence area, giving them certain abilities that they would not otherwise have. One can understand why that would happen in that area.
There seems to be absolutely no reason why the sorts of provisions that operate in, say, the legislation that controls the Federal Police, the NCA or any of the policing authorities and Customs should not have been in the Border Protection Bill 2001 that was before us last night. That bill, which has now been defeated, talked about border protection, the sort of thing that you look at not in terms of what ASIS or ASIO does but in terms of what the Federal Police and perhaps the NCA and Customs do. The Border Protection Bill was a very slender piece of work indeed. Contrast that with the Australian Federal Police Act, the Customs Act and the National Crime Authority Act.
Why should we suddenly have legislation brought in that deals with a process that has been dealt with in the other legislation that I have been talking about but abandons all of the traditional safeguards that we have in this area? We have safeguards to prevent the exercise of arbitrary power. I have not seen any legislation that allows the exercise of arbitrary power in the way that the Border Protection Bill did. I am confident about this: I throw out a challenge to anybody to come in here and produce legislation of this kind—in other words, dealing with the protection of our border—that is as arbitrary in its cover as this is.
—I can: the Reichstag, 1938.
—Thanks. That is probably correct. In a civilised society such as we are supposed to be, in a society where we believe in the rule of law, in a society where we say there should be balances, in a society where we say we have the division of power between the judiciary, the executive and the legislature and in a society where we say that the press should have cover, where would you get legislation such as this? And where would you get legislation such as this produced at such short notice? Where would you get legislation that would allow a very junior member of the Army, a very junior member of the Federal Police or a very junior member of the Customs Service to be dressed up with the sort of power that is allowed for in this legislation? It says that an officer, perhaps a young lady who has been in the Army for six months—I hope that that would not happen, but if you look at the terms of the legislation it allows it—may in her absolute discretion direct the master or other person in charge of a ship—a man of great seniority, it could be; a man who has all the ability that we would want from somebody who commands a ship—to do what she says and, if he does not, look out! As long as that ship is within the territorial waters of Australia, that can occur. Of course, as has been pointed out already, it does not need to be a foreign ship; it could be a local ship—it could be a fishing ship.
I do not want to go on about this because the matters that I have been talking about have been discussed again and again. For the life of me I cannot see why you would want such legislation coming before this parliament when much more traditional legislation could well have achieved the purpose for which it was written. I think it is a tragedy—and I use that word advisedly—that we should have legislation such as this coming in and setting a precedent for others to use. I think it is a matter for pride on the part of the Senate that this chamber stopped this sort of legislation going through. In a certain sense I am not here talking in a party political way, but I am talking in a political way. I am talking of the balances that must be exercised by this chamber. I am talking about that sense of what is right and wrong that should permeate any legislative chamber, particularly this one. I am talking about the duty of the Senate to see that this sort of power, the power that indeed the Star Chamber would have been proud to possess—
—Oh!
—He says, `Oh!' Senator McGauran, I invite you to get up and show how this power is in any way limited in the ways that have been built up over the centuries in that fine tradition that English law has left us—and not only English law but also English tradition and English parliamentary history. This is a contradiction of that grand tradition. This is not the sort of bill, I suggest to you, Senator McGauran, that somebody like Sir Winston Churchill would have been proud to bring forward. It is not the sort of thing that he, who had a great appreciation of what the parliamentary process is all about, would have agreed to. I think this bill is perhaps an aberration—let us hope it was an aberration, something brought on in the crisis of the moment—a bill introduced in the context of a tension that hopefully has now ceased. If this sort of legislation is to come back, I hope it will come back in what has now become the traditional way—that is, in the way that legislation dealing with the Federal Police, the National Crime Authority or the Customs Service would be presented. The Migration Act gives lots of power to the immigration department and people within it, but nevertheless the legislation has within it many protections. I wanted to take the opportunity of going on record about this because I do think this was a very bad piece of legislation for the reasons I have already given.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-08-30,"—Earlier this month I had the privilege of being able to join the crew of HMAS Canberra during Operation Kakadu in Australia's northern waters. HMAS Canberra was commissioned in 1982 and is one of six guided missile frigates currently serving in our Navy. Around 186 officers and sailors work on the ship, and it carries antiship, antisubmarine and surface-to-air missiles, some of which have a range of over 100 kilometres. The ship also has the capacity to carry two Seahawk helicopters, one of which I travelled in during a medivac to Darwin.
I was fortunate enough to be one of the members and senators invited to join our defence forces, and two of my colleagues in the chamber here tonight, Senator Jacinta Collins and my colleague Senator Julian McGauran, have also taken part in this most interesting and valuable program.
On board HMAS Canberra, I was particularly impressed with the young women crew members. They represent a small percentage of the 2,000 women who currently serve in the Navy today. But, while they make up only 17.5 per cent of all sailors, women now comprise 23 per cent of the Navy's officer class. The number of female officers in the Navy is now growing rapidly, with nearly half of the Australian Defence Force Academy's intake of Navy officer cadets being female. But a particular challenge for all sections of the defence forces is to find ways to enable young women to remain involved in the defence forces during their early years of motherhood. I know this issue is a high priority with the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Chris Barrie, and I am confident that ways will be found to enable these women to combine work and family commitments. They are talented and very highly trained women.
I am particularly proud that our government continues to make such a significant contribution towards strengthening the role of our defence forces and supporting those who so courageously serve our country. In our last budget, we increased government spending on defence for 2001-02 by $500 million. Next year it will increase by $1 billion and by the end of the decade defence spending in cash terms will stand at $16 billion per year in today's dollars.
Defence clearly plays a significant role in our community. If measured in terms of annual revenue, the Department of Defence is the third largest organisation in the country, with revenues of $20.2 billion. Only the big Australian, BHP, and Coles Myer have greater revenues. If measured in terms of net assets, the defence department is the largest organisation in the country, with assets of $41 billion. Furthermore, including those in the reserves, Defence is our second largest Australian employer with over 88,000 people. Our Defence white paper is receiving great support among our service men and women. It provides for a $500 million boost this financial year and $1 billion boost next year.
HMAS Canberra, which I was fortunate enough to be assigned to, was undertaking Operation Kakadu along with HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Adelaide. We also had the good fortune to have a group of sea trainers on board, which gave me the opportunity to see a number of emergency procedures being undertaken. It meant that I was able to see what happens when a man goes overboard—when a sailor is lost at sea—either in the daytime or at night. I was particularly impressed with this procedure. I could not believe that the sailors were able to see this person in the water, particularly during the day, although it was much easier at night when the person had reflective tape on. I hasten to say that `Oscar' was not a human being but simply a mannequin taking part in the trials. I also had the opportunity to witness procedures for a fire on board and also witness how fuel is transferred at sea, when HMAS Westralia came alongside. It is a very precise and quite technical operation to move diesel fuel from one ship to another, and it was done, I might say, without spilling a drop.
As Senator McGauran has said in publicity for his week at boot camp in Queensland, there are a number of opportunities to take part in operations which we are often not accustomed to.
—I can just see you in boot camp!
—It is a long time since I have slept in a second storey bunk in a very small cabin, particularly when the access to the second storey bunk does not include a ladder.
—That is too much information.
—I was very admiring of the two young women who share one of these very small cabins: the loss of personal space and the need for tidiness and for everything to be secured when the ship is at sea really impressed me. Not only did I experience some quite unusual circumstances getting into the second storey bunk but sharing bathroom facilities was also something of a new experience for me, particularly when, at 6 o'clock in the morning, I went into what we call a bathroom and what they call in the Navy the `Heads' and met two very large young officers coming out of the showers wearing a very small amount of towelling.
—This is far too much information.
—This is not something that I am accustomed to in my normal life. The two young officers handled it a great deal better than I did, in the sense that they are of course much more accustomed to sharing the facilities with the female officers on a daily basis. It was something that I was less accustomed to, but it was handled with great dignity and aplomb. Senator Conroy, if you had been there, you would have been very proud of all concerned.
The women who serve in the Navy deserve great admiration. Quite apart from the work that they do—it is a very long and hard job with split shifts and night watch shifts—they also wear what Senator Collins and I have described as `utilitarian' clothing: that is, a very basic set of overalls and, most importantly, a very heavy pair of steel capped boots, not something that I am accustomed to wearing, let alone running in up and down stairways in emergency situations. I am very admiring of the women who are able to competently and confidently wear this uniform far better than I was able to do.
I must say I found the opportunity to serve at sea for, unfortunately, only a couple of days a really interesting and very different experience. I was fortunate enough to be at sea in the northern waters of Australia which were at the time very calm so there was no question of needing to worry about motion sickness and so on. It gave me a very interesting opportunity to experience a life which is very different from the life that we lead here in this place. I think it is something which all members and senators who have the opportunity should undertake if they can. I would also like to mention the visit that Senator Collins and I were able to undertake to NORCOM, the Northern Command base in Darwin, and the patrol boats that are based in Darwin, which are playing a very valuable role in protecting and guarding our coastline. In conclusion, I thank the Navy for the opportunity to work with them, as much as I was able to, for a few days just a couple of weeks ago. I particularly thank Commander Roger Boyce, the captain of HMAS Canberra, for his patience and generosity with his time and also Lieutenant Sam Jackman, who was our Navy contact. Senator Collins and I were very grateful for the opportunity to be briefed as well as we were on the protocols that we would expect to find on the ship.
