"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—The bills we are discussing cognately are the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007. I want to use the opportunity of the committee stage to address the small business bill. This bill implements changes to various tax acts to standardise the primary eligibility criteria for small business tax concessions. These changes will reduce the compliance costs for many Australian small businesses. They substantially simplify the tax law to make it easier for small business to determine eligibility for a number of concessions.
The object of the bill is to implement recommendations of the Taskforce on Reducing the Regulatory Burden on Business to make it simpler for small business to determine eligibility for some 12 small business tax concessions. It does this by establishing a single definition of a small business entity in schedule 1. The bill also implements several budget announcements.
Schedule 2 increases the goods and services tax accounting threshold applicable to small business tax obligations. Schedule 3 redefines the simplified tax system to include small business entities. Schedule 4 increases the capital gains tax asset threshold for small businesses. Schedule 5 extends the fringe benefits tax car parking exemption to small business entities. Schedule 6 extends the base assessment instalment income threshold for full self-assessment STS taxpayers from $1 million to $2 million. Schedule 7 extends the rollover relief available under the uniform capital allowance system.
The cost to revenue over the forward estimates years is $295 million. This bill implements the government’s new small business framework for small business entities, and makes the necessary amendments to various pieces of taxation legislation to implement the policy of the new small business framework. Fundamentally, this bill ensures that small business has one definition that applies across all taxation legislation.
Schedule 1 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide a more specific definition of small business entities, annual turnover, aggregated turnover and other related concepts. Schedule 2 amends the GST act relating to various GST turnover thresholds to enable a small business entity to access GST concessions of accounting for GST on a cash basis, annual apportionment of input tax credits for acquisitions and importations that are partly creditable, and paying GST by quarterly instalments and making consequential amendments.
Schedule 3 makes amendments to establish the new small business framework, replacing the term ‘STS taxpayers’ with ‘small business entities’. The tax concessions that are available to simplified tax system taxpayers under current law—namely, the simplified depreciation regime, the simplified trading stock regime and the immediate full deduction for prepaid expenses—are retained in the concessions under the small business framework.
Schedule 4 amends the RTAA 1997 to increase from $5 million to $6 million the capital gains maximum net assets threshold for an SBE to access CGT concessions. Schedule 5 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to enable an employer to get the FBT car parking exemption if the employer is either an SBE or has ordinary and statutory income of less than $10 million.
Schedule 6 amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 so that, for full assessment taxpayers, the base assessment income threshold is increased from $1 million to $2 million for entitlements to make quarterly PAYG instalments on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax. Schedule 7 extends the rollover relief available under the uniform capital allowance system to small business entities which choose to deduct amounts for depreciating assets under subdivision 328-D, and schedule 8 includes consequential amendments to tax law which arise from changes from the STS system to the small business framework.
This bill, like the taxation laws amendment bill No. 3, was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, but only one submission was received—from the Small Business Development Corporation of Western Australia. The SBDC is a very able body and it is located in my home state. It is a vibrant organisation which contributes to discussions on areas which impact on small business. It also keeps a watchful eye on newspapers and websites so that it knows when matters relating to small business are being discussed at a federal level. That is just as well, because there was only a five-day window between the advertising of this committee investigation and the closing date for submissions. The government is to be condemned for the consistent shortness of those processes. As I said in relation to the tax laws amendment bill No. 3, that time frame excludes those with limited resources or those with a lot on their plate from examining legislation and making a considered submission on it. The SBDC made it clear that they welcomed the changes proposed by the legislation, as it streamlined the taxation treatment for small business and defined exactly what constituted a small business entity.
The Australian Democrats support this legislation and the speed with which the government has dealt with industry concerns. However, it brings me back to a point I have made several times before: if the government can move swiftly on taxation reform which deals with small business, why can’t it move with just as much haste on reform of the Trade Practices Act for small business? I think it is because big business does not care about the former, but does care about the latter—and you are listening to them far too much on these matters.
It is now more than three years since the then Senate Economics References Committee produced its report entitled The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. In its response, the government did not accept that there was a need to amend section 46 of the Trade Practices Act in the way that small business advocates and as the majority of the committee recommended—and, tellingly, as the minority of Liberal senators themselves recommended. However, the Liberal senators’ minority report showed that there are sections of the coalition which do support amendments to the Trade Practices Act, and a number of those recommendations were accepted in the government’s response. I will point out again, as I have previously pointed out, that the author of the Liberal senators’ minority report is Senator George Brandis, who is an expert in the area of trade practices and who, as a legal practitioner, was heavily engaged in that field.
Over three years later, here we are still waiting—with only Senator Joyce on the coalition side showing any real concern. No wonder people are getting tired of this government’s slow response in this area. The Trade Practices Act should protect all business from anticompetitive conduct. The Democrats have never sought to protect competitors from competitive conduct. The Democrats and the small business sector, however, have been pointing out that anticompetitive conduct requires reforms. This has been a long campaign. Perhaps, at last, the government will follow up and adopt as good policy the recommendations in the report of the Senate economics committee, produced in March 2004, entitled The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. However, I see nothing in the legislation listed for these two weeks that would indicate that the necessary reforms will be brought forward.
In their minority report, the Liberal senators said that they were persuaded of the need for legislative reform of section 46. They pointed out the disproportionately high number of unsuccessful cases that were prosecuted under section 46. And, since then, everyone knows that the ACCC have shown a real reluctance to pursue section 46 litigation because of their lack of success in the past and because of an inadequate law. But the coalition has continued to sit on its hands. Academic and small business experts complain that this section, which relates to predatory pricing, is weak. They are right. In section 46 cases such as Melway, Boral and Rural Press, the courts have made it clear that this key part of competition law is poorly worded, does not achieve its aim and is ineffective.
If the government would implement even the minority recommendations of the Senate economics committee, it would strengthen section 46 by defining what ‘a substantial degree of power in a market’ means and it would also clarify the elements of ‘take advantage’. The courts would then also be able to consider the recoupment of losses in determining whether there has been predatory pricing. This is one key to ensuring that consumers, particularly those in regional and vulnerable communities, are protected from larger corporations pricing themselves to destroy small competitors and then ramping up prices as soon as the competition has been removed or, alternatively, holding a pricing regime which in itself acts as a barrier to the entry of new competitors. In that respect, I was interested to hear Alan Jones, on Channel 9 this morning, again pointing out the dangers of the pricing behaviour of some major retail corporations.
So while the Prime Minister is banging on about giving the ACCC the powers it needs to combat price gouging by petrol companies, he should also turn his mind to this important issue which will have an impact on petrol pricing and which has a broader effect to the advantage of small business. While I am on petrol prices, I point out that the Prime Minister was blindsided by a somewhat headstrong Senator Brandis, who, as the coalition chair of the Senate committee reporting on petrol prices, decided to run the committee rather than chair it. He would not accept the caution that Senator O’Brien and I were urging—that petrol prices deserved a different look and that the ACCC perhaps needed stronger enforcement or investigative powers. Neither would he accept that the ACCC had insufficient means to get behind the corporate veil on petrol pricing. That is a very different tune from the tune the Prime Minister and other members of the coalition are now singing. With respect to competition law and any regulatory powers, it is important to get behind the corporate veil and to examine these matters at the coalface.
The Australian Democrats are supporting the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007, which makes tax planning a little easier for small business. But far more important is trade practices reform. The coalition should either get on with it or, instead, let the next government do the job. In conclusion, with those introductory remarks, my question, through the chair, to the parliamentary secretary, who is on duty today, is: when will the government do something about reforming the Trade Practices Act for small business? What is your agenda? What is your timetable and will that timetable be overtaken by an early election?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-06-13,"—Before the minister concludes, I want to respond, in part with some further comments on the withholding tax issue, to the unexpected late intervention of Senator Ronaldson last evening and his so-called contribution on this particular matter concerning the Senate economics committee. A number of aspects concern me in terms of the accuracy and lack of analysis presented by Senator Ronaldson, which I will come to shortly. One of the good aspects, at least, of his intervention and the debate that occurred yesterday was that there actually was a genuine debate around an alternative Labor policy, as presented in the second reading amendment.
—It is a rare occurrence!
—It is a relatively rare occurrence. It is relatively rare that senators actually come in, having listened to contributions, and respond from different perspectives and analyse the issues to some extent, rather than by way of a set piece contribution to the debate. To that extent, it was welcome. Senator Watson, in his contribution, at least conceded that the Labor policy, on his initial analysis, had some appeal and some attraction. Labor’s policy is to reduce the withholding tax treatment of 30 per cent down to 15 per cent to make Australia more attractive in terms of funds management. But Senator Watson went on to criticise Labor’s proposal and its policy, after being initially attracted to it. I am not quoting him here, but the basis of his argument was that there should be equitable tax treatment of the different forms of investment. If we were to adopt Senator Watson’s premise, we would not have the concessional tax treatment of superannuation, for example. If we were to adopt the logic of his argument against Labor’s proposal on the withholding tax, you would tax everything at the same rate with no concessionality at all. That is an interesting theory from Senator Watson, but in practice it would totally cut across the views on the tax concessional treatment of superannuation that he has so rightly expressed. So I would suggest that, whilst Senator Watson’s contribution in opposition to Labor’s proposal is an interesting economic theory, in reality and in practice tax concessional treatment is used in a whole range of areas in Australia to provide a range of incentives in public policy areas to address what are identified as weaknesses.
I thought the intervention from Senator Ronaldson was the more interesting—and indeed the less accurately analysed piece of disinformation, which is frankly how I would describe it. He referred to the specific example of Japan given by the Labor leader Mr Rudd. I will not say that he did this deliberately—far be it from me to allege that he deliberately misconstrued the example of Japan. The example of Japan was presented by Kevin Rudd in the context of Japan’s treatment of these sort of investments.
—Methinks you protesteth too much, Senator
—That is seven per cent, Senator Ronaldson. The point the Labor leader was making was that Japan’s tax treatment of seven per cent is considerably below Australia’s treatment of 30 per cent and, therefore, there is obviously a great incentive to use Japan, rather than Australia, as a financial centre for the purposes of this form of investment. Labor policy is supported by IFSA, Investment and Financial Services Association Limited, and the property management association. This is not a policy dreamt up by Labor in isolation; it is a policy that has been actively encouraged by a range of experts in the funds management area. We have to narrow the difference in the tax treatment. Labor agrees with that policy. Indeed, as the Treasurer said, ‘This is nothing more than rewarding foreigners with the hard-earned tax dollars of Australians.’ Labor’s costing is $30 million, and I will get to the costing in a moment. I will also get to Mr Costello’s contribution on the costing in a moment—a view which, presumably, Senator Ronaldson shares.
In the context of a tax incentive, $30 million is very modest indeed when compared to a whole range of other tax incentives that we have in our system. Labor argues that it is well worth paying this price if it adds to the attractiveness, particularly in Asia, of building Australia as a centre for financial services. It is a particularly modest price in the context of these outrageous advertising propaganda campaigns that we are currently seeing. In the context of the government’s so-called advertising of industrial relations or superannuation changes, $30 million pales in comparison. So $30 million is a modest price for Australian taxpayers to pay to change the withholding tax regime to make Australia more internationally competitive in this very important area and to build on Australia’s future as a financial funds management centre.
I turn now to the issue of the costing. The night that the Labor leader, Mr Rudd, gave his budget in reply speech and announced this Labor policy, the Treasurer was obviously listening. He gave a doorstop interview immediately afterwards. He said that Mr Rudd had got his costing of $30 million wrong and that in fact the costing was $100 million. How on earth could the Treasurer, having stayed until the end of Mr Rudd’s speech, get a costing on a Labor policy which he had only just heard announced? That is if indeed he got any costing done at all. I suspect he got no costing. I suspect the Treasurer made up a figure when he went out to do his doorstop, because there simply was not time for him to get an accurate figure in that five minutes when he walked from the House of Representatives chamber to do the doorstop. As it turns out, we understand that he had a costing—but it was a costing based on zero tax, not 15 per cent. He gave an inaccurate costing based on a false analysis of Labor’s policy commitment. It is Mr Costello who should fess up to misleading the Australian people with the inaccurate costing he gave. So not only was Senator Ronaldson incorrect last night in his critique but, even worse, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, gave an inaccurate costing shortly after Mr Rudd announced the policy.
To conclude my remarks on this issue, in the debate yesterday I did refer to the impressive level of savings in funds management in Australia. I indicated that, in terms of total assets under management, Australia, with a shade over $1 trillion under management, was fourth largest behind the USA, Luxembourg and France. That is particularly impressive if you compare us to other significant economies—for example, the UK has about $950 billion, Hong Kong has about $760 billion and Japan has a shade over $700 billion. If you look at those levels of savings, Australia does very well. It punches above its weight in terms of funds management.
As I indicated earlier, Labor was supported in its policy approach by both IFSA and the property association—and for good reason. With the figures that I have given, Australia should be proud of its funds management financial services sector. It is substantially underpinned by compulsory superannuation, which the current Prime Minister described as ‘silly’ when he opposed it back in the late 1980s. Given the way the Treasurer, Mr Costello, carries on about compulsory super, you would think he had actually introduced it. But he actually opposed it as well, and he used a much rougher description than ‘silly’. Anyway, that is the historical context.
We should be proud of our funds management financial services sector in Australia. There is a need to encourage Australia to export more of those services and, with such a significant funds management sector, to be at the very least a regional centre in Asia—if not because we have the fourth largest funds management sector in the world by volume then because flowing from that are a range of other services that can be exported as part of a total package. These include asset management; investment consulting; platform delivery; custodial services; financial services; IT and software; actuarial services; legal and accounting services; compliance and risk monitoring; investment performance; research and reporting; education and training services; portfolio administration services; and advice distribution. Australia leads the world in many of these areas. Labor’s vision is one of greater encouragement to these sectors of our financial services sector, exporting into Asia in particular, and the expertise that we have in these areas off the back of the sheer size of our fund management system and off the back of Labor’s introduction of compulsory superannuation—and we see it as a good thing. We have a vision of people working in wealth management and its various aspects, where incomes are higher than average and where there is real jobs growth over time. We should be proud of it and be encouraging its export.
As I have mentioned, the advantages with Asia are obvious. We have a shared time zone and, at the moment, we are the largest funds management centre in the Asian region. But there is also significant economic growth in China and India, for example, and significant reform in terms of their legal financial services sector. They will need the sorts of services that I have just referred to in which Australia has ample expertise. My final point is that most of the Asian countries have redesigned or are in the process of redesigning their pension funds systems and, here again, Australia has an obvious advantage.
Labor is proud of the policy it has presented to encourage the development of Australia as a funds management centre in the Asian region and to encourage exports. That is what its policy on withholding tax is designed to do. It is a modest cost—certainly not the cost the Treasurer has claimed—in the context of other tax concessions in our system. It is well worth that cost because of the long-term benefits it will bring to this expanding and very important sector of the Australian economy.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-06-13,"—I am very grateful that Senator Sherry been requested by his leader to come in here today and defend his untenable position of overnight. It is always nice to get positive reinforcement of the fact that you are actually making the appropriate comments. Senator Sherry may or may not be aware—I would be a bit surprised if he is not—that his esteemed leader addressed the IFSA national conference in August 2006. I do not know whether you are aware of that, Senator Sherry. You are not responding, so I assume you were not aware of that.
—I am coughing.
—I would be coughing, too. You have obviously read this again. I would be coughing—in fact, I would be gagging—at your leader’s total incompetence. In that speech to IFSA in August last year, the opposition leader ran the industry line. He talked about lower rates and he talked about Japan, and he indicated the lines that were run by the industry. So do you think it would realistically be any surprise to the Treasurer, after the budget in reply speech, not to have the sorts of costings that had been floated by the industry, which had clearly written parts of the opposition leader’s speech? This was not some new announcement in the budget in reply. This was not the Treasurer, having heard the budget in reply, walking out and making some comments on it. In August 2006, the opposition leader had floated this and had talked about lower rates, so of course the Treasurer would have had some costings for these matters well before the budget in reply. Senator Sherry’s leader had floated this and some potential outcomes, so of course it was common knowledge what some of the options were and, therefore, it would be common knowledge what the costings would be at various rates—this was 2006.
I will go back to this and pose this question, through you, Madam Temporary Chairman: if greater fund inflows are going to lead to an expanded market, why is Japan lifting its rate from seven per cent to 15 per cent? Why would this be? I pose that question because this is the premise that underpinned the Leader of the Opposition’s argument in relation to this matter. I will read part of his speech again. You have got to have a look at it, Senator Sherry. This is a very important stuff.
—I’m going to respond to this.
—I will read it again. This is in the context of a reduced rate. It says:
greater investment would also flow into Australia for Australian funds managers to invest globally. For example, a Japanese resident could place their funds for management with an Australian funds manager for investment in an appropriate third country market; ...
As we discussed last night, there is no witholding tax associated with that sort of investment, so how the Leader of the Opposition could be so badly advised as to underpin his argument with a false premise is beyond me. As I said last night, I am prepared to accept that he had not sought Senator Sherry’s advice. I am prepared to accept that Senator Sherry, given his level of experience in this area, could not possibly have advised the Leader of the Opposition in relation to that speech, because it is only in relation to Australian sourced income. Senator Murray knows that, Senator Webber knows that and I am sure that Senator Sherry does as well.
The other acknowledgement that we have had today—finally—is that the Labor Party proposal is a tax cut for foreigners without any ability, because it is an across-the-board proposal, for Australia to negotiate appropriate circumstances that would be in our national interests. Senator Sherry knows full well why this is potentially a tax cut for foreigners: because if they are taxed at a rate higher than that 15 per cent we are effectively subsidising them. So we have the Leader of the Opposition playing Father Christmas to foreign treasuries with the hard-earned dollars of the working men and women of Australia without any ability at all to have those negotiated on the basis of mutual benefit for us if appropriate—because this is an across-the-board flat rate with no ability for us to utilise this for our mutual benefit. It is nothing else but a tax cut for foreigners, from which we are unable to extract any potential benefit. I want to read out paragraph 3.27 of the report:
... Treasury representatives also questioned whether the 30 per cent rate is uncompetitive against international rates, stating that a number of other countries had rates that were similar, although rates may be lower where a double tax treaty is in place:—
So that is where we have negotiated a double tax treaty for the benefit of Australians, as opposed to a flat rate on which there is no potential negotiation in our national interest. I quote a Treasury official:
Just commenting on the international comparisons, I think what has been quoted this morning is 15 per cent. Looking at different structures overseas, you are not always comparing like with like. We have different organisational structures, different regulatory structures. When we look at the withholding tax arrangements we find that in Canada there is a 25 per cent withholding tax on foreign distributions but it is reduced in double tax treaties, generally down to 15 per cent. In the United States there is a 30 per cent withholding tax on distributions from estate investment trusts but it is reduced to 15 per cent for portfolio investments under its double tax treaties; so they start off much higher. Similarly, in Korea there is a 27.5 per cent withholding tax but they reduce it down in their double tax treaties. Japan has a seven per cent rate but it is scheduled to increase to 15 per cent after 1 April 2008. It only applies to listed property trusts. For unlisted property trusts it is 20 per cent. In Singapore, listed REIT is subject to 10 per cent, but this is temporary; it is scheduled to return to 20 per cent on 18 February 2010. So I think we have to be careful of these international comparisons.
Further on, in a reference to Japan, there is this:
On 1 April 2007 it was only a temporary seven per cent. It is going to 15 per cent on 1 April 2008. As I say, it only applies to listed property trusts. For unlisted trusts it is 20 per cent. Like all things, in the case of Japan if a foreign investor owns more than five per cent of a listed REIT then any capital gain is subject to Japanese tax at 30 per cent.
So all of these examples, whether it is Canada or elsewhere, are talking about reductions in the context of double tax treaties. They are negotiations on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, so there is some mutual benefit. But the Australian Labor Party’s response to this is to have an across-the-board totally non-negotiable rate. This is where Senator Sherry and the Labor Party have confused priorities, and you have regrettably jumped and taken the bait from industry in relation to this matter without thinking twice about it. You have taken the bait to the extent that the Leader of the Opposition, the would-be Prime Minister of this country, does not understand the basics of this issue. It is all very well to run TV ads and have a multitude of focus groups talking about your fiscal conservatism, and at the first hurdle in relation to something as basic as this you do not even understand the principles of it. This is not an economically conservative Leader of the Opposition. This is a man who has again shown his utter inexperience and inability to understand basic economic concepts. He has shown his inability to make sure that when he makes a comment, particularly in relation to something as important as this where we are effectively giving away taxpayers’ dollars subsidising international treasuries, he has done the work required to substantiate a policy position.
We saw a classic example of this again last week where he rushed out and made announcements in relation to further troops into Afghanistan. If you want to be the Prime Minister of this country and if you hold yourself out to be the alternative Prime Minister of this country, then you are required to have the policy integrity that enables you to make policy decisions and policy comments on the basis of fact and not fiction. If the Australian Labor Party wants to run their program between now and the next election relying on focus groups and grabs from Sky News, then so be it. But you should have no expectation at all that you will be supported by the Australian people if that is the way you choose to conduct yourselves between now and the federal election. The Australian people will quite rightly say that if you are not prepared to do the hard work now, if you are prepared to rely on focus groups, then you do not deserve the opportunity that may be presented to you. If you are not prepared to do the hard work now, why would anyone have any confidence at all that you are prepared to do the hard work in government? Why would they have any confidence in that at all? Senator Sherry will probably jump up and say, ‘Well, this was just a minor aberration.’ Senator Sherry’s leader now has a litany of so-called minor aberrations, and this has gone from a number of small creeks to a large river of incompetence—a large river of incompetence from someone who is not prepared to do the hard yards and who is not prepared to ensure that those underneath him are doing the hard yards. And, for that, he stands condemned.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I want to briefly respond. I do not want to take the time that Senator Ronaldson did because I do not want to engage in the verbosity, the repetitiveness and the general deliberately muddled presentation that Senator Ronaldson gave us just now and last night. Let me make a couple of key points in response. He alleges I was coughing in angst and shock and horror over Mr Rudd’s alleged mistakes. I have got a medical condition—it had nothing to do with the contention of Senator Ronaldson. Secondly, he accuses Mr Rudd of being motivated by focus groups and Sky News and of rushing policy. Well, on Senator Ronaldson’s own presentation of his arguments, the Labor leader, Mr Rudd, has not rushed this one. He raised this issue at the IFSA conference in August 2006, from which Senator Ronaldson quotes, and then he announced the specific detail of the Labor policy in May of this year. So it is hardly an example of a rushed policy, a muddled policy, a policy that was not adequately researched or a policy that relied on focus groups. We have the general populist position of Senator Ronaldson, and I look forward to him advancing this in other tax debates. Senator Ronaldson, the Liberal government and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, are opposed to tax concessional treatment or tax cuts for foreigners. Well, I would like to see him apply that principle to all legislation that comes before the Senate, because that has not been the position of Senator Ronaldson or the government in the past.
—Capital gains.
—Capital gains, as Senator Murray, I am sure, is going to make the point. Senator Ronaldson came in here and voted for a capital gains tax cut for foreigners, and he is opposed to foreigners’ tax cuts. Senator Ronaldson and this government continue to support the tax concessional superannuation treatment for foreigners who come to this country and work temporarily. There are plenty of examples of tax cuts for foreigners that you and Labor have voted for because the policy presented at the time justified the cost. That is what Labor argues here. The modest cost of $30 million justifies the cost in terms of the incentive and the growth and the impact on the growth of Australia’s very important financial services sector. I have highlighted that in my previous contributions. They are the essential issues that we have continued to debate.
I am looking forward to the parliamentary secretary’s contribution because he actually allowed this debate to go on last night. He could have said, ‘We want to get the bill,’ last night, but you dashed in and gave what I consider to be a most unhelpful and inaccurate intervention to which we have had to respond.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—I want to recap the three main propositions which we are dealing with in respect of this debate. The first is whether a flat and final rate is better than a nominal rate, the second is what the rate should be and the third is whether there is a cost or gain to revenue. The problem for the government is that it has not dealt with the fundamental proposition that a flat and final rate is more attractive to investors than a nominal rate. The reason for this is that, on the basis of a nominal rate, to get a reduced rate from the 30 per cent you have to put in tax returns and you have to structure. It could take 12 to 18 months before those matters are resolved, and there are complexity and cost consequences to that. My view is that, in these circumstances of investment in a fast-moving capital market by foreign investors and Australian investors, a flat and final rate is probably the preferable way to go. That is the first proposition. I think the government has made a mistake in staying with the nominal rate.
The second issue which Senator Ronaldson focused on—and indeed Labor focused on—is what the rate should be. The 30 per cent nominal withholding tax rate is the same in numerical terms as the 30 per cent corporate tax rate. You would ask the question automatically of whether, if there were a reduction to 15 per cent as Labor proposes, there would be a capacity for arbitrage. I asked that question at the hearing and the evidence was that there was no capacity for arbitrage. So your next question is: what is the rate that will make us most competitive? It does seem that in this is fast-moving capital market—which is adjusting—15 per cent would be at the upper end that would make us competitive. I think Labor has a valid economic and competitive case.
The third area which Senator Ronaldson quite rightly draws attention to is the matter of the cost or gain to revenue. One set of estimates is that the cost to revenue would be $30 million; the Treasury estimate is that it would be $100 million.
—On zero.
—Never mind—on zero or whatever; I take the interjection of Senator Sherry. The point that I want to make is that Treasury has not provided the real figures to the coalition, to the crossbenches or to the official opposition. There are no costings available to us. The assumptions they have made and the costings basis they have provided are inadequate to say the least. In fact, they denied us the opportunity to get those figures. Therefore, Treasury is asking us to take on trust the cost or gain to revenue that we would look for—in this case it is a cost of $100 million. I think extremely highly of Treasury officials. The people I have met are people of great capacity, but I remind the chamber that these same Treasury officials got the surplus wrong in 10 out of 11 budgets and the average error they make on the surplus is $4.5 billion over the budget estimate. Their ability to estimate costs is not infallible, and, frankly, I will not accept that $100 million figure as valid until such time as I am able to see the assumptions, the workings and the base figures. Unfortunately, neither Senator Ronaldson, Senator Sherry nor I have got these because Treasury refuse to give them to us.
The question was raised as to whether we are subsidising foreign treasuries. Certainly, the IFSA people are not recommending subsidising anyone and nor is the property institute. The question of attracting investment does sometimes mean that you have to incur a cost. Senator Sherry was quite right in reminding the chamber that Senator Ronaldson, Senator Sherry and I have voted many times to give a cost advantage to foreigners where it is in Australia’s interest or where we conceive it to be in Australia’s interest. So that is not a very good argument. The question is: would you be reducing the rate to produce a cost unnecessarily? In other words, would you generate the level of investment that we are now generating and get the higher tax return anyway—which would be to your benefit? That is a good argument, but the evidence put to us is that the way in which the market is moving means that Australia must anticipate that it is going to lose the power to pull in investment if it retains the figure of 30 per cent. That is why the 15 per cent is considered to be a reasonable target; it is at the upper end of the competitive rates which are operating worldwide. The economic theory, as people would understand, behind the behavioural responses you are seeking in these matters is that, if you lower the tax rate, you then produce higher investment and you will get a greater tax return. It is a matter of judgment as to whether this would occur.
The last point I would make with respect to double tax treaties is this: the difficulty with the double tax treaties that are already in law is that they do not all cover this particular field. They might not cover off this field, so you might have to go back and renegotiate these elements of the tax treaty to accommodate this particular policy. I am not sure how many tax treaties cover off this field or how many prospectively do. I think we have two more tax treaties coming in. It would be interesting to establish—and perhaps the parliamentary secretary could take this on notice because he might not have it to hand—just how many of the double tax treaties that are in existence already accommodate the proposition that a lower rate for the withholding tax in investments will pertain. I suspect not all of them do, but I just do not know, and I would like to have the answer to that question.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-06-13,"—I will answer the last question first, Senator Murray. My advice is that none of the Australian double tax treaties take account of a reduced rate so the rate of 30 per cent applies in all circumstances. In respect of your initial question regarding the Trade Practices Act, I will have to refer that to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to get some advice. I do not have that information available to me at this point, particularly as we are not necessarily talking about the Trade Practices Act here this morning. But I am happy to refer that to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to get some advice in relation to your specific question in relation to the Trade Practices Act, recognising your interest in that particular matter.
There is probably a lot that I could say in relation to the debate that has gone forward here this morning but I will not say too much. I will note that, given the comment that we are in the top four in this area in the world—and that the United States has a 30 per cent withholding rate and France has a 25 per cent withholding rate—I am not sure that the rate is necessarily one of the key drivers. I do understand that the industry puts that forward as a key argument but I think there are other factors in play and note that, in respect of the costings, there is a very wide range. I think the Labor Party’s initial costing was $15 million—that was mentioned in the budget address-in-reply—and that has now morphed to $30 million. The basis of that depends on the gearing assumptions that are placed in the calculations. I think that gives an indication that there is a fairly broad range for the basis of the calculations. I thank senators for their contributions.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-06-13,"—Labor supports the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. The bill seeks to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by appropriating additional funding of $26.1 million over the period of the 2007 and 2008 calendar years for Indigenous students in the school, vocational education and training, and higher education sectors. This will expand the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. It also provides infrastructure funding for boarding school facilities and extra funding to cover the conversion of Community Development Employment Projects into ongoing jobs in the education sector.
Approximately one in four 15- to 19-year-old young Indigenous people live in remote areas. The proportion of Indigenous people living in remote areas who reach year 12 is about half that of their metropolitan peers. Given that only one in 10 actually completes year 12, you would not be surprised to learn that Labor would support additional resources being spent to encourage higher levels of attainment in education for Indigenous people. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program will expand by about 860 places over the next four years. The program currently provides assistance to around 600 Indigenous people from remote areas, with access to a broad range of training and employment opportunities on offer at major regional centres.
The program’s focus is on accredited training options across a range of occupations, and post-school work and study opportunities in nursing, teaching, accountancy and business management. The bill also provides for an increase in the number of scholarships available through the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. The budget increases the scholarships by 750 over four years. This will bring the total number of the scholarships to about 1,000. Also, funding of $14.1 million over two years is being made available under the bill to fund infrastructure for existing boarding schools catering for Indigenous students. In addition, funding of $5.3 million will be made available to convert—where government and non-government education providers agree—Community Development Employment Project places into ongoing jobs in the education sector.
Labor believes that these measures will go some small way towards lifting the educational attainment levels of Indigenous Australians. One would expect that this would in turn lift the employment rate for Indigenous Australians. However, it has to be acknowledged—and I am sure it is acknowledged widely within this chamber—that these measures are grossly inadequate. At all levels of educational attainment, we see Indigenous Australians falling behind the rest of the nation. According to the Higher education report 2005, which is produced by the government’s very own Department of Education, Science and Training, the number of Indigenous students attending Australia’s higher education institutions decreased by 5.9 per cent in 2005. The report noted that Indigenous commitments particularly in nursing, initial teacher training and medical practitioner courses had also declined. The total commencements in these and related courses had declined overall in 2005 by eight per cent. So, at a time when we need more Indigenous students undertaking professional programs to service remote communities, we actually have fewer people taking up those educational opportunities. DEST admitted in its Higher education report 2005 on page 21 that this was part of an ongoing trend. It states:
Continuing declines in Indigenous involvement in higher education will perpetuate disadvantages experienced by Indigenous Australians and hinder their full participation in Australia’s economic and social development.
The report acknowledged that these continuing declines will perpetuate disadvantage and inequality in this country. While this situation in higher education is a national shame, it is worse in other parts of the education sector. There are far too many Indigenous children who continue to be unable to read, write and count at even a most basic level. Indigenous children fall further and further behind the longer they stay at school. Fewer Indigenous students meet the year 5 and year 7 benchmarks in literacy and numeracy than meet the year 3 benchmarks. In 2005, fewer Indigenous children in years 5 and 7 met basic literacy and numeracy benchmarks than their older brothers and sisters did in 2002.
Poor educational attainment levels have a direct impact on employment prospects and on general health and wellbeing. So it is somewhat telling that Indigenous unemployment levels are many times higher than the national record unemployment lows that this government talks about at every opportunity. If we take, for instance, the Elizabeth area of North Adelaide, Indigenous unemployment is as high as 34 per cent. In Macquarie Fields in Sydney, Indigenous unemployment is 30 per cent.
The same is not true everywhere. Many Indigenous communities are close to booming in terms of the mining industry, for instance. We should recognise the good that has been done in that sector to improve the job prospects for Indigenous Australians—and I do acknowledge it, particularly in the north-west of Western Australia. The Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining report into Indigenous employment in the Australian minerals industry highlights the steps taken to date in this area. It points to the benefits for our society, our nation and our industry from taking a long-term view not just towards the provision of employment opportunities to Indigenous Australians but also towards working with local communities to address the root causes of Indigenous socioeconomic problems.
The key issues are education, health and poverty. Those three factors are intimately linked together. I would say, therefore, that a great deal more needs to be done in terms of our society’s claims to be democratic. Unless these critical issues of education and health are addressed, Indigenous people, especially those living in remote and rural communities, are likely to remain a marginal and largely unskilled labour force. This is why I say that much more needs to be done in economic development and in providing opportunities for Indigenous people to fully participate in this country. A country such as ours that locks out so many of its citizens cannot claim to be fully democratic. This is the most obvious and most graphic indicator of neglect and disadvantage that this country faces.
I turn now to statements made in recent times by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma. In 2005, he noted:
What data exists suggest that we have seen only slow improvements in some areas ... and no progress on others over the past decade. The gains have been hard fought. But they are too few. And the gains made are generally not of the same magnitude [as] the gains experienced by the non-Indigenous population, with the result that they have had a minimal impact on reducing the inequality gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians.
The percentage of Indigenous Australians under the age of 10 is more than double that of the rest of the Australian population. Labor recognises the fundamental importance of investing in a child’s early years—and this applies to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. However, this does not diminish the importance of providing continuous education and learning opportunities throughout life. Indeed, lifelong learning has many benefits, and this bill goes some way towards acknowledging that, but it falls short of where we need to be as a nation. Labor recognises the social and economic imperatives for lifting the education standards of all Australians, particularly Indigenous Australians. As a Commonwealth, we have to assess those things that we did in the past as well as where we are at today.
There are some things that, on the ground, we know work in practice; however, it requires a long-term bipartisan approach from this parliament to ensure that they are effective. It is in that context that the Leader of the Opposition spoke only a week ago, on the 40th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, on the need to set new national bipartisan goals to close the gap between black and white Australia. It requires goals that are achievable and measurable and fulfil the spirit of the referendum held some 40 years ago. Mr Rudd has made it perfectly clear that Labor is committed to following those bipartisan goals, including the elimination of the 17-year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation. Labor is committed to at least halving the rate of Indigenous infant mortality within a decade. Further, Labor is committed to at least halving the mortality rate of Indigenous children under five and to doing so within a decade. Labor is also committed to halving within 10 years the difference in the rate of Indigenous students who fail to meet the reading, writing and numeracy benchmarks for years 3, 5 and 7.
Labor are committed to meeting these goals and a range of other health and family initiatives. We argue that education is the key plank to achieving these objectives. Under Labor, all Indigenous four-year-olds will be eligible to receive 15 hours per week of government funded early learning programs for a minimum of 40 weeks a year. Labor will provide $16.9 million over four years to support the rollout of the Australian Early Development Index in every Australian primary school. This will be adapted to establish a culturally appropriate and nationally consistent means of addressing key aspects of Indigenous children’s early development that are central to the readiness for learning at school.
Labor will ensure that every Indigenous child has an individual learning plan based on his or her needs, which will be updated twice a year for every year of schooling up to the age of 10. It is that sort of personal attention that is needed to address the gross inequalities. Labor will spend $34.5 million over four years on the provision of professional development to teachers to equip them to complete these learning plans. Through their children’s teachers, parents will have access to these plans so they can be part of their children’s learning improvements. Labor will expand intensive literacy programs and develop a new intensive numeracy program to help underachieving students catch up with the rest of their class. Literacy and numeracy are the building blocks upon which each and every individual builds his or her participation in society in respect of their capacity to work and to lead a healthy and active life.
Labor want to halve the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students’ performance in reading, writing and numeracy within a decade. We are setting ourselves very tough targets, which is the only way we can drive reform in these areas. Labor will provide $21.9 million over four years to expand intensive literacy and numeracy programs in our schools. As part of this commitment, a new intensive numeracy program will be developed and implemented. Labor support measures to lift educational retention rates and to assist those most in need to help themselves.
Labor believe strongly that more can and must be done and that the Commonwealth has a critical role to play. It is insufficient to look at only one aspect of Indigenous Australia. We need to take a global perspective. After years of neglect, Indigenous Australians have manifold issues that require a comprehensive approach. Education is crucial—and this begins in a child’s early years—to building the foundation stones for a successful life. Health is another crucial issue, and more must be done to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. That is why Labor support the second reading amendment that commits to the goals I outlined earlier. I would like to take this opportunity to move the second reading amendment. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate commits to the following goals:
         (a)    to eliminate the 17-year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation, so that every Indigenous child has the same educational and life opportunities as any other child;
         (b)    to at least halve the difference in the rate of Indigenous students at years 3, 5 and 7 who fail to meet reading, writing and numeracy benchmarks within 10 years;
         (c)    to at least halve the mortality rate of Indigenous children aged under five within a decade; and
         (d)    a long-term bipartisan national commitment to work with Indigenous Australians towards achieving these goals, and overcome generational disadvantage”.
I commend the bill and the second reading amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I rise to make a few brief comments on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. I do have a particular interest in this bill, as I have travelled regularly throughout the Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne and Goldfields regions of Western Australia since 1979. In this time I have met so many wonderful Indigenous people who are well aware of the challenges their communities face in finding a way forward for their young people. Their words have left a lasting impression on me and they motivate my comments today. The purpose of this bill is to appropriate additional funding, and to expand on and improve the options and facilities available to Australia’s young Indigenous people.
In my home state of Western Australia, there are no fewer than 289 remote Indigenous communities. As a Labor senator from Western Australia, I am very much aware of the conditions and challenges faced by many young Indigenous people in these communities. Last week I travelled once again through the Kimberley region of Western Australia and spent time in seven remote Indigenous communities. When debating this bill in the other place, my Labor colleagues made the crucial point that goals and targets that are set must be realistic and achievable within a generation, and Labor calls on the government to give a genuine commitment to overcoming Indigenous disadvantage.
I speak today in favour of this bill, but I do not believe that this bill demonstrates a genuine commitment to overcome Indigenous disadvantage. I remind honourable senators that we in Australia are smack bang in the middle of a massive economic boom driven by a global demand for our mining and resources commodities. The tragic irony that we cannot under any circumstances ignore is that a significant source of our current national wealth is the land, and on that land is where the most disadvantaged members of our community have lived for thousands of years. Furthermore, it is amongst these people, living on that land, that we see the highest mortality rates, the highest poverty rates and the lowest educational attainment in this country.
And what has this government done for the traditional owners of that land at a time of great economic growth? I will tell you what it has done. It has made a one-off pre-election promise to beef up programs that have not yet even been the subject of a publicly available evaluation. More so than ever before, the Commonwealth government has had the opportunity to enable Indigenous communities to move out of the cycle of poverty and disadvantage and to create economic sustainability. But, sadly, it has not seized that opportunity. Even worse, the government has adopted a CBD mentality for Indigenous affairs. Middle-class, city-centric views are not the answer. Creating expectation on the journey toward a meaningful future then aborting the trip halfway through is not the answer.
I acknowledge that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has taken a step in the right direction by bringing this bill into the parliament, but sadly it is nothing new. It simply looks to be an extension of funding for existing programs that we are not even sure are of lasting value. We as senators have an obligation to meticulously examine the programs and goals set out in this bill with a view to whether they will deliver something meaningful for young Indigenous people. There is no doubt about it: the Commonwealth programs at the heart of this bill create enormous expectations of participating young Indigenous people in their communities. Yet you get the impression that the Howard government thinks that, by sponsoring these sorts of programs, young Indigenous people will then take over the burden and pressure of leading the way for others in their community. The expectation is that these young people will solve the problems that the government has consistently failed to. There is no indication that the government is entering into a meaningful partnership with young Indigenous people to advance the quality of life, health and economic wellbeing of their communities—and that, to my mind, is an abject betrayal of an entire generation of young Indigenous people.
What I want to know is: what is the government’s expectation of young Indigenous people after funding has been expended through these programs? Where will the government be when these young people return to their communities to face the real-life challenges? You could not expect to have a senior Howard government minister spending any serious time in a remote Indigenous community. After all, it is a bit hard in the desert to find the pristine white robe and the matching fluffy white slippers that may come with a booking at the Sheraton, let alone a poolside bar to sip almond daiquiris from. Instead, you are confronted with the struggle and despair that is born out of two centuries of dispossession.
In the last 11 years, there has been a real opportunity for change and for the government to achieve constructive reconciliation. Instead, the Prime Minister has managed to wash away a taste for reconciliation left by the previous Labor government. In completing this manoeuvre, the Prime Minister has done it with the same ease as gargling Listerine to mask a cheap wine—or, for the benefit of senators opposite, gargling red wine to mask the taste of Listerine. From my experience, as recently as last week, the programs that the bill before us seeks to expand are failing young Indigenous people and more broadly failing Indigenous communities.
Senators have a right to know whether there was any consultation with Indigenous communities before this bill was brought into the parliament. Sadly, I suspect there was not, particularly as the results of an evaluation of the programs to be expanded by the bill are absent from the explanatory memorandum. The government claims that the additional funding it is now seeking to appropriate will be used to convert Community Development Employment Projects, otherwise known as CDEP, program places into ongoing jobs in the education sector. How? Particularly as the proviso has already been set by the minister in the other place where he said:
Approximately 200 Indigenous people will benefit from the provision of funding of $5.3 million to convert, where government and non-government education providers agree, Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) program places into ongoing jobs in the education sector.
This is exactly what I am concerned about, and so too should other senators. There is no real commitment from the government once the money is handed over. I suspect that the additional funding is all about enabling the Howard government, on the eve of an election, to stand up and cry about a marked increase in the number of young Indigenous people receiving funds from the Commonwealth. This is a desperate ploy by ‘Mr Sheen’, beavering around the tarnished silver with his magic spray to make everything sparkle. But what happens after the election if the Howard government is returned? If this lot gets back in, Australia’s Indigenous population will find out pretty quickly that the magic polish only lasts a few days.
There is an enormous need for young Indigenous people to have the opportunity for training in the wide range of skills that Australia is so desperately short of. As part of this bill $14.1 million is being used for the provision of infrastructure funding to enable boarding schools catering for significant cohorts of Indigenous students to repair and replace aged and deteriorating facilities. In my home state of Western Australia, we have a serious shortage of skilled labour—a situation presided over by this incompetent and inactive government. On the surface, $14.1 million may look like a lot of money. But with the serious skills shortage in the construction industry, coupled with the economic boom in WA, I cannot for the life of me see the money being stretched very far at all.
In this place on 10 August 2006 I stated:
The Howard government has continued to reduce the overall percentage of the federal budget spent on vocational education and training, and it stands condemned for the skills crisis it has created.
You might ask: what has changed? Sadly, not much. Australia continues to suffer from a lack of action from this government. I reiterate an article by Steve Lewis in today’s Australian as reported through the national media over the past few days. The article stated:
... the Business Council of Australia and the Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry confirmed plans for an advertising campaign in support of Work Choices ...
Isn’t that ironic! Fair dinkum, I was rolling around my room this morning as I was reading the paper. Fortunately I did not have to change my pants, but I did have a cackle at these two representatives of industry, and mates of the government, who have to be dragged kicking and screaming if it is suggested they may have to invest in Australia’s future skills training but here they are investing huge amounts into a re-election campaign for the Howard government. They stand guilty through association with this government.
What have the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry done, firstly, to avoid the crisis we now face, and more importantly, to address the current sad state of affairs? The hypocrisy of these two groups is incredible. They will not invest in training but they will throw potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars into an election campaign. The mining industry in Western Australia, for example, is screaming out for skilled tradespeople and labourers. The government’s response to that has been to encourage increasing numbers of migrant workers on short-term visas while there has been a potential significant workforce just outside the mine gates. Where is the government’s program to initiate trade skills training for young Indigenous people, particularly in remote regions? This is the sort of practical measure that would open up a whole economic vista for the young Indigenous generation. We know the jobs are there. Why has the government not given priority to ensuring access to skills training for all Australians?
The Howard government is intent on creating the illusion of serious investment in Indigenous communities. This is why I believe this bill is a continuation of the Howard government’s piecemeal, superficial, CBD mentality. I refer senators to Patricia Karvelas’s article in the Australian on 8 June 2007 on the waste associated with the funding of Indigenous programs. It stated:
For every dollar the Howard Government spends on indigenous people, it spends up to another dollar on bureaucracy ... it cost the Howard Government an average 40c to spend a single dollar of indigenous funding, leading to a staggering amount of taxpayers’ money going to bureaucracy.
Senators need note that the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Indigenous Leadership Program were 2004 Liberal election commitments. However, places were not offered with respect to these programs until 2006. How much money then was wasted under the guise of these programs between 2004 and 2006? Further, how much of the $26 million proposed in this bill will stay in Canberra to pay the bureaucrats? According to the article quoted in the Australian newspaper, it could amount to no less than $10 million of what we are being asked to approve today.
Indigenous people want investment in their communities that generate real jobs. Ecotourism, agriculture and aquaculture are just three examples of what is already being achieved in some of Australia’s remote Indigenous communities. As was told to me recently, Indigenous elders want to get away from the notion and mentality of ‘sit down’ money and start having a role in creating their own prosperity. We could not expect the Howard government to understand this desire, particularly as they are a government happy to see large numbers of Indigenous people disenfranchised by recent changes to electoral enrolment laws. There is no doubt that these changes have created unfair hurdles for traditional people living in our remote areas to be able to exercise their right to elect their government.
If the government had the will to give Indigenous people a genuine mechanism to determine their future, they would be investing resources into getting more Indigenous people on to the electoral roll and not the reverse. There is no justification for the number of Indigenous people on the electoral roll to be lower than that for the rest of the Australian population but that is what we have. But there is an even greater travesty: it is now easier, thanks to the Howard government with the support of senators opposite, to make secret donations to a political party than it is to enrol to vote. But, then again, it is highly unlikely that Indigenous communities would make donations to the Liberal Party, even in the spirit of reconciliation. So it is not hard to work out why the right of Indigenous people to vote is well down the list.
Unlike the Howard government, Labor have made a real commitment to Indigenous Australians. Wouldn’t it be tremendous if the Prime Minister and his cronies finally got out of Labor’s way so we could move forward and turn our commitment into reality? Labor support this bill despite its monumental inadequacies in addressing the lack of economic opportunity for young Indigenous people. I would not want to see any funding taken away from Indigenous programs but the government has to improve its performance in the way the money is spent and what it actually provides on the ground.
I would like to close with the words of one elder who spoke to me in one of the communities I visited last week. He said to me:
We are not just dumb black fellas stuck out in the bush; we have ideas.
We need to have these very words at the forefront of our minds as we stand here as representatives of the entire Australian community and legislate for the future of Indigenous people.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. This is another in a series of bills that we consider in this chamber each year to ensure that Indigenous education around this country continues to be supported. This bill appropriates additional funding of $26.1 million over the 2007 and 2008 calendar years, explicitly to expand the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. It provides infrastructure for boarding schools and it provides for the conversion of a limited number of CDEP positions to full-time positions within education.
As this is a bill that adds funds to Indigenous education, I certainly welcome it. Those of you who know my passionate interest in this area would not be surprised to learn that this bill is supported in principle by the Labor Party and, in particular, by me. But Senator Sterle is correct in saying that it does not go far enough. It is a start, but the measures in this piece of legislation do not go anywhere near addressing the particular needs that have been identified. We know that, of the total additional funds, some $2.6 million goes to expanding the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program. It will give us about an additional 860 places over four years. That is on top of the 600 or so students who already benefit from this program, giving us a total of 1,460 students. The Indigenous Youth Leadership Program will be expanded by up to 750 places over four years, with $4 million allocated for the first two years. So the total impact will be 1,610 students. There is $14.1 million for infrastructure to enable boarding schools with a significant number of Indigenous students to repair and replace old facilities.
I know from my questioning of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd during the most recent estimates process that, under the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio estimates, it says at page 164 of Budget Paper No. 2 that FaCSIA will establish three new boarding hostels and expand two existing boarding hostels at a cost of $38.8 million over four years. Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, of course, will operate two of the new boarding hostels at a cost of $2.4 million over 2009-10 and 2010-11.
At the Standing Committee on Community Affairs estimates hearing on 28 May, Mr Clarke, from Aboriginal Hostels, could only give me the details of one of those hostels, which will be built at Kununurra to cater for 40 secondary students. In addition, he thought that maybe one hostel would be built in the Northern Territory, possibly at Nhulunbuy on the Gove Peninsula—though that had not yet been decided—and that one would be built in Queensland, possibly in Townsville. He said that he would also be looking at partnerships—for example, he would talk to the McArthur River Mine about a possible boarding facility at Borroloola. He also said that there had been a budgeted allocation for partnerships for secondary education, either for recurrent costs or for construction. So we know that Aboriginal Hostels, by and large, has carriage of the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program. This program encourages Indigenous students who live in remote or very remote areas, or maybe even in outer regional areas, to relocate to major centres to board and to study. So it is certainly an initiative that we would encourage.
The overall effect of this bill is to assist young Indigenous people to relocate to undertake accredited education and training and then, hopefully, gain employment. It is always a very difficult decision to send your child away from home to attend different schools. It is no different whether you are an Indigenous parent or a non-Indigenous parent. But Indigenous parents in particular feel that their children will lose their culture and not return home, or that they might meet their demise through succumbing to some of the attractions of the capital cities. It is a decision that all parents confront at one stage or another. But it is a decision that does give Indigenous people some possibility of providing their children with better and further education.
Education is important, and Indigenous parents do make that choice. We see that in the Northern Territory in respect of Kormilda College, an independent coeducational secondary boarding school in Darwin. It has arguably the largest enrolment of Indigenous students from remote communities in Australia. The parents of those students do recognise the value of education and they send their kids into Darwin to board at the college.
While I say that this legislation and the additional funding is welcome, it does not go far enough if we are talking about encouraging children to stay on to year 12 and then take up structured training beyond year 12. To see that, one need only look at the statistics on and also at the needs of a place like Kormilda College. They have, from my recollection, lobbied this federal government for many years now to take account of what is happening in their boarding school in terms of infrastructure. And when I say that the funding in this legislation is welcome but does not go anywhere near meeting the need, Kormilda College are one example of that. They have a total enrolment of 1,050. Their Indigenous enrolment is 310 students from 70 remote communities—from Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. They offer the Northern Territory Certificate of Education, the International Baccalaureate and also some vocational education and training programs. So you would think that a college like this should be a great beneficiary of the legislation that we have before us, but it is not so.
In 2006, 35 per cent of all Indigenous NTCE graduates from remote communities studied at Kormilda College. The third generation of students from Indigenous families now board at Kormilda College. In 2007, among their year 12 enrolments, they had 17 Indigenous students, including 13 remote boarders. In 2007 they had the first Indigenous candidate for the International Baccalaureate Diploma, and the attendance rate for Indigenous students was around 95 per cent. If you looked at those statistics and had some kind of report card—by which the current minister would want to judge educational outcomes—you would have to say that Kormilda College are doing it pretty well. But they have a chronic need in terms of their current boarding infrastructure facilities. Anyone who knows and appreciates Indigenous culture would understand that, at this particular school, there are boarding facilities for girls and boys, and they are quite distinct and separate. Their current boarding capacity is 330 students but, in recent years, they have had to close 60 beds due to excessive maintenance costs. There is asbestos and concrete cancer in the existing boarding facilities. Recently, I had a meeting with the current principal, Malcolm Pritchard, and he told me that they currently have a waiting list of more than 200 remote students and, of course, no capacity to meet this demand.
We have a bill before us today that will establish some boarding hostels around this country, auspiced under Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. But, from what I can see, there is no additional funding to meet the incredible demand that a place such as Kormilda College will have and no intent that any of the money from this bill will go to places such as Kormilda College. They have closed some of the boarding facilities because the infrastructure is diminished and they need to be demolished. Currently, they cannot offer 60 beds, and they have over 200 students on their waiting list. They need to replace two condemned boarding facilities at a cost of around $15 million. The total capacity under threat is around 260 beds.
Here we have a college in the Northern Territory, in Darwin, which is doing well. It offers a fantastic program and it attracts and keeps Indigenous students—it has an attendance rate of 95 per cent—from 13 Indigenous remote communities across the territory, which this government has continued to turn its back on. Successive principals at Kormilda College have lobbied this government for $15 million to improve the boarding infrastructure, and it has not been forthcoming. This bill is another example of how this college will not be able to get the money that it needs to maintain and meet the unmet demand of its boarding school. On the one hand, the government is saying that it wants to improve the retention rate for Indigenous children in year 12 and beyond while, on the other hand, we have a perfect example in Darwin of where $15 million could be targeted and spent. But Kormilda College has been totally ignored by this government, year after year. The proportion of Indigenous children reaching year 12 is well below that of their non-Indigenous peers—we have known that for years—and the proportion of Indigenous children finishing year 12 is slightly worse.
I commend the government—and I have done this successively—on putting out the National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training. The latest one is for 2004. This is the fourth report which has been produced. It is good to see this government front up and report to the federal parliament on the progress—or, in some instances, lack of progress—in Indigenous education. Unlike other programs that this government oversees where it is not so willing to publicly report on the outcomes, it is willing to publicly report on outcomes in Indigenous education. Year in, year out, the statistics do not improve. On page 34 of the last report, with respect to year 11 and year 12, it states:
There is a further decline in this rate in 2004—
here we are talking about the retention of Indigenous students in schooling—
to produce the worst result for the period. Between 2003-04 there were declines in the rates of five of the eight states and territories, with only South Australia, Victoria and the ACT showing an improvement. The 2004 rate of 64.7 per cent is below the 2000 rate of 60 per cent, indicating that over the period of the quadrennium there was no overall improvement.
Good on the government for actually reporting it but, throughout this document, year after year, while I do see some improvements—I will admit that—in some areas, I do not. This bill is an attempt, one would hope, to encourage a turnaround of those statistics, but it is not good enough and the money is certainly not well targeted. Any measure that may help to reduce the gap and see more Indigenous people finish year 12 and go into some form of higher education or training is certainly welcome. Indeed, it is long overdue.
The Department of Education, Science and Training’s Higher education report 2005 showed that the number of Indigenous students fell by 5.9 per cent in 2005—an occurrence that will do nothing to reduce the education gap. I could go on and talk about measures that the Labor Party has committed to. They include concrete goals and targets to eliminate the gap in life expectancy within a generation, to halve the Indigenous infant mortality within a decade and to halve the gap in literacy and numeracy levels at primary school within a decade. Why is that important? It is crucially important. If you have an educational background and know anything about the first steps in life then you would know that, when it comes to retaining kids in year 12 and encouraging them to move to capital cites or regional centres to take up further vocational education and training, we can move as many bills and acts in this parliament as we wish but, unless we get it right in the first five or six years of a child’s life, they struggle and play catch-up for the rest of their school life. The evidence is out there. We know that, unless you ensure that the life expectancy of Indigenous children is increased and unless you have a commitment to set a target for improving literacy and numeracy at the primary school level and help them get it right in the first couple of years, then all of the funding that we appropriate in this place, which is targeted at year 11, year 12 and beyond, will go nowhere.
The Labor Party have said that we will set targets and measure outcomes—unlike so many programs under the Howard government’s mainstreaming policy where red tape and bureaucracy continue to defeat Indigenous progress and the achievement of outcomes. We have committed $450 million a year to provide early education of up to 15 hours a week for all four-year olds for up to 40 weeks a year. As I travel around the Northern Territory, I see many schools that do not have efficient preschools or kindergartens operating. That needs to change. We have committed to halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in reading and writing within a decade. We will need significant resources and effort to achieve that, but at least it is a performance indicator. At least it is something that we will be able to measure the success or otherwise of within that 10-year period.
Before I finish my speech, I want to talk about the move in this legislation to convert into full-time jobs 200 places in education for CDEP participants. People will know that I personally think that the CDEP has run its course, but it is still useful in remote communities in some parts of this country to get people job-ready. In 11 years, the Howard government has done nothing to improve CDEP in terms of providing education and training in those very remote communities to give people the skills to move off CDEP and into real jobs. No labour market has been stimulated and no remote training educators have been funded or provided over and above what current institutes like the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education and Charles Darwin University can provide out of their current funding. I want to talk about what is happening in urban areas. We know that these 200 jobs are part of the 825 jobs identified in this current budget to move people off CDEP and into paid jobs in urban areas. Obviously, DEST have identified that they have at least 200 of those. I understand that the urban areas will take priority as CDEP is changed, reviewed and restructured by this government over and over again. This job conversion must be taken further to convert more jobs into more full-time positions in some of the isolated areas.
On 1 July these 200 people, out of the 825 in CDEP positions around this country, will be moved off CDEP. Let us talk about what is going to happen to those 825 people. There is one measure by this government that will improve what will happen to them: they will either move into full-time employment, and that is welcomed, or they will move onto the STEP program or Newstart. But in doing so they will lose, as a consequence, access to free hearing services. This is an issue I raised with the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health during the last Senate estimates, and this government is aware of it. Is it an unintended consequence of this policy shift? Who would know? If departments were actually talking to each other then surely someone should have said: ‘We’re going to move people in urban areas off CDEP and onto either the STEP program or Newstart. Then of course you realise they’re going to lose access to hearing services.’ It is unfortunate that this government is going to ideologically push ahead with that agenda and not put it off for 12 months to sort out what will happen to these people who had access to this service offered by Human Services. It was a program that was initiated in 2005 and it should be maintained for these people. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-06-13,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate—though it would be straining both language and charity to describe Senator Sterle’s rather crude and belligerent remarks as a contribution. The Howard government want to see the gap between the education outcomes for Indigenous Australians and those for non-Indigenous Australians closed. We are addressing this goal. This is why we are building on existing programs and initiatives that are actually working to close this gap. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to increase the appropriations over the 2007 and 2008 calendar years to provide $26.1 million of additional funding. This bill provides $4 million for the expansion of the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program by an additional 750 scholarships over four years, $2.6 million for the expansion of the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program by an additional 860 places over four years, $14.1 million in infrastructure funding for urgent repairs to boarding school facilities and $5.3 million to support Indigenous people into jobs through the conversion of Community Development Employment Project positions into jobs in the education sector. The new funding of $26.1 million that is to be appropriated under this bill will support increased choice and mobility in education and training for young Indigenous people and will support CDEP participants to move into ongoing employment within the education system.
The increase in the number of scholarships offered under the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the increase in the number of places available under the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program will allow more young Indigenous people to access high quality education and training, to develop their leadership potential and to make informed life choices. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program places provide valuable opportunities for young Indigenous people to leave remote communities to obtain the skills and experience that will directly prepare them for jobs that are available in remote and rural communities, particularly those in traditional trade areas such as plumbing, electrical and mining trades and in business management, teaching and nursing. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program broadens the pool of qualified Indigenous people available to fill jobs and ensures Indigenous young people are able to make informed choices about real job opportunities and their economic independence. The increase in the number of scholarships offered under the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program will provide educational opportunities for Indigenous students at the secondary and tertiary levels while developing their leadership potential. These two initiatives will enable more Indigenous young people from rural and remote areas to access high quality education, training and employment opportunities.
The provision of $14.1 million for infrastructure funding to existing boarding schools with significant cohorts of Indigenous students will assist with urgent upgrades of accommodation facilities to prevent a loss of existing boarding places and enable the boarding schools to better meet the educational needs of Indigenous students from remote and regional areas. These schools have growing waiting lists for access to places for Indigenous people. This appropriation is in addition to the allocation of $50 million from this year’s budget surplus for non-government boarding schools that accommodate Indigenous students.
These measures will have a significant impact on Indigenous young people and their families. They will lead to accelerated improvement of their education, employment and training outcomes. They will also lead to significant improvement in community capacity in remote Indigenous communities, as many of these young people will eventually return to their home communities with enhanced knowledge, life skills and job readiness skills. In addition, the provision of funding to convert around 200 Community Development Employment Project positions into jobs in the education sector will support CDEP participants to move into ongoing employment in schools and education systems. Many CDEP participants have been doing similar work to Indigenous education workers currently being paid by schools but until now have not received the same employee benefits. They will now be able to gain the benefits of employment, including wages, leave, superannuation, training and professional development. This is part of a broader package that will see CDEP participants move into ongoing employment and move out of this welfare program to become employees in education, environment and heritage protection, community care, child care and Indigenous community policing. All up, spending on Indigenous specific education programs has increased by almost 50 per cent in real terms over the last decade.
The importance of education for young Indigenous people is a key to changing people’s lives. Education provides a foundation for later success in terms of individual advancement, choice and opportunity; and it is a vital path to improve both health and wellbeing and to achieve social and economic success. The new funding of $26.1 million that is to be appropriated through this bill is only an element of the broader package of $214 million over four years announced in the budget for Indigenous education and training. Overall, in 2007-08, the Howard government will invest almost $600 million in Indigenous specific education programs. I acknowledge and thank Senator Crossin, who has a deep and longstanding interest in this area, for her congratulations on the government’s transparency in reporting the outcomes under Indigenous education programs.
The government is determined to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students by providing more choice, mobility and educational opportunities for Indigenous students. The measures in this bill build on the government’s practical commitment in this important area of public policy. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-06-13,"—My interest in the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007 relates to schedules 3 and 8—those amending the research and development provisions in terms of the taxation arrangements and establishing the Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership scheme. May I say that it is good to finally see the latter come before the parliament. The early stage partnership scheme, for those who are not aware of it, was announced in last year’s budget, so it has taken a whole year to get the program before the chamber.
—A whole year! Are we three months from an election? 
—Yes, that is indeed the case, Senator Conroy. We finally get to see these measures. As my colleague Senator Sherry has already stated in foreshadowing the moving of his second reading amendment, Labor do not believe the scheme will be as good as it could be. We are suggesting that the government make some further changes to ensure that the scheme is feasible and that it provides maximum benefit in terms of boosting Australia’s venture capital performance. I will come back to that in a moment.
I now take this opportunity to discuss schedule 3. Schedule 3 of the bill makes amendments to the tax law relating to the 175 per cent premium research and development taxation concession and the tax offset for small companies. The bill makes 10 technical amendments to clarify the law, to remove unintended consequences and to seek to ensure that the law accurately reflects the original policy intent of the research and development taxation changes introduced in 2001. There are three main tax concessions that companies that incur expenditure on research and development may claim. They may claim the accelerated R&D deduction—that is, the 125 per cent concession. There is the premium incremental concession, at a rate of 175 per cent for research and development expenditure above the average R&D expenditure over the preceding three years. Then there is a refundable tax offset for small companies which provides the equivalent to the value of the R&D deduction as an offset where companies are not liable to pay tax.
This bill amends arrangements for the premium concession and the offset. There is no need to repeat the full range of the long list of amendments as they are fairly non-controversial. They seek to fix problems that the government’s legislation actually put in place in 2001, so you would have to ask yourself why it has taken so long to identify some of these problems and why we are only now finally moving to address those concerns.
The government has recently announced that it will be making further and more substantial changes to the premium R&D tax concession. It will be opening up eligibility for this concession to multinational companies which conduct R&D in Australia but hold the intellectual property offshore. This involves the so-called ‘beneficial ownership test’. This reflects the changes that have been asked for by numerous parliamentary committees, and of course these are matters that the Labor Party has been pursuing for some time. Personally, I have been seeking to push these changes since I returned to this portfolio late last year.
Given the experience of this bill, however, I cannot help but wonder how long it will be before we will see legislation giving effect to the other particular changes. Presumably, we have to wait until after the election, with the prospect of a new government, to actually pursue these changes. More importantly, while Labor supports the removal of the beneficial ownership test for the premium concession, the fact is that this policy reflects a half-hearted approach by this Howard government—as does the whole industry statement that gave rise to it. There are other fairly basic issues that neither the government’s announcement nor the bill that is before us today has sought to address. Firstly, there is the concern that the premium concession has become an administrative nightmare and the government’s industry statement has done nothing to change that situation. Secondly, every man and woman and his or her dog—including the Productivity Commission, I might say—realises that the eligibility criteria for the tax offset provides perverse incentives for small high-tech businesses to actually limit their research and development spending. But the government has made no move to amend those threshold arrangements. You can only presume that, as the government has not done that in the industry statement and has missed that opportunity, clearly it has no intention of fixing this problem. Beyond that there is serious potential to improve the R&D tax concession arrangements overall. More broadly, there is a serious need to improve Australia’s business research and development performance.
I will take this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that Australia’s research and development performance under this government is nowhere near what is actually required for Australians as a collective to actually keep their heads above water. Australia invests only 1.8 per cent of GDP in research and development, well below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent. Business spending on research and development since 1996 has grown at half the rate it grew at over the previous decade. It has actually plummeted from 11.4 per cent to only 5.1 per cent.
If we turn to manufacturing, we see that the story is even grimmer, with the average annual growth rate slipping from 10.6 per cent to only 1.9 per cent. This contrasts with the performance of our competitors, and we can see just how much of a gap is now opening up between Australia and them. Let us look at China. China has committed itself to lifting its research and development expenditure as a proportion of its GDP to 2.5 per cent by 2020. That is up from 1.2 per cent in 2002 and 0.6 per cent in 1995. China is doubling its expenditure on research and development every seven years. We now have the situation of China, as a matter of deliberate policy, increasingly moving from low-end manufacturing to high-end manufacturing. We have the situation of the Chinese government spending extraordinary sums of money on its research infrastructure to the point where it is very likely that we will see their researchers being paid more than ours and they will have an opportunity to pursue research on equipment far superior to what is available in Australian universities. I take the view that it is only a matter of time before we are finding that Australia’s best researchers are actually working in Beijing.
In 2006, China overtook Japan as the second largest spender on research and development behind the United States, with spending growth of 20 per cent over the previous year. The Chinese are already the second largest in the world in terms of their expenditure on R&D. Every other developed economy is responding to this challenge with a sense of urgency, but not the Howard government. Its apathy has been made abundantly clear through its industry statement and through the last budget. This is not a government with a long-term agenda. It is not a government that is committed to a sense of urgency in providing Australians with the tools necessary to maintain their productivity and competitiveness.
Back in 1996, despite committing to improve our international ranking in terms of expenditure on business R&D as a share of GDP—that was the election commitment the Howard government made in 1996—the Howard government’s main policy after it was elected was to cut research and development, and in particular cut research and development taxation concessions from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. This was not something they went to the election with, of course; this was not the policy they put to the Australian people, but it was the policy they put to this parliament after the election. This has been a consistent pattern of this government throughout the last 11 years: they say one thing before an election and do exactly the opposite after an election.
As a result of this policy and other changes that have occurred in terms of the corporate taxation rates, the value of the base research and development concession has fallen under this government from 18c in the dollar in 1996 to 7.5c today. There was some hope that the government’s recently released industry policy statement—which, I might say, took 11 months to put together—might attempt to remedy the neglect of the national innovation system. I am too kind to say to Minister McFarlane that he has failed, because I do not think he tried. I do not think there was a serious attempt to address those fundamental failings of Australia’s national innovation system through this policy instrument. In fact, it is instructive that this government announced its industry statement the week before the budget. It was such a low priority for the Treasurer that it was not even worth a mention in the budget speech. We all know that the arrangements made by that statement were fundamentally changed on the weekend prior to the announcement where the government sought to double the period of forward commitments that were announced in that industry statement. We also now know that the finance department gave a cursory glance to those costings. They were simply flat line assumptions that took out any commitments from the four-year basis on which the program was planned through to the 10 years of the announcement in the statement one week before the budget.
When we look at the details and we see what progress has been made, we see there are a number of problems this country has to face up to, yet this industry statement failed to deal with those questions. For example, benchmarked against the United States economy, Australia’s labour productivity has fallen from a peak of 85 per cent in 1998 to just 79 per cent in 2005. We have almost lost the gains that were made in the 1990s; labour productivity growth has fallen from 3.2 per cent in 1998-99 to 2.2 per cent in 2003-04. The government’s own budget papers indicated that officials expect zero productivity growth this year; and growth in export volumes has been slower over the last decade than it has been at any time since World War II. Over the past five years manufactured exports have recorded a growth of just 0.4 per cent a year compared to the 16 per cent record achieved under Labor. When it comes to innovation, Australia has now slipped to 24th on the World Competitiveness Index and is about to be overtaken by India. Out of 125 countries, Australia is ranked 25th on university-industry research collaboration, 28th on company spending on research and development, and 30th on the government procurement of technological products based on technical performance and innovation rather than simply price. Australia is ranked 35th in capacity for innovation, which measures whether companies conduct formal research or pioneer new products and processes, and we are placed 35th in the availability of scientists and engineers. At the World Economic Forum these measures were all identified as ‘notable competitive disadvantages’. I say that Australia is facing these acute challenges and we have the opportunity to do something about it. But, rather than lifting our performance in global terms, we are falling behind.
The Treasurer said he would try to explain how we were to invest in the future. We talked about what the options were in terms of innovation or the better use of technology—these things did not occur to him; they did not appear in the Treasurer’s statement explaining the government’s budget. It is not surprising to some of those concerned in this chamber that the OECD says:
Most of the rise in material standards of living since the industrial revolution has been the consequence of innovation.
It says innovation has long been the main motor of economic growth. It is not just the OECD that makes this claim. Alan Greenspan, who has a world-class reputation as an economist, made this point in February 2004:
Over the past half century, the increase in the value of raw materials has accounted for only a fraction of the overall growth of US gross domestic product. The rest of that growth reflects the embodiment of ideas in products and in services that consumers value. This shift of emphasis from physical material to ideas is the core of value creation appears to have accelerated in recent decades ... ideas are at the centre of productivity growth.
By completely ignoring the issue of innovation and productivity, I think the Treasurer has shown that this government has no credibility when it comes to understanding the drivers of economic growth. It has no credibility when it comes to securing Australia’s economic future beyond the mining boom.
There is no comparison between what the government is arguing in terms of innovation and what the Labor Party are putting forward. Labor understand that in this country we have a complex innovation system. It has many elements to it—there are many moving parts. But it needs to be understood as a whole and thought about in a strategic sense. That is why, on 24 April, Mr Rudd released Labor’s new directions in innovation paper. This shows that there is a need for a much bigger picture in the approach that the Commonwealth should take on the question of innovation. The first thing to make clear is that a Rudd Labor government would actually take responsibility and show national leadership on innovation. That is why we argue in our 10-point plan for innovation how important it is that the Commonwealth front up to its responsibilities. Labor’s innovation plan has been very well received—and I am sure that Senator Brandis will appreciate this point. Our willingness to show national leadership and to bring together the disparate parts of our innovation system has been widely praised. A recent Business Review Weekly editorial described Labor’s proposal to bring responsibility for industry innovation, science and research back into a single ministry as ‘fundamentally important’. It said that it addresses a ‘core issue that has guided or misguided national innovation policy in the past decade’.
Coming back to the thrust of this bill, and particularly schedule 3, Labor support all of these administrative amendments for improving the operation of the taxation scheme—particularly the concession scheme. But we wait with bated breath to see how long it will take for the Howard government to introduce legislation removing the beneficial ownership test from the premium concession, given that it has taken them a year to get this particular measure before this chamber. We certainly will not be holding our breath for any further enhancement to the research and development taxation concession. That ship has clearly sailed under this government.
On behalf of Senator Sherry and the opposition, I move:

At the end of the motion, add “b
ut the Senate:

condemns the Government for its failure to promote the venture capital industry; and

calls on the Government to:
increase to $500 million the value of assets of an entity invested in by an Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership (ESVCLP) beyond which an ESVCLP must divest itself of an interest in the entity,
increase the time allowed for a partnership to divest an investment from 9 months to 12 months, and
increase the value of assets target investees of an ESVCLP can have, to $500 million”.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007 has eight schedules dealing with: first, effective life provisions of mining rights and their depreciation treatment; second, the taxation of boating activities; third, expenditure on research and development activities; fourth and fifth, the donation of listed shares to deductible gift recipients and the listing of new deductible gift recipients—these are in this bill, including a valuable listing for a body in Bunbury; sixth, the deduction for contributions relating to fundraising events; seventh, technical amendments and corrections; and, eighth, venture capital.
This bill was sent to the Senate Economics committee. Schedules 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 attracted no submissions. The other schedules raised timing issues. Some wanted the provisions to be made retrospective, but I agree with the committee chair that their case was weak and should not be supported. This is a reasonably lengthy bill, but you would describe it as a cleaning up bill and a more technical bill with relatively minor, but helpful, changes. In tax terms, it will not cost very much. My quick addition of the cost of the various schedules in 2010-11 is about $40 million, so it is not exactly costly.
The bill does cover some areas which are of interest in a policy sense—they are to do with research and development and venture capital. One of the debating points that were raised by the shadow minister, Senator Carr—and no doubt it will be responded to by the minister at the table—is the issue of whether previous and present governments have paid enough attention to long-term investment by the public sector. There is also the issue of the commitment of the public sector to these areas, as opposed to leaving it to the market.
Economics is quite accurately described as an art rather than a science. It can be quite arcane and complex in its reasoning and deductions and so on. At the heart of economic theory is a very useful and simple summation of those things that contribute to productivity and the health of the nation-state. Those are known as the factors of production: land, labour and capital. The interesting thing about those three is that both the previous Labor government—long distant now—and the present Howard government have paid a great deal of attention to the factor of production known as capital. Capital is highly mobile and it is the least important of the nation-state’s elements in the sense that the nation-state is built on its land and its people, but it is very important to the nation-state in terms of its facility and efficacy. Both the previous Labor government and the present Howard government have paid a great deal of attention to ensuring that capital is well attended to, and to making Australia as competitive, modern and efficient as possible.
There have been very significant changes to regulatory mechanisms, corporations law, finance law and tax law, all of which have given us an extremely dynamic, flexible and modern capital market which contributes very significantly to Australia’s wealth and health—both from the public sector institutional side, which includes the Reserve Bank, APRA, ASIC and so on; and in the functioning of the market, which includes the ASX, the Takeovers Panel and other such bodies.
So, by and large, I would give the previous government, who initiated the Wallis review, and the Howard government a tick for advancing our commitment to modern, progressive and continuous updating of our ability to facilitate capital. However, with respect to land and labour, I think the criticisms of the Howard government are real. It would be facile to remark that the Howard government has paid no attention to land; obviously they have in a number of respects. But in key matters, investment in land—in the broader economic sense—is long term and requires the long term to show benefits and to generate returns.
If we wanted to secure the future wealth, prosperity, productivity and sustainability of our land, we should have paid far more attention far earlier on the issues of water, energy, infrastructure, the environment and areas like that. There has been a very strong debate about a very slow, tired, sceptical and delayed response by the Howard government to those issues. It is true that they are catching up, but the underinvestment in those areas is a real problem. You cannot point the finger solely at the Howard government; you have to remember that the state governments have had their parts to play in this. Those state governments which have been sucking out dividends, capital and cash from their water and energy utilities to prop themselves up have done a disservice to future Australians because of the underinvestment in sewerage works, updated modern recycling capacities and the ability of our energy suppliers to compete effectively and provide what is necessary.
The other area of concern with respect to the factors of production is labour. Again, it would be facile to believe that the Howard government have not paid any attention—by way of law change—to that factor of production, but it is undoubtedly a strong criticism of the Howard government that they failed to invest sufficiently and early enough in education and training, and in motivating and incentivising the research and high-level capacity of the Australian population. This chamber has heard me say in debates on other matters, with respect to the mistreatment, abuse or assault of children, that if you harm a child you end up with a harmed adult. If you harm a child at age 10 that harm is still exhibited at age 70. In other words, it has decades of effect and generational consequences. The same applies to underinvestment. An underinvestment in a child who has been in training or education systems for the last 10 years will have a lifetime effect and will have a consequence which is long term.
That is why people like Fiona Stanley, former Australian of the Year—I think she is a Companion of the Order of Australia—has always insisted on the importance of preschool education and training. Many others share that view—including me and my party—and of course they support a continued investment in the public and private sectors of education and training. There again you have split responsibilities between the states and the federal government, but in international and competitive terms the view is that there has been insufficient investment for the last decade or so in that area, with the consequence that we will be underperforming in terms of our capacity for productivity, competitiveness and wealth creation over the long term, in contrast with some OECD countries which are far better at education, training and other matters.
I have previously in this chamber said to both the government and the opposition—of course there are people from all parties who have this view—that we should look as much at the Scandinavian countries as we do at the Anglo-Saxon countries for initiatives which contribute to world-beating performance in competition and employment measures and their general ability to advance their countries. The Scandinavian countries lead the world in many areas with respect to global competition, open markets and the development and fulfilment of their people. We should draw from as many sources as we can to get ideas which maximise the future productivity of our people and guarantee that our nation-state will be as competitive and well ranked in the future as we think it is now.
Those are broad comments on the wider debate in this chamber and in the community at large between the government, which says it has been doing plenty and that we should look at what good work it has been doing, and the opposition, which says, ‘You haven’t been doing enough.’ My own judgement is that there has been gross underinvestment in the land and labour factors of production, but I would give a tick to the government in its efforts with regard to the factor  of production of capital. Having been prompted to those remarks by the broader approach of the shadow minister Senator Carr, with respect to venture capital and the expenditure on research and development activity, I should conclude by saying that the Democrats support this bill fully without amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-06-13,"—by leave—I thank the government for according me leave to speak today on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007. I last spoke on this legislation on 10 May, and I had not completed my remarks when debate was interrupted by the 12.45 dinner break. So some time has elapsed.
—It is still fresh in our minds!
—I am sure it is, as all my contributions on tax legislation are. In continuing my contribution, I am sure that all those who are listening to this broadcast are well aware of my refreshing words on 10 May when I referred to the need to boost R&D in this country. My colleague Senator Carr, who, I have to say, is much more of an expert in R&D than I and who has some shadow ministerial responsibilities in this area, made a very effective contribution in his speech on the second reading. Labor notes that it has taken a long time to deal with the issue of the offset and premium deduction, which was introduced in 2001. There is 150 per cent tax deduction for eligible expenditure on R&D, which was introduced by the Labor government in May 1986. In 1996, the Liberal-National Party government, as part of its budget measures on R&D, decided to reduce the maximum concessional rate of deduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and to further tighten eligibility criteria.
The current government’s record on research and development is truly woeful. Rather than improving Australia’s ranking in expenditure on business research and development since 1996, Australia has slipped from third to ninth in the OECD—the organisation of developed countries—in terms of government expenditure on R&D as a percentage of gross domestic product. We have also slipped from 13th to 15th in terms of gross expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP. This is a fundamental factor in improving productivity, which in turn is a fundamental factor in sustaining economic growth.
Schedule 4 of the bill amends the tax law to allow a deduction for donations of small parcels of shares in listed public companies to deductible gift recipients, known as DGRs. The amendments will allow taxpayers a tax deduction where they make a gift to a DGR of shares in a listed public company that were acquired more than 12 months before making the gift and are valued at less than $5,000. Labor supports this proposal and efforts to encourage philanthropy in Australia. The bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the list of deductible gift recipients. Labor supports this measure in schedule 5 and wishes the organisations listed in it well.
Schedule 6 extends eligibility for tax deductions for a contribution to a DGR where a ‘minor benefit’ is for a fundraising event. Schedule 6 proposes to relax the eligibility threshold for minor benefits to allow deductions for contributions of more than $150 (it is currently $250) where the market value of the minor benefit is no more than $150 (it is currently $100) and 20 per cent of the value of the consideration (it is currently 10 per cent)—whichever is the lesser of these. Labor supports these measures to assist charities.
Schedule 7 corrects a defect in the definition of ‘exempt entity’ by ensuring the definition covers all entities exempt from tax under the tax law. This bill will change the definition of ‘exempt entity’ in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include any entity if all of its income is exempted by any Commonwealth legislation or if it is an untaxable Commonwealth entity. This will ensure that ancillary funds and prescribed private funds can donate to tax exempt state, territory and Commonwealth bodies, such as public ambulance services, research authorities and cultural institutions. That was the original intent of the 2005 legislation. Labor supports the proposals but notes this is another example of poor drafting, which has taken some two years to fix.
Schedule 8 amends the venture capital provisions to relax eligibility requirements for the concessional treatment of foreign residents investing in venture capital limited partnerships. I did emphasise foreign residents—

Senator Murray interjecting—

—Senator Murray knows what I am referring to here. We had an earlier debate about tax concessions being made available to foreigners, and Senator Ronaldson railed against tax concessions for foreigners. I note that when he votes to support this bill, he will be supporting another tax concession to foreigners.
This schedule introduces a concession to investors investing in early stage venture capital activities through a new investment vehicle: an early stage venture capital limited partnership. It has the acronym of ESVCLPs. The aim of such tax concessions is to provide a source equity capital for relatively high-risk and expanding businesses that find it difficult to attract to investment through normal commercial mechanisms. However, Labor believes that the government’s efforts in this bill to attract more venture capital to Australian businesses do not go far enough.
Schedule 8 relaxes the restrictions on a VCLP by: removing restrictions on the investor’s country of residence—currently, partners and VCLPs must be residents of, or established in, certain countries; allowing the entities to invest in unit trusts and convertible notes; reducing the minimum partnership capital required for registration from $20 million to $10 million; allowing the appointment of auditors to be delayed until the end of the financial year of the investment; and relaxing the Australian nexus test, which currently requires that the investee entity company—a company a VCLP invests in—be a company resident of Australia and 50 per cent of the assets and employees of the invested entity to be located in Australia for 12 months following the investment.
However, this bill still maintains the restriction on VCLPs that target investees. They must have less than $250 million in assets—a restriction generally not imposed in other jurisdictions. The Labor amendment goes to ensuring that Australia’s VCLP regime is internationally competitive to ensure an expanding Australian economy can attract investment-encouraging innovation.
These vehicles are new early stage venture capital vehicles which will progressively replace the existing pooled development funds and, as with PDFs, are aimed at early stage venture capital in small to medium enterprises. The ESVCLP will be tax flowed through vehicles; however, income and capital gains earned by the entity will be exempt from any Australian tax. This exemption will apply to both resident and non-resident investors; however, the attractiveness of these concessions must be measured against the restrictions that will apply: the maximum size of the fund administered by an ESVCLP is $100 million; they will not be able to invest in investee entities with total assets exceeding $50 million; losses from the entity will not be deductible by the partners; and, once the total assets of an entity invested in by an ESVCLP exceeds $250 million, it must divest itself of that entity. This is a significant and onerous requirement that, despite the tax concessions, may prove to make them unattractive vehicles for private equity. The Liberal government is making these changes because the venture capital regime introduced by it in 2002 is not working properly and has failed to boost the venture capital industry. Only 15 VCLPs and 15 PDFs have been registered.
The removal of some of the restrictions on VCLPs and the introduction of an ESVCLP are positive and are welcomed; however, the reforms do not go far enough. Significant restrictions will remain, the key one being that target investees must have less than $250 million in assets, a restriction generally not imposed in other jurisdictions. This restriction contributes significantly towards making the vehicle uncompetitive internationally. The explanatory memorandum states that these measures address the key findings of the Watson report ‘The review of venture capital industry’; however, the report is not public. I call on the government to make the report public—what is the secrecy?—so that we know that all the key findings have been addressed in this legislation. More and more it is a hallmark of this government, with its majority in the House of Representatives and now in the Senate, to cover up and to keep secret the reports and essential data needed to assess key legislation. More and more, we are seeing the government use its majority to shut down inquiries and, where it does hold an inquiry, to not release the reports publicly. This is yet another example of this trend towards arrogance and secrecy, particularly since the government secured a majority in the Senate.
I note that, when my colleague the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Bowen, moved the second reading amendment in the House, it was rejected by the government. The amendment condemned the government for its failure to promote the venture capital industry. It called on the government to increase from $250 million to $500 million the value of assets of an entity invested in by an ESVCLP beyond which an ESVCLP must divest itself of an interest in that entity; to increase from nine months to 12 months the time allowed for a partnership to divest an investment; and to increase from $250 million to $500 million the value of assets target investees of VCLPs can have. Increasing the threshold to $500 million would encourage more investment in early stage venture capital vehicles and more investment in innovative businesses in Australia.
Increasing to 12 months the time allowed for an ESVCLP to divest itself of an interest in an entity which breaches the threshold is a more practical length of time for the vehicle to divest itself of an interest in early stage growth companies. I understand my colleague Senator Carr moved Labor’s second reading amendment. For the reasons I have outlined, Labor believe the second reading amendment will be supported. I should indicate that we will not take the amendment to a division; however, venture capital investment is a key area to help ensure strong productivity growth and to maintain economic growth beyond the enormous good fortune of the current mining boom. It is a theme that I touched on earlier in the debate about another tax measure. Labor urge the government to consider our second reading amendment. I suspect we are urging in vain; however, we believe that that would represent a fundamental improvement to the attraction of venture capital industry so vital to our future productivity and economic growth.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-06-13,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007 implements a number of changes and improvements to Australia’s taxation system. The provisions of the bill were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, of which I am a member, for inquiry and report. We received six submissions. The bill has eight schedules, some of which are technical but most of which deal with specific areas to which the Howard government has given attention that either simplify or extend current provisions and concessions relating to taxation. These include the effective life provisions for depreciation purposes, the taxation of boating activities, certain expenditure on research and development activities, donations of listed shares to deductible gift recipients, additions to the list of deductible gift recipients, deductions of contributions related to fundraising events, technical amendments and provisions relating to venture capital.
I want to particularly direct my remarks today to schedule 8 of the bill, which amends the venture capital regime as far as tax law is concerned. These amendments relax the eligibility requirements for foreign residents who invest in venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds. They also introduce a new set of taxation concessions for Australian residents and foreign residents who invest in early stage venture capital activities. This is achieved through a new investment vehicle called an early stage venture capital limited partnership.
The term ‘venture capital’ generally refers to relatively high-risk early stage equity finance of young and emerging high-growth companies. Australia’s venture capital regime was introduced through the Venture Capital Act 2002. The purpose of the regime is to encourage foreign investors to team with Australian industry to provide a source of equity capital for relatively high-risk projects. Apart from direct funding, government assistance for venture capital projects comes from tax concessions provided under the Income Tax Assessment Act.
Changes to the venture capital regime were announced in the 2006-07 budget as a package of measures aimed at increasing activity in our venture capital sector. The measures in schedule 8 of the bill address key findings of a review into Australia’s venture capital industry. The measures further demonstrate the Howard government’s continuing support for new business and reflect that promotion of industry innovation will always be encouraged by this government. Schedule 8 improves the taxation incentives for foreign and venture capital activities based in Australia. It will enact measures that were recommended in the government-commissioned review of the venture capital industry and, as I said, announced in the recent budget. The budget announced the introduction of an early stage venture capital limited partnership which will provide a complete tax exemption for income received by domestic and foreign partners.
There are two primary sources of external equity capital for entrepreneurs: one is visible and highly formalised; the other is largely invisible and very informal. The ‘visible’ venture capital market is composed of formal venture capital funds. These funds are predominantly managed by highly trained finance professionals who invest capital in growth companies on behalf of a group of passive investors, often superannuation funds. The ‘invisible’ market, in contrast, typically requires private investors investing a portion of their personal wealth in early stage entrepreneurial values and is frequently unstructured and high risk. The changes in the bill will widen the incentives for investor companies and professionals to assist young companies raising capital and other venture capital related sources.
Venture capital has a number of advantages over other forms of finance. These include the financing mechanism itself, whereby the venture capitalist injects long-term equity finance which provides a solid capital base for future growth. The venture capitalist may also be capable of providing additional rounds of funding should it be required to finance future growth. Another possible advantage is that of a business partner, whereby the venture capitalist is a business partner sharing the risks and rewards. Venture capitalists are rewarded by business success and the capital gain. An additional advantage is mentoring, where the venture capitalist is able to provide, in addition to his financial support, strategic operational and financial advice to the company, based on past experience with other companies in similar situations. Another possibility is that of alliances, where the venture capitalist also has a network of contacts in many areas that can add value to the company, such as in recruiting key personnel and providing contacts in international markets, introductions to strategic partners and, if needed, co-investments with other venture capital firms when additional rounds of finance are required.
This bill is of particular relevance to my home state of South Australia. Increasingly, the role of entrepreneurs who build and lead successful and dynamic businesses—those that are supported as a result of the Howard government’s strong economic record—is being recognised as a key component of economic prosperity in South Australia. Entrepreneurship and the demand for venture capital are barometers of business confidence in an economy, and the availability of innovative thinkers in South Australia complements this.
South Australia’s share of Howard government administered venture capital program funds is currently less than 10 per cent, due in part to the predomination of small business in that state. The reality is that a number of small to medium sized businesses looking for venture capital money cannot always readily find big east coast venture capital firms interested in what they are doing. As a result, there is a big gap between start-up funds—that is, grants, the initial firm’s own resources and capital from family and friends—and venture capital. Any changes which will encourage venture capital investment or produce a business or investment environment where size does not matter are of benefit to South Australia, which has, as I said, hitherto had a smaller slice of the pie. The incentives in the bill enable South Australia to set targets for venture capital and facilitate entrepreneurship, emphasising the challenge of attracting, retaining and making best use of those who can help our regional, as well as national, economy to thrive.
This bill provides a concession to facilitate non-resident investment in the Australian venture capital industry by providing incentives for increased investment in relatively high-risk start-up and expanding businesses that would otherwise have difficulty in attracting investment through normal commercial terms. Therefore, it is a win-win situation.
Key features of the venture capital measures, which were announced jointly by the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in connection with the budget and which are provided in this bill, are that the requirements to qualify for tax concessions by venture capital limited partnerships, known as VCLPs, will be relaxed to remove a range of restrictions, including allowing investment in unit trusts and convertible notes as well as shares, relaxing the requirement that 50 per cent of assets and employees must be in Australia for 12 months after making the investment, and removing restrictions on the country of residence of investors.
A new vehicle for venture capital investments will be provided with the establishment of the early stage venture capital limited partnerships, with flow-through tax treatment and a complete tax exemption for income, both revenue and capital, received by its domestic and foreign partners. To qualify, the ESVCLP must have a maximum fund size of $100 million, and total assets of investee companies cannot exceed $50 million immediately prior to the investment. The early stage venture capital limited partnership must also divest itself of any holdings once the total assets of the investee company exceed $250 million.
Another initiative in this legislation is the progressive replacement of the existing Pooled Development Funds Program with the ESVCLP program. The Pooled Development Funds Program will be closed to new registrations as of the end of last year. The government will commit $200 million for a further round of funding of the Innovation Investment Fund Program, and that will be drawn down over the next decade. The government funding will be matched dollar for dollar with private sector funds.
Schedule 8 of the bill also improves the taxation incentives for foreign venture capital activities based in Australia and, again, puts into place measures that were recommended in the review of the venture capital industry commissioned by the government and to which I referred earlier. The current law requires investments to be acquisitions of shares or options, for the company to be located in Australia for at least the first 12 months, limited partners to be residents of specified foreign countries, ongoing auditor involvement and a minimum of $20 million of committed capital for the venture capital limited partnership to register.
This bill allows for more generous concessional tax treatment of foreign residents investing in venture capital limited partnerships by permitting investments to be acquisitions of convertible notes and unit trusts, for up to 20 per cent of investments to be in companies and unit trusts not located in Australia, partners can be residents of any foreign country, auditors are to be appointed at the end of the financial year in which the investment is made, and the minimum partnership capital required for registration under the Venture Capital Act to be $10 million.
These new venture capital measures, as part of this overall initiative of the Howard government, will benefit small to medium enterprises seeking capital injections to finance expansion and also will assist start-up companies by making it easier for them to obtain capital. Again, this is of particular value to South Australia, where the measures will increase the supply of private equity in that state, positively influence innovation and development in local business sectors and encourage a culture of innovation and business development. Venture capital will boost Australia’s innovation levels and provide numerous spin-off benefits in the form of jobs, particularly in regional Australia, and will foster further economic growth when projects reach the commercialisation stage. Again, this is true of South Australia’s rapidly growing bioscience industry.
Venture capital investors will also benefit from these measures. Major beneficiaries from the introduction of the early stage venture capital limited partnership vehicle will be domestic resident investors and fund managers, as non-resident investors have already benefited from an exemption from capital gains tax which was implemented last year. The Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Limited welcomed the venture capital measure announced in the budget and stated:
We congratulate the Federal Government on their Venture Capital initiatives outlined in the budget. The reforms should add to the supply of venture capital, drive commercialisation of research, develop advanced skills, and contribute to the creation of a knowledge based economy.
The issues which have been addressed in this legislation were drawn to my attention several years ago in terms of the shortcomings of the current administration and the current legislation that applied to venture capital initiatives. As a result of that I have lobbied strongly over the several years since that time for changes to be made, and the changes for which I have lobbied are implemented through this legislation. So I am very glad that the government has responded to the proposals that I put forward, having listened very carefully to the issues that were raised by venture capitalists and the shortcomings in the previous approach to venture capital. I believe the changes that are being made through this legislation will, as I have said, be strongly beneficial to the venture capital market and will further innovation in Australia by assisting both those industries and businesses seeking venture capital and potential venture capital investors. As a result the strong growth that Australia has experienced in recent years in its venture capital industry but which has been, to some extent, hamstrung by those shortcomings, will now grow even more strongly. It will be driven by demand from emerging and expanding businesses for equity funding and the increasing availability of institutional funding for investment. The bill before us clearly demonstrates that the Howard government has been alert to the needs of the venture capital industry and is alert to providing ongoing support for new business ventures and the promotion of industry innovation. It is on that basis that I wholeheartedly commend this legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-06-13,"—Firstly, I will briefly say that the government opposed this amendment in the other place. This is the same amendment being put in the Senate, and the government similarly opposes it in the Senate.
For the record, I will point out that the $250 million divestment requirement is reasonable because the government is introducing generous tax concessions for early stage vehicles. Given the emphasis on start-up and seed capital, the need for ongoing tax concessions once an entity reaches a size of $250 million diminishes. Moreover, if the partnership divests the entity into a venture capital limited partnership as it approaches the $250 million limit, it can continue to attract tax-free gains without any divestment requirement. The requirement to divest once an entity reaches $250 million applies for up to six months after the end of an income year. This provides ample opportunity for divestment to occur. I certainly commend the bill to the Senate and I thank senators for their contribution.
There are a number of schedules to this bill which deal with important issues and they have been touched on by senators. Schedule 1 to this bill makes amendments to the capital allowance system. Schedule 2 implements the government’s decision to allow taxpayers to deduct boating expenses up to the amount of boating income earned. This is very relevant when one considers the increased tourism in this country with people leasing out vessels for visitors overseas in particular. Schedule 3 to this bill improves the operation of the research and development—or R&D—tax offset. Schedules 4 to 7 demonstrate the government’s support for philanthropic activities in the community. Schedule 4, for instance, extends the gift provisions to allow taxpayers to claim a tax deduction for the donation of certain publicly listed shares to deductible gift recipients.
Schedule 5 has two aspects to it which I have been closely involved in. It amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the tax legislation to extend the current listing for the Finding Sydney Foundation and to list the American-Australian Association Limited and the Bunbury Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund. I have had an active involvement in the Finding Sydney Foundation, one which is endeavouring to mount a search to find the Sydney, which was tragically lost off the coast of Western Australia. That is a very important endeavour and one which I think all Australians would support. This will assist that foundation in its work.
The Bunbury Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund was set up as a result of the Catholic Cathedral in Bunbury being destroyed, somewhat ironically, by an act of God. It was a storm that went through which caused the cathedral to be demolished. It was tragic for the people of Bunbury and the south-west, and the government provided $5 million towards the rebuilding of the cathedral. That is something which I have had an involvement in and fully support.
Schedule 6 to this bill extends the eligibility for tax deductions for contributions to deductible gift recipients where an associated minor benefit is received at an eligible fundraising event. Schedule 7 to this bill makes technical amendments to ensure that the definition of ‘exempt entity’ covers all entities exempt under the income tax law. Schedule 8 demonstrates the government’s commitment to new business ventures and the promotion of industry innovation. That amends the venture capital regime to relax the eligibility requirements for foreign residents investing in venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds.
So there are a number of important initiatives in this bill. I thank senators again for their contributions to the debate and I commend the bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Marshall)—The question is that the second reading amendment, moved by Senator Carr on behalf of Senator Sherry, be agreed to.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-13,"—Today we are dealing with the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2007. This bill proposes to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to create a framework for the operation of diagnostic imaging services in Australia. Diagnostic imaging, a growing area of medical technology, includes a range of diagnostic medical services, including ultrasound; computer tomography, or CT; nuclear medicine; radiography, or X-ray; magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI; positron emission tomography, or PET; and bone densitometry.
The Australian government provides Medicare rebates for a number of diagnostic imaging services which are listed in the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table. The relevant legislation which provides the framework includes the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Regulations of 1975 and the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations.
Management of diagnostic imaging under Medicare is through the radiology memorandum of understanding. The signatories to this radiology MOU are the government, represented by the Department of Health and Ageing, and sector representatives of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists and the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association. The radiology MOU is one of four collaborative agreements between the government and diagnostic imaging representative organisations made as part of the 2003-04 budget process for managing Medicare funded diagnostic imaging services. There are additional MOUs for cardiac imaging, nuclear medicine imaging and obstetric and gynaecological ultrasound.
The radiology MOU is the largest of the diagnostic imaging MOUs. It accounts for around 80 per cent of all diagnostic imaging services under Medicare. In the 2005-06 financial year there were approximately 12.6 million services claimed under the radiology MOU, accounting for more than $1.2 billion per annum in Medicare benefits for services. These costs—$1.3 billion per annum—account for around 10 per cent of the total Medicare budget. Clearly, then, it is important that we ensure not only the quality of the diagnostic imaging services provided to millions of patients but also that the investment of Australian taxpayers in Medicare is well protected.
This bill seeks to create an overarching framework within the Health Insurance Act 1973 for the establishment and operation of accreditation schemes for diagnostic imaging services, as agreed to by the government and representatives of the sector as part of the negotiations for the radiology MOU in 2003. Under the scheme, all diagnostic imaging practices providing services under the radiology MOU will need to be accredited by an approved accreditation provider in order for Medicare benefits to be payable for the services they provide.
By allowing the minister to establish the rules and operational details of the accreditation scheme through a legislative instrument, the bill has been designed to enable the introduction of accreditation schemes for other diagnostic imaging services in the future without further amendments to the act. As I said earlier, diagnostic imaging is a growing area of medical technology and the legislation needs to recognise its dynamic nature.
Labor supports this legislation. However, we are disappointed that there is scant detail available as to how this accreditation process will work in practice. We support the intention and the need to establish such a process, but how many times have we had to say, ‘In principle, what the government is proposing is okay, but where is the detail’?
Labor knows that accreditation schemes are widely utilised in the health sector as a method for reviewing and improving systems of care and for ensuring that consumers receive quality services irrespective of who provides the services and the facilities in which they are provided. Labor also knows how important it is to get the most out of the scarce health dollar. We support measures which will result in efficiencies under Medicare and in the health system more broadly.
Given that diagnostic imaging services account for more than $1.3 billion per annum in Medicare benefits, Labor recognises that it is in the interests of the efficient working of Medicare and the broader health system that services are provided within a framework of continuous improvement in the delivery of safe and high-quality health care. Just as past Labor governments built Medicare, Labor believes that Medicare should be retained, defended and strengthened. An accreditation system for providers of diagnostic imaging services will help protect Medicare, the cornerstone of our health system.
I now turn to the provisions of the bill. The most significant changes are affected by items 5 and 11 of schedule 1. Item 5 inserts a new section, 16EA, to the Health Insurance Act 1973. It precludes the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services unless the procedures are carried out at premises which are accredited under a diagnostic imaging accreditation scheme to undertake a particular type of diagnostic imaging procedure. Where the images are captured off site—for example, by mobile services—they must be captured on equipment that is ordinarily located at a base for mobile diagnostic imaging equipment or at diagnostic imaging premises accredited to undertake that procedure. Item 11 inserts a new division 5, diagnostic imaging accreditation, into part 2B of the act, which sets out the framework for the establishment and operation of diagnostic imaging accreditation schemes.
A new section, 23DZZ1AA, allows the minister to establish, via legislative instruments, a diagnostic imaging accreditation scheme, or schemes, with approved persons who will be able to accredit practices for the purposes of the scheme. Under this section, the legislative instrument establishing a scheme can specify the conditions for accreditation and provide for any matters needed to create and administer the scheme. If the legislative instrument establishing a scheme confers a power or function on the minister in administering the scheme, subsection 23DZZ1AA(5) allows the minister to delegate these powers or functions to an officer, as defined in existing section 131 of the act:
(a)  an officer of the Department; or
(aa)  a person performing the duties of an office in the Department; or
(b)  the Medicare Australia CEO; or
(c)  an employee of Medicare Australia.
A new section, 23DZZ1AB, provides that the accreditation status of accredited practices for Medicare benefits will be recorded on the diagnostic imaging register. The type of information will be recorded and will be prescribed by regulations when the legislative instrument for the scheme is made. Another new section, 23DZZ1AC, outlines the process and features that a diagnostic accreditation scheme as outlined in the legislative instrument must include, including full and proper review mechanisms for reconsideration of an accreditation decision.
Another new section, 23DZZ1AD, deals with the reconsideration by the minister of accreditation decisions. It applies where an accreditation provider does not grant accreditation, renew accreditation or revokes accreditation or varies an existing accreditation status, such that there would be a reduction of Medicare benefit entitlements. According to the explanatory memorandum, the minister’s decision will not be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because the minister’s decision is a review of a decision of an approved accreditation provider, which itself will be required to have a full and proper review mechanism in place.
New section 23DZZ1AE makes clear that the proprietor of an unaccredited premises or base must notify their patient before the patient undertakes the diagnostic imaging procedure that Medicare benefits are not payable. The proprietor must also advise the patient of the reason why no Medicare benefit is payable—that is, that the premises are not accredited for the procedure the patient is requesting. The offence for unaccredited sites is a strict liability offence, carrying a fine of 10 penalty units for an individual, currently $1,100, and 30 penalty units for a corporation, currently $3,300.
New section 23DZZ1AF provides that, where the proprietor has failed to notify the patient of the accreditation status or where no Medicare benefit is payable, the amount of Medicare benefit paid to the patient in respect of a diagnostic imaging service is recoverable from the proprietor of a diagnostic imaging premises. This debt will be in addition to any fine imposed on the proprietor.
Another new section, 23DZZ1AG, imposes the same rights and responsibilities on partnerships for the purposes of accreditation arrangements. These are substantial changes proposed by the bill. The introduction of an accreditation scheme via a legislative instrument for radiologists is clearly aimed at improving standards within the sector and making proprietors liable if correct procedures are not followed. These are worthy objectives. Obviously, these accountability measures will also enhance the service experienced by consumers.
Items 1 to 4 are minor amendments, inserting new definitions and cross-references. Items 6 to 8 clarify sections in the act and align them with the new accreditation processes. Items 9 and 10 amend subsection 23DZT(2) and section 23DZU, respectively, to exclude details about the accreditation status of a practice site to be released in extracts published on the internet. Item 12 contains the transitional arrangements for practices in operation at the time the diagnostic imaging scheme comes into effect. According to the explanatory memorandum, as long as a practice has registered for accreditation before 1 July 2008 it will have provisional accreditation, and the services rendered by the practice will continue to be eligible for Medicare benefits until such time as the practice goes through the accreditation process. Item 13 provides that new sections 23DZZ1AE and 23DZZ1AF apply only to diagnostic imaging procedures carried out on or after 1 July 2008.
Subject to the passage of this legislation, the government has indicated that the commencement date for the proposed scheme will be 1 July 2008. Presumably, this will coincide with the commencement of the new MOU between the Commonwealth and the diagnostic imaging sector, as the current MOU runs from 1 July 2003 to the end of June 2008. Among the current MOU’s principles and objectives are objectives to promote access to quality, affordable radiology services and to improve the quality and delivery of radiology services. These are all worthy objectives. Labor considers that these objectives would be even better served by greater investment in, and a broader emphasis on, e-health, particularly teleradiology.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-06-13,"—The most arbitrary disenfranchising of what are probably the most vulnerable communities in Queensland is about to be undertaken by the Queensland Labor government. At a time when we should be encouraging Queenslanders to decentralise and removing the pressure on water, the Labor government is giving every indication that the only place to live is Brisbane. In Queensland, the Labor government, which is supposed to look after the worker, is about to put many jobs, household incomes, house repayments and hopes under threat. It is going to drown the lives of those on the Mary River and create a poverty corner at Cunnamulla. The Labor government has perfected the ruthless delivery of its arbitrary nastiness. It has devolved into a regime that partakes in a regional annihilation of the social fabric of hope in sections of Queensland. Labor has proved that all can descend through the folly of self-aggrandisement to verge on the tyrannical. A government which spends hundreds of millions of dollars on art galleries in a city that is running out of water, and which then distracts attention with a Mugabe-like attack to clear the regional council squatters, is no longer a vestige of the just deliberation of power but has become an anathema.
Hundreds of thousands of anxious Queenslanders—from the coastal strip of Noosa to the Tasmania sized shire of Boulia—are waiting to see if the character of their communities will be irrevocably damaged by the Beattie government’s plan to forcibly amalgamate their councils. A seven-member reform commission will hand down a report in August. This is the axe hanging over the head of many local communities in Australia’s most decentralised state. Queenslanders are not unusual in their desire to have a government that is close and responsive to the people. Local government is all about Queenslanders having the freedom to solve their own problems locally. They do not want the ever-present hand of a distant government, state or federal, treating them like children and telling them how to organise garbage collection or where to build roads. In essence, there are many who believe that this is clear sign that the community of interest has now diverged so far that they must ask whether they need to have new states or new premiers to lead them. Alternatively, others ask whether we need states at all. Both questions are motivated by the Labor government’s butchering of the ‘fair go for all’ Queensland ethos.
Local government is older than parliamentary government. Our political institutions arose out of the consent given by local communities to the larger entities—whether state or federal. This was clearly understood by founding fathers such as our first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton. During the Constitutional Convention debate in Adelaide in 1897, Barton quoted from the British historian Edward Freeman. Freeman believed that true federations were unions of pre-existing city states. Barton’s use of Freeman’s quote at the Constitutional Convention in 1897 is worth repeating in the context of a state government seeking to destroy local representation:
The greater aggregate was simply organised after the model of the lesser elements, out of whose union it was formed. In fact, for the political unit, for the atom which joined with its fellow atoms to form the political whole, we must go to areas yet smaller ... That unit, that atom, the true kernel of all our political life must be looked for ... in England—smile not while I say it—in the parish vestry.
What Barton and Freeman understood is that other levels of government derive their legitimacy from the smaller units. What we see in Queensland at the moment is not inspiring but, rather, dictating—confusing strength with belligerence and riding roughshod over the vulnerable. In common-law countries, local government did predate parliamentary government. While kings unified England politically, there has always been a strong tradition of respect for local self-government. In the United States, there is a particularly strong tradition of this as people went out and settled regions which they effectively governed themselves. This has also been a factor in the Australian experience. Yes, we are parochial about where we live and we do not like others telling us how to govern our local affairs. This is steeped in our consciousness from hundreds of years of local government in Western communities. What is happening in Queensland today is a reversal of that history and a progression of what began in Queensland under a previous Labor political figure.
Queensland towns were once better endowed with local courthouses; clerks of the court; branch railway lines, preserving local roads from being carved up by heavy trucks; two-person police stations, which were open on weekends; and local hospital boards. The demise of these local services was instigated during the Queensland cabinet office tenure of its then departmental head Mr Kevin Rudd. The Beattie government’s assault on local government is a repeat performance of an ALP government of yesteryear which also did not care about rural or regional Queenslanders. The instigater of this gutting of regional and rural Queensland, whose legacy lives on in the Beattie government’s move to further damage communities by amalgamating councils, is now seeking to lead the Australian government.
It is worth revisiting how Mr Rudd paved the way for today’s council amalgamations. Forty-six courthouses were closed under Mr Rudd. They included: Allora, Aramac, Augathella, Babinda, Bell, Biggenden, Boonah, Calen, Cambooya, Canungra, Capella, Cardwell, Carmila, Cecil Plains, Clifton, Collinsville, Cooyar, Crows Nest, Dimbulah, Edward River, Eidsvold, Eton, Eulo, Finch Hatton, Forsayth, Gin Gin, Biru, Goombungee, Gordonvale, Harrisville, Helidon, Herberton, Home Hill, Inglewood, Injune, Jandowae, Jericho, Jondaryan, Kilcoy, Kilkivan, Killarney, Kumbia, Laidley, Malanda, Many Peaks, Marburg, Millaa Millaa, Millmerran, Miriam Vale, Miles, Mitchell, Monto, Morven, Mount Garnet, Mount Larcom, Mount Molloy, Mount Morgan, Mount Perry, Moura, Mundubbera, Nebo, Peranga, Prairie, Proston, Ravenshoe, Rolleston, Rosewood, Silkwood, Springsure, Surat, Texas, Thallon, Theodore, Tiaro, Torrens Creek, Wandoan, Wondai, Wowan, Yarraman, Yelarbon and Yungaburra. I put them on the record to show the sort of gutting that Mr Rudd has been responsible for.
Rail closures included the Inglewood to Texas line, the Takura line, Pialba to Urangan, Melawondi to Brooloo, Goolara to Theodore, Cobarra to Greenvale, Cloncurry to Kajabbi, Duchess to Dajarra, Hendon to Allora, Dalby to Bell, Oakey to Cecil Plains, Rannes to Wowan and Murgon to Byee. Only widespread condemnation and backlash saved more than one-third of the state’s rail lines. In addition to rail closures and associated loss of jobs, eight rail positions were cut at Home Hill, six positions were cut at Ayr, 23 positions were cut at Cloncurry, and the closure of the Townsville rail workshop resulted in the loss of 420 jobs. Ipswich and Banyo rail workshops were also closed. This is from the party that is supposed to protect the worker.
Six hundred jobs were cut at the department of primary industries. DPI suffered a 20 per cent reduction in its budget. DPI offices were closed at Miles, Mitchell, Millmerran and Wandoan. Extension officers were removed from country towns and research stations were closed. Police stations were unmanned on weekends. One-man police stations were closed and two-man stations became one-man stations. Four hundred and three teaching positions were lost. Many small country schools were closed. Many country school principals were either transferred or sacked. Funds for rural school libraries were cut. Rural TAFE projects were cut. Funds for rural education projects were cut.
The downgrading of education services in rural Queensland forced families to move out of those centres. Hospital boards were sacked and all administration moved to Brisbane and/or regional health authorities, which were an unmitigated failure, paving the way for the Dr Patel scandal. Local fire services boards were sacked and all administration was moved to Brisbane. Local ambulance boards were sacked and all administration was moved to Brisbane. This was the legacy of the head of the department of cabinet in the Goss Labor government—one Mr Kevin Rudd.
Emboldened by Mr Rudd’s reform agenda, Mr Beattie felt free to unilaterally pull out of the Size, Shape and Sustainability process of voluntary reform that was proceeding in cooperation with Queensland’s local councils. The Size, Shape and Sustainability process had been running for just 14 months, not two years as claimed by the state Labor government. In a true spirit of cooperation and partnership, local government was participating in the SSS process in good faith. More than 30 major changes were proposed at the time the voluntary reform process was scrapped. But even before SSS, councils recognised the need to change. Since 1994, Queensland elected councillors had voluntarily reduced their numbers by 200 positions. I do not recall any politicians voluntarily agreeing to abolish their positions in the name of smaller, more efficient government.
Since the Beattie Labor government’s betrayal of communities there has been a massive backlash: 22,000 people have attended rallies and 36,000 people have made submissions to the Local Government Reform Commission. That the seven commissioners can consider 36,000 submissions and make recommendations for amalgamations across Queensland in three months is a complete and utter nonsense, and it shows the sort of regime that is currently in place in Queensland. This is the sort of government I imagine we can expect on the ascension of Mr Rudd. It is obvious that this is a sham process. A case for compelling, urgent arbitrary action has not been made. While he was the architect of the last round of the gutting of services in regional areas, even Mr Rudd realises the case for forced amalgamations has not been made. I doubt his sincerity but, nonetheless, on 17 May he told ABC radio:
If you’re going to seek to bring about greater economic efficiencies with councils, and let’s face it a number of them need to see that happen, there are other ways other than forced amalgamations to achieve that.
If you look at their current terms of reference I believe they are skewed far too much in the direction of bringing about forced amalgamation options.
They’ll make up their own mind, but my request to the premier to look at a review and reappraise the powers they have been given is based on that principle.
Despite his form in destroying rural communities, Mr Rudd has now had a road to Damascus experience. It is amazing how the electoral imperative suddenly focuses the mind. But secure in the knowledge that he is doing this at the start of a new term of government, Peter Beattie has refused to listen to Mr Rudd. Some would suggest that this is just contrived theatrics to get Mr Rudd off the hook. Sure, there are a small number of shires sailing close to the wind, but this is hardly a reason for wholesale forced amalgamations. But without taxpayers’ dollars the state government would also be in financial trouble. All it has to do, as we have seen in the latest budget, is increase taxes and borrow more. Surely, if financial trouble were a determinant of amalgamations, then after the federal Labor government left us with $96 billion in debt we should have amalgamated with—I don’t know who—Samoa or New Zealand, perhaps. The last federal Labor government was in such a financial mess that it left Australia with a $96 billion interest bill that cost $8 billion a year to service. Had the coalition not been elected with its policies of strong economic management, a case could have been made for amalgamation—with whom, one could only suggest.
Local government, while not having access to a growth tax like GST, had to make do with prudent financial management to survive. The Rural Doctors Association of Queensland is worried that council amalgamations will impact on the effectiveness of health services in rural and remote areas with Indigenous communities. Cloncurry doctor Sheila Cronin says many western councils, like Diamantina and Cloncurry, have dramatically improved their health services in recent years. But Dr Cronin claims that super shires will take away local decision-making powers and make it harder for council—run health services to operate. Dr Cronin said:
Remote communities are trying to get through to people in Brisbane that their communities, they are hundreds and hundreds of kilometres apart.
They cannot just travel half an hour and then sit down with a CEO or mayor of their local shire. If these amalgamations happen, these communities are going to be hundreds and hundreds of kilometres from where the shire chamber might be.
Towns with a significant local government presence that would be adversely affected include Birdsville, Bedouri, Cunnamulla, Tambo, Ilfracombe, Boulia, Noosa and Chinchilla. People in most of these shires already face some of the biggest travel distances in the free world to get to their first level of government. In Cloncurry shire, shire engineers are moved around by helicopter, as the towns are at least 200 kilometres apart. Councillor Kelsey Neilson is a councillor from Boulia. This is a shire of more than 60,000 square kilometres—the size of Tasmania. She says: ‘We choose to live here, we love our towns and the state needs us to live here. We look after the outback.’
We should be encouraging decentralisation in Australia, not trying to squeeze everyone onto the coastal fringe. Gutting services in the bush by forcing councils to amalgamate into super shires bigger than many European countries will not encourage people to move away from the south-east corner. This is economic rationalism gone mad and it is completely out of step with the realities of Queensland.
I am a long-time supporter of inland Australia. I choose to live in the inland and make my life and that of my family’s there. Without the services of my local council and the flow-on effects of the economic activity generated by it, it would not be tenable to live inland. The cynic in me says that there is another agenda here. Mr Beattie is the master of political diversions. A huge fight in the bush takes up valuable news time— (Time expired)

I refer the minister to his answer yesterday where he said that the Liberal Party paid $2,128.50 for food and $1,476.52 for drinks for the fundraiser held at Kirribilli House on 1 June 2007. Does the minister know of anywhere else in Australia where you can entertain 225 people and feed them oysters, prawns, so-called posh soup and other gourmet food for $9.50 a head and give them all the fine wine they can drink for $6.50 a head?

What I think is actually fishy, through you, Mr President, to Senator McEwen, is the behaviour of the South Australian Labor Party in dumping Senator Wong to the No. 2 position and dumping Senator Kirk right off the ticket to put a union hack called Don Farrell, a failed Labor candidate from 1988, into the No. 1 position on the Senate ticket. That is what is very fishy, Senator McEwen. As to your question about—

Now, I do not know what information or what expertise they have in commercial catering costs. All I can do is report to the Senate, as I did yesterday, that this was the cost of the food and the beverages for the supply of Liberal Party delegates and observers at Kirribilli House.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2007-06-13,"—My question is to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Will the minister update the Senate on the government’s support for competition in the telecommunications sector? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telecommunications</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-06-13,"—I thank Senator McGauran for a very good question indeed. Today marks the 10th anniversary of open competition in Australian telecommunications. Ten years ago the Howard government spearheaded major reforms to telecommunications long neglected by the Labor government. When the government was elected in 1996, we inherited a near duopoly in the telecommunications industry. Competition was limited and consumers were the losers. Since the government’s telecommunications reforms of 1997 there are now 167 providers vigorously competing in the telecommunications field, and there can be no argument that consumers have been the major beneficiaries of competition reforms. Fixed line prices have fallen substantially—by 18.9 per cent—and mobile service prices have fallen by a whopping 36 per cent.
In fact, since 1997, the overall price of telecommunications services has fallen by 26.2 per cent, which is a staggering amount. The Australian economy has grown by $15.2 billion since 1997, thanks to the Australian government reforms of the telecommunications sector. Only this morning, I tabled an ACCC report on the performance of the industry for the last financial year. The report showed that investment had increased from $6.3 billion in 2004-05 to $69 billion in 2005-06—signs of a very healthy framework, with increasing investment levels and increasing productivity leading to falling prices for consumers.
But it does disappoint me to see that not everyone has supported open competition of the telecommunications sector. Labor, for instance, have opposed each of the three tranches of the sale of Telstra prior to opportunistically caving in just a couple of weeks ago when they wanted to dip their paws into the honey pot and raid the Future Fund. Labor opposed the tough decisions taken by the Howard government to create a highly competitive telecommunications industry that has resulted in reduced prices and increased choices for consumers.
This is why we say, ‘Don’t listen to what Labor say in opposition; just look at what they do.’ People remember that Labor have voted against every major economic reform that has been introduced by the coalition government. Labor have voted against tax reform, against retiring their own debt, against industrial relations reform and against the introduction of competition in the telecommunications sector. Now a poll-driven Mr Rudd would have you believe that he is a fiscal conservative. His advertisement says so. As Mr Keating has so graphically reminded us, Labor cannot get out of bed in the morning without having a focus group to tell them which side of the bed to get out of. But it takes more than a focus group to run a trillion-dollar economy. It takes tough decisions and sound judgement. The massive benefit brought to consumers by the competition reforms is just another example of the dividend that is made possible by the Howard government’s strong economic management.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telecommunications</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-06-13,"—My question is to Senator Ellison, Minister for Human Services. Is the minister aware that his predecessor, Ian Campbell, has won a $35,000-a-year board appointment with Perth based IT company ASG? Is the minister aware that ASG has a six-year $14 million contract to provide IT services to the Prime Minister’s department, which its 2005 annual report says ‘greatly assisted its access to the federal government market’? Doesn’t the ASG website also list agencies in the Human Services portfolio as being among the company’s clients? Can the minister confirm whether the company is part of a consortium bidding for work on the access card project?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-06-13,"—They really are scraping the bottom of the barrel when they come up with a question like this. I think it was former communications minister Graham Richardson who became an adviser to Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd and a Nine Network commentator in 1994. We did not hear Labor complaining about that. But I will deal with the question. Let us see how we go.
To my knowledge, former senator Ian Campbell had known the director of ASG for some time. It was a person whom he knew well before his previous ministerial portfolio. But, importantly, my department has advised me that ASG is not a tenderer for any of the current access card procurement activities, including the systems integrator and card issuance and management requests for tender. In addition, tenderers for current and future access card related procurements, such as those associated with the system integrator and card issuance and management activities, are required to adhere to a probity framework. The conditions of tender associated with both tenders that I have mentioned and which will apply to future tenders specifically require that a tenderer should not, in the absence of written approval from the department, permit a person to contribute to or participate in the preparation of the tenderer’s tender or the RFT process if the person was at any time a relevant person who was involved in the planning or performance of the access card program during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of issue of this RFT or during the period from the date of issue of this RFT to the closing time. That squarely deals with the issue that Senator Sterle raises. What is more, if former senator Ian Campbell were to be involved with a tenderer accordingly in relation to that, written permission would need to be sought from the department as I have outlined. My department advises me that former senator Ian Campbell did not have any access to tenders, nor did he seek to have access to any such tenders.
I have looked at this because I knew that the opposition would try and have a go at it. There is absolutely nothing untoward about this. I have cited the probity aspects of this. I think those senators opposite who know former senator Ian Campbell well would realise that he is a man of probity and integrity, but, what is more, he has broad experience of the commercial sector and he was going to take up a position in the private sector, which he should be entitled to do.
I can go into great detail about previous Labor ministers taking up positions—for example, John Button; Ros Kelly, in the environment; and John Kerin, in forestry. Former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch subsequently advised law firms on competition policy and former immigration minister Gerry Hand set himself up as an immigration agent. They really are scraping the bottom of the barrel.

What about John Kerin, who was a primary industries minister when he took up a job in forestry? I have outlined the probity issues that apply.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-06-13,"—Mr President, my question is to the Minister for Community Services, Senator Scullion. Would the minister advise the Senate of the level of assistance that the Australian government provides to volunteers?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Volunteers</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,question
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-06-13,"—I would like to thank Senator Boyce for her question, and I note that it is her maiden question in this place. I am delighted that Senator Boyce would choose to ask a question about a very important aspect of my portfolio—that is, volunteering. Since Senator Boyce is from Queensland, I think it is also appropriate that I acknowledge the great distance that SES volunteers from Queensland have travelled to assist those people needing help in the Hunter Valley.
The Australian government also recognises the important role that volunteers play and the particular benefits they provide to local communities. We provide significant support through a number of programs, particularly in the area of financial assistance. In our recent budget, we increased to $81 million the total funding for the volunteer small equipment grants. That is over four years. In following years, up to $18 million will be available each year. That is an increase from last year, from $16 million, and the year before, from some $3 million, so it has shown a huge increase which reflects the demand for this excellent program. Over 7,200 organisations shared in the $16 million worth of grants last year.
We have extended the volunteer small equipment grants in sport scheme, which might be something the Leader of the Opposition is interested in. This component is to encourage sporting participation and better health, particularly involving young people. In previous years the volunteer small equipment grant supported groups through the purchase of equipment like barbecues, trailers, first-aid kits and sunshades, and that has been very useful. Most of those processes have been directed through volunteer resource centres. We provided another $4.8 million to the resource centres. These centres are intended to be a hub for some of the 6.3 million Australians who are wishing to volunteer. They can simply ring one of the resource centres in their area, which match a volunteer to a need.
A further $20 million will be available under a Local Answers round—that very important program—which closed on 25 May. That is on top of the $10 million Local Answers program we directed through the drought affected communities. Whilst the government has made a substantial injection of funding and assistance to volunteers, the real measure of volunteering is not really the financial support that we provide; it is what those individuals deliver to their communities.
Just before coming to question time I was speaking on the phone to both Peter Blackmore, the Mayor of Maitland, and John Clarence, the Mayor of Cessnock. The stories they tell me of how the volunteers have pulled together in the Hunter are incredible. The licensee of the Abermaine Hotel has basically opened his hotel up, put on free food and is accommodating people. He could not be found because he is out helping clean up a mate’s house. A number of people have simply turned up, in the great Australian way, to volunteer. ‘Give me a bucket and let me loose,’ was one of the quotes that the mayor gave me. We have had 2,500 SES volunteers travel from right around Australia—from New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Australia Capital Territory—to lend a hand. I also acknowledge the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, the Red Cross, Anglicare and the other organisations for their tremendous assistance in this matter.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Senators McEwen and Wong today relating to a function for the Liberal Party held at Kirribilli House and political donations.
In Australia, the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has two official residences: Kirribilli House, on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, and the Lodge, here in Canberra. We have heard a number of interjections from senators, particularly those who were here in the period prior to 1996, about the level of policy content in our questions. I recall that a lot of the questions from a lot of the senators who were here prior to 1996 were about dog kennels, Thai teak tables and expenditure at the Lodge. We have two official residences in this country for Prime Minister Howard: Kirribilli House and the Lodge in Canberra. It is interesting that one of the first decisions Mr Howard took on taking office as Prime Minister 11 long years ago was to establish a second official residence at Kirribilli House. One residence was not good enough for Mr Howard; he had to have two—one here in Canberra and one in Sydney. One residence was good enough for the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating—and we used to get constant questions in this chamber about the alleged dog kennel and the Thai teak table. But for Prime Minister Howard, it was necessary to have two residences.
Over the last 11 years, Senator Ray, Senator Faulkner and others have highlighted the significant additional cost to the Australian taxpayer of the Prime Minister maintaining two official residences. No-one complains about the Prime Minister having one official residence. What was good enough for Paul Keating? For that matter, what was good enough for Sir Robert Menzies? I recall that the Lodge was good enough for them. But one of the first decisions Prime Minister Howard took was to introduce a second residence—Kirribilli House. As I have mentioned, my colleagues Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner have, over the last 11 years, highlighted the additional costs involved in having two official residences for the Prime Minister—the cost of alcohol, the cost of capital upgrades, the cost of security, the cost of food, the cost of curtains and the like.
As I say, no-one complains about one official residence—but two! And recent events were exposed at estimates as a consequence of the Liberal Party national conference. No-one opposes the Liberal Party national conference running business observer functions. I think this function cost about $8,000 per head. But it was a shambles. Former Senator Baume, now Mr Baume, used to say a lot in here about piggeries in relation to the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Mr Baume drew attention to the total shambles of the Liberal Party conference. Apparently it was an organisational disaster. Business observers could not understand how the supposed party of business could be so disorganised; it was a shambles. None other than former Senator Baume had to write and complain in order to get a ticket to the function—presumably the function at Kirribilli House.
—It was so popular.
—‘It was so popular,’ says Senator McGauran. There is no complaint about fundraising for business activities or for delegates, but involving Kirribilli House—the second official residence of the Prime Minister—in that fundraising activity is where the line needs to be drawn. As I said, the business observers function was apparently at a cost of about $8,000 per head. Part of the commercial fundraising package was a cocktails, wine, oysters, prawns and soup event at Kirribilli House. Kirribilli House is owned by the taxpayer and paid for by the taxpayer. It is the second residence of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. The quoted cost of that package, with associated security for some 225 guests, was $5,186.78. It does seem a suspiciously low attributed cost when you compare it to the commercial costs at a local restaurant, the Guillaume restaurant, with harbour views, where the cost is $30 a person. It does seem a suspiciously low cost on a commercial basis for providing this— (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2007-06-13,"—Certainly this is a fixation that the Labor Party have, as demonstrated by the interest they have taken with the recent conference that was held in Sydney. A function was held on 1 June at Kirribilli House. The decision to hold the function took into account previous advice that has been provided by the department—
—Reading weasel words is not a good idea.
—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, please continue.
—I will when Senator Ray stops interjecting. It was thought to be appropriate to hold such functions at Kirribilli House, and business observers were invited to attend the function. The decision to hold that function took into account previous advice given by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that it was appropriate to hold such a function on a full cost-recovery basis as long as it was not a fundraising function. The function was attended by 225 guests. The total function cost was $5,186.69, which covered food, $2,128.50; beverages, $1,476.52; casual staff, $829.57; and hire charges, $752.10. The cost of the function has been reimbursed by the Liberal Party. The food and beverage served at the function was purchased separately for the function and existing stock was not used. Audiovisual costs for the function were billed directly to the Liberal Party. The cost of full-time staff was not charged to the Liberal Party, as that cost would have been incurred in the normal running of the house. As I said, the full costs were billed to the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party has reimbursed those costs.
—I’ve heard this before. I think you used this statement yesterday.
—Senator Campbell, order!
—This is the fixation the Labor Party has with Kirribilli and the Lodge. All you had to do was listen to Labor senators at estimates recently, when they got fixated with such things as sewing machines at the Lodge. They went to great lengths to complain about a $647 sewing machine that had been purchased for the Lodge. What a fixation! For anybody that knows anything about running houses—
—Mark Scott stitched you up at estimates!
—Clearly, Senator Campbell, you do not know much about running houses, because you would know that a sewing machine is very useful in a household. In any case, you would otherwise have had to send items out, incurring further cost to the taxpayer. The point I am making is that this is the sort of fixation that you lot over there have with this sort of thing. One need only go back to the time when the Lodge and Kirribilli were occupied by those opposite. We do not hear anything about when your lot occupied Kirribilli and the Lodge. Nothing is said about the entertainment costs that were incurred at that time.
On this particular occasion, yes, the Prime Minister did hold a function at Kirribilli House. As I have said, the decision to hold the function took into account previous advice from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was appropriate to hold the function there on a full cost-recovery basis. As I have said, the cost of the function has been reimbursed by the Liberal Party. Certainly advice has been provided to that extent. I think that, as Senator Minchin said yesterday, it is not appropriate for that advice to be tabled at this point.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Liberal Party</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,13,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I want to announce today that scientists have identified a gene in Liberal Party members that causes them amnesia. Those opposite are great forgetters. They have written Malcolm Fraser out of history. They forget that their current Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, left this country with double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment, double-digit interest rates and a deficit, in constant dollars expressed today, of $25 billion. They have forgotten that, but what they have really forgotten are all the questions they asked between 1993 and 1996 about the Lodge. I remember that because I had to sit where Senator Minchin is sitting today—because Senator Gareth Evans, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, who was the foreign minister, often was not here. I had to answer stupid questions about the mythical heated dog kennels that did not exist. I had to answer questions about teak tables. I had to answer questions about Gould prints in the cabinet room, which, by the way, have appreciated in value five times over. If you wonder why we occasionally pay you back by asking questions about Kirribilli, the Lodge or the Prime Minister’s office, it is simply to say that you did exactly that so you can have a bit back.
Look at the two issues that have come up recently. Take the dining room in the Prime Minister’s office—each extra seat at the table was going to cost $125,000. This typifies this government—not the expenditure but the response. They responded later in the day by saying: ‘We’re cancelling this project. We hadn’t realised the cost.’ That would be believable except that they were told the costs in the previous December. They sacrificed this project not to save money but because the political heat was on them. The Liberal senator who spoke previously said, ‘Surely you can have one of these functions at Kirribilli.’ But this is the first, and this differs. If you just invited the Liberal Party delegates to your national convention out to Kirribilli for drinks, there is no problem because that is the history; that has happened over a number of years. But what you invited as part of a package was your business observers. You advertised it and put it up front; it was part of the inducement to sign up business observers that they could go and have drinks at Kirribilli. Frankly, what difference is there between that and the criticisms by your neocon friends in the United States of Bill Clinton’s use of the White House—the sleepovers and the fundraising that occurred? There is no difference whatsoever! This was an abuse of the Kirribilli residence.
I do not quite share the view of Senator Sherry. I do not mind the Prime Minister occupying Kirribilli and the Lodge. If you go back through the record from 1996, you will not find criticism by me of that actual decision, because, given the cost of security at the other house and all the rest of it, it did not necessarily make bad sense to occupy both. But when you do occupy both, you have a higher responsibility to the Australian taxpayer to minimise the costs. While I am on the question of costs, frankly I do not believe the explanation. I do not think you can cater for 225 people at $20 a head. That has not been my experience in all the functions that I have run. I am told that there was seafood, soup and other things and that the catering costs came in at $9 a head. I tell you what, I want to get a piece of that for all the functions we have to run. I want to know the name of the caterers. We will use them even though you have used them. We will put our principles aside, because this price is too good.
There are other issues that we have raised that we want answers to. If you have actually charged people to go, we want to know whether you had a liquor licence. It is not so much that we want you prosecuted over that, but you insist on the imposition of the law on others—that there be no exceptions, that people be prosecuted if they offend against the law—and you are subject to the same law. You are subject to the Australian electorate act, which says that donations in kind have to be declared. There is no doubt here that there have been donations in kind. We want to know whether you will in fact pass that on to the Australian Electoral Commission.
Finally, I have to say this. Every time I hear a leader get up in this place and say, ‘We acted on advice from the Prime Minister’s department,’ I would like to see that advice—and the reason for not tabling it this time is nothing more than weasel words. If it is a well-argued and cogent case then maybe we will concede some ground, but I bet it is not. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2007-06-13,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin. In so doing, I would like to correct some of the comments made by those opposite. I was a parliamentary observer at our federal council meeting. It was not, as Senator Sherry said, the Liberal Party federal conference; it was actually a council meeting and that was a very different scenario. Our federal conference is usually held in each state and we have a much larger number of people. Senator Sherry also said the whole thing was a shambles. I can assure you that it was not a shambles and that, as a parliamentarian, I gained a terrific lot from it, meeting with all the delegates and the business observers when I had the opportunity.
—Did you go? Were you there?
—I said I am not a delegate; I am a parliamentary observer. There is a difference and I will explain it.
—Did you go to Kirribilli House?
—I was not invited to Kirribilli House, because I am not a delegate. I am a parliamentary observer. There is a difference.
—So you weren’t invited?
—I did not go. I was not invited because, as I am trying to tell you—
—Order! Senator George Campbell! Senator Adams, just refer your comments to the chair and ignore the interjections.
—As I was going on to say, at this national council meeting you have delegates from each state division who are permitted to be there as delegates, and we also have our federal executive. Other people who wish to go are observers, and we have another class of observers—parliamentary observers. I was there as a parliamentary observer, and so were Senator Parry and Senator McGauran. I just wanted to set the record straight.
—Did you have to pay?
—Of course we had to pay. We paid a registration fee. Once again, we were not invited to Kirribilli House, because we are not delegates; we are parliamentary observers.
As far as parliamentary delegates went, they did not get an opportunity to mix with business observers, simply because they were involved with the council meeting. This particular social event was an opportunity for delegates from all the states to meet with the business observers. It was one of the real opportunities they had. They were invited to a social event and that was very—
—Did you lot go home?
—It was for delegates. I used to be a delegate, but now that I am a politician I am no longer one. We did not go home; we did other things. Business observers who attended Kirribilli House were really delighted with the opportunity to meet with our conference delegates from each state, as I said. The business observers and the council delegates had this rare opportunity to be able to meet and greet and talk to one another at this function because, as I have already explained, the council delegates had been involved with the council meeting over the two days that it was held. They were there talking to the ministers and senior advisers; they did not have an opportunity to speak with business observers. This is why that group of people went to Kirribilli House. As I have said, it really was a great success. All the states meeting together and our delegates, who are lay party people, to catch up with them, talk to them and socialise with them was very good. To set the record straight: the invitation to Kirribilli House was for our council delegates to meet with business observers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Liberal Party</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,13,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-06-13,"— I must say after those valiant efforts by Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Adams they should be commended back in the party room. I notice none of the other heroes over that side put their hands up to try to defend the indefensible, and I must say that, after Senator Adams’s contribution, I am a little bit more confused about who went. There might have been more than 225 guests at this nosh-up. Was it just the business observers paying the $8,000-odd for the introduction to Kirribilli House, the prawns, the rock oysters—I am assuming they would be Sydney rock oysters—and posh soup? I cannot work out what the posh soup was; maybe Julian can tell me. Maybe it was vichyssoise. I do not know, that is about the only posh soup I know of, but you would probably know of a few more. Then you have the fine wines. If you work it on the basis that there were only 225 people—I am assuming that is 225 people who paid the $8,000-odd—I am not sure if there are any freeloaders on top of that. Are those freeloaders the Liberal Party Council delegates? I am not sure from the contribution just made by Senator Adams if they are included because it may be that there are more people who have gone to this function. So if we divide this so-called cost of the function of $5,000-odd, we might have to divide it by more. That would mean that for the prawns and the Sydney rock oysters—one oyster, one prawn and the posh soup, if there are only 225 paying people it comes to $9.46 a head. That is still only 225 paying people plus these fine wines—it does not mention beer and it does not mention spirits, so I am assuming it is nice, fine wines. That is $6.46 per head. Where in Sydney can you dine and drink for that sort of money at that sort of venue? You can go to anywhere around Sydney—start at Doyles at Watsons Bay—do you think you can go in there and grog on and put your snout in the trough for two hours, have some prawns and some oysters for $9.46? Do you think you would pay $6.56 for some wine? If you go to Catalina further along, do you reckon you could do that for that amount of money? Could you dine in these nice, prime locations? Go to the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, which is right near Kirribilli House. Do you reckon you could dine at the Kirribilli Workers Club, as some people call it, for $9 for food and $6 for some grog? Not on your nelly! The only place you would be able to dine for that sort of money in that sort of location might be Harry’s Cafe de Wheels down in Woolloomooloo, and you do not get that same sort of ambience from that part of Sydney that you do looking across from Kirribilli House.
I have never been to Kirribilli House. I think Senator Campbell has in his days of dealings and all of that. I have been outside Kirribilli House protesting, but I have never been inside. I do not know when the opportunity might arise for me to go in, but I would like to know how you could feed anybody at that location and at that venue serving that type of food for that figure. You simply cannot. No wonder we question how much this cost the Liberal Party to put on. There is no way in the world, if there were 225 paying guests, that you could do this for just over five grand. I agree with Senator Ray. I do not object to the Prime Minister using this as an official residence, and I would not even object to him taking the Liberal Party Council there to show them the place, but when it is used as a fund-raising venture they should pay for it. That is the point we have been making for some time. We have seen instances of how much it costs for charities or whoever else to rent out the Great Hall; I think it is $46,000 for a few hours. What do you imagine the real cost would be to rent out Kirribilli House for the amount of hours that those Liberal Party delegates and functionaries were exposed to on that evening? I think it is outrageous. As we delve more and more into this we will find that it has been rorted by the Liberal Party and it is something that the Prime Minister, who always tries to say he is above all this, will live to regret.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-06-13,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:


Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified GST Accounting) Bill 2007


Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007.

I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2007 WINTER SITTINGS
TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED GST ACCOUNTING) BILL 2007

Purpose of the Bill

The Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified GST Accounting) Bill will amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to determine in writing simplified accounting methods to reduce the GST compliance costs on small businesses that make mixed (taxable and GST free) supplies or have mixed purchases.

Reasons for Urgency

This measure was announced in the 2007-08 Budget and is a high priority for the government.  Enactment before 1 July 2007 will allow the Commissioner to put determinations in place for use in the 2007-08 financial year.
WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2007

Purpose of the Bill

The bill:
extends the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s current temporary power of veto over bulk wheat exports until 30 June 2008;
inserts new information gathering powers for the Wheat Export Authority;
inserts a power for the Minister to direct the Wheat Export Authority to undertake investigations into certain matters;
inserts a power for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to change nominated company B;
deregulates wheat exports in bags and containers, but with the addition of a quality assurance mechanism; and
makes changes to the governance arrangements for the Wheat Export Authority that will result in it becoming an agency subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 with a skills based commission of between 4 and 6 members.

Reasons for Urgency

On 22 May 2007 the Prime Minister announced in the House of Representatives future arrangements for wheat marketing, including that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry would have his bulk veto power extended for a further 12 months.  The current temporary bulk veto power held by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is due to expire on 30 June 2007.  Urgent amendment is required to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to extend the Minister’s power and prevent the veto power reverting to AWB (International) Ltd.

Senator Milne to move on the next day of sitting:

That the Senate:

notes that:
renewable electricity generators face significant barriers to entry into the electricity market,
households selling electricity into the grid are typically paid low prices that do not fairly reflect the value of zero emission, distributed energy,
‘feed-in’ tariffs have secured market incentives, driving an unprecedented expansion of the renewables industry in several European nations, and
policies such as feed-in tariffs and renewable energy targets are intended to foster emerging industries to ensure that deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in the medium- and long‑term; and
calls on the Government to reject the recommendation of the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading that, ‘All Australian schemes that set mandatory targets for deployment of particular technologies should be wound up over time, and new ones forestalled’.

Senator Nettle to move on the next day of sitting:

That the Senate:

notes that 10 June 2007 marks 40 years since the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights; and
calls on the Australian Government to:
take action to ensure that Israel complies with United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 passed unanimously in 1967 that calls for a ‘withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict’,
ensure that humanitarian relief is provided to those who need it, particularly the children in Palestine,
stop providing arms to Israel, and
play a constructive role to ensure that peace and justice can be achieved in Palestine, Israel and the Middle East.

Senator Milne to move on 21 June 2007:

That the following matter be referred to the Economics Committee for inquiry and report by 6 October 2007:


An assessment of the benefits and costs of introducing renewable energy feed-in tariffs in Australia, including an evaluation of:

barriers to the expansion of the renewable energy industry in general and within the electricity market in Australia in particular;
the likelihood that carbon prices generated by an emission trading system will be insufficient to overcome these barriers in the near term; and
options to link the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme (with an increased target) with feed-in tariffs to guarantee a viable return on investment for investors in a range of prospective renewable energy technologies.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,14,1,speech

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-06-13,"—Before the report is adopted, it is worth commenting on two matters, but I only want to go to one. What we have in this is a process of the Selection of Bills Committee which provides the opportunity for bills to be referred to committees, to be examined by senators and for reports to be prepared and tabled in parliament. When the committee does not reach agreement with respect to bills to be referred then they are usually listed in the committee report. Two such committee bills are the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. That means the committee did not come to a conclusion about the referral to a Senate committee with respect to those two bills. In respect of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007, it is incumbent on the government in that instance to say why it should not go to a committee if there was a reference for it to go to a committee.
The statement by the government for the reasons of urgency with respect to that bill is this: timing is critical to allow Indigenous land tenure reform in the Northern Territory to proceed. Without more, the government needs to justify why it needs to pass the bill in the two weeks so it cannot go to a committee, so it cannot be considered, so you cannot have the opportunity of having the relevant stakeholders involved in the process. Of course what the reference provides for by the relevant senators is to consider the merits of a township leasing model, particularly the entity holding the land lease. It would seem that the Northern Territory land councils and other relevant parties should have been provided with an opportunity to have input into that process and to consider the merits of the various models, particularly the entity holding the land lease. That would be the relevant way, unless there were significant reasons as to why that bill could not go to a committee and be dealt with in August, as other bills are.
Of course, it now really is incumbent on this government to provide those cogent reasons. Simply stating that timing is critical to allow Indigenous land tenure reform in the Northern Territory to proceed is not sufficient reason in itself. It is a statement; it does not provide the timing. What timing is critical? Are there agreements pending? Have parties reached agreement and are now awaiting signatures? That would be helpful to know otherwise it will be assumed that this is just a bland statement without substance. It would be necessary, if the government did need the bill, to be able to at least put that case.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-13,"—I also would like to speak about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007. The Greens would have liked to have seen this referred to the committee and the committee being given an opportunity to examine it. When we briefly touched on this issue during estimates, I felt a great deal of concern about the fact that I could not be provided with clear answers to a number of my questions. Take, for example, the issue of $5 million that is to be provided from the ABA to the traditional owners on the Tiwi Islands. This is the issue we were specifically talking about. That $5 million was being given from the ABA to the traditional owners in advance of any lease money that was coming back. When I asked where that $5 million goes once the lease money has been received—nobody knew what I was talking about at first—I was told one answer and then, two hours later, I was told a different answer. The different answer was that once that money that was originally given, because it is not a loan, by the ABA to the traditional owners had been received in lease money it was then given to the entity to then fund the leases and the lease process in other towns. That sort of information and that sort of process needs to be examined. The department could not tell us the answer straightaway, nor could the minister. It took hours to get that information.
I think that is important information. I think that sort of detail is the sort of detail the committee needs to be asking about, and I am certainly not reassured that they have got this right. This legislation has been rushed, and I agree with Senator Ludwig—that is, that communities in the NT should have been able to examine this legislation and should have been able to appear before a committee to give us their opinion. This affects not only the Tiwi Islands; this also affects other areas in the NT. I bet the NLC and the CLC have fairly strong opinions on these issues. These are very significant issues that should be examined.
The other thing is that the minister said that an agreement had been reached between the traditional owners on the Tiwi Islands and the government. There was a big brouhaha about it, there was a media release, but in fact no such agreement has been reached. An MOU has been signed, with, I understand, still quite a bit of further work to be done. Information that was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs during estimates turned out to be incorrect. That is the information we found out about; we do not know how much more of that was incorrect. We do not know the full implications of this legislation, and we certainly will not be able to find it out in the short time that this place will have to consider it without it going to the community affairs committee to be examined.
I do not think enough information was provided by the government to justify why this lease has to be rushed through. It is the same sort of thing that was done last time with land rights legislation. It was rushed through, despite the government saying they had done extensive consultation, and everybody knew that large parts of that legislation had not been subject to consultation. It was the same thing with native title amendments: many of those changes were not subject to consultation. Now we have yet another repeat of the government rushing through legislation and not giving us adequate time to consider it and not even having the answers themselves.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—There are a few aspects of this report that I would like to comment on. Firstly, I would like to note that the report does refer the legislation dealing with the citizenship test to a committee. That committee has about six weeks to examine that issue, which is much longer than committees are used to getting these days but still not quite as long as the Democrats would have liked, as is shown in the appendix to the report. But at least there is some opportunity for that examination, which is more consultation than was provided when the whole issue was first put on the agenda at the end of last year.
The Democrats also share the concerns regarding the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007. This is compounding an error. When the very significant amendments to the land rights act were put through the Senate last year, they were sent to a committee and the time frame for that inquiry was totally inadequate. When you are dealing with an issue that is so fundamental, that is so important and that affects people’s rights so directly then you need to make sure that consultation was done properly. It was very clear that there was insufficient consultation with a whole range of affected traditional owner groups in the Northern Territory. That increased their anxiety, that increased their concern, and it was so obvious that that was going to happen.
Indeed, I can remember speaking in this chamber when such notions as changes to the land rights act were first floated by the government and saying that I welcomed the opportunity to debate those and that I did not have a closed mind; but the one thing the government had to do was to make sure that those changes were put forward and that the people who were directly affected were given an adequate opportunity to consult and to consider those changes. It was not so much that I or other senators should have been given the opportunity to look at them; it was that the people who were directly affected should have been given the opportunity to look at them so that they could inform us and inform themselves.
That process was so flawed that eventually even the minister himself—after it had gone through parliament, of course—did concede that there were a few flaws with the process and that it could have been done better. Yet what do we see here—legislation, admittedly much narrower in its focus but still dealing with issues and concerns that are very current, very alive, very controversial and very much surrounded in uncertainty, and the committee is being prevented from looking at it at all. If there were a start-up date of 1 July that relied on a budget measure or something like that then maybe you could justify it, but there is not.
There is simply not sufficient reason to say that this has to be rubber-stamped now and that there is no opportunity for community input or examination of the issues surrounding the legislation. It is an extremely serious abuse, I would argue, of the Senate’s power. It is a very dangerous precedent, one of the many precedents that have been set in this area in the last couple of years. But the trouble, of course, is that this becomes an ingrained practice and we all become used to it.
There are a couple of other Senate committees that are reporting back on Monday. Maybe we can get away with that sort of time frame for those bills, but we are getting more examples of grossly inadequate time frames that are simply not allowing the people who are directly affected to be consulted—let alone allowing the Senate, which is making these decisions, to consider the issues. If we become used to that practice being the norm, to that being usual—another rubber-stamped Senate committee—it will become ingrained in the community as well.
I am certainly starting to hear from people who are saying: ‘There’s no point in putting in a submission to a committee because the time frame is not long enough. It is not being taken seriously, it is being rushed through and it is all going to be rubber-stamped.’ Even if that is not accurate 100 per cent of the time—and it is not accurate 100 per cent of the time; I accept that the government does sometimes listen to recommendations in committee reports—and if that is the attitude that is developing out there then that is a serious problem and it is degrading the Senate committee system.
I would also note that the Democrats wished to have the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 referred to a committee. That has not been agreed to. I will not push that point in terms of an amendment, because there is no point. We all get used to not bothering anymore, but the point still needs to be raised that we believe it merited examination. Indeed I would suggest that other legislation dealing with journalists’ privilege—which I know is important and which I know people want passed but which only appeared less than a month ago—would have merited some examination as well. It is a serious concern and one that we need to flag every time. Otherwise, these sorts of things will become accepted practice and the Senate will not be the only loser; the community will be as well.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-06-13,"—I thank most senators in this debate for having kept their contributions very brief, and I will be doing the same. In relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007, I think it needs to be recalled that the substantive bill, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006, was in fact referred to the relevant committee for detailed consideration. The amendment bill deals with the issue of being able to allow the first township lease to be in place on the Tiwi Islands by July, when it is expected to be signed. We hope this legislation will come into force at the end of this financial year so that Aboriginal landowners will be actually given some degree of choice, which I understand the stakeholders in fact want.
In relation to Senator Siewert’s comments on this piece of legislation, in fairness, questions that you think are important at Senate estimates are not necessarily answered as the information is not at officials’ fingertips. In Senator Siewert’s contribution she indicated that she was provided with an answer a few hours later, which I think indicates that we are as responsive as we possibly can be and, of course, so are the departmental officials present. The fact that they do not have all the information at their fingertips all the time is not a matter for which any criticism ought to be levelled. It is good news for anybody listening that the officials go away and, within a matter of hours, are able to provide the answers that are being sought.
Regarding Senator Bartlett’s contribution, I think we got a tick and a cross in relation to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007. That is a new bill and we thought it appropriate that it be given appropriate time for consideration. We are looking forward to seeing full consideration by the committee in relation to that. As I said regarding the Aboriginal land rights legislation, it is just an amendment to legislation that was looked into substantively by the relevant committee only last year.
The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 is a budget measure and needs to be passed as soon as possible to provide certainty to universities who will start receiving first-round applications in September this year. Universities need to make plans now for the courses they will be offering next year. Those are the reasons: it is a budget measure and it is something that universities need to prepare themselves for by 1 January 2008. That is why we want this piece of legislation dealt with as expeditiously as possible.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-06-13,"—Before the report is adopted, it is worth commenting on two matters, but I only want to go to one. What we have in this is a process of the Selection of Bills Committee which provides the opportunity for bills to be referred to committees, to be examined by senators and for reports to be prepared and tabled in parliament. When the committee does not reach agreement with respect to bills to be referred then they are usually listed in the committee report. Two such committee bills are the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. That means the committee did not come to a conclusion about the referral to a Senate committee with respect to those two bills. In respect of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007, it is incumbent on the government in that instance to say why it should not go to a committee if there was a reference for it to go to a committee.
The statement by the government for the reasons of urgency with respect to that bill is this: timing is critical to allow Indigenous land tenure reform in the Northern Territory to proceed. Without more, the government needs to justify why it needs to pass the bill in the two weeks so it cannot go to a committee, so it cannot be considered, so you cannot have the opportunity of having the relevant stakeholders involved in the process. Of course what the reference provides for by the relevant senators is to consider the merits of a township leasing model, particularly the entity holding the land lease. It would seem that the Northern Territory land councils and other relevant parties should have been provided with an opportunity to have input into that process and to consider the merits of the various models, particularly the entity holding the land lease.

It is good news for anybody listening that the officials go away and, within a matter of hours, are able to provide the answers that are being sought.
Regarding Senator Bartlett’s contribution, I think we got a tick and a cross in relation to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007. That is a new bill and we thought it appropriate that it be given appropriate time for consideration. We are looking forward to seeing full consideration by the committee in relation to that. As I said regarding the Aboriginal land rights legislation, it is just an amendment to legislation that was looked into substantively by the relevant committee only last year.
The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 is a budget measure and needs to be passed as soon as possible to provide certainty to universities who will start receiving first-round applications in September this year. Universities need to make plans now for the courses they will be offering next year. Those are the reasons: it is a budget measure and it is something that universities need to prepare themselves for by 1 January 2008. That is why we want this piece of legislation dealt with as expeditiously as possible.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I present the sixth report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 6 of 2007, dated 13 June 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:

That the Senate take note of the report.

In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 6 of 2007, I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to two bills that seek to establish offences of strict liability, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 and the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007.
Proposed new subsection 100B(1A) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, to be inserted by item 5 of schedule 2 of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007, and proposed new subsection 101AA(1A) of the same act, to be inserted by item 7 of schedule 2 of the bill, apply strict liability to the element of the location of a foreign fishing boat in the Australian fishing zone, contained in the offences in sections 100B and 101AA of that act. The result of these proposed amendments is that, in a prosecution under either of those sections, the prosecution will only have to establish that fishers were in the territorial sea of Australia, not that they intended to be in such waters.
The Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers states that applying strict liability to a particular physical element of an offence, as is proposed in this instance, may be considered appropriate where there is ‘demonstrated evidence that the requirement to prove fault of that particular element is undermining or will undermine the deterrent effect of the offence, and there are legitimate grounds for penalising persons lacking “fault” in respect of that element.’
The explanatory memorandum to the bill seeks to justify the imposition of strict liability on the basis that the ‘Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has not been able to prosecute people for these offences because there have been difficulties collecting sufficient evidence to prove that the people intended to be in the territorial sea.’ However, the explanatory memorandum does not outline what ‘demonstrated evidence’ there is to support this assertion and the committee remains unclear about the extent to which the imposition of strict liability in these instances is consistent with the guide.
Proposed new subsection 161A(4) of the Corporations Act 2001, to be inserted by item 50 of schedule 1 of the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007, creates an offence of strict liability in respect of certain companies which fail to set out their former name on all of their public documents and negotiable instruments. The explanatory memorandum states only that these offence provisions are ‘comparable to existing subsection 541(2)’ of the Corporations Act 2001, and that ‘several other offence provisions in the [Corporations] Act have similar penalties’.
The explanatory memorandum does not indicate whether the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers has been taken into account in framing these offences. The guide states that the application of strict liability to all physical elements of an offence is generally only considered appropriate where, among other matters, the offence is not punishable by imprisonment. However, item 121 of schedule 1 of this bill would increase the penalty for an offence against which these strict liability provisions apply to 10 penalty units or imprisonment for three months or both. The explanatory memorandum provides no explanation for this apparent deviation from the guide.
The committee recognises that the imposition of strict liability offences may be warranted by a range of circumstances; however, fault liability is one of the most fundamental protections of criminal law and to exclude this protection is a serious matter. Where a bill seeks to impose an offence of strict liability, the committee expects that the explanatory memorandum will clearly demonstrate that the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers has been consulted by documenting the evidence supporting the imposition of these offences and providing a clear rationale for any deviation from the guide. The committee has sought advice from the relevant ministers with respect to each of these bills. Pending the receipt of this advice, I draw the Senate’s attention to these bills.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,23,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-06-13,"—I am not a member of this committee but used to be at one stage. Fortuitously, I am in the chamber dealing with the next report. In response to Senator Ray’s comments about the fisheries bill and his seeking some advice as to why the strict liability offences were included, I refer Senator Ray to and remind him of the chase of the Viarsa. That incident occurred when the Australian patrol vessel the Southern Supporter came across the Viarsa in Australian territory and then proceeded to chase it all the way across three oceans through 30-metre seas and ice floes and apprehended it, with the assistance of the South African Navy and the British fisheries vessel out of the Falklands, not far from Montevideo, where the Viarsa was running to.
We brought the vessel back to Australia and then a couple of years of legal procedures transpired. The jury were hung in the first instance and were discharged, and the second jury trial went for quite a number of weeks. There were a lot of returns for directions by the judge, and there appeared to be one juror holding out but eventually all of the jurors found that the offences were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt under the standard of proof required.
I only relate this to say that it is very difficult in these types of areas to pinpoint on a map exactly where a vessel was and what its intention was. Obviously, the Commonwealth and the DPP thought they had sufficient evidence for the jury to convict—hence the two trials—but in the end result the jury were not convinced. I, of course, was not on the jury. But it was very difficult to prove the point and to get the conviction. As it turned out, we were able to forfeit the boat and the fuel and the patagonian toothfish on board, but that was under another element of the same act.
So it was following those instances and a couple of others like it—where the difficulty in pinpointing particular locations in a vast ocean away from the normal support you would get to do that sort of pinpointing was evident—that instructions were given to the department to try and come up with some way that we could get convictions for people who quite clearly were, although it could not be proved to the jury, fishing illegally in Australian waters.
As a former lawyer, I understand Senator Ray’s hesitation about strict liability offences. They are offences that should only ever be legislated for in extreme circumstances. But I think this instance is one where those strict liability offences are very appropriate. No doubt, when the bill comes before the chamber, these matters will be gone into at greater length. But I thought it might be helpful to advise the chamber, at least in that instance and the instance of the fisheries amendment bill, of the background to why those strict liability offences have been included.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-13,"—As I was saying prior to the Senate moving on to other business, the principles and objectives of the radiology memorandum of understanding include the need to promote access to quality, affordable radiology services and to improve the quality and delivery of radiology services. These are objectives that we should all aspire to and that we are hopeful this legislation will in fact deliver. Labor does, though, consider that these objectives would be even better served by a greater investment in and emphasis on e-health broadly and teleradiology in particular.
In March this year my colleague Senator Conroy announced Labor’s broadband policy—an area on which the government continues to bury its head in the sand. As announced in March, federal Labor will revolutionise Australia’s internet infrastructure by creating a new national broadband network that will connect 98 per cent of Australians to high-speed broadband internet services at speeds over 40 times faster than most current speeds. Broadband offers enormous opportunities for e-health, enhancing the potential for a range of cost savings and service improvements for Australian citizens. E-health in particular has the potential to significantly improve access to healthcare services for Australians living in rural and regional areas as well as those Australians who find it difficult to leave their homes, including the elderly and those people with disabilities. It also offers ways to more flexibly and conveniently utilise our stretched health workforce.
Teleradiology, the electronic transmitting of radiographic patient images and consultative text from one location to another, is already being utilised in Australia, but enhanced broadband technology provides the key to significantly expanding these services. Given the national shortage of radiologists—another area given insufficient attention by the current minister—expanding the use of teleradiology would also be a focus of the next radiology memorandum of understanding. When we see reports such as the one that appeared in the Hobart Mercury on 29 March 2007 stating that Tasmanian women were waiting weeks for the results of breast-screening mammograms sent to New South Wales to be read, we can see the advantages of technology that would allow digital images to be transmitted between and viewed instantaneously by surgeries and clinics, hospitals or, in this case, specialists in different states.
Recently I was on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait. There the Queensland government has installed a very high quality X-ray machine. It has installed a telehealth facility at Thursday Island hospital. This is to serve the needs, in particular, of people who are travelling from Papua New Guinea to Australia, potentially with tuberculosis, to be diagnosed quickly. That is absolutely essential not only for their health but also for the health of Australians living on Saibai Island. The Queensland government has funded that service. You can imagine what an advantage it would be if we had these e-health type services in remote parts of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin.
I return to the bill. As I said, the proposed start date for the accreditation scheme is 1 July 2008. This was postponed from 1 September 2007 after concerns were expressed by stakeholders. Labor remain concerned that the proposed scheme will not be ready to commence by July next year. The government has failed to provide sufficient detail about how this scheme will operate. The bill does not provide operational details of the proposed scheme such as the standards to be used, the names of the approved accreditors, the accreditation process and the period of accreditation. Rather, it simply allows the minister to establish, through a legislative instrument, the rules and operational details of the scheme. Whilst we recognise the sector’s support for the introduction of an accreditation scheme, we note that representatives of the diagnostic imaging sector have previously raised concerns relating to the operational details of the scheme. Labor share their concern that the full policy implications are yet to be announced.
Labor are also critical of the situation that full costings for the introduction of the accreditation scheme are yet to be determined. According to the explanatory memorandum for the bill, the introduction of the accreditation scheme will require enhancements to Medicare’s processing systems. These costs have not yet been quantified, but they are estimated to be $1.2 million based on previous similar policies. According to the explanatory memorandum, full costings will be provided when the subordinate legislation is developed. It is expected that these costs will be funded from existing budgetary measures for the provision of diagnostic imaging services. This lack of detail is typical of the Howard government’s shabby approach to health in particular. It is a government that is tired and out of touch. Unfortunately, lack of preparation, lack of detail and lack of interest are consistent features of the Minister for Health and Ageing’s approach to legislation and the health portfolio more generally. We hope that the government allocates the requisite resources to get this accreditation process sorted out and off the ground in time for the 1 July deadline. We look forward to receiving more detail in due course.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING ACCREDITATION) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2007. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to establish a legislative framework that will enable the introduction of an accreditation scheme for practices providing diagnostic imaging services covered by the Radiology Quality and Outlays Memorandum of Understanding. The explanatory memorandum to this bill states:
There is currently no regulatory mechanism that helps to ensure all the elements involved in the delivery of diagnostic imaging services work together.
The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:
As such, there is no guarantee to patients that optimal radiology services are being provided.
This is an incredible omission by the Howard government. Medicare pays over $1.6 billion a year for radiology services. Over the last two years this cost has increased significantly compared with the previous years of 2004-2005. In 2004-05 the cost of Medicare radiology services went up by 11.5 per cent. In 2005-06 the cost went up by 8.5 per cent.
No amount of rhetoric will negate the failure of the Howard government to properly support Australia’s public hospital system. Neither the government’s GP policies and its support of private hospitals through private health insurance subsidies, nor its aged-care policies have taken pressure off public hospitals, emergency departments or the demand for public hospital beds. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will understand, therefore, my scepticism that the proposed measures to change the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, will deliver all the benefits claimed by the government.
An essential point to be made from the outset is that the PBS is an integral part of the universal health system. The PBS is not just a government cost centre that needs to be managed simply in cost-accounting terms. Access to appropriate medicine has huge health and economic benefits for the country and for individuals. Access to appropriate medicine not only saves and prolongs lives; it can greatly reduce the overall cost of illness to individuals and the economy. Australia has been well served over the past 50 years by our national government’s participation in ensuring the universal availability and affordability of medical practitioner prescribed medicines.
—Are you sure!
—I lost my place; I will go back to the figures I was talking about earlier. Those figures would indicate that the radiology services funding agreed to and set out in the June 2003 memorandum of understanding between the radiology profession and the private providers of diagnostic imaging services has already been breached. This should be a warning sign to the government about its ability to invoke the cooperation of the medical profession and private medical service providers to ensure that Australia has a health and medical services system that is accessible and affordable to all Australians. Even though Medicare meets approximately 83 per cent of the total cost of radiology services in this country, the government is not able to assure members of the Medicare scheme that they will receive optimal radiology care. Not only that, but the government has also admitted that neither it nor Medicare Australia has the power to enforce minimum radiological service standards. This is in spite of the fact that the current MOU between the government and the radiology profession and the diagnostic imaging service providers includes a provision that mandatory accreditation of radiology practices will be introduced by November 2005. This obviously has not occurred.
It is now four years after the signing of the agreement with the radiologists, and what do we have by way of legislation? A bill merely to establish the framework to enable the introduction of a radiology practice accreditation scheme. That is not a great deal of progress in four years. Clearly, at this rate, patients are not going to see a radiology services accreditation scheme with enforceable standards any time soon. It is also interesting to note that the explanatory memorandum to this bill indicates that the peak industry body for private specialist diagnostic imaging practices—that is, ADIA—has indicated that it is not at all enthusiastic about the proposed accreditation model put forward by the Howard government. ADIA’s opposition to the proposed model appears to be because of the perceived cost of the model to diagnostic service providers, even though the cost will be minuscule compared to the revenue generated in providing government funded diagnostic medical services. With respect to the government’s radiology practice accreditation proposal, ADIA put forward an alternative model which, from the small amount of information available, seems to be very close to a form of self-regulation rather than a rigorous and independent accreditation process.
There is no question that radiology services are critical to the health of millions of Australians. What does warrant questioning is that we have large, sophisticated companies generating huge revenues annually from the government—in some cases, hundreds of millions of dollars—yet these companies appear reluctant to embrace accountability. You can see what the business strategy is. As soon as the government suggests that there should be any form of regulation to protect the interests of Australians, business immediately starts clamouring about costs in order to frighten the government into watering down the introduction of necessary standards. I have no doubt that that is what ADIA is about.
This will be a real test for the government to see whether it has the backbone to stand up to the spoiling tactics of corporate medicine when it comes to finalising the planned radiology practice accreditation scheme. But, as we know, the government’s track record on standing up to corporate medicine is pretty appalling. Corporate medicine has been rapidly building up large corporate empires on the back of the Medicare scheme and government subsidies to the private health sector through the private health insurance system. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this if the benefits of a more cost-efficient and effective medical services system flow to all Australians. However, there is little evidence that this has occurred.
Corporatisation of Australia’s medical services organisations has not decreased the real cost to patients of medical and hospital services. All the returns from any efficiency gains have gone into the pockets of the large medical and hospital service corporations. So there we have it again: the Howard government letting down patients. The explanatory memorandum to the bill, in discussing the regulatory problem that the bill addresses, states: 
Effective management, available resources, information systems capable of monitoring patient progress, and multi-disciplinary teamwork contribute to a high quality service being provided. In other words, health outcomes are impacted by each element/activity carried out by the practice when delivering a diagnostic imaging service.
In other words, a patient’s care outcome depends on how effectively all elements of the diagnostic and treatment process interact. How, then, can the accreditation of one part of the diagnostic and treatment process ensure optimum patient outcomes? What is required is a medical services accreditation and standards monitoring regime that encompasses the whole of a patient’s diagnostic and treatment process rather than the piecemeal approach adopted by the Howard government.
Furthermore, a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the management of a patient does not look to be supported by the Australian Medical Association, the AMA. This to me seems very strange. Why wouldn’t the peak body for doctors advocate rigorous accountability across the network of medical disciplines that knit together to ensure a patient receives optimal care? This is where corporate medicine has something to offer in the way it is able to link up, for the patient’s benefit, GP, radiology and pathology services within the one service regime. The federal government has a responsibility to harness the benefits of corporate medicine and deliver those benefits to patients. And, from a patient’s point of view, until there is cross-discipline accreditation, patients cannot be assured that they are receiving optimal care.
In many ways, the proposed radiology practice accreditation scheme looks very much like a rerun of the Professional Services Review Scheme, or PSR Scheme—that is, lots of words and very little effect. Indeed, the PSR is a prime example of the incompetence of this government when it comes to setting up and supporting government regulatory bodies whose role is to protect the interests of ordinary Australians against the excesses of powerful medical interest groups and big business. The PSR is supposed to protect the integrity of the Medicare scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
I would like to quote from comments made by the director of the PSR, Dr Tony Webber. He obviously has very serious doubts about his organisation’s ability, as currently organised and resourced, to prevent exploitation of Medicare’s $9 billion-a-year benefit payments. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald in January 2006, Dr Webber indicated that evidence was emerging that doctors working for corporatised medical chains had geared their software and patient management systems to maximise returns from Medicare. He further indicated that there was evidence that some of the services, including pathology and radiology, were inappropriate. More worryingly, Dr Webber is reported to have said:
My concern is that where corporate medicine is having a strong influence on doctors, it raises suspicion that there is a lot of money potentially being wasted.
Dr Webber went on to say:
Medicare benefits are not designed to give a doctor a reasonable income and give corporates a 20% return on investment without compromise to standards of care.
There is no doubt that the director of the PSR would not have made these comments if he had felt that he had either the power or the resources to even up the contest between the profit intentions of corporate medicine and the maintenance of the objectives and financial integrity of the Medicare scheme. These comments should set alarm bells ringing for the government in respect of its radiology practice accreditation plans.
We know from the PSR’s Report to the Professions 2005-06 that a review of possible inappropriate practice by an individual medical practitioner, in respect of claiming Medicare benefits, can take as long as three to four years to bring to completion. Even then, the final outcome is not certain if the medical practitioner concerned contests the PSR decision in the Federal Court. It is also interesting to note that in 2005-06, when a medical practitioner contested a PSR decision in the Federal Court, there was a high probability of the medical practitioner concerned having the PSR decision overturned. In 2005-06 the Federal Court handed down 17 decisions in favour of the person under review and six decisions in favour of the PSR. To claim that the PSR can be held up as the protector of the integrity of the Medicare scheme is highly questionable. The question needs to be asked: why do we have such an apparently ineffective watchdog? Why is it that individual doctors can incur financial sanctions for misconduct in respect of their use of Medicare but the corporations for whom they work are apparently immune from penalty?
While the corporates own the show, the government deals with the bit players. How crazy is this? The government penalises individual medical practitioners for inappropriate prescribing practices but not the corporates for whom they work. There is no indication that the Howard government understands the realities of the commercial world of medical services provision in Australia, which the government is effectively funding through Medicare. While the corporates are drawing huge revenues from Medicare, the government’s surveillance of the integrity of the Medicare scheme and of the interests of the taxpayer is concentrated on individual doctors.
The result of this action is that the corporates who employ the radiologists have managed to disappear off the government’s Medicare surveillance radar. The government has apparently no idea of the amount of Medicare funding that flows to the large corporate medical services providers. This situation has occurred because the AMA has bludgeoned the government into establishing a professional services review scheme that is completely inadequate. You would not believe it if you read it in the tabloids, but it is a reality in Australia that corporate medicine is insulated from proper accountability in respect of its use of Medicare as a cash cow. It could easily be construed that AMA self-interest has effectively emasculated the PSR.
Why the Howard government constantly allows the medical profession to mangle its regulatory responsibilities is beyond belief. On top of that, in 2005-06 the PSR—let us remember that it is the Medicare scheme watchdog—only managed to claw back approximately $1.3 million in inappropriate payments made by Medicare. On the other hand, the cost of running the PSR in 2005-06 was no less than $5.4 million. You would have to wonder what this is all about. The government’s Medicare watchdog runs at a massive loss while corporate medicine reaps huge financial returns from the Medicare scheme.
So what does this all mean for the bill we are considering? Given the four-year delay in finalising the diagnostic accreditation model, how can we be assured that the radiology practice accreditation scheme will not be watered down to the detriment of patients? When the radiology practice accreditation scheme finally comes into operation, Australian consumers will need to be able to have confidence in it. It is about time that this government lived up to its responsibility to the Australian people and to Medicare. (Quorum formed)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-06-13,"—I would like to thank Senator McLucas and Senator Sterle for their contributions to this debate. On behalf of the government, I acknowledge the opposition’s support for the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2007. This bill establishes a framework under Medicare for the introduction of an accreditation scheme for practices providing diagnostic imaging services covered by the Radiology Quality and Outlays Memorandum of Understanding. Patients should have timely access to high-quality radiology services. From 1 July next year, accreditation against objective and realistic standards will become a condition for facilities providing Medicare eligible diagnostic imaging services. The impetus for accreditation is not a reflection on the quality of services now being provided. However, accreditation provides government and the community with extra assurance that the 12 million or so diagnostic imaging services supported by Medicare, at a cost of $1.2 billion annually, are provided by organisations that are able to meet specified standards. The presence of many senators in this chamber signifies the importance that the government attaches to this bill.
The government is working closely with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists and the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association, the relevant industry body, to develop a scheme that is practical and workable and that will minimise the cost to each practice. We are seeking expert advice on the standards through our extensive consultation with a wide range of bodies and a wide range of groups. The transitional arrangements in the bill will ensure that these practices will have ample time to prepare for the accreditation process. The bill also includes a mechanism to ensure that any adverse decision regarding a practice’s accreditation status will be the subject of an independent review, and so no-one will lose access to Medicare without a full and a fair process. The government is aware that there are robust discussions going on between the college and the industry on the development of the regime. We appreciate their commitment and trust that they will be able to work in collaboration with relevant professional medical groups to reach an agreement on the nature and structure of the accreditation regime. On behalf of the government and the Minister for Health and Ageing, I restate our willingness to assist the college and industry to meet the 1 July 2008 commencement date. Early agreement on the accreditation regime will ensure the necessary planning and implementation arrangements are completed in good time. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-06-13,"—by leave—I move Australian Democrat amendments (1) and (2) together:
(1)    Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 12), after item 2, insert:
2A  Paragraph 10AA(7) (definition of spouse)
Repeal the definition, substitute:

spouse,in relation to a person, includes:
              (a)    a person who is legally married to, and is not living, on a permanent basis, separately and apart from, that person; and
              (b)    another person, who although not legally married to the person, lives with the person on a bona fide domestic basis as the husband or wife of the person; and
              (c)    a person in an interdependency relationship as defined in section 10AAA.
(2)    Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 12), after item 2, insert:
2B  After section 10AA
Insert:
10AAA  Interdependency relationship
         (1)    Two persons (whether or not related by family) have an interdependency relationship under this section if:
              (a)    they have a close personal relationship; and
              (b)    they live together; and
              (c)    one or each of them provides the other with financial support; and
              (d)    one or each of them provides the other with domestic support and personal care.
         (2)    In addition, 2 persons (whether or not related by family) also have an interdependency relationshipunder this section if:
              (a)    they have a close personal relationship; and
              (b)    they do not satisfy one or more of the requirements of an interdependency relationship mentioned in paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (d); and
              (c)    the reason they do not satisfy those requirements is that either or both of them suffer from a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability.
         (3)    The regulations may specify:
              (a)    matters that are, or are not, to be taken into account in determining under subsection (1) or (2) whether 2 persons have an interdependency relationship under this section; and
              (b)    circumstances in which 2 persons have, or do not have, an interdependency relationshipunder this section.
These amendments deliver on the Prime Minister’s promise, which was made some time ago now—I think it was early last year—that he would remove financial discrimination against same-sex couples and other relationships that are interdependent. These amendments give effect to that promise in respect of the safety net which applies to Medicare. I know that this is somewhat outside the thrust of the legislation we are dealing with today but it does still apply to diagnostic imaging accreditation in the sense that diagnosis and the costs of diagnosis are captured by the Medicare safety net. The effect of these amendments would be to remove the financial discrimination that the Prime Minister said was abhorrent and to do so, as I said, for Medicare.
It would affect those in a relationship who were not previously known to be in the category of ‘partners who are legally married’. It would apply not just to those people in a same-sex relationship but also to those people who are in a relationship which is close and which is physical, in that they live together, where there is financial support provided from one to the other and where there is also a sharing of domestic support and personal care. This applies to siblings who may live together in such a relationship, to an aunt and a niece or to anyone who is not closely related but who chooses to cohabit and to have a relationship which is interdependent. There is no good argument for discrimination against such people. The same costs, the same encouragement and the same incentives should apply to those people who have such relationships and to those who are legally married—a man and his wife.
I urge the minister to accept these amendments on behalf of the government and to vote with the Democrats’ amendments, which honour the promise of the Prime Minister. If the government does not support the amendments, I would very much value advice from the minister dealing with this legislation as to when we can expect this to be the case. This was, as I understand it, an honest, sincerely made promise by the Prime Minister and now this chamber is looking for delivery. This is a perfect opportunity to do that. This is a straightforward amendment. I think everybody can understand it. The definition of ‘interdependent relationships’ was adopted for superannuation. The so-called ‘choice’ legislation introduced this concept of interdependency for those in the private sector, so it is not new and it should not be a foreign concept to the government. Again I say: the Prime Minister promised this. When will he deliver? Will it be now? I encourage that to be the case.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING ACCREDITATION) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I rise to indicate that Labor support these amendments on the basis that we would like to see some improved policy coherence on these kinds of issues. This is something that the Democrats have pursued very actively on a range of legislation, so we will support them on that basis.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING ACCREDITATION) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-06-13,"—I understand that the Australian Democrats have raised, in similar contexts, amendments to include same-sex partners in the definition of a spouse. Can I indicate to Senator Allison that the government will oppose these amendments. There are no plans to change current government policy at this time irrespective of the views of individual coalition senators. Same-sex couples cannot register as a family because Medicare is limited by the definition of ‘family’ in existing Australian government legislation. As Senator Allison did indicate, the relevant provisions are section 10AA of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and section 84B of the National Health Act 1953, which state that a family comprises a person’s spouse and/or dependent child, with ‘spouse’ being further defined as a person who is legally married to that person or de facto of that person. ‘De facto spouse’ is further clarified in section 4 of the National Health Act 1953, which defines the term as ‘a person living with another person of the opposite sex on a bona fide domestic basis although not legally married to that person’. It is this section that would need amending if same-sex families were recognised for Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits safety net purposes. There are no plans to change current government policy at this particular time, and the government will oppose this amendment.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING ACCREDITATION) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-06-13,"—I am grateful to the minister for his advice about which act and which clause would need to be amended in order to deliver on this piece of social justice and human rights; however, I will confine my comments to his remarks about the coalition’s not acting on the comments—I think those were your words, Minister—of an individual member of the coalition. As I said to you, it was the Prime Minister who made this comment, not some backbencher in the Senate or the House of Representatives. We have become accustomed in this place to understanding that, if the Prime Minister says it, there is a fairly good chance it will happen. But, just to reiterate what you have just said, there are no plans here—or in any other legislation, presumably—to right this wrong despite the fact that the Prime Minister identified it some time ago. So that is very disappointing.
This is an issue that goes beyond the mere question of safety nets. This should be about an equitable society—where people are treated equally, particularly when it comes to benefits and measures such as the safety net. Whatever you think about the safety net and whatever you think about same-sex couples, the question is one of equality and fair treatment across the board. The Democrats see no reason to continue this discrimination. It is disappointing that, despite the fact that the Prime Minister also sees no reason to discriminate, this discrimination will continue for the foreseeable future under a coalition government.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING ACCREDITATION) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—I do not want to detain the Senate for an excessively long period on this, but I do think it is worth emphasising what specifically is stated here. I am sure Senator Mason will listen to this information and take it on board—he is now in a position of much more power, authority and influence these days, as is Senator Johnston behind him. Senator Mason might not be aware of the full background to this, but the Prime Minister is capable of supporting amendments such as this because he did do so once—about three years ago. It was the only time during my period as leader that I chose to have a joint press conference with Mr Howard. I sat at one of those little lecterns out in his fancy courtyard, where we were able to talk about the fact that he had agreed to amendments that would open up access to superannuation entitlements for same-sex couples. It was part of reaching agreement on the superannuation choice regime. Not surprisingly, Mr Howard was more keen to talk about superannuation choice and I was keen to emphasise the same-sex couple changes; nevertheless, they were agreed to.
It took, I think, about three years. The government actually held up their own superannuation choice regime. They quite rightly thought the regime was a good idea—and, after it was tinkered with by the Democrats, it was reasonably good. But they were willing to hold up the entire thing for three years because of just this issue. I am thankful to the Prime Minister, and I think Senator Coonan in particular should be noted for enabling that change to occur. But it does need to be emphasised that the Prime Minister himself said at the end of 2005 that he does not support discrimination against same-sex couples in regard to access to entitlements, and he thinks most people would not. That is totally separate to issues of marriage, adoption and those things. But there has been no action.
We have had a HREOC inquiry in great detail that has reaffirmed the enormity of the discrimination that exists in a whole range of acts. To me, it really goes to the issue that there is a range of people in the coalition who, due to all the other distractions that we all have, have not been across the detail of what has been said on the record by the Prime Minister and what the past record is.
I would also point to some speeches. We are putting great store in the Prime Minister here, but I think we should not totally belittle the role of the humble backbencher, which every minister was once upon a time. I can recall some very fine speeches in this chamber towards the end of last year, again on this very topic and on the Democrat sexuality discrimination bill, which has been in this chamber since 1995, seeking to address issues like this. There was a very supportive speech given by Senator Brandis, as I recall. If I might say so myself, it was a better speech than the one I gave. It went to the point so well—it was so well constructed. Maybe that is the reason why he has become a minister! Perhaps Prime Minister Howard heard it and thought: ‘He’s a man after my own heart. We’ll make him a minister.’ Maybe that is why he got Arts; who knows? And it was not just Senator Brandis but one or two others as well who made very good, cogent arguments about how this is completely appropriate in principle. But still we see nothing happening.
It needs to be emphasised that it is one thing to just put up an argument and say, ‘No, this is bad policy; we don’t support it,’ for whatever reason. Frankly, in some ways it is worse to be continually making statements saying, ‘Yes, we do think this discrimination is bad; we don’t think it’s good; we do think it needs to change,’ and then still have nothing happening. In some ways that is actually worse. So I urge all coalition members to revisit this issue, to look for an opportunity to add to that pressure that I know is being applied to see if we can get change. There is the report from HREOC that I think will be tabled in this parliament by the end of this sitting fortnight. I fully expect that it will strongly reinforce the case that the Democrats have been making for 12 years or so in this place, as have senators from other parties and Senate committee reports, including reports from the Senate committee on superannuation and including specific reference committee reports. There is an overwhelming mountain of evidence. There are now an overwhelming number of statements in support. All we need is that action.
I would suggest that it goes to an issue of credibility, beyond just the pros and cons of the policy. If you have statements being made continually of a certain position or belief and they are not then followed up with action, it does call into question the integrity of the belief and indeed the integrity overall of that party and their leadership. If they make repeated statements and then do not follow up on them, it is a bit hard to do anything other than draw the conclusion that perhaps they are not genuine. If they are not genuine on that then maybe they are not genuine on other things either.
It might seem like a second-order issue to a lot of people, but to many people it is a top-order issue, not least because it has been promised for so long and so little has been delivered on it, despite the bits that the Democrats have managed to get over the years, particularly in the area of superannuation. So I do urge people, in the period between now and the election, to look at that HREOC report when it is tabled and perhaps even after that consider acting on it.
I should say as well that I welcome Labor’s support on these amendments. It has not always been forthcoming on all occasions, and it is pleasing to see that being more consistently applied as well, so that it is acted on if they do get into government.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-06-13,"—I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2007. This bill makes a raft of changes to Australia’s native title regime. I will not have the opportunity to touch on all of those changes in detail, so I will touch very briefly on the provisions of the bill before I proceed to outline Labor’s support for the bill and to articulate some of the concerns we have.
Before I do that, I would like to thank the government for moving significantly towards Labor’s position on this bill. I am sure that is the sort of praise they do not often get. The government’s amendments have picked up two of Labor’s key concerns about this bill. They are, firstly—and this is the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—that the National Native Title Tribunal, rather than the registrar, hear appeals against decisions of the registrar not to register an application and, secondly, that the Federal Court retain the role of determining prescribed bodies corporate and that this role not be taken over by regulation, which is appropriate and was the view expressed in the minority report by Labor senators. I will touch on these two areas again in a moment, but Labor still has a number of minor concerns about this bill and I will go to those this evening.
Before I do that, I note that this bill, and the amendments which the government is moving, really does underscore the value of committees as part of the whole Senate process. The committee that examined the bill made a number of recommendations, and I will take the chamber to these a little further on. Also, Labor made a number of recommendations in the minority report, as I have noted. The government has now moved amendments which would put into effect two of those recommendations. It is a sensible position that the government has now adopted in agreeing to those recommendations. It is helpful when the government is prepared to take up sensible amendments to improve its legislation. Rather than commend the government, I note that it has done that and I recognise that it also joined in the committee process itself.
Returning to the bill, I will firstly provide a short overview. Schedule 1 will introduce the majority of the changes in this bill. These include amendments to the process for future Indigenous land use agreements and the making and resolving of native title claims, changes to the obligations of the registrar and a range of other changes that I will not have time this evening to go to in any detail.
Schedule 2 simplifies a range of procedures relating to representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies, ensuring that legal obligations on those bodies are not duplicated, improving processes for reviewing decisions, and clarifying the process for transferring documents from a superseded body to a replacement body.
Schedule 3 introduces a range of amendments to the operation of prescribed bodies corporate. It will close a loophole relating to the placement of these prescribed bodies corporate with other PBCs and prescribe a regime for the charging of fees by those prescribed bodies corporate.
Schedule 4 is composed entirely of minor technical amendments. The title of this bill goes to ‘technical amendments’, and the bill also has a technical amendments schedule within it. I do not see any need to go to those this evening.
Schedule 5 is a new schedule to the bill which has been introduced by the government in a later set of amendments. The explanatory memoranda state that this schedule ‘would rectify a drafting oversight in the transitional and application provisions of the Native Title Amendment Act 2007 (2007 Act) relating to the dismissal of unregistered claims’. Again, these appear to be mainly ‘technical amendments’, which again go to the title of this bill.
As I said earlier, and as my colleagues stated in the other place, Labor supports the vast majority of the changes in this bill and we will be voting for them, as they are technical amendments designed to streamline and improve the operation of the Native Title Act rather than to radically alter or amend it. In addition, the government moved towards Labor’s position in two key areas which I outlined earlier. This is also of value and underpinned how Labor would address this bill. However, there are still changes in this bill which we do not agree with and which we believe could be clarified and improved in the best interests of all those who will have to operate under this scheme.
I will start with a concern that was identified in the submissions to the Senate committee—that is, the new fee system that is proposed in schedule 3 of the bill. Labor can certainly understand the arguments in favour of having a fee regime. The bodies are performing a statutory function and, as such, it is reasonable to expect at least some level of statutory prescription of fees. According to the bill, the scheme would work in this way. A registered native title body corporate would be entitled to charge a fee for the cost it incurs for certain negotiations, including negotiations for a right to negotiate an agreement or its equivalent under a state or territory scheme, or negotiations for an Indigenous land use agreement. A body corporate would be entitled to charge fees for costs it incurred in these negotiations. There are a limited number of persons of whom a body corporate cannot charge a fee, and they are set out in proposed section 60AB(4) of the bill. There are also certain types of negotiations for which a body corporate would not be entitled to charge a fee and the ability prescribed by regulation or other circumstance for which a fee cannot be charged, which is sensible.
Of course, concerns about this bill were raised in submissions to the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the proposed fee scheme represented a restriction rather than a facilitation of the ability for bodies corporate to charge fees. The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in response, indicated otherwise. In evidence given at the Senate inquiry, their representatives argued as persuasively as they could that the statutory bodies are by law required to have either explicit or implied authority to charge fees. Having looked at the evidence of the department on this matter, Labor will not oppose proposed section 60AB.
However, the subsequent proposed section, 60AC, is not, quite frankly, good law. We call on the government to have a closer look in dealing with this area. We think the problems with proposed section 60AC revolve around the fact that it provides that a person who has been charged a fee may go to the registrar to obtain an opinion about whether or not the fee is payable. The registrar then gives an opinion, which may agree or disagree with that fee being payable. If the registrar decides that the fee is not payable, that opinion is binding on the body corporate. The government, in its latest round of amendments, has moved, as I said earlier, technical changes to this section to clarify that the registrar always retains the discretion to not give an opinion. This section also provides that the regulations may set out the scheme in greater depth. It would certainly be helpful if that were available. Usually these matters come later, but, in any event, if the department turns its mind to ensure that the regulations ensure a smooth operation in this area, it would be helpful.
In any event, though, it is our view that there are still quite a few unanswered questions about the fee system that at this stage preclude the ability for Labor to wholeheartedly give it a tick. These questions include—and these may be matters that we can raise in committee: is there a right of merit review for a native title body that believes that the registrar may have made an incorrect decision; will the regulations set fee scales; what procedures will the registrar have in place to assess the matters that are brought before them; what assurances are there that they will make consistent decisions; will precedent be relevant; will it be based on only merit; will it be the practice of the registrar to give an opinion which includes what they think might be an appropriate fee or will they simply provide a yes or no answer; and, will they provide reasons for their decisions and will those decisions be publicly available? In addition: if so, will it eventually evolve into a situation where the registrar effectively acts as a de facto agency which sets fees? Will they be given that authority at some point or will the body of decisions that are made point to the registrar providing, in fact, an opinion method of setting fees? Other questions of this nature present themselves and the department and the minister need to be able to answer these questions before Labor can give this a tick.
We understand why such a scheme is necessary, but we do not believe that a fee scheme provides certainty for all stakeholders. If the eventual aim is to ensure there is certainty, that certainty is not apparent on the record here. However, we will not move to strike out either section from this bill, because of the complex nature of the way in which the bill has been put together, and because, in essence, it is a technical amendment to a provision.
Proposed section 60AB is necessary to allow the statutory authority to charge fees, but it is incumbent upon the government and the minister to develop a workable system and bring that back before parliament, certainly by way of regulation. It is not our role in this instance to try to come up with an alternative model that is workable; it is really incumbent upon the government to make sure that those matters that I have raised as concerns are addressed appropriately and that it certainly works reasonably for the parties and the stakeholders, because that is ultimately where we want to be. We want to ensure that the stakeholders have certainty, that the fees that are charged are reasonable and that everybody knows the process. Therefore, I repeat the request that the government, in truth, takes this away and devises a proper and more comprehensive process for the review of fees that sets out the rights of each participant and how they might exercise those rights. I appreciate that will not happen. I appreciate that the department and the minister are not going to accede to that, but I think it is still incumbent upon the government to put its case and ensure that it does work.
A second area of some minor contention in this bill relates to the provisions in the act which deal with cases in which applicants are found to be not properly authorised. As senators in this chamber may know, certain types of native title claims and applications must be made by a person who has been properly authorised. The problem under the current regime is that there is no clear indication of what would happen if it became clear during the proceedings that the applicant was not properly authorised. The proposed scheme—which we support, as I have said—would fix and clarify this situation. It would allow for the court to make an order that evidence must be produced by an applicant to show that they were authorised to make the application. If the court determined that the person was not authorised to make the application, a range of orders would be made. The court would also be entitled to continue to hear and determine the application if it believed that such a course of action were in the interests of justice.
Labor supports these provisions. I note from submissions to the Senate inquiry that these provisions are supported and welcomed by the stakeholders. However, one suggestion that was made in submissions which we think has merit—and it is never too late for the government to pick it up—is that a person who is making an application to the court for an order to produce evidence is required to show cause as to why it should be made. This would help to make sure that such applications are not open to abuse. I will give the government an opportunity to have a second think about that. I foreshadow that I will move amendments in the committee stage to achieve that.
Another area of difficulty with this bill, minor as it may be, relates to the potential for non-Indigenous persons to be members of bodies corporate which oversee native title rights for native title holders. Native title is an area which is distinctly Indigenous and is based on Indigenous customs and laws. It is appropriate that this section be clarified to make sure that only corporations with solely Indigenous members are entitled to become prescribed bodies corporate.
Turning to the right of review—and I think my colleague Jenny Macklin flagged in the House another concern regarding the right of review—the bill before us today would introduce a right of review for persons who have had their registration refused. Initially the government proposed to give the right of review to the registrar. That would have meant that the same body that had originally refused the registration would be conducting the review. Submissions to the Senate inquiry indicated that it would be more appropriate for the scheme to allow the review to be conducted by the National Native Title Tribunal. Of course, that would mean allowing a fresh set of eyes to look over the application. The committee concluded that this was an appropriate change and made such a recommendation. In the latest set of amendments, the government has picked up the suggestion of the Senate committee, as I mentioned earlier. I thank the government for that. It is a sensible amendment and it has Labor’s support.
I will now turn to the proposed amendments that deal with and validate alternative state regimes. As the submission by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission pointed out, there are concerns that this section would act to retrospectively remove the rights of native title holders. As such, Labor believes that these items that relate to the validation of the alternative state regimes should be delayed pending consultation with native title holders.
Finally, I turn to the issue of default prescribed bodies corporate. The new provisions essentially allow for the appointment of prescribed bodies corporate in circumstances where no functioning body corporate has been nominated by the native title holder. This will mean that the functions that a prescribed body corporate normally undertakes will continue to operate in circumstances where for a variety of reasons they currently do not.
Originally, the Senate committee identified problems with this scheme, which were picked up in Labor’s minority report. The concern was that the regulations would allow the prescription of not only the types of bodies corporate that may be determined as the default PBC under the scheme but also the exact bodies corporate. The department indicated to the committee that this was not intended to be the case and that it did not believe that the powers would ever be exercised by a body other than a court. Labor picked up these comments in its minority report. I note that the government—perhaps taking a belt-and-braces approach—has also moved to rectify these concerns by foreshadowing amendments to deal with them. Again, I thank the government for at least taking those matters seriously and fixing them up.
Despite the concerns I have outlined, I indicate that Labor supports this bill. We do believe that it can be a positive development towards cutting down the time it takes for native title matters to be resolved, which is far too long at the moment. I think that everybody recognises that and I think it is in everybody’s interests as well that we cut down the time used in making determinations. If the technical amendments go some way in granting certainty for stakeholders, I think they are worthy of support. Having both certainty and a streamlined system—although I am not convinced it is as streamlined as it could be—will ensure that decisions can be made quicker by allowing the greater use of the system in the exercise of people’s rights earlier and with some greater certainty.
I foreshadow, of course, that Labor will move amendments in line with the issues I have outlined. We do so because we believe that these will improve rather than hinder the operation of the bill. When the amendments are moved in the Senate, I hope the government will—perhaps I will put it more strongly than that: I think the government should—look at them in greater detail and support them because they will improve the operation of the scheme in more general terms than this bill currently does.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT (TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—Senator Ludwig has outlined most of the detail of the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2007, so I will not repeat all of that. I would note that the government have circulated a number of amendments which respond to much of the report into the legislation by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and I welcome that. These days I am regularly critical of the lack of interest by the government on many occasions in the Senate committee process, the ridiculously truncated time frames that they apply and their lack of interest in the findings of the committee at the end of the process. So, in the interests of balance, I have equally to make note of it when they do listen and pay attention to the committee’s findings.
This is the second native title amendment legislation that has been before the Senate this year. To some extent that is a symptom of the fact that the native title regime has significant imperfections. I recognise and acknowledge that the amendments that have been introduced this year are intended to address these imperfections, and some of them do go some way to doing that, but I also suggest that a lot of them revisit some of the flaws in the original native title arrangements, particularly those that were put in place under the so-called 10-point plan and heavily modified but nonetheless passed by the Senate, not with my support but obviously with majority support, quite some years ago—in 1998 if my memory serves me correctly.
Linked into that are some of the institutional shortcomings with the native title arrangements. Senator Ludwig has alluded to some of those as well. Some of the other shortcomings are those that you can never fix with law; they are the ones to do with attitudinal shortcomings, particularly at the level of state and federal governments as well as some other key stakeholders. There has been too much foot dragging, there has been too much resistance and there has been too much apprehension and fear about what native title is. Indeed, there has been grotesque misinformation in some cases. I am pleased to say there is less of that than in years gone by.
Again in the interest of balance, I note that despite its shortcomings—and they are significant—native title is delivering results. I spoke in the Senate earlier today in the matter of public interest debate about the Productivity Commission’s latest report on the state of play with Indigenous equality in Australia. There were a range of indicators in a report they have released—their third report looking at indicators for Indigenous people with regard to health, education and other things—and one of the measures that has progressed is an increase in the areas that have had native title determinations or Indigenous land use agreements put over them. Not all of those land use agreements are perfect or ideal by any means, but many of them have delivered positive results for Indigenous people. Some of those that have not certainly still have the potential within them to do so, and the work still has to be done so there is potential there.
In that same speech today, I spoke about an agreement that has just been reached with the Queensland state government and traditional landowner groups on Cape York, putting in place a framework that should enable the prospects of further land use agreements and joint management over areas where native title has been recognised that have national parks put over them. Many of those things would not have been put in place or would have been harder to put in place if there was not that underpinning recognition of native title. Of course it should be noted that Far North Queensland—the Torres Strait Islands specifically, and with the Wik case on Cape York—is in one respect the birthplace of native title, in the legal sense at least. So it is delivering some results, slowly, torturously and with a lot of anguish in some cases. I do not dispute those flaws, but it is important to emphasise the positives that are being delivered in some areas. Inasmuch as these changes here today will go to further enhance those, then they should be welcomed.
I made some further comments in my contribution to the Senate committee report. I have no additional comments there, so I will not repeat those; I refer the Senate to those. As I said, the government has made some amendments that go some of the way to some of those and I have other amendments here that I can address when we get to the committee stage of the debate. It is an area that is important; it has moved out of the public and media spotlight and perhaps in some ways that is a good thing. It takes some of the heat out of it most of the time. We can focus on making it work better for everybody. But let us not forget that the primary aim of native title, certainly in the Democrats’ view, is to provide some mechanism for some limiting or halting of the damage done through dispossession of Indigenous peoples. That can never be fully reversed, of course, but it is a mechanism for halting further dispossession and, where feasible, for enabling the remaining title to be used for the benefit of Indigenous Australians.
To that end, I again implore governments, both state and federal, to do more in this area to facilitate the positive opportunities that native title represents for all Australians, not just for Indigenous people. We do still have examples, like the appeal that was launched by both state and federal governments against the Noongar land claim in Western Australia. I think the appeal against that was unfortunate. We have other circumstances in the Northern Territory. I have spoken a number of times in this place about delays in native title claims in south-east Queensland. It is not just a matter for those who are in northern areas or the remote parts of Queensland; there are claims in and around metropolitan areas, including in and around Brisbane and the Gold Coast. We have had the claim of the Githabul recognised in northern New South Wales, which is very positive. Their claim stretches over into southern Queensland—across the Mount Lindsay and Beaudesert areas—and it seems incongruous and unfortunate that it has been concluded on the New South Wales side of the border with some positive arrangements but there is still no recognition on the Queensland side. It is also important to once again repeat the call for further and more effective resourcing of Indigenous bodies; not just the native title representative bodies, but also the PBCs and others who wish to engage in the native title process. Streamlining and promptness are important—particularly when you are dealing with establishing connection to country, some knowledge of which resides in elderly people—but it should not be at the expense of a just outcome. We need to always guard against that.
I will speak further on my amendments in the committee stage of the debate. I think that at least some of the amendments that are made to this legislation, technical though they may be, should improve the operation of the native title regime for most stakeholders. While it is important to have it operate effectively for everybody, having it operate effectively and fairly for Indigenous people has to be a primary goal. On balance, these changes do that, but, again, to some extent it comes down not just to what is in the act itself but also to the attitudes of those who engage with it and the resources and capacities available, particularly to Indigenous people, to engage with it.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT (TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-06-13,"—I would like to thank senators for their contribution to the consideration of the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2007. I also thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for its detailed consideration of this bill. The government has carefully considered the recommendations made by the Senate committee and has accepted a number of them. The government will accept recommendations 2, 3 and 5 of the Senate committee report. The government will also accept part of additional recommendation 2 from the minority report. I will discuss these recommendations further when I move government amendments to implement these recommendations. The government does not accept recommendations 1 and 4 of the Senate committee. I will deal with both these recommendations here to record the government’s response to the Senate committee’s report for the record.
With respect to recommendation 1, which was to amend proposed section 87A, the Senate committee recommended proposed subparagraph 87A(i)(c)(v) to:
... require consent from a party, with an interest in relation to land and waters in the determination area, where the Federal Court is satisfied that the interest is likely to be affected by the proposed determination.
The government does not accept this recommendation. Proposed section 87A is intended to streamline processes where there is an agreement amongst those who have an interest in the determination area and prevent those with an interest in other areas of the claim from blocking a consent determination over part of the claim.
The amendment to proposed section 87A in this bill directly implements recommendation 9 of the Senate committee’s report on the previous native title amendment bill. I note that, in its current inquiry, the committee received conflicting evidence from stakeholders. Some thought the amendment should go further; others felt the amendment was not necessary. The provision as drafted strikes an appropriate balance between the need to effectively resolve native title matters and the need to protect those with substantive interests within the claim area. Implementing this recommendation would create uncertainty as parties would not know prior to the determination being considered by the court which parties with an ‘interest’ are required to consent. This proposal would also encourage time-consuming debate about which parties should be required to consent.
With respect to recommendation 4 on the replacement of applicants, the Senate committee recommended amending the bill to provide a separate simplified process for the removal of an applicant who consents to removal or who is deceased or incapacitated where there is no requirement to replace that applicant. Whilst the Senate committee did not specify what that simplified process could be, a submission to the Senate committee suggested that the court could remove the person on receipt of affidavit evidence that the person is in fact deceased or incapacitated or consents to his or her removal. The government does not accept this recommendation. Changes to the applicant can raise complex issues, particularly in relation to authorisation of the claim. There is a risk that claims may not be properly authorised if the bill provided for a streamlined process of the kind proposed by the Senate committee. The bill already provides that applications can be amended to replace the applicant, including where one of the persons who is an applicant dies, becomes incapacitated or consents to his or her replacement or removal without undergoing a registration test again. However, the amendments in the bill will not negate the need for the court to be satisfied that the replacement applicant is authorised to be the applicant. Whilst a change to the applicant to remove a deceased or incapacitated person may seem uncontroversial, the effect of such a change may in fact be quite significant, particularly with large claimant groups. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a response from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to the report tabled today by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I will speak to that report next. The report from the Ombudsman details the circumstances surrounding a number of people who were in immigration detention in Australia for prolonged periods of time—for over a year, in the majority of the cases for over two years and, for quite a few of them, for longer than that. The minister’s response simply details the minister’s response to the recommendations in the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s report. The first thing I would note is that there are 62 cases in the Ombudsman’s report. This report is the latest in quite a long line of reports—hundreds of cases would have been detailed in the range of reports by the Ombudsman.
The requirement for investigations to be done and reports to be written about people in long-term immigration detention was announced by the government in the middle of 2005 following significant public pressure over many years and further pressure from within the government from a number of coalition backbenchers. The report enables the Ombudsman to provide recommendations, but there is no obligation on the minister to act on those recommendations. It is worth noting that, of the 62 cases that the minister responded to—all of whom were effectively in jail for a year, two years, three years and more, many of them suffering sufficient mental health damage to end up in mental health institutions for a period of their detention—47 of them ended up getting visas. So, at the end of the process of considerations, re-examinations and appeals, the vast majority get visas, having spent the entire intervening period locked up at enormous public cost. As the Ombudsman’s report makes clear, very significant harm is done in some cases, with pretty much permanent damage to people’s health. It leads me to once again ask the question: what sort of absurd system do we have?
We can see from this example from the minister’s response that 47 out of the 62 ended up with visas and only eight returned home. Seven others are pending and I would suspect, from looking through them, that a number of those will end up with residency visas as well. It says to me that it is a completely wrongheaded policy that is delivering completely absurd results. It is costing the taxpayer a fortune and it is causing significant harm to a number of people who, as our own system demonstrates, at the end of it all have a valid claim for refugee or other humanitarian protection. Why are we traumatising these people? Why are we causing them so much damage? Why is this continuing, at such taxpayer expense, when it is not necessary? We should draw a clear lesson from this.
The other point I would make is that in a few of the cases where the Ombudsman has made recommendations—and the Ombudsman’s recommendations, in most cases, were provided back in April—the minister’s response, two months later, was to say, ‘A submission for this client is currently being prepared for my consideration,’ or, ‘We are currently assessing ministerial intervention requests.’ That was two months after reports came down about people who had already been locked up without charge for years. To say two months later, ‘Yeah, we’re still putting together a submission on this,’ is not good enough. To me, it does not show sufficient urgency in respect of people who have had their freedom removed although they have committed no crime nor been subjected to any charge. It makes me repeat the pledge on behalf of the Democrats to continue to campaign for the removal of mandatory detention, which is a cruel, unnecessary and expensive policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-06-13,"—A surprising comment came from a Tasmanian Labor senator when he recently said, ‘Timber workers must not be used as election bait by the Liberal Party at the upcoming election.’ Had the senator substituted the word ‘Greens’ or even ‘the ALP’, the senator would have been 100 per cent correct. Since I have been around for a while, I wondered at what point since the 1980s the Labor Party had taken forestry off the hook as election bait and, of course, why timber workers’ hopes have not been realised. The Labor Party’s memory seems to stretch back only as far as their last national conference. They neglect to remember turning their backs on forestry workers at the last election, while they happily fished for big-city votes on the mainland.
Federal Labor’s new forestry policy, which was adopted at the Labor Party’s national conference in May this year, shows that Labor will again go fishing for mainland Green preferences. If Labor does not intend to lock up more forests, then why did they ratify a policy at the national conference which said that they might? Why have they kept their options open again, like they did in 2004? The problem with bringing back the policy of Mark Latham was not lost recently on Labor member for Franklin, Harry Quick. When asked on ABC radio in May this year, Mr Quick highlighted the difficulty with Labor’s inability to be consistent and stick to a position on forestry. He agreed forestry would be an issue at the 2007 federal election, particularly for the seats of Bass and Braddon. He said: ‘It’s a perennial problem that comes and bites us again. You know, we’ve got a name for every bloody tree in Tasmania, I think. We’ve looked at them that often. I just wish it’d go away and we could get on to some serious issues.’ That is exactly the problem: why can’t Labor make a principled decision and stick to it? Labor cannot stick to the very people that it purports to represent.
Of course, there is a great gap in this polarised debate between ordinary Tasmanians, timber workers and environmentalists, who pick fights with machinery and forestry corporations listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. I am concerned that Tasmanians who work in the forestry industry should not be subjected to open-ended criticism and abuse for cutting down trees, planting trees and imagining a future in which a timber industry continues to exist. It should be an anathema for a person concerned about the environment to damn the careful management and selective use of a renewable resource. Let me say, after something like 28 years of representing the people of Tasmania, we have really grown weary and fatigued by this debate and its increasing permutations. Tasmania’s $1 billion forest products industry is the state’s second largest employer.
We have a strategic plan with a five-year review mechanism: the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, the RFA. A decision to adopt it was made by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian state government in November 1997 following public consultations. The agreement, of course, covers the whole state. It laid the foundation for the creation of 550 jobs in plantations, intensive forest management and infrastructure development, and was accompanied by a Commonwealth funding package of $110 million to help develop exports and value-adding. Initially the RFA received the support of both the Liberal Party and the ALP at both state and federal levels, as well as across the broad community. The RFA provides the national criteria for the conservation of forest biodiversity, old-growth forests and wilderness. These criteria form the foundation for conserving all elements of biodiversity, old-growth forests and wilderness. The RFA increased the existing conservation reserve system by almost one-fifth. It brought the total reserve system to 2.7 million hectares, nearly half of Tasmania’s land area. As a result, more than two-thirds of the state’s public land is in reserves. The RFA established a program to protect conservation values on private land. So the RFA is both a compromise and a solution to complex and competing claims. No one group got their way or walked off in triumph. That is the nature of compromise.
As Mr Barry Chipman, the Tasmanian coordinator of Timber Communities Australia, said:
Compromise is important in achieving win-win outcomes on difficult land use questions. The key to an achievable outcome is the willingness of all parties to resolve the problem.
So it is disappointing that the 20-year-old fight over Tasmania’s old-growth forests is still not perceived as resolved. Governments, the majority of Tasmanian electors and industry have already reached compromises several times over, but the Greens and environmental groups consistently reject them, while Labor embraces the RFA only when it is convenient. Ironically, the foreword in the JANIS report, which was written a decade ago, begins:
For over two decades in Australia the competing demands of conservation and industry on our forests have been an area of debate and controversy. The National Forest Policy ... agreed by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, provides the framework for a long term solution ...
Fifteen years ago the goals were the same. Labor says they represent the interests of timber workers, but come election time there is not even a faint echo of those voices in the Huon Valley, Geeveston, Triabunna or Scottsdale.
Tasmanian political history is littered with forest compromises. No less than 25 inquiries have been held since 1971. Not one found the Tasmanian forestry industry unsustainable. All of these policy debates, consultations, studies, analyses, agreements and compromises have led to the conservation of significant areas that were previously available for forestry. As difficult as these changes were to communities reliant on timber, they nevertheless accepted the outcomes. Each time they were told that the agreement represented the ‘final lines on the map’. It is not hard to imagine their exasperation. People who work in forestry have had the goodwill to accept the RFA and all other forestry land use compromises. The challenge is for the Tasmanian environment movement to do the same, and for those who live in inner city Melbourne and Sydney to respect the right of Tasmanians to manage and make decisions about Tasmania and its forests. Tasmanians are the custodians of these forests and they are very good at it. Tasmanians consider the interests of their children, grandchildren and future generations. We are surrounded by the beauty of our forests and value the wealth this renewable resource brings our economy.
The Howard government remains committed to developing Australia’s timber resources and generating economic wealth and jobs in a very sustainable way. The forestry industry employs about 83,000 Australians, mostly in rural and regional areas. The coalition showed in the 2004 election that it is a strong friend of Australia’s timber workers, not the ‘fair-weather’ variety. In no government that John Howard leads, or where Michael Ferguson or Mark Baker voice the interests of northern Tasmania, will ideology or short-term political expediency be put ahead of the job security and welfare of timber workers and their families.
