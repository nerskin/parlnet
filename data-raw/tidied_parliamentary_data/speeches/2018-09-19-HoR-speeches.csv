Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (10:03):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities, I present the report of the delegation to China from 2 to 6 July 2018, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr ALEXANDER:
  Today, I present the report of the parliamentary delegation to China. In July 2018 a delegation from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities visited the People's Republic of China. Travelling to four cities in five days, the delegation spent time in Beijing, Tianjin, Chengdu and Hong Kong. It witnessed the incredible progress made by China, particularly in the development of cities and transport infrastructure. A number of key lessons arose from the visit, perhaps the most important being that we have much to learn from our biggest trading partner in the planning and development of infrastructure and cities.


One critical lesson from China is the importance and value of integrated planning. All China's infrastructure is planned hand in hand with land use. This ensures that infrastructure development supports and is supported by other key economic, social, and, increasingly, environmental objectives. Furthermore, it ensures that the uplift in property values created by this integrated development is automatically captured to entirely fund the infrastructure development. In particular, the development model used by the MTR in Hong Kong is directly applicable to Australia, both in retrofitting infrastructure into our cities and in the infrastructure required for strategic decentralisation and sustainable growth. MTR provided the delegation with a full briefing of their business model—integrated planning of transport and land use, using comprehensive value capture to fully fund infrastructure development. MTR are already familiar with Australian conditions. They could easily apply their experience and expertise to assist with the development of transport infrastructure within our cities. More importantly, that model could be applied to the development of high-speed rail in Australia.


China also provides lessons for the development and financing of housing in Australia. Official government policy is directed at ensuring that the housing market favours homebuyers over investors, with much higher equity requirements for investors in purchasing real estate, and restrictions on the amount of property that can be purchased by individual investors. Planned growth is about housing future generations.


The delegation to China was also an opportunity to, in a small way, enhance China-Australia relations. The delegation received a warm reception at every meeting and had the opportunity to engage in open discussion on issues significant to both countries—a practice that should be encouraged. It is the delegation's view that, given the importance of China-Australia relations and the part that Chinese trade and investment is likely to play in the future development of Australia, it is vital that Australian policymakers have a stronger understanding of Australia's principal trading partner. This understanding can be gained only through direct engagement with and our experience of China.


It was noted in a briefing to delegation members that in the past four years nine committee delegations had visited Australia from China, but that in the past five years only three Australian parliamentary delegations had visited China. The delegation therefore believes that more opportunities should be created for Australian parliamentary delegations to visit China, thereby exposing more members and senators to the reality of modern China.


I'd like to personally thank those who played a part in the organisation and conduct of the visit—our hosts in China and the consular staff who supported us. In particular, I would like to thank Her Excellency Jan Adams, Australia's Ambassador to the People's Republic of China; Mr Tony Walter, the Acting Consul-General in Chengdu; Mr Sam Guthrie, the Acting Consul-General in Hong Kong; and Dr Yin Kwan, the Counsellor for Infrastructure with the Australian Embassy in Beijing. Dr Yin travelled with the delegation throughout the visit, ensuring that everything ran smoothly. I would especially like to thank my delegation colleagues, the members for Scullin, Fairfax and North Sydney, who, in a spirit of bipartisanship, ensured that the visit was pleasant and productive. On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:08):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement I present the committee's report entitled Inquiry into the trade in elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  by leave—The number of elephants in Africa has declined rapidly over the past century. A little over 100 years ago their population was estimated to be five million. However, a census in 2016 estimated that the number had declined to around 350,000. Further, it found that African elephant populations had declined a further 30 per cent between the years 2007 and 2014. In the last century we've witnessed a 95 per cent decline in that species.


In recognition of this ongoing problem, in 2016 the international community agreed to a non-binding resolution that called upon all CITES members to implement a domestic trade ban on elephant ivory. Since that time, a significant number of countries have implemented a domestic trade ban on elephant ivory. The world's largest consumer of elephant ivory, China, implemented its ban in 2017. The world's primary exporter of elephant ivory products, the United Kingdom, is currently in the final stages of reviewing legislation that will implement a domestic ivory trade ban. The United States legislated its ban in 2016. Australia is yet to introduce an equivalent ban. The recommendations of the committee are that the Australian Commonwealth states and territories, through the Council of Australian Governments, develop and implement a national domestic ban on elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn; and that the domestic trade ban should be consistent with those implemented in other like-minded international jurisdictions.


However, I would like to note that the international trade in ivory was actually first banned in 1989, and the 2007 CITES agreement, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, adopted a moratorium back in 2007, yet this was not successful in stopping the poaching. To the contrary, since the moratorium was in place, there has actually been an increase in demand and, as I mentioned before, there's been a further 30 per cent decline in elephant populations. The committee also notes that there are no known examples in human history where efforts to eliminate demand for a product by governments simply legislating to make it unlawful have succeeded. The committee notes that there is a risk of such bans resulting in a perverse outcome: that ivory could become rarer and could be viewed as an inflation-proof investment, fetching higher prices and actually increasing demand and increasing illegal stockpiling. However, we do note that the evidence indicates that the bans recently implemented in China have had the effect of reducing demand.


It was the view of the committee, in supporting the ban, that publicly visible trade in ivory or partial legalisation of that trade undermines all attempts to change public attitudes and all attempts to stigmatise the ownership of ivory products. Government bans are not going to save the African elephant. What is going to save the African elephant is if we can make it socially unacceptable and create a stigma throughout the world that to purchase or own ivory products is taboo. That is the reason the committee supports Australia joining China, the US and the UK in implementing a likewise ban. I thank the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (10:13):  I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House makes note of the Government's lack of long term policy and planning to assist primary producers and rural Australians facing drought conditions"".


Labor will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018, which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow immediate deduction rather than deduction over the course of three years of the cost of fodder storage assets, such as silos and hay sheds, used to store grain and animal feed. The government has made the case that this will assist primary producers by making it easier to invest in these assets. The measure was announced on 19 August 2018 and applies to fodder storage assets first used or installed ready for use on or after that date. The fiscal impact of the measure is $75 million over the forward estimates.


While we are supportive of this measure, we do note the haphazard approach which the government has taken to the drought that many Australian farmers are suffering from. First, there was the increase in the farm household allowance payments from three years to four years, effective on 1 August 2018. Then, a few days later on 5 August, the government announced a $190 million drought package, claiming that it provided immediate additional financial support to help farming families and their communities, which is a bit of a stretch given that the additional funding did not start flowing on 5 August. We're yet to see how many farmers will actually access the farm household allowance supplementary payments. And, as the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, has pointed out, there is a real risk that farming families will miss out on the full $12,000 because the government insists on splitting the payment and denying farmers the possibility of getting a lump-sum payment.


Then, in his second reading speech introducing this bill, the Assistant Treasurer made mention of increased funding for mental health support, something which should of course be welcomed by both sides of this House. Yet, it was just later that week that the new Prime Minister tweeted an extremely insensitive video that claimed that drought is 'a necessary evil' that 'can help cut out the bottom 10 per cent that probably shouldn't be there anyway'. That isn't what struggling farmers need to hear at this time of crisis. Labor has called on Prime Minister Morrison to apologise and to remove the video, but he refuses to do so.


Then we have the fact that, on 19 August 2018, former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day as the National Drought Coordinator. But then, interestingly, in introducing this bill in the House, the Assistant Treasurer made no mention of support for the appointment of the drought envoy position by the current Prime Minister, so the status of that envoy is unclear. We also know that, as the former agriculture minister, the member for New England did very little to address the long-term systemic challenges of the agriculture sector. We all sadly remember his failed white paper, which was full of short-term initiatives so poorly designed that most are yet to be implemented.


This House will recall that one of the first acts of the member for New England as Minister for Agriculture was to dismantle the Standing Council on Primary Industries as part of the COAG council. That body, the so-called SCoPI, worked on longer-term drought reform measures, and its abolition means that we have one less avenue through which to pursue long-term reform. And, of course, we had the member for New England doctoring the Hansard. Everyone in this place will remember his doctoring of the Hansard, which ended up with the unprecedented firing of his departmental secretary, but some may have forgotten exactly the topic on which he was caught out doctoring the Hansard. It was his attempt to exaggerate the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's drought assistance measures. Farmers have not experienced any meaningful relief from drought in the time since.


As the shadow agriculture minister has said, the Morrison government must immediately take action to restore the COAG drought policy reform process, to respond to the review into the intergovernmental agreement on drought reform and update the parliament on the progress of the new agreement, and to help farmers better adapt to climate change and embrace best practice regenerative farming methods to combat drought—a topic that I will return to.


To go to the tax aspect of this measure, we on the Labor side support the principle that more rapid depreciation—what's known in the US literature as 'immediate expensing'—can be good policy. Labor has supported the government's instant asset write-off. We did so noting that the government had scrapped Labor's instant asset write-off and then put in place their own instant asset write-off. Much like the low-income superannuation contribution, they scrapped the policy, railed against it and then restored Labor's policy when finally they saw sense.


On top of the instant asset write-off, Labor has announced an Australian investment guarantee. That delivers for all companies investing in Australia and is a much more targeted policy than an across-the-board company tax cut. Work carried out by Victoria University suggests that, if you're after investment, then the bang for your buck of an investment guarantee of more rapid expensing is three times larger than a company tax cut. Labor's Australian investment guarantee has the benefit too for firms that it is permanent, permanently accelerating depreciation for all companies and thereby ensuring that we're able to improve the investment pipeline that businesses deliver. This is responding to a concern that many economists have raised about the level of business investment in Australia. As the shadow Treasurer has noted, business investment in Australia has fallen by 20 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia has recently commented that non-mining business investment has been 'disappointingly low' in recent years. Our support for more rapid depreciation schedules, as a long-term growth measure, is something that is important to put on record.


This measure is using accelerated depreciation as a form of fiscal stimulus, if you like, and as a way of getting farmers through the drought. In this exercise, it's less clear whether that will have a strong benefit for farmers. The benefits of more rapid depreciation only come to firms that pay tax. If you're not paying tax, then being able to depreciate does not necessarily boost your growth prospects. It's a long-term policy and it has no end date, but it's couched very much by this government as a crisis response. While Labor recognises the economic value of more rapid depreciation schedules, we do put on record at this stage our concerns about the benefits that this measure will bring in helping farmers tackle drought.


To that end, I do want to put on record that Labor intends, if we win government, to review this measure to ensure that it's having the intended effect. We've taken such an approach with other measures that we have supported in this House, such as the measures contained in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 that passed the House earlier this week. A careful, independent review is warranted in a context such as this to ask questions such as whether providing the benefit to all firms but restricting it to fodder storage assets is the best use of resources. We need to make sure that we are safeguarding taxpayer money, particularly at a time when under this government we've seen net debt almost double since the coalition came to office and at a time in which Australian debt is rising more rapidly than it did even during the global financial crisis. That was when Australia was taking on debt not through government mismanagement, as we are under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, but to deal with the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression and to save 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses.


It's important too that, in order to tackle drought, we address climate change. We've seen, as the shadow minister for climate change and energy has pointed out, the fact that the Liberals have no climate policy, and no measures to contain, let alone reduce, Australia's rising carbon pollution. A number of Morrison government ministers continue to repeat the lie that Australia is on track to meet its international climate commitments, but we're simply not. They have a target of a five per cent cut in emissions by 2020, but the coalition government's own data, snuck out in the days before Christmas, showed there would be a zero per cent cut in pollution by 2020. The Liberals have committed to the Paris Agreement with a 26 to 28 per cent reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels. But the same government data—again, snuck out before Christmas 2017—showed there would only be a four per cent cut in pollution by 2030. That means Australia is on track to miss its carbon abatement targets by a whopping 24 per cent. And this was all at a stage when the National Energy Guarantee still had a possibility of garnering bipartisan support. Since the junking of the National Energy Guarantee, the new energy minister seems to take it as a virtue that the coalition has no plans to reduce emissions.


Australia's emissions are substantial. The electricity sector is responsible for a third of all Australia's emissions and has the lowest cost of cutting pollution. That's why Labor has been willing to work with the coalition on their various plans—the emissions intensity scheme, the clean energy target, the National Energy Guarantee. And that's why we're so disappointed at the government's decision to entirely walk away from meaningful action on climate change. This is a great concern to our Pacific neighbours and to the European Union, but it's also a concern to Australia's farmers, who are suffering the impact of drought.


As we know from the scientific evidence, extreme weather events will become more frequent as unchecked climate change continues. In South Australia, there's the famous Goyder's Line, the line which demarcates the boundary of sustainable agriculture. We've seen Goyder's Line shifting towards the coast, shrinking the area of viable agriculture in South Australia: an impact which has been traced directly back to climate change. A government with no plan to tackle climate change cannot be a government that is doing everything to tackle the scourge of drought and the impact of drought.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (10:28):  I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. This drought continues to exact a heavy toll on country communities around Australia, but particularly in central western New South Wales. It's exacting a heavy toll on the farm and on farming families. There is a physical toll attached to this drought—the drudgery of having to get up early, feed stock, check troughs, check stock and check dams. There's the economic toll of worrying about how you're going to be able to feed the flock, or the herd, where you're going to be able to source feed from, how it's going to get there and if there will be enough of it. And then there's a huge mental toll as well. I've seen the toll that it's taken, because I've been travelling around our region and around our farms and farming communities, talking to them and doing anything that I can to help. The toll is being exacted on the farms, but it's also being exacted in the towns as well—through the small businesses, the mechanics, the tyre fitters, the rural suppliers, the fuel distributors and even the grocery outlets.


Despite some recent rain, this drought hasn't broken, and our region is facing a long, hot and, potentially, fiery summer period. We need to be continuing to ramp up drought support as these conditions worsen. At the moment our total drought support package is hitting $1.9 billion. This bill is part of that response. It won't be for every farmer. I have many farmers in my region just focusing on sourcing feed, and not every region in Australia is in drought, but it is a useful measure to assist farmers to get through potentially devastating dry times both at present and in the future. Basically it means that there's an immediate deduction for fodder storage assets first used or installed and ready for use from August 2018, and they can get the tax benefit straightaway. Currently primary producers can deduct the value of fodder storage assets over three years by one-third of the amount in the income year in which the expenditure occurred and one-third in each of the following two income years. Under the new arrangements this will reduce to one year with effect from 19 August. I think it's a valuable measure. It's about getting through this drought but also preparing for the next drought.


As I mentioned, it's part of a suite of measures which the government has introduced, now totalling almost $1.9 billion. The Regional Investment Corporation, which is going to be based in Orange in the Central West, is going to be dealing with $2 billion in concessional loans and $2 billion for national water infrastructure at the concessional loan rate—very welcome in country Australia and a great example of decentralisation. The farm household allowance has just been extended. The asset cap has been lifted to $5 million. That was a big issue with many local farmers. The total payment for a couple is now up to $37,000. This is a substantial measure, which has been well received, designed to put food on the table of farmers and diesel in the ute when there is no income. The paperwork is being simplified, and I encourage the government and all of those agencies involved to keep going on that, because it is a great source of frustration to our local farmers.


The Rural Financial Counselling Service has also been boosted by $5 million in recent times. We need more rural financial counsellors on the ground in the Central Tablelands. I know that help is coming, but we need to ramp that process up, because at the moment the counsellors we have are on the raggedy edge. They are overworked, they have a huge backlog of cases and they need more help and support. There are also a suite of measures to manage weeds and pest animals—very much welcome. There are new measures for weather forecasting. The government has committed a further $36.9 million to 2023 for Great Artesian Basin water security. This funding will help to drought-proof farms and maximise the availability of water. There's more money for water infrastructure and a suite of taxation measures, including the farm management deposits scheme, which has been in place for a while now. That is a very useful resource for farmers, and many farmers are using it.


You also have the instant asset write-off. There's the small business instant asset write-off, which is basically for assets that cost less than $20,000. Anyone can access that if they're in business and have a turnover of less than $10 million, but this measure today goes beyond the $20,000 cap and means that if you want to get a storage silo for your grain or a shed for storing fodder then you can get the tax benefit in the year that you purchase that infrastructure. You also have measures such as income tax averaging, which enables farmers to even out their high- and low-income years. The tax payable over a maximum of five years ensures they don't pay more tax over a number of years than do taxpayers on comparable but steady incomes.


All are valuable measures but, as I've said, we need to keep ramping it up as these conditions worsen. One of the big issues we're facing is sourcing feed and fodder. If we need to release more water from dams in order to irrigate fodder, we need to be doing it. This is an emergency situation. If the Australian government needs to underwrite grain to get it from Western Australia—where they're going to be having a bumper harvest—into the Central West, where there's not much around, then I think we should do it.


We need more rural financial counsellors, as I've said. We need to keep moving our response and ramping it up as these conditions worsen. I was very pleased to see that Major-General Stephen Day is on the ground working hard. I'm meeting him tomorrow to talk through some of these measures.


One of the distinguishing features of country communities is that when the chips are down they come together, and you see this all over our region and all over country Australia. The communities rally and support each other, and the country community spirit has particularly shone through in these dry times. For example, I'll give you just a taste of what the Bathurst RSL club are doing. This club was established in 1928 and has more than 14,000 members. The club is supporting a Buy a Bale in September campaign, kicking things off with a $10,000 donation to the appeal. They've got banners in the club highlighting the appeal so that members can donate every time they purchase a meal. The club has been creative; they've also given away a dollar from every chicken parmigiana sold in their Parma for a Farmer campaign. Deputy Speaker, I would invite you and all members to drop in for a parma for a farmer—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  I don't like chicken parmas, mate. If it were a beef parma I'd be onto it!




Mr GEE:
  I'm sure they could do that. In fact, for all of the folks listening at home, wherever you may be, if you want to support drought stricken communities come and visit us. Come and support the hotels, the restaurants, the pubs and the clubs.


Back to Bathurst RSL, 20c from every coffee sold at the club's coffee shop, The Grind, is going to the appeal. And in the popular weekly members draw, if a member wins cash the club will match that amount for Buy a Bale. So far this month the club, with the help of its many members, has raised over $22,000, with plenty more to come. Individual members have also been making donations. For example, one anonymous member left $2,000 on the bar to help those crippled by drought conditions. The Bathurst Filipino community, for example, kicked in $600. The region is looking forward to more hay on the way, with loads expected to arrive in Bathurst on 24 September.


Special thanks to Ian Miller, the president; Ron Hollebone, the vice-president and Harry Robertson, the vice-president and treasurer. Thanks to the directors: Brett Kenworthy, Les Anderson, Paul Hennessy and Coral Miller. And, of course, thanks to the general manager, Peter Sargeant, who has generally let staff wear jeans for the month if they buy a bale. Congratulations to Bathurst RSL club for all of their hard work.


The hard work continues right across the region. For example, the Millthorpe Village Committee held a hugely successful farmers day on Sunday at Redmond oval to support those affected by drought. After I attended the show, where there were many farmers, I also dropped in to see how the farmers day went. It was an opportunity for locals to gather and listen to the representatives from the various assistance bodies and organisations, to hear about what services and support are available. For example, there were representatives from the NSW Farmers Association, the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority as well as mental health workers. It was highly successful. There were about 200 people there on the day. About 400 sausage and steak sandwiches were served—it wouldn't be a country event without the sausage sizzle. It was very strongly supported by the Millthorpe branch of the CWA.


The Millthorpe Village Committee has around 100 hardworking members. Special thanks for organising the day needs to go to Sam Yeates, president; Russell Keogh, vice-president; Sue Marsh, treasurer; Nick Anagnostaras, secretary; and Mary Dowrick, publicity officer. The farmers day itself was a suggestion of committee member Lyndall Harrison, who runs the annual Millthorpe Garden Ramble. Congratulations to the Millthorpe Village Committee on their successful day. It's great to see grassroots community groups stepping in to support our farmers, and, as I said, that's what we do in the country.


Have a look at Mudgee, where you've got the 200BALES campaign. It started off with a group of volunteers getting together and asking the community to sponsor a bale of hay for farmers. They were aiming for 200 bales, but they've well and truly exceeded that target. It's been a godsend to many farmers. Many of them don't ask for the help, but when the trucks roll up they are truly grateful. I've been out in that region talking to farmers who've been the recipient of the 200BALES campaign, and it's just lifted their spirits. So to Glenn Box, Kelly Dray, Will Bateman and the whole team—all of the hay runners—I just want to thank you on behalf of a grateful community for all of the work that you're doing.


As I've said, this drought has taken a heavy mental toll on our farmers as well. There are some wonderful people out there doing wonderful work, including the folks from Lifeline. I was at the launch of Lifeline's Drought Tool Kit recently in Orange, and there were many Lifeline volunteers there who give up their time. They don't get paid for it, but they work tirelessly through the night and through the day just to make sure that, when people call, there's someone there on the end of the line, and sometimes just being able to talk to someone can make all of the difference. Being out on farms can be isolating for people, and some of the farms are very physically isolated. Some are up in the high country, for example, in different parts of the Calare electorate. I think that just being able to talk to someone and knowing that someone's there if you need them and that you're not alone can make all of the difference. So I'd like to thank Lifeline and all of their hardworking volunteers. I also thank the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health. They've got the Glove Box Guide to Mental Health. Basically, both of these resources let farmers and farming families and communities know where they can get help. I've actually been into farmers' homes, talking to them, and on the table there has been the Glove Box Guide to Mental Health. Both of these publications, from Lifeline and the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health, are distributed through local publications, and I just wanted to thank them for that, because their work is largely unseen but the community should know that they're out there working really hard in very difficult times.


So we need to be backing our farmers to the hilt in this time of drought. During the recent economic slowdown, it was the Australian farmers and the farm sector which got Australia through, so they've actually been doing the heavy lifting economically for a long time now, and we can't take them for granted. If we want a strong and vibrant farm sector, we need to keep backing them through these dry times. I think people in the cities tend to take their food for granted. They just think that it's something that appears, but we can't take our farmers for granted. We need to be backing them and ramping up relief as these conditions worsen. I fully support this bill and commend it to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:43):  Labor is supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. However, I'm speaking in support of the second reading amendment that was moved by the member for Fenner, which really highlights the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's lack of any long-term policy, planning and approach to assist primary producers in rural Australia facing drought conditions. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow primary producers to immediately deduct, rather than depreciate over three years, the cost of fodder storage assets such as silos and hay sheds used to store grain and other animal feed. This will assist primary producers by making it easier to invest in stockpile fodder. The measure applies to fodder storage assets used or installed, or ready for use or installation, on or after 19 August 2018. The measure has a fiscal impact of $75 million over the forward estimates.


Despite these measures, it's clear that there has been a lack of any long-term policy and planning to assist primary producers in rural Australia facing drought conditions by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. New South Wales, the home state that I represent, is entirely in drought. Farmers are facing falling crops, short supplies of water and diminishing livestock feed. We've already heard from farmers who say that the government's slow response has been too little too late. Unfortunately, there's been no real planning by this government for drought conditions when we know—as we've heard from climate scientists and others—that we're going to face an increase in frequency and an increase in severity of drought conditions in Australia due to climate change.


The government has been on notice for some years now that, according to climate scientists, these conditions are going to worsen; but the government hasn't adequately planned for them and that's why many farmers are saying that this is too little too late. That's what happens when you have a policy vacuum and a failure of the hodgepodge, last-minute measures from the government. Drought policy shouldn't only be designed during a period of drought. It should be planned for during other periods to ensure that adequate planning has been done to cater for the fact that climate change is occurring in this country and that all of the evidence and all of the expert advice of climate scientists is that climate change is going to worsen the effects of drought and increase the frequency of drought in Australia.


We also need to ensure that the management of water resources is better planned for around the states, in terms of their provision of access to water resources through agreements with the Commonwealth government. Again, this is something that this government has a dismal record of planning for. Importantly, through measures such as what we're discussing today, our taxation arrangements and our system of deduction—particularly for the purchase of assets—need to be appropriate and meet the needs of farmers, ensuring that they can continue to operate and survive during drought conditions.


Unfortunately, this reactive approach to policy initiation by this government is all too common. We've seen this in terms of the financial services sector, which, again, has had a big effect on farmers. We've seen the rounds of evidence that have come through the banking royal commission and the effects that some bad decisions by banks have had on many farming families and businesses in the agricultural sector. Again, the royal commission was a knee-jerk reaction from this government. We should never forget that for 600-odd days, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments voted against a royal commission. That was when many farmers were saying that what was going on in their industry was at crisis levels and the government needed to initiate a royal commission. Many National Party senators, particularly Senator Williams, had been crying out for a royal commission for some years. Crisis shouldn't be the only catalyst for change when it comes to supporting Australian farmers.


Sadly, after the five years of policy inaction by the Turnbull and Morrison governments, we now have had four drought announcements within three months. Firstly, there was the increase in the farm household allowance payments from three years to four years, which is effective from 1 August 2018. Then, on 5 August, the government announced a $190 million package, claiming that it provided immediate additional financial support for farming families and their communities—although it didn't really, given that the additional funding didn't start flowing until 5 August. Time will tell how many farmers access the farm household allowance supplementary payment. It's possible that many farming families will miss out on the full $12,000 amount because the government insisted on splitting the payment and denying farmers the option of receiving a lump sum payment.


The minister then made no mention about increased funding for mental health support, yet last week the Prime Minister tweeted an extremely insensitive video claiming that drought was 'a necessary evil' and that it can help cut the bottom 10 per cent of people that 'probably shouldn't be there anyway'. That's not what struggling farmers need at this time of drought crisis. Labor have been asking the Prime Minister to apologise and remove this video for what we believe are insensitive remarks to people that are really battling and doing it tough at the moment.


On 19 August 2018, the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day as the National Drought Coordinator. Interestingly, no mention was made on the appointment of the drought envoy position by Prime Minister Morrison, and we think that that's quite telling. The member for New England was clearly an answer to a question that farmers had never been asked. Unfortunately, when the member for New England was the agriculture minister there was a distinct lack of action and planning to deal with what was inevitably going to be another drought situation in Australia, given the advice of climate scientists. Of course, we also had the failed white paper, which was full of short-term initiatives, many of which were so poorly designed that they never saw the light of day. One of his first acts as Minister for Agriculture was to dismantle the SCoPI, the COAG council working on long-term drought reform measures.


When it comes to drought relief, farmers have not experienced any meaningful and long-term planning from the various iterations of this conservative government. The government has failed to deliver long-term policy and planning for primary producers and rural Australians facing drought conditions, including a failure to take mitigation and adaptation responses when it comes to climate change. We need to help more farmers better adapt to climate change. It's pleasing to see that many farmers are now on the front line of arguments for greater action for climate change, because those that work on the land probably understand better than all of us that the climate is changing, that it is having an effect on conditions for farming in this country and that we need to embrace best-practice regenerative farming methods to combat drought. The National Farmers' Federation support this approach, saying that real impacts of climate change will mean that drought and rain events could be more extreme and could be more frequent, yet the Prime Minister still won't say whether human-induced climate change is associated with the drought. He's saying he's not terribly interested in engaging with this crucial aspect of policy design for supporting Australian farmers.


Unfortunately, when it comes to drought, energy policy or electricity prices—which, again, have had a big impact on the profitability of farms and farming businesses—the government is willing to ignore the evidence. Their ideology overlooks the fact that, according to climate scientists, widespread and prolonged droughts like the millennium drought will occur more frequently in Australia. Researchers at the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University argue that droughts are getting worse compared to recent centuries and may be exacerbated by climate change. In particular, they say that recent shifts in rainfall variability are either unprecedented or very rare. If it's serious about supporting farmers, the Morrison government must institute some long-term planning around drought resilience and ensure that the agricultural sector can survive what are going to be increasingly frequent and more severe events. We need to be doing that planning with the states to ensure that it takes place at a coordinated national level and has the support of the states. The Morrison government must also take immediate action to restore the COAG drought policy reform process, respond to the review into the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform and update the parliament on the progress of the new agreement.


We can't, as a nation, continue to ignore the fact that, unfortunately, according to climate scientists, drought is going to happen more frequently and more severely in this country. If this parliament have the interests of the livelihoods of Australian farmers and their families in mind—those that toil and work on the land year in, year out—then we need to make sure that we are properly planning to mitigate the effects of climate change and that we're working with state governments and local governments to ensure that we have better processes in place to mitigate those effects. That is what was being approached through the COAG process. It's disappointing that this government stopped that collaborative approach, and has really put its head in the sand about the effects of climate change that we see in their approach to energy policy and electricity prices. It's been five years since this government was elected, and they still don't have a policy on energy prices in this country. That's simply not good enough.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Mrs MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (10:55):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. I've said repeatedly in this House that I believe I'm the only dairy farmer in this place with a family and a business that's still actively dairy farming, and one that's passionately committed to our farmers in this nation and very keen to speak on their behalf at any given opportunity.


The government has acted to support our farmers during this period of drought. Those of us who are farmers live by the weather, and we have no control over it. There are times when life gets really tough for those of us who live and work on the land. There is no doubt that we love our dirt, we love the grass and we love the water, and we know how essential it is for those of us who farm. In my part of the world we fortunately have access to some irrigation systems fed by a series of dams in the hills. These dams are critical to the long-term future of the region, and I'm very pleased to see that the federal government is investing in securing and improving those water supplies in the Myalup-Wellington project. This underpins that the opportunity for all of us, basically, is water and the quality of our soils and how we manage our land.


I think around 90-plus per cent of our farming land is family owned. It's really a great testament to them—their passion and commitment for their land and their farms—and that they know to pass it on to a future generation in better condition, perhaps, than it was when they inherited it. That's a great passion that the farmers I meet have, and they do it particularly well. Often they make really challenging decisions that affect their bottom lines, about how they manage their property, their water supplies and their fertiliser. They're constantly having to improve, and they always are doing more with less—less land, less water and less fertiliser. Yet look at what we contribute to the Australian economy and how many people around the world we feed. That's a great tribute and a great testament to the efforts of our Australian farmers.


I am always proud to rise in this place and stand up for our farmers, to actually represent them. I don't want to see what we saw so many years ago with Labor, when they shut down the live cattle export trade overnight, and the damage that that brought to an industry, to individual people and to Indonesia itself. How important those cattle supplies and the live trade are. So when I look at the measures in this bill and I see the efforts around fodder storage assets—including the fact that a farmer has now an incentive through the tax system to be able to write off that asset purchase or the installation, whether it's silos or whether it's sheds or bins—and we talk about how we as farmers future-proof ourselves against the constant changes. In all my years as a farmer, I've seen constant change. Whether it's in rainfall or whether it's in weather patterns, it's been a period of constant change, and I suspect that will continue. When you look at your own individual business you have to make decisions about how you're going to manage that constant change. When I look at our irrigation system in the hills, there are years when we have not received a full allocation—in fact, we've received far less—and we still have to manage our farms and our businesses.


The farmers make those decisions on-farm. They decide what paddocks they might dry off. They decide what extra cost they have to go to—whether they're going to produce additional silage or hay, and whether they actually have to feed more bales to their animals to get through that period. Those are the decisions we make on a daily basis.


So this measure that the government is applying gives those that are constructing additional fodder storage an opportunity to write it off over one single year. This is in addition to the $20,000 instant asset write-off for the eligible small businesses, which is being extended further, yet again. The $20,000 instant asset write-off is really valuable, and it's being used extensively by small businesses—not just farming businesses but right across the board. I'm a great supporter of it and, with my colleagues, fought hard for these measures for small businesses—and of course our farmers are small businesses. This is a practical measure that allows farmers to make really good decisions in their businesses.


Some of those decisions are around managing their actual land. Around 96 per cent of farmers are members of landcare groups. These are the practical groups that make a difference on the ground on individual properties and in whole areas. Farmers work with catchment councils. There are a whole lot of groups that work together through our landcare movement to get improved outcomes on each individual property and for the farmers involved. It can be to do with water sources and water resources, it can be to do with fertiliser use or it can be around how they manage their business more broadly. We've seen no-till and low-till practices come out of Western Australia. These are all very important parts of how farmers individually make great decisions in their businesses, because the future of their business and future generations relies on the great decisions they're making today, and they do it on a daily basis.


I've said before in this House that we take for granted the quality of the food that we have available to us in this nation. I think the access to quality food has been brought into very sharp relief with what we've seen recently in relation to strawberries. I've been to other countries where the quality of the food is not what it is in Australia. I look at my own area in the South West of Western Australian, and we produce some of the best quality food in the world right there. I am inordinately proud of the people who produce it, often in really extreme circumstances. Some of our local climatic conditions can be extreme, but we still keep producing. We still keep making it available for people to walk into a supermarket or their local market or wherever they buy their products. As I say, Australians have basically never been hungry. When you go to other countries in the world that, during war years, have gone hungry, they place an extraordinary value on their farmers and the food that they consume. That's something that we've never had to think about too much in Australia. It's when we have a situation, such as we have with the strawberries, that brings that into sharp relief that people are immediately made very aware of the immediate impact on those businesses of simply not being able to sell their products.


I was really pleased this morning, when I was at a breakfast for GPs with the Minister for Health, that he took up to the podium a wonderful Australian strawberry and said he wanted to encourage people to cut and consume local strawberries. The minister has just entered the House. Minister, on behalf of every strawberry farmer in Australia, thank you for you what did this morning. It is a very important message to get out to people: to cut strawberries but not cut them out. I think that's a really simple message.


We see the volume of strawberries that are being dumped. I have heard of one group of over 100 people who've lost their jobs. That's the reality for those of us who live and work in rural regional Australia who are farmers. That's how direct it is. In small communities, the loss of 100 jobs has an enormous impact on every small business. So every time there's an issue, whether it's drought or a situation such as the one we're seeing with the strawberries, there is a loss of income.


The other issue that bothers me greatly is the impact on our international reputation. I hope the law takes absolutely full effect on the people who are doing this. This is having an enormous impact on our reputation as a clean, green producer of high-quality products, worldwide. That reputation is something that we as the farmers in this country have worked so hard for so many years to create. Often, historically, we've had to compete with countries that have significant tariff protection. It's only with the free trade agreements that this government has worked on and delivered that some of those barriers are starting to be, have been and will continue to be removed. But, historically, as farmers, we've often felt as though we've had to work with one hand tied behind our back because of the tariffs that were applied and the concessions that were available to farmers in other parts of the world. We have to compete, and we do compete very well, because we have some of the most efficient producers in the world. Not only are they efficient but they produce absolutely top-quality produce. And they will continue to do that no matter the challenges they face.


I'm really pleased to see the Rural Financial Counselling Service is available to our drought-stricken farmers. I'm encouraging every farmer to take advantage of that. Sit down with these people. There are a whole lot of things happening in your family. There are a whole lot of things happening in your business. There are a lot of things happening in, and impacts on, your community, and no-one is immune. Community service organisations; emergency services, often staffed by volunteers; local volunteers; local farmers; local people and local business people are all affected when we have a drought like we're having. They're also affected when we get a crisis like we're having with the strawberry farmers. There's going to be less money in the small local communities—in community service organisations and community sporting clubs. And that's not going to be overcome overnight either. The impacts of that are like dropping a stone into a bucket of water—the ripples continue. There will be businesses that may not survive this. As I said, the impacts are significant, and I want the full impact of the law to be visited upon those who are perpetrating this. It's having a much greater impact than people actually understand. It's having a direct impact on the ground with our farmers and with the pickers, the planters and the packers.


In Australia, as I said, the farmers produce some of the best-quality food in the world. I can say to the Australian people that we'll keep doing that. My dairy farmers are going to keep producing some of the best-quality milk in the world for you. They're going to continue to produce amazing products for you. I know that once the strawberry growers get back into full production, you'll be buying the most wonderful Australian produced strawberries. Whether it's in the horticultural sector, the food sector or the fibre sector, what everybody needs to know is that every farmer goes out there every day to do their job the best way they, and often it's under really tough circumstances. There are times when the market does not return the sorts of profits that were expected and demanded in other parts of our economy. But our farmers keen producing. And they produce extraordinary products. Look at the food that we take for granted when we walk into a supermarket. As I've said frequently, I look at some of the prices that are being paid in the supermarket—I'll touch on the $1 milk—and see that the market is demanding more and paying more for water than it is for milk. It's in the hands of our consumers. Make a great choice and buy a branded product—a branded product that you know pays more for that product so that our farmers, in the broader sense, are able to keep producing the products that we all take for granted.


Every farmer in Australia, as I've said previously, works constantly. They are very, very technology savvy. They are constantly innovating and improving. They don't sit back. Most of their information now is coming electronically. They're doing amazing work, and they rely on their technology. I'm really pleased with the mobile phone black spot tower rollout that we've been so strongly supporting and putting the funding into. This has made a huge difference to small businesses, which are, of course, our farming businesses. It gives them access and opportunities. They can be sitting in a tractor—the hay season is not far away, and I am really sorry that in New South Wales it's going to be a challenging hay season because they won't be able to grow the crops that they need for the next 12 months. It's not just this last 12 months that's affected by drought. Look at the feedstocks ahead. I want to thank every one of the farmers and organisations in Western Australia and around Australia who have contributed and are contributing fodder into New South Wales. They know that this is pushing up the prices for the rest of the farmers locally, but they're still doing it to support their fellow farmers. I thank and congratulate everyone who is doing that, and I say to the farmers affected by drought: 'Hang in there, and use your rural financial counselling services as well.'

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:10):  Labor will always stand by the people of the bush. People often forget—and it is worth reminding people sometimes, especially those opposite—that Labor was born of the bush. In 1892, the Australian Labor Party was born under a tree in Barcaldine, Queensland, during the Shearers' Strike. Men were fighting for a better deal. Men were fighting for better pay and conditions and a fair go from the pastoralists. Labor was born of the bush, and its mission to fight for a fair go has never changed.


Labor are proud to stand here today and support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018, but we're not going to pretend that this bill is the answer to all the problems that are besetting farmers during this drought. The bill before us today is, at best, a mild response to what is a very serious problem affecting New South Wales and Queensland. I don't want to belittle the bill, but it really is window-dressing. What it will do is offer mild relief to some farmers who are beset by drought. It will allow some farmers a provision whereby they can get instant asset write-offs for things like silos and grain sheds, rather than waiting three years for depreciation to take effect. It will be of some assistance, but it won't do nearly enough to address the real issues besetting farmers. 


One of the concerning things throughout this whole episode has been the government's rather piecemeal approach to responding to this drought. We've heard speeches from various members on this issue. We've seen this government's piecemeal approach reflected in the fracturing and the failures of the government itself. We've had a National Party leader replaced by another National Party leader. We've had an agriculture minister replaced by another agriculture minister. We've had a Prime Minister replaced by another Prime Minister. The failures of this government are reflected in the failures of its drought strategy. It is a fractured and piecemeal approach; it is not good enough. It is not good enough that there has not been a coordinated, strategic approach to combatting this drought. 


As I said before, this bill is a very modest measure in the scheme of things. It will have a fiscal impact of around $75 million over the forward estimates—and, to be blunt, it is window-dressing. It will be of some assistance to farmers, but it won't do much—and we really should not pretend that it will. This is, as I say, the fourth drought announcement by the government in three months. Instead of planning and preparing a comprehensive response, the government is, frankly, all over the place—a little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit later on. It has all the hallmarks of the utter dysfunction that plagues the government. People who are struggling to keep their heads above water, who are in tears over the condition and misery of starving stock, deserve better. 


On 19 June the government announced an increase in farm household allowance payments from three years to four, effective 1 August 2018—a very modest measure. On 5 August, the government announced a $190 million financial support package and a $12,000 supplement to the farm household allowance. The government announced it but the funds weren't released then—no; the government has split the payment. So farmers who are beset by drought now must wait till the next financial year before they can access the second $6,000 instalment. It's unnecessary red tape getting in the way of helping farming families who are in need of assistance today. 


Later on, the minister announced some increased funding for mental health support. I welcome this initiative. Done properly, it will be of great assistance, and I do commend the minister for this thoughtful initiative. I know mental health workers in my electorate do incredibly important work and have saved scores of people, particularly men, from taking their own lives. I refer in particular to the organisation Rural Alive and Well—or RAW, as it is better known—which is based in the town of Oatlands in my electorate. The more we can do to improve the mental health and psychological resilience of farmers and other members of regional communities, especially in times of financial crisis, the better. It is difficult to get men in regional Australia to open up about mental health, but it's getting better. There is less stigma attached to discussing and disclosing mental health, and we must do all we can to ensure that we remain on this trajectory.


A couple of weeks later, on 19 August, the then Prime Minister announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day as National Drought Coordinator. I have every confidence that Major General Day will bring his expertise to bear in bringing together charities, NGOs, donors and arms of government, and I look forward to getting a progress report from the minister. It has been a month since Major General Day was appointed and I know the parliament would be keen to get an update on how things are going.


Then, following the still unexplained change of Prime Minister—and the country is still asking why: a question the government seems unable to answer—the member for New England was announced as drought envoy, a position we know little about in terms of what it is meant to achieve other than perhaps to keep the troublesome member for New England in Queensland and New South Wales as much as possible. Indeed, in his first week on the job, the drought envoy suggested diverting water that is vital for environmental sustainability to farmers and also suggested opening national parks to grazing. He has been silent, however, as far as I know, about his government's decision to allow Adani to access 12.5 billion litres of river water without going through an environmental impact study.


The fact is that the government's drought response has been a mess. Farmers have had to contend with, first, the change in the Nationals—with the member for New England out as leader, Deputy Prime Minister and agricultural minister, and the member for Riverina in as leader and Deputy Prime Minister, and the member for Maranoa in as the agriculture minister—and then the change in the Liberal leadership, with the former member for Wentworth out as Prime Minister and the member for Cook in as Prime Minister. From all the public statements flying about, it seems responsibility for the drought response is being undertaken jointly by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the agriculture minister, the drought envoy and the Drought Coordinator.


What makes this dog's breakfast even more bewildering is that the government had a template for drought response at its fingertips. Ten years ago, the Productivity Commission completed an inquiry into drought support and, in 2008, the federal and state primary industries ministers, the majority of them representing conservative governments, signed an agreement on drought reform. The ministers, sitting as the COAG committee known as SCoPI, agreed to commission the PC inquiry and report. So a coordinated drought response was ready to go, pretty much with a ribbon tied around it, but instead it has been all but ignored and discarded.


In fact, the federal coalition elected in 2013 abolished SCoPI and thereby removed an important coordinating body between the federal and state primary industries ministries. It was an act of policy vandalism, idiocy and arrogance to abolish SCoPI and it bore all the hallmarks of a born-to-rule federal coalition government that believes it, and only it, has all the answers and needs no input from the states to develop policy. The result has been a disaster. With New South Wales and Queensland suffering the worst drought in living memory, there has been no coordinated or strategic response. Ten years after a coordinated drought response was agreed to by all levels of government and backed by key farm leadership groups, we are scrambling with three piecemeal announcements in two months from a government that's changed leadership amongst both its senior and its junior coalition party partners.


The elephant in the room is climate change. The mere mention of climate change is enough to have some coalition members sticking their fingers in their ears and making loud sounds to drown out the noise. The truth hurts. Climate change is real. It is here, it is happening and it is having a real and lasting impact on our agricultural sector. The former agriculture minister, the member for New England, did nothing about mitigating the impacts of climate change because he simply doesn't believe it's real. He says, 'We've always had droughts and we always will.' He shrugs and says, 'This is no different than what's happened in the past.' It's a she'll-be-right attitude that flies in the face of scientific, measurable facts. Annual temperatures are hotter than they've ever been in recorded history. The trends are hotter and dryer. Extreme events are occurring more often and are more extreme. Any agriculture minister who seeks to respond to the drought without having a climate change strategy is not doing their job.


Climate change is the elephant in the room and it has to be contended with. Those opposite just have to deal with climate change; they have to get on board with this. They can't say, 'There's a drought on right now. We can't discuss climate change. That would be insensitive to those going through it.' Increasingly, we're getting farmers and those who represent farmers saying to us, 'Yes, climate change is real. Yes, it's having a real impact on our farms and on our ability to grow produce. We need to have a strategy to deal with it.' Farmers are calling out for this. Farmers are just as frustrated as we on this side are by the government's failure to grapple with the scientific facts that climate change is real and that climate change is absolutely contributing to the conditions that farmers face today.


This is a land of drought and flood; we know that. But the 100-year floods are now 20-year floods. The bushfires are hotter and faster. They are happening more often. The experts, the measurable data, the facts and the charts tell us that climate change is responsible. You have to have a strategy in place to deal with it. You can't have a drought response and you can't have a response to the crisis enveloping Queensland and New South Wales without having a climate change strategy. It is absolutely crucial.


I will finish where I started off: Labor will always stand by the people of the bush. We were born of the bush. We're not what those opposite like to paint us as. We're not just a bunch of inner-city lefties who go down to the cafe for a soy latte. That's not us. We represent blue-collar workers: farmers, shearers and the men and women in the shops and the IGAs. It was Labor in Tasmania that brought on the irrigation scheme that is transforming Tasmania today. It was Labor who put through the infrastructure, the roads through the regions, that allow us to get to goods to market quicker. It is Labor that looks after the bush.


The pretenders over there think that wearing a big hat and having a subscription to RM Williams is enough to make people think that they represent the bush. They say one thing out there to the people in the regions, and then they come in here and all they do is vote with the Liberals on big corporate policy. It was Labor fighting the $17 billion giveaway to the big banks. It wasn't the National Party standing up for the people of the regions when the Liberals were trying to give that $17 billion corporate handout to the big banks. It was Labor that helped get that stopped; it was Labor that brought on the policy change from the government. We brought the pressure to bear to stop the $17 billion giveaway to the big banks. It wasn't the National Party; they rolled over and had their tummies tickled on that.


I just mention here, by way of passing—and I don't want to get personal—that I can't help but smile when I recall that the deputy leader of the National Party, the self-proclaimed party of the battlers of the bush, doesn't live in the regions. She lives in inner-city Melbourne, if I recall, in the member for Melbourne's seat. The deputy leader of the National Party lives in a Greens seat. That's what I understand. I'm happy to be proven wrong.




Mr Hunt:
  If you want to go down to where your members live, we'll do that.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  That's okay. That's okay. As I say, I'm just mentioning by way of passing that the Nationals put on the big hats, the checked shirts and the RM Williams and they wear the whips on their sides as if somehow that tells the story of representing the bush, and it's not accurate. It takes more. It takes policy answers to represent the people of the bush and the people of the regions. It takes policy and a commitment to the real issues: cost of living, Medicare, access to health and access to infrastructure. These are the real issues that affect the people of the bush and the people of the regions. Instead, what the National Party does is vote with the Liberals every day of the week to back in the big corporates, even against the interests of the people of the regions, and they need to be held to account for it.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (11:25):  I too take great pleasure in rising today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. I'd hoped that the member for Lyons might stay here for a minute. He might learn something. I will not be lectured by the Labor Party about responses to drought. I have been in this place for more than a decade, and for three decades before that I was a farmer. I have lived through the Keating years, when we were paying 22 per cent interest, and I know what it's like trying to farm in that area. I was in this House when the member for Watson, as the minister for agriculture, changed drought policy. He said: 'We don't have drought policy anymore. We now won't even refer to the word ""drought"". We are going to refer to it as ""dryness"". Because of climate change, we're going to have ""dryness"".' He talks about farmers wanting to adapt to climate change. Well, I can tell you our farmers are way ahead of the field, mate. I have my colleague here with me. When he was the shadow minister for the environment, he got to see what my farmers are doing with zero-till, where they're conserving every drop of moisture and growing crops now in adverse climates. Your mates in the Greens want to ban glyphosate, so even that's going to be harder.


We hear the members opposite talking about there being no response to the drought. The federal government has committed $1.8 billion so far, and that figure is rising. The former minister for agriculture Barnaby Joyce's white paper brought in accelerated depreciation for fodder storage, water, grain silos and fencing. Previously it was 15 to 20 years; it was brought back to three years. This legislation brings it back to instant asset write-off. If the members opposite actually knew something about regional Australia, not just what they saw on Facebook or popular TV shows, they might know that that policy has made a big difference in how farmers are impacted by this drought. I've spoken to many of my farmers who are now selling grain at a good price because they took the initiative that was offered to them by the government and have invested in their own storages. This patronising idea that I'm getting from members of the Labor Party that somehow farmers need the government to tell them what to do and are somehow poor, helpless individuals is something I find deeply offensive, and so do the people that I represent.


This legislation is very much appreciated and welcomed by the farmers that I represent, because farmers are not victims. Farmers will know that this is a genuine piece of legislation that will help them plan for the next drought. It gives them greater control not only in their preparedness for drought but in the general marketing and storage of their own product. At the moment, we have a crisis because of the shortage of hay. One of the reasons for this is that the vast majority of all hay that is produced never leaves the farm that produces it. It is cut and stored in preparation for drought. This legislation will enable farmers, when the seasons return and they end up with a wool cheque or a grain crop, to instantly depreciate the cost of a hay shed so that they can store more hay on farm, ready for the next drought.


The cash storage through the farm management deposits scheme is very important. The fact that farmers can withdraw that in less than the 12-month period during a period of drought, to enable that cash to be used to help through the drought to purchase that fodder, is very important. This morning I spoke to one of my constituents, who was unloading a load of hay, and he said that load of hay has brought his fodder bill for this drought up to $400,000. That's what one farmer has spent on fodder. He said that, because he had the money in a farm management deposit scheme, put aside for that very purpose, he's managed this drought. Those opposite would have the government in control of what farmers do.


I have heard academics in the last couple of weeks saying, 'Maybe we're going to need legislation, so that farmers can be instructed where they're going to grow certain crops, or run livestock.' I can tell you one thing that farmers don't want: they don't want the government in their lives. They want the government to provide positive programs like this: legislation like this will help them.


The member for Hunter has just walked in. Some of the comments he has made about this drought over the last month I find deeply offensive to the farmers that I represent. They are getting thoroughly sick of being treated as victims. I can tell you that the farmers in Australia are the most productive and the most innovative in the world—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  A point of order: there are processes in the House. If the member wants to make allegations he needs to authenticate them. What quotes from the member for Hunter is he referring to?




Mr COULTON:
  The member for Hunter wants me to go through them. I probably wouldn't have enough time left in my speech, but I have heard comments about the lack of support—$1.8 billion going to farmers is not a lack of support. The member for Hunter was a member of the government that removed that policy when the member for Watson was the minister, so one of the advantages of—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  With your support—




Mr COULTON:
  Rubbish. One of the advantages of being here for a long time is that you have a corporate memory of these things.


This legislation is very, very important. This legislation, to be honest, is not going to help farmers through the current drought; this legislation is all about preparedness for the next one. During the current drought, we are supplying farmers with household support. That money is to provide some dignity: to take the pressure from the daily lives of farmers who need to worry about how they're going to clothe and get food for their families, and other basic essentials.


Major General Day has been appointed as National Drought Coordinator to facilitate and coordinate some of the programs that are in train now. I know that last week he was speaking to the charities to try and get a coordinated approach, so that we don't have areas that are falling through the cracks.


With the help of social media, this drought has brought the plight of farmers to people in the cities. The support that's coming from people away from farms has been exceptional, and I know it's very much appreciated. But one of the downsides of social media campaigns is that the true situation is probably not presented. When people see a picture of a skinny cow, there could be various reasons why that cow is in that condition, and it's not always as portrayed. As I've touched on earlier, one of my concerns about the current drought is that farmers are being portrayed as a group that have lost control of their own industry, and their own destiny, and that's far from the truth. They're incredibly resilient.


I don't come into this place speaking from theory or philosophy; I've actually lived through droughts as a farmer. Several times in my life I've gone through drought seasons where we haven't grown a grain for the entire year. I know what it's like trying to purchase sugarcane tops from the coast to feed cattle when you've exhausted your own supplies. I know what it's like to spend night after night on a machine baling hay in preparation for the next drought. I know the work that's involved in this. I stand up here today in support of the farmers that I represent and the farmers of Australia, knowing that this drought will end, knowing that they will step up and be back in production very, very quickly and knowing that the vast majority of them out there now, while it's incredibly difficult, are managing this because they have prepared. They have prepared because of previous policies put in place by this government.


This legislation that we're talking about today will certainly make preparation more appropriate and easier for them to do for the next drought. When production does return, they'll be able to take advantage of the markets that are opening up now through the free trade agreements that are being negotiated—some are already agreed to; some are before the House at the moment—which will enable them to trade on the global stage at an advantage over our competitors. I support this legislation. I know that the farmers I represent support this legislation. They are pleased to see a government that's actually putting in practical measures, not the philosophical, ideologically driven, patronising discussions that we're hearing from the other side.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (11:36):  What an embarrassing contribution from the member for Parkes, full of fluff and full of platitudes. Oh, my God! We couldn't have academics making a contribution to one of the most serious challenges facing this parliament and our country! We couldn't have policy based on fact! We can't have long-term planning! We just have to trust people like the member for Parkes, who, of course, is a farmer! That makes him the expert! He's practical! His approach is practical! I heard the member for Forrest saying the same thing, declaring herself a dairy farmer. Well, here's an idea: how about some of these members start declaring an interest in some of these matters. If I were a financial planner and I came in here to speak about a matter relating to financial planning, they'd be all over me like a rash. Conflict of interest, they'd be saying.


Now, let us not have this great boast from those on the other side that, because they are farmers, they don't need policy contribution from any of the experts. That's a ridiculous proposition, and it's an embarrassing proposition for this national parliament. Farmers don't want just sympathy and platitudes from their members of parliament; they want a government that reacts properly, thoughtfully and in a timely way. We are in the seventh year of this drought, and this is a government that did nothing until the media started paying this issue attention. Yes, we had some concessional loans. We had some concessional loans which, of course, were a replication of concessional loans programs that the former Labor government had in place. But concessional loans have been the policy response of choice for this government. No matter what the problem: 'Oh, we'll set up some concessional loans.' Which takes me to the point the member for Parkes made: this continual misrepresentation of what this government is spending on drought. They say $1.8 billion. Well, how did we get to $1.8 billion? Pretty simply. What they do is count the full capital value of all loans provided for, whether they're taken up by farmers or not. Have a think about that. They put a billion dollars aside for drought loans and they count that as a contribution to the drought assistant package whether or not farmers take those loans.


That takes me to the contribution of the member for Calare. I listened carefully to the member for Calare. Of course it wasn't that long ago that the member for Calare was boasting that the member for New England's so-called Regional Investment Corporation in Orange was going to create 200 jobs. Think about that. Then it was 100 jobs. I'll tell you how many jobs the Regional Investment Corporation has provided so far—one, and it's an interim job. This Regional Investment Corporation is no longer mentioned by the member for Calare. I wonder why that is. The answer, of course, is that he's moved beyond the political phase of that campaign or that idea and he's now realising what a joke the member for New England's proposition was. We all know it was a response to another very bad state by-election result for the coalition in 2016. They said: 'We'll have to do something about that. We can't have the National Party losing Orange. We'll create a pork-barrelling exercise and put a regional investment corporation into that town.' That is a regional investment corporation which still has no office, still has no staff and still has no real job to do.


We need a government that is serious about drought reform and drought policy, not a government that comes late to the party and makes three announcements within two months because the media has started taking notice. The only thing that has occurred more often in this country than drought itself has been the review of drought policy, including the one we started in 2009, the Productivity Commission's review, which was manifested in the 2013 intergovernmental agreement on drought.


Speaking of that agreement, I've got a confession to make. I changed my positioning on the speakers list, hoping to follow the member for New England. I was hoping to respond to his contribution. Alas, he's not here. I've been around this place long enough to know he may have good reason not to be here, so all I can do is express my disappointment that the member for New England hasn't presented himself to the House to make his contribution and my disappointment that I won't have the opportunity to respond to him. But I still hope he makes his way in here at some point to explain himself and to explain why, over a five-year period, he stalled drought policy reform in this country, he didn't progress the intergovernmental agreement on drought policy and he abolished the Standing Council on Primary Industries, the key COAG committee which was to progress that reform. He does need to come in here and explain himself.


He will talk about concessional loans and he will talk about the provisions in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. Labor support the provisions in this bill. We support anything that will help farmers through drought after a five-year hiatus on drought reform policy. We must. We don't agree absolutely with any of the policies this government has put forward, but we've been prepared to support them because they are the only thing on offer and it's the only thing an opposition can hope to do—urge the government to act and support anything that it does, within reason. There's nothing wrong with an immediate write-off or an investment in storage. That can only help. I do note, though, that the Productivity Commission rejected that proposal because they argued there's no market failure obvious and there's no broader community outcome or benefit in it. I'll challenge that somewhat because I would argue that, if this helps farmers better prepare for and protect themselves from drought, there is a broader community benefit. We know that it's not just farmers affected by drought; the communities around them are affected by a drop in income and therefore a drop in consumer spending in their towns.


Not only have we had a five-year hiatus but we don't even know who is in charge of drought policy in this country anymore. We had the member for New England, and then he was gone, and now we have Minister Littleproud, and he's still floating around, but we have the Drought Coordinator, Major General Day, and now we have the drought envoy, and there appears to be no coordination between them. I welcome the member to New England to the debate. I'm glad he turned up at my urging. I would have been most disappointed if he hadn't. We don't know, after a five-year hiatus, who is in charge of drought policy in this country. Is it the envoy? Is it Minister Littleproud? Is it Major General Day? We simply don't know.


Those on the other side can't have it both ways. They come in here with their platitudes and unthoughtful contributions, but they also want to tell us how well the farmers are doing. Thankfully it is true that some farmers are doing it okay. Some farmers have managed to better prepare for drought than others. Sometimes those reasons are merely geographical, sometimes it's about access to infrastructure, but it is true that some have done better than others. But it's counterintuitive for those on the other side to come in here on a daily basis and claim credit for the things that are doing well but not accept responsibility for the others.


Thank goodness the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in charge of drought policy, because he told us via tweet last week, by authorising a video, that drought is a necessary evil. What it does, he said by authorising the video, is it allows you to wipe out the bottom 10 per cent who are struggling most. What an amazing thing for a Prime Minister to say. I know the Minister for Health would have been shocked by that as well. The Prime Minister tweeted and authorised, and therefore promoted and endorsed, a video that claimed drought is a necessary evil because it wipes out the bottom 10 per cent who shouldn't be there anyway.




Mr Hunt:
  That is utterly false.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  The Minister for Health says that's a false accusation. I say to the minister that I was very careful about how I said that. He tweeted and authorised a video in which that was said. I think in anybody's language that is akin to promoting and endorsing thoughts in that video, particularly when the text of the tweet said something like 'another way of thinking about drought'. If the Prime Minister wasn't sympathetic to that statement, there is no way in the world he would have tweeted that video. What is the alternative explanation? What other conclusion could we possibly come to? Why else would the Prime Minister be tweeting that video and writing something like 'another perspective on drought'? There's only one conclusion you can come to.


Those opposite have been coming to this debate saying, 'We've been doing this; we've been doing that.' I've dealt with those issues, but members of the House don't have to take my word for it. At the National Press Club recently the president of the National Farmers' Federation, Fiona Simson, said this:


… we don't have a comprehensive national strategy to deal with drought.


That's what the president of the National Farmers' Federation said, and she is right, because the member for New England stopped the progress of the reform program.


The member for Parkes outrageously gestured over towards the opposition and said, 'They got rid of all the good programs.' I remind the member for Parkes that that historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the states in 2013 was supported by all members in this place of all political persuasions—I shouldn't say that; I'm not sure what the member for Kennedy, for example, had to say at the time, but it was supported by the major parties and that minor party they call the National Party, even though that's not really their name, and the National Farmers' Federation. This approach was the commencement of a program which had the support of all the major parties and the leading farm organisations. It is not appropriate for the member for Parkes to be pointing his finger across at this side; he should be pointing his finger at himself, because his party was very much part of that process.


You can't have a drought policy or hope to develop and progress a drought policy until you accept that the climate is changing, fairly obviously, and until you accept that it's important—if only based on the precautionary principle—to do something about carbon emissions. We have to do something about carbon emissions. Again, we've had five years of a government that is unprepared to do that and climate deniers like the member for New England, who want to continually run a political campaign on that point. It doesn't have to come at a high cost; the cheapest way to do it is through the electricity sector. The best way to prevent this ridiculous discussion about going to the farm sector for the abatement is to do something in the electricity sector. But the member for New England doesn't want to do that. If people start gesturing to the idea of going to the farm sector for the abatement, blame people like the member for New England, who don't want to do anything in the electricity sector.




Mr Joyce:
  Why don't you do something about water policy?





Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Yes, I will say something about water. It was the Labor Party that built water infrastructure projects in this country in the six years it was in government. I heard my colleague talking about the Northern Midlands project in Tasmania. That was entirely a Labor project. How about Chaffey Dam in the member for New England's electorate? That was entirely a Labor project. I give credit to the former member for New England, Mr Windsor, who urged the Labor government at the time to build that augmentation project. The member for New England has to stop taking credit for things he had no responsibility for. He needs to get on board with some decent drought policy. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England) (11:52):  What a load of nonsense. What a load of prattle and nonsense. I don't know where to start with such a load of nonsense. Let's start with the fact that there was no extension on Chaffey Dam when Labor, the Greens and Independents—that lot was a merry little bunch—left government. We had to get the approval through. They didn't have an approval. They were bent over backwards looking after the Booroolong frogs.


You have listened, ladies and gentlemen out there in radio land, to the shadow minister for agriculture. Did you hear one thing that could even vaguely relate to a policy by the Labor Party? Of course not. Oh, hang on—they have to do something about carbon emissions! They said that, before they do anything, they've got to do something about carbon emissions first. The member for Hunter is going to cool the planet and, after he's done that, he'll come back and give you a drought policy! If there's anybody still here when that happens, good luck to you. There will be nothing left. Those opposite never have the gumption, they never have the motivation and they never have the muscle to come in here and nominate something that they will actually do. What they do is say: 'Well, you know, we're going to first of all reduce carbon emissions. We'll then look after the farmers who have no money. We'll then look after the fact that there is no fodder.' They don't even mention that. There's no plan.


I'm going to give you a plan. We'll start by moving 6,500 tonnes of fodder over to Parkes. We're talking about that today. There's another 500 tonnes just up the road; that's going to join up with it as well. We're also talking about what we're going to do with the crop. There's a crop over in Western Australia that's just had to deal with a frost, and that frost means that there is a great capacity for wheat and hay to be moved to the east. We've been having discussions this morning with the Prime Minister about how we can get further stimulus into regional towns on top of the $1 million that we've put into every council in the drought areas to help them out. Ladies and gentlemen, these are policies.


Here, today, we are talking about a 100 per cent write-off for fodder storage assets. That's huge. If you spend $10 million on new silos, you can write them off straightaway. If it's associated with the drought, you can do that. That's real policy, just like we have the 100 per cent write-off for water reticulation, which is part of a white paper; just like we have the 100 per cent write-off for fencing, which is part of a white paper; and just like we've changed the farm management deposits from $400,000 to $800,000, which is part of a white paper.




Mr Drum:
  What did you ever do, Joel? What did your mob do?




Mr JOYCE:
  What did they do? We set up the Regional Investment Corporation, a new regional based bank which the Labor Party are going to get rid of. We have put money on the table to build the inland rail. The Labor Party hasn't. The Labor Party doesn't believe in it. We have money on the table for dams. The Labor Party is going to take the money out. That's the difference. Everywhere they go, they are destroyers. They are the political Shiva of rural Australia. Every time they go somewhere, they are going there to destroy it. We believe in decentralisation. Does the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, stand by the movement of APVMA to Armidale? He's silent now, isn't he? He will never actually go in to bat for regional Australia. Well, the Labor Party candidate in Armidale wants to know where you are. The Labor Party candidate in Armidale wants to know where you're going. He'd like you to go a long, long way away. That's where he'd like you to go, because you're not helping him when you arrive. Everywhere they go, they never stand up for regional Australia—never once. We always have to go back in to bat.


It's great to be sitting in the room today with the Prime Minister, with Major General Stephen Day, with the president of the NFF, Fiona Simson, and with the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, to try to make sure we take this step forward. Not once has the Labor Party gone to the dispatch box at question time and asked a question about drought. They don't do it, because the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Hunter, is so politically impotent that he does not have the capacity to get a question through tactics. He can't get a question up at tactics time. Either they just don't care about agriculture or they don't care about him. I say it's both. They don't care about either.


So we have so much more to do, and we're going to make sure that we drive ahead. I am happy to say that, in my discussions with the Prime Minister this morning, there's a real motivation. We are going to make sure that the empathy stops and the action starts, starting right now. About now, or in a few minutes time, the Prime Minister will be doing a press conference, and I'm absolutely certain that he will be mentioning the further things we have to do to assist other areas, especially with what's happening with the adulteration in the strawberry industry and the disaster and hurt that has caused. That would be something you'd believe—




Mr Drum:
  They might want to ask a question.




Mr JOYCE:
  They might want to ask a question on that. Maybe the shadow minister for agriculture might get a question today and show some interest. I'm going to help you out. I'm going to help you out. I'm going to ask the Labor leader for tactics, Mr Tony Burke, the Manager of Opposition Business, to see if he can get the member for Hunter a question today. I plead with you: give the member for Hunter a question today. Give him some relevance. I'm helping you out here. Give him some relevance.


What we are doing here is building on the $4 billion agriculture white paper. It's great to see the dam that we built, Chaffey Dam, the dams in the Midlands in Tasmania that we are building and the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline that we are building. It's great to see the pipeline that we are building in the Macalister Irrigation District. And what about Rookwood weir, which we're building? The Labor Party fought it all the way through. They ran to any rathole they could to look after their Greens mates and Greens preferences. We're trying to get infrastructure built. I know the member for Kennedy. He's a big fan of Hells Gate. This is a great project. You've got no hope of ever getting something like that past the Labor Party. They'll be looking after their Greens mates, the same Greens mates they look after when they don't want to open up Galilee Basin. It's incredibly peculiar that the member for Hunter, formerly supported by blue-collar workers, has turned his back on them as he turned his back on the farmers. They've given up and become the party for the inner suburban areas, and they're getting a vote to match.


This bill is part and parcel. It's not the fight; it's the start of a whole range of issues that we have to deal with in what is the worst drought on record in certain areas. The rainfall of Tamworth so far this year is slightly better than the annual rainfall of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. It is so devastating that what is happening right now is that there are gum trees—and they're a pretty good indicator of how dry it gets—dying because of a lack of water. We have a national crisis, and we have to deal with it as a national crisis.


We have to hope that the efforts of this parliament are put towards a constructive debate to drive policy. So I'm happy that we have made changes to the farm household allowance, and I commend the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, who's just now come into the chamber. We've gone a long way. I remember when the Labor Party were in government only 367 people got access to the farm household allowance. Now we have well in excess of 8,000 people who have had access to it, and this is so vitally important. It's uncapped. About a quarter of a billion dollars has been spent on it, and that's so vitally important. That's really money that is going on the table to help people. And I know there's more we can do to streamline that application process, and I know the minister for agriculture is working on that. We had discussions about precisely that this morning, and the minister for agriculture is doing an absolutely remarkable job, a splendid job. He's hard at work. Because of the vastness of his electorate, the member for Maranoa has such a great understanding of how agriculture works.


I know that the member for Maranoa, the minister for agriculture, would dearly love to be challenged in question time by the vociferous and cogent questions delivered by the member for Hunter. But he isn't! The member for Maranoa might as well do sudoku when he comes in here because he never gets a question from the member for Hunter.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Point of order, Member for Hunter.




Mr JOYCE:
  Oh my gosh, he's on his feet!





Mr Fitzgibbon:
  I alert the member for New England to the fact that he doesn't have to go his full 15 minutes.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for New England has the call.




Mr JOYCE:
  He's a funny man! Gosh! He's in the wrong career, the member for Hunter. He should have been at the Emmys the other night. He would have done a lot better job!


We have to make sure that we get the absolute focus of this nation's parliament on helping these people who are doing it so tough during the drought. We now know that in the abattoirs—I was speaking to one the other day—they are killing many of the cows with the calf inside. That means people are going through their breeding herds. And because they're going through their breeding herds that means when the drought is over there's going to be serious problems for abattoirs. The stock prices will go through the roof and their capacity to make a dollar is going to go through the floor. The last thing we want is for these abattoirs to shut down, because that will mean blue-collar workers, who we have to look after that, will be out of work. Part of the challenge of this parliament would be to suggest how we're going to keep these workers—many of them are probably members of the AWU—in a job. Has the Labor Party ever proposed during question time a discussion about this? Of course not. They've talked about the reduction of carbon emissions. Well, I'm sure I'll be able to hand that to someone on the boning floor of a local abattoir. I'll say, 'What the Labor party is going to do for you is reduce carbon emissions. Good luck; I hope that keeps you in a job.' But I don't think it will. I think they'll be looking for something a little more direct than that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  A little bit more tangible.




Mr JOYCE:
  A little bit more tangible. They'll want something to take home to their partner. How are they going to pay for their house if the abattoir closes down? I don't think it's going to be a policy on carbon emission reductions. I think it's going to be: what is the government doing to make sure that, if this drought continues, I, as a meat worker, still have a job? The Labor Party won't ask those questions, but we are. We are in the process of working out precisely how we deal with issues such as that.


The drought has become more pronounced in the last years. You might have been in opposition for five years, and that's very understandable. If you look at how you performed, it's a wonder you're not there for 50 years. What we have to make sure of is that we continue on this path—a 100 per cent write-off for fencing, a 100 per cent write-off for water and, now, a 100 per cent write-off for all your fodder storage, and the extension and streamlining of the farm household allowance. We're making sure that the Regional Investment Corporation that we set up and that the Labor Party wants to get rid of is focused on making sure that, when the recovery phase comes, we're able to deliver an outcome back to regional Australia to keep the cash flow going. The stimulus package is a million dollars per council. I'm sure there is more we can do. I know that the Prime Minister has been made aware of that by the ardent efforts of such people as the member for Maranoa in making sure we go forward with a drought policy that actually delivers on this crisis. A great example of how a government works is how they deal with a crisis. Away from all the theatrics there is something very important: who is providing a path of real policy to deal with the crisis of the drought? I would suggest that the National Party and the Liberal Party, supported by such people as the member for Kennedy, are doing that. I would suggest that the Labor Party have said nothing. They have shown that, when a crisis is at their door, they have nothing to say except theatre—




Mr Drum:
  Negativity.




Mr JOYCE:
  and negativity. They never come forward and challenge us with real policies. It is all a rhetorical flourish. As we are speaking here today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018 is showing precisely that. We are bringing forward the legislation to support Australian farmers. This is merely part of what is to come. I think it's going to be very important for people—it's good to see Councillor Webb and Mr Bede Burke in the gallery today—to understand that this parliament is hard at work helping them, making sure that we ask the questions and deliver on the outcomes so that we can get fodder from Western Australia over to Tamworth, Gunnedah and the Upper Hunter, an area quite relieved that they now have an advocate who takes agriculture in their area seriously. It's going to be an interesting test today: will the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, in the middle of a record drought, get a question up? Once more the only ones that people in regional Australia can truly rely upon are the National Party and the Liberal Party.

"Katter, Bob, MP",KAP,2018-09-19,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (12:07):  It was very good to go to Brisbane, where there were three ex-treasurers and two ex-premiers of Queensland, to listen to Sir Leo Hielscher. Two of the three biggest bridges in Australia are named for Sir Leo Hielscher. I think he was the outstanding figure in economic administration in the nation's last hundred years. A tribute to him was that so many important people—there were four ex-ministers as well, myself being one of them—were in that room for his address. For me it was Paradise Lost. Was the world ever really like that? The budgerigar media and the lily-pad lefties say, 'But Bjelke-Petersen; they are corrupt.' There was never a single case of corruption; there were four ministers who misused their personal travel allowance money. That's not government corruption; government corruption is when you do a job for somebody, the public benefit is involved and you get recompense for that. There was never any of that. It was all police corruption.


I am going sideways; let me return. I would ask the budgerigars supposedly in government to listen to what I am saying. You can see the minister is having a little chat with his mate over here. If he were to listen to me, he might find out what needs to be done in these situations, because I was in a government which successfully dealt with them. The price of sugar in Queensland in the eighties dropped clean in half, as it does regularly. It is a cyclical effect that occurs, like a drought. You have to be ready for it. A well-run government has to know how to handle it.


I point out to the people listening to this debate that the minister is now having a chat with somebody else, and that's what I would probably be doing if I were in his shoes, because he's been in those shoes for some time, I am informed, and he has done absolutely nothing about the drought. What we did was immediately discuss with the state bank a reconstruction loans approach. The head of the bank said no; so we asked him again and again and again. When two weeks were up, according to the media, we sacked him. Whether we sacked him or not, I will leave that to somebody else to say. After his departure from the state bank, I had primary responsibility for it. The Treasurer, Bill Gunn, and I were very close friends. We worked closely together and we discussed it. As usual, we put out, I think, about $700 million or $800 million in loans to the sugar industry. 


I want to repeat that, while I have been telling the minister what a successful government did to deal with these problems, he has been constantly talking. He is not the slightest bit interested in finding out what to do, which leaves it open to me to savagely attack him for having no interest whatsoever in solutions to this problem. We borrowed $700 million or $800 million. We bought out the banks so that the sugar industry—



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  He is now laughing, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will give a running commentary on his performance while I'm speaking. People will enjoy this. We're talking about a situation where it would appear that a farmer is doing away with himself every five or six days, and he is laughing! 



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  And now he is screaming abuse. So he talks to his mates, he laughs and then he screams abuse. What is he going to do next? We put the $700 million out so that the farmers owed nothing to the banks. They now owed it to the state bank, which was called the QIDC. We were borrowing it at a little under three per cent at the time, so we were able to put the loans out to farmers at three per cent. If they owed $1 million at the time, they were probably on about 10 per cent interest, so it was $100,000 in interest, and they were probably up for about $50,000 in repayments. So the cane farmer was up for $150,000 a year. They now owed the money to the Reconstruction Board and all they had to find was $30,000 a year—not $150,000 a year. 


Within two years, as we knew it would, the upcycle occurred—the price of sugar doubled. The farmers went to commercial interest rates, and Bill Gunn and I, as part of the Bjelke-Petersen government, made some $200 or $300 million in profit, because we now held those loans. Not only did it not cost the taxpayers any money; the taxpayers made money out of it. At all times we knew that that would occur, because we had at our disposal the greatest administrator the country has ever seen in the form of Sir Leo Hielscher. He was offered a position at the World Bank. I'm most certainly very proud to say that I am very much a protege of Sir Leo Hielscher. The greatest fighter for Hell's Gate and the Bradfield scheme in Australia was none other than Sir Leo Hielscher. It's no surprise that I was the No. 2 fighter for that area. What we did was just quietly make available Reconstruction Board loans. 


I believe that my son was not very interested in politics initially. What got him interested was when, as part of an inquiry, he went around Queensland talking about the possibility of a reconstruction board. He assumed that people on the committee were listening when every single person they spoke to said that they wanted no further debt. At every meeting—albeit I attended only three—Robbie Katter said that people wanted no further debt. You can bet London to a brick that this government will offer them further debt. They won't offer them reconstruction of their debt; they will offer them further debt, which is specifically what people said they didn't want. When it came to a vote on this committee, he expected that both Labor and Liberal would agree, because clearly that was what every single person who had gone before the committee had said. To his shock and horror—and I think 'shock' is the right word—he couldn't believe it. Here's the logical thing to do. You know it works. It's been tried a million times. Every government in Australian history has done it. It was the essence of the Country Party philosophy. Yet, here they are, both sides, voting against it. I think his shock led him to believe that he had a job to do in politics. From that day forth he was a person who didn't want to get into it and was trying to get out of it. He became very, very dedicated and passionate in his belief.


I want to say some positive things about previous people in positions of power. Wayne Swan called a debt round table with Rowell Walton, the president of Katter's Australian Party. Rowell called a meeting with Wayne Swan and myself, and we got a debt round table. Out of that debt round table we had $450 million made available. We thank former Treasurer Swan for that. Barnaby Joyce attended another meeting called by Rowell Walton at St George. It was very big of the former Deputy Prime Minister, because he knew that we were a competing political party. But he was a big enough man to go to that meeting and provided $200 million on top of the $450 million. Then Robbie Katter called the last meeting, in which Alan Jones was the main feature item. At that meeting former Deputy Prime Minister Joyce put another $150 million aside. Again, we thank him for his approach. This is the very sad part, they gave that money to the LNP government of Queensland.


I think the member for Groom—I'm never too sure of these things—might be the member sitting here at the table. I don't know—




Mr Littleproud:
  No, mate, I'm Maranoa. I'm your neighbour.




Mr KATTER:
  Again, he's laughing and joking. Whilst people out there are doing away with themselves he is laughing and joking. That is true. He just laughed and joked. Don't say it's not true. It's on the record. The radio will have picked up that you were laughing and joking.


The tragedy of this was that Wayne Swan, former Treasurer, ALP, and Joyce, National Party—not LNP; National Party—are both from outside Queensland, in the sense that their parties are controlled from outside Queensland. They gave $750 million. It was given to the LNP government of Queensland, and they did not go to a reconstruction board. They did not reconstruct the loans. They gave them further debt. Very seldom in my entire life have I heard my son shocked and in trauma, but when the figures came out he said, 'The figures have come out. At the back of Queensland, principally North and Central Queensland, the subject of the cattle collapse'—he's had a lot to do with the cattle collapse, as a result of the ALP's actions on live cattle—'out of 2,500 cattlemen who needed that assistance they have given it to four people.' Four people got that assistance. We worked like dogs down here to get $450 million. God bless former Treasurer Swan, because he took pain in getting the $450 million made available. God bless Barnaby Joyce, because he took pain in getting that money made available. In good faith they gave to it the state government—the LNP government of Queensland—and they gave it to nobody.


I said that we were suffering one suicide every three weeks and I was corrected. A number of people venomously attacked me, because it was one every two weeks in the industry. Don't think about graziers here; think about the contractors, the workers and the businesses that depend upon this industry. But four people got it. The policy of this current government is exactly the same as the policy of the LNP in Queensland. The minister comes out of the LNP in Queensland. It is exactly the same policy.


Now, I've spoken to the Prime Minister personally. I have pleaded on my bended knees to go to a reconstruction board approach. Theodore, Chifley, Curtin, McEwen and Doug Anthony, arguably the greatest men in the political history of this nation, all went to a reconstruction board. They knew what needed to be done. But if you can't go to a reconstruction board then you are simply imposing more pain and more debt upon the people. It is counterproductive in the extreme. Having said those things that needed to be said, I put it before the Prime Minister. I went to see the last Prime Minister. He stared at his watch and he stared out the window. I may as well have had a conversation with a gum tree. The next morning I went down to see Arthur Sinodinos. I told him what had transpired. He, like a good and faithful minister, said nothing. He said: 'Shut up. What do you want?' I named four things. He said, 'Have your chief of staff in my office at 10.30 tomorrow morning.' By half past 11 that day, we had the four things through.


I don't think I contributed in any way to the downfall of Mr Turnbull. I most certainly contributed to the downfall of Julia Gillard. She was responsible for the live cattle decision, and she copped it. What, did she really think that I was going to walk away and not break a leg if someone did that? Running commentary: the minister is talking again at the table. At no stage has he listened to anything we've said, just like the LNP people that went on the inquiry all over Queensland and didn't listen to anything that the people there said. They just won't listen! The second thing that needs to be done is on grain. There has to be feed. A grant to people using grain is absolutely essential. I mean, the cattle have to be fed. To feed the cattle, you have got to do that. I might add, in conclusion, that Hell's Gate would feed a million head of cattle a year. Wouldn't that be a weapon? Hughenden and Charters Towers—two little projects we put before the Prime Minister—would feed 300,000 head of cattle a year. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had that weapon at our disposal as well?

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray—Nationals Whip) (12:22):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018 is an important bill to have the opportunity to talk to, because we all know that the drought is cutting right throughout regional Australia right now. I must admit, though, I find it difficult to sit here in silence when the Labor Party come in here and start espousing the values of the Labor Party and what they're doing to try and help our farmers. What they do and what they say they will do in government is quite scary and it spreads a lot of fear through the farmers in my area of Murray.


I don't come to the parliament and profess to be an expert on the union movement. I don't understand how these new workers in the Melbourne infrastructure projects that the government is going to build are going to get $50 an hour, and $100 an hour for Sunday work. The average labourer is going to pick up $150,000 a year from Daniel Andrews. The taxpayers in Victoria are going to have to pay for that. I don't understand how the union movement works. I imagine the Labor Party have full expertise on how the union movement works. But to have the Labor Party turn up here and tell us that they are the party for the farmers, I find that a little bit of a stretch too far. I talk to the leaders of my area and I watch Labor Party policy. There is no support for agriculture from within the Labor Party's leadership.


It starts first and foremost with water policy. We know very clearly that, when it comes to setting water policy in place that is going to enable irrigators right up and down the Murray-Darling Basin to afford to grow their produce in an efficient and profitable manner, the Labor Party, along with the Greens, are the biggest opponents to those two million people that live along the Murray-Darling Basin. They are the ones who are going to make water so expensive that, effectively, we're not going to be able to grow the produce that we have been able to grow for as long as we can remember. It is the Labor Party who are going to make sure that even more water is taken out of the consumptive irrigators' pool and put into the environment, effectively creating a tipping point. We have these Labor Party people who come in here and talk about agriculture and who have no idea what their water policies are going to do to agriculture. And, yet, they still maintain that somehow they are miraculously on the side of farmers. It is just a joke. They don't understand exactly how directly their cutting policies are going to hurt people in the irrigation areas of the Murray-Darling Basin.


We understand that this drought makes the debate around water policy even more succinct and heightened to another degree again. So we have to put in place now the policies that are going to effectively help farmers today, as best as we possibly can, and help them through this time. In my patch right now, farmers are making the incredibly heartbreaking decision to maybe cut their crops for hay. Some farmers will be saying, 'No, there is enough in them that we will give them the chance to get further spring rains so that we'll be able to get the crops through and be able to harvest them around Christmas time.' But this decision is being made right now, right throughout southern New South Wales and Victoria. When you have to make that decision to cut your crop for hay, it's heartbreaking. It means that your profits in that particular crop are going to be less. You'll get your money back, plus a little bit. Ultimately it's all going to depend on the price of fodder.


To deal with this, this bill is putting in place an accounting procedure that's going to make it much more attractive for people to prepare for storage of fodder into the future. So, as has been said throughout the debate this morning, the ability for farmers to increase the numbers of bunkers for silage and the numbers of silos and various bins around farms that are going to help them store their grain won't be used to help people through this drought as much as it will be used for future dry periods right throughout Australia. We've already seen the instant asset write-off have an enormous impact on a whole range of businesses, not just farming businesses. The instant asset write-off has been able to create a real opportunity for many people in small business to further invest in their business and have that offset against their tax. It's become very, very important.


We've also seen the outcomes of some of the measures that we currently have in place, not just for the drought. Before I first came into the federal parliament, we had the milk crisis. We had processors that were offering a price that was unsustainable and then, all of a sudden, they had to make an announcement and come clean and then start clawing that money back out of dairy farmers. They had paid them at a price that was unsustainable. We saw the farm household allowance ramped up at that stage to enable more and more farmers to gain access to it. Under the government and Minister Littleproud's watch during this drought period, we've seen that farm household allowance increased to $37,000, with the new additional money being paid over two instalments. We've also seen a reduction in the amount of paperwork that is needed for mums and dads and individuals to be able to get onto the farm household allowance. We have also seen an enormous uptake in the number of people who have been able to access low-interest loans. Again, these are things that are tangible and have been able to assist farmers as they go through this incredibly tough period.


Right now, the government has Major General Stephen Day working as the Drought Coordinator. There are a whole raft of people out there in the community who are trying to assist in any way they possibly can. I bumped into a great mate of mine, Kevin Sheedy, recently. He was trying to work out with the Essendon Football Club and some of their supporters how they could move into the market and buy hay for the farmers of the Riverina and throughout New South Wales. When you've got people whose hearts are right behind the farmers and right behind the agriculture sector, you need someone like Major General Stephen Day, who can get all these different actors in the industry coordinated so that we can actually get the best bang for our buck.


Barnaby Joyce has now been appointed as the drought envoy. You've heard some of the figures. Thousands and thousands of tonnes of grain are being accessed in Western Australia and brought over to the eastern seaboard by Barnaby Joyce and his connections. Again, they are trying to source the produce from various parts of Australia where we actually have grain and fodder, and bring it over to the eastern states where the ravaging of the drought is worst. But, again, we need special people out there who understand what's really going on and who also understand the difficulty of bringing that produce over to the East. We also argued as hard and as fiercely as we possibly could with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder about whether they had the capacity to release more water into the market, to lower the price of that water so that it could have found its way to the fodder producers three weeks ago, who would then have been in a good position to grow the lucerne that we were looking for.


It's good to see that we've got both Minister Littleproud and Barnaby Joyce from this place bringing together the drought packages and drought assistance. We've also got Major General Stephen Day as the overall coordinator and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer putting in place financial bills like this that are going to assist farmers to make the investments that they need so that they can be better prepared for future droughts. This is a horrible situation that exists in our regions at the moment, and it's probably going to get worse as we move into the summer months. We need a government that is going to be receptive—in the way that the government is already—but it's a reality that we are also probably going to need more and more assistance in the months to come.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Treasurer) (12:32):  I thank all those members who have contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. It's an important issue in our national discourse. The government well and truly recognises the need to support Australian families during difficult times, with drought being one of the most difficult. One way we're doing this, of course, is to help farmers better droughtproof their properties. Some four weeks ago, on 19 August, the government announced an instant depreciation initiative for fodder storage assets. This bill gives effect to that announcement. The government is moving, legislating, and acting quickly.


This measure amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow primary producers, from 19 August this year, to immediately deduct the cost of fodder storage assets, such as silos or hay sheds used to store grain and other animal feed. Previously, primary producers generally had to deduct the cost of fodder storage assets over an extended period of some three years. Implementing this instant depreciation initiative will certainly assist farmers. It will make it easier to stockpile fodder, and farmers will no longer have to track the depreciation of fodder storage assets for more than one year for tax purposes. I wholeheartedly commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill now be read a second time. To this the honourable member for Fenner has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment moved by the member for Fenner be agreed to.

"Katter, Bob, MP",KAP,2018-09-19,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (12:45):  The best way to explain the amendment I am moving is this: if I am a farmer, or a business supplying the farms, or a worker in trouble because of what's happening, and let us say I owe $1 million, I am now paying about $90,000 in interest and about $40,000 or $50,000 in repayments, so I have to meet $150,000 a year or be sold up. Under this arrangement all I have to meet is the government borrowing interest rate, which is about three per cent, so instead of paying $150,000 this year, all I have to find is $30,000. Thanks very much to the efforts of Treasurer Wayne Swan and the family assistance scheme, I can get my income topped up with welfare payments and I'll almost certainly be able to meet that $30,000 a year of repayments.


This worked for us in the sugar industry, where the head of the state bank said he wasn't going to provide a reconstruction approach. According to the newspapers we sacked him nine days later, but he had said that 25 per cent of the industry had to go. We said: 'That's ridiculous; you don't know what you're talking about. It's a cyclical industry; the price will be back up in the next two or three years.' The only thing that went was him. We put the money out and about four per cent of the farmers still went down, but we successfully brought through over 20 per cent of the farmers that would have gone down. The many free marketeers in this place would argue that we made a hell of a lot of money out of it because, when the prices doubled, as they did the next year—we said over the next two or three years, but it was the very next year—we went to commercial interest rates and made about $200 million out of the deal. That's the difference between public servants and career politicians—on both sides of the house—and people with hard hands and hard hats on, who backed their judgement with their own money.


Having said that, I again thank and pay very great tribute to both Treasurer Swan and Minister Joyce, who did the right thing in giving away that money. The Queensland LNP government, who touted themselves as successors to the National Party, which they're not, did it in such a way that no-one got any benefits at the end at all. I heap great praise on then Treasurer Swan not only for that but also for his welfare payments, the family farm assistance benefits, which are now carrying nearly 10 per cent of farmers in Australia.


If you look at some of these things, you have to wonder whose side the LNP is on. You just can't say that they're on our side—hence my voting for the last piece of legislation. This needs to be done. It is the way to handle it. It costs the taxpayers no money, and it will give real assistance. If we continue to go down the pathway laid down by the LNP and past Labor and Liberal governments, it will continue to cost the taxpayers money and provide no benefit to the farmer. I have not had time—and I apologise—to distribute this earlier to the House. We got some wrong advice on timing. I take great pleasure in moving the amendment:

2A


Rural Loan Reconstruction Authority



(1) When the necessary appropriation is approved by the Parliament, the Minister be authorised to borrow whatever funds are necessary to provide a Rural Loan Reconstruction Authority. The Authority is to provide a process by which the bank debt is bought out and all of the debt transferred to the Reconstruction Authority. The Reconstruction Authority is to borrow at the current Government borrowing rate providing the farmer with a Government interest only liability.


(2) The Reconstruction Authority will not provide finance for farmers and contractors and farm-workers or industry where there is not long term viability. But, it will reduce/eliminate the annual liabilities of the borrower of other punitive, discretionary charges will be removed as well as the common rate of interest. It will remove the liability for repayments and in most cases the onerous 6 monthly valuations. It also removes the debt to equity trigger that bankrupts farmers who have been meeting faithfully their annual liabilities to the banks ( interest repayments). Typically, a farm supply business may owe $1 million, in the current climate they would be paying 8 ½% interest, with bank charges and impositions an extra 1 ½ %. On top of these repayments over 20 years would add $50 000 a year to $100 000 he is already facing.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (10:13):  I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House makes note of the Government's lack of long term policy and planning to assist primary producers and rural Australians facing drought conditions"".


Labor will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018, which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow immediate deduction rather than deduction over the course of three years of the cost of fodder storage assets, such as silos and hay sheds, used to store grain and animal feed. The government has made the case that this will assist primary producers by making it easier to invest in these assets. The measure was announced on 19 August 2018 and applies to fodder storage assets first used or installed ready for use on or after that date. The fiscal impact of the measure is $75 million over the forward estimates.


While we are supportive of this measure, we do note the haphazard approach which the government has taken to the drought that many Australian farmers are suffering from. First, there was the increase in the farm household allowance payments from three years to four years, effective on 1 August 2018. Then, a few days later on 5 August, the government announced a $190 million drought package, claiming that it provided immediate additional financial support to help farming families and their communities, which is a bit of a stretch given that the additional funding did not start flowing on 5 August. We're yet to see how many farmers will actually access the farm household allowance supplementary payments. And, as the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, has pointed out, there is a real risk that farming families will miss out on the full $12,000 because the government insists on splitting the payment and denying farmers the possibility of getting a lump-sum payment.


Then, in his second reading speech introducing this bill, the Assistant Treasurer made mention of increased funding for mental health support, something which should of course be welcomed by both sides of this House. Yet, it was just later that week that the new Prime Minister tweeted an extremely insensitive video that claimed that drought is 'a necessary evil' that 'can help cut out the bottom 10 per cent that probably shouldn't be there anyway'. That isn't what struggling farmers need to hear at this time of crisis. Labor has called on Prime Minister Morrison to apologise and to remove the video, but he refuses to do so.


Then we have the fact that, on 19 August 2018, former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day as the National Drought Coordinator. But then, interestingly, in introducing this bill in the House, the Assistant Treasurer made no mention of support for the appointment of the drought envoy position by the current Prime Minister, so the status of that envoy is unclear. We also know that, as the former agriculture minister, the member for New England did very little to address the long-term systemic challenges of the agriculture sector. We all sadly remember his failed white paper, which was full of short-term initiatives so poorly designed that most are yet to be implemented.


This House will recall that one of the first acts of the member for New England as Minister for Agriculture was to dismantle the Standing Council on Primary Industries as part of the COAG council. That body, the so-called SCoPI, worked on longer-term drought reform measures, and its abolition means that we have one less avenue through which to pursue long-term reform. And, of course, we had the member for New England doctoring the Hansard. Everyone in this place will remember his doctoring of the Hansard, which ended up with the unprecedented firing of his departmental secretary, but some may have forgotten exactly the topic on which he was caught out doctoring the Hansard. It was his attempt to exaggerate the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's drought assistance measures. Farmers have not experienced any meaningful relief from drought in the time since.


As the shadow agriculture minister has said, the Morrison government must immediately take action to restore the COAG drought policy reform process, to respond to the review into the intergovernmental agreement on drought reform and update the parliament on the progress of the new agreement, and to help farmers better adapt to climate change and embrace best practice regenerative farming methods to combat drought—a topic that I will return to.


To go to the tax aspect of this measure, we on the Labor side support the principle that more rapid depreciation—what's known in the US literature as 'immediate expensing'—can be good policy. Labor has supported the government's instant asset write-off. We did so noting that the government had scrapped Labor's instant asset write-off and then put in place their own instant asset write-off. Much like the low-income superannuation contribution, they scrapped the policy, railed against it and then restored Labor's policy when finally they saw sense.


On top of the instant asset write-off, Labor has announced an Australian investment guarantee. That delivers for all companies investing in Australia and is a much more targeted policy than an across-the-board company tax cut. Work carried out by Victoria University suggests that, if you're after investment, then the bang for your buck of an investment guarantee of more rapid expensing is three times larger than a company tax cut. Labor's Australian investment guarantee has the benefit too for firms that it is permanent, permanently accelerating depreciation for all companies and thereby ensuring that we're able to improve the investment pipeline that businesses deliver. This is responding to a concern that many economists have raised about the level of business investment in Australia. As the shadow Treasurer has noted, business investment in Australia has fallen by 20 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia has recently commented that non-mining business investment has been 'disappointingly low' in recent years. Our support for more rapid depreciation schedules, as a long-term growth measure, is something that is important to put on record.


This measure is using accelerated depreciation as a form of fiscal stimulus, if you like, and as a way of getting farmers through the drought. In this exercise, it's less clear whether that will have a strong benefit for farmers. The benefits of more rapid depreciation only come to firms that pay tax. If you're not paying tax, then being able to depreciate does not necessarily boost your growth prospects. It's a long-term policy and it has no end date, but it's couched very much by this government as a crisis response. While Labor recognises the economic value of more rapid depreciation schedules, we do put on record at this stage our concerns about the benefits that this measure will bring in helping farmers tackle drought.


To that end, I do want to put on record that Labor intends, if we win government, to review this measure to ensure that it's having the intended effect. We've taken such an approach with other measures that we have supported in this House, such as the measures contained in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 that passed the House earlier this week. A careful, independent review is warranted in a context such as this to ask questions such as whether providing the benefit to all firms but restricting it to fodder storage assets is the best use of resources. We need to make sure that we are safeguarding taxpayer money, particularly at a time when under this government we've seen net debt almost double since the coalition came to office and at a time in which Australian debt is rising more rapidly than it did even during the global financial crisis. That was when Australia was taking on debt not through government mismanagement, as we are under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, but to deal with the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression and to save 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses.


It's important too that, in order to tackle drought, we address climate change. We've seen, as the shadow minister for climate change and energy has pointed out, the fact that the Liberals have no climate policy, and no measures to contain, let alone reduce, Australia's rising carbon pollution. A number of Morrison government ministers continue to repeat the lie that Australia is on track to meet its international climate commitments, but we're simply not. They have a target of a five per cent cut in emissions by 2020, but the coalition government's own data, snuck out in the days before Christmas, showed there would be a zero per cent cut in pollution by 2020. The Liberals have committed to the Paris Agreement with a 26 to 28 per cent reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels. But the same government data—again, snuck out before Christmas 2017—showed there would only be a four per cent cut in pollution by 2030. That means Australia is on track to miss its carbon abatement targets by a whopping 24 per cent. And this was all at a stage when the National Energy Guarantee still had a possibility of garnering bipartisan support. Since the junking of the National Energy Guarantee, the new energy minister seems to take it as a virtue that the coalition has no plans to reduce emissions.


Australia's emissions are substantial. The electricity sector is responsible for a third of all Australia's emissions and has the lowest cost of cutting pollution. That's why Labor has been willing to work with the coalition on their various plans—the emissions intensity scheme, the clean energy target, the National Energy Guarantee. And that's why we're so disappointed at the government's decision to entirely walk away from meaningful action on climate change. This is a great concern to our Pacific neighbours and to the European Union, but it's also a concern to Australia's farmers, who are suffering the impact of drought.


As we know from the scientific evidence, extreme weather events will become more frequent as unchecked climate change continues. In South Australia, there's the famous Goyder's Line, the line which demarcates the boundary of sustainable agriculture. We've seen Goyder's Line shifting towards the coast, shrinking the area of viable agriculture in South Australia: an impact which has been traced directly back to climate change. A government with no plan to tackle climate change cannot be a government that is doing everything to tackle the scourge of drought and the impact of drought.





Mr Thistlethwaite:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (10:28):  I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. This drought continues to exact a heavy toll on country communities around Australia, but particularly in central western New South Wales. It's exacting a heavy toll on the farm and on farming families. There is a physical toll attached to this drought—the drudgery of having to get up early, feed stock, check troughs, check stock and check dams. There's the economic toll of worrying about how you're going to be able to feed the flock, or the herd, where you're going to be able to source feed from, how it's going to get there and if there will be enough of it. And then there's a huge mental toll as well. I've seen the toll that it's taken, because I've been travelling around our region and around our farms and farming communities, talking to them and doing anything that I can to help. The toll is being exacted on the farms, but it's also being exacted in the towns as well—through the small businesses, the mechanics, the tyre fitters, the rural suppliers, the fuel distributors and even the grocery outlets.


Despite some recent rain, this drought hasn't broken, and our region is facing a long, hot and, potentially, fiery summer period. We need to be continuing to ramp up drought support as these conditions worsen. At the moment our total drought support package is hitting $1.9 billion. This bill is part of that response. It won't be for every farmer. I have many farmers in my region just focusing on sourcing feed, and not every region in Australia is in drought, but it is a useful measure to assist farmers to get through potentially devastating dry times both at present and in the future. Basically it means that there's an immediate deduction for fodder storage assets first used or installed and ready for use from August 2018, and they can get the tax benefit straightaway. Currently primary producers can deduct the value of fodder storage assets over three years by one-third of the amount in the income year in which the expenditure occurred and one-third in each of the following two income years. Under the new arrangements this will reduce to one year with effect from 19 August. I think it's a valuable measure. It's about getting through this drought but also preparing for the next drought.


As I mentioned, it's part of a suite of measures which the government has introduced, now totalling almost $1.9 billion. The Regional Investment Corporation, which is going to be based in Orange in the Central West, is going to be dealing with $2 billion in concessional loans and $2 billion for national water infrastructure at the concessional loan rate—very welcome in country Australia and a great example of decentralisation. The farm household allowance has just been extended. The asset cap has been lifted to $5 million. That was a big issue with many local farmers. The total payment for a couple is now up to $37,000. This is a substantial measure, which has been well received, designed to put food on the table of farmers and diesel in the ute when there is no income. The paperwork is being simplified, and I encourage the government and all of those agencies involved to keep going on that, because it is a great source of frustration to our local farmers.


The Rural Financial Counselling Service has also been boosted by $5 million in recent times. We need more rural financial counsellors on the ground in the Central Tablelands. I know that help is coming, but we need to ramp that process up, because at the moment the counsellors we have are on the raggedy edge. They are overworked, they have a huge backlog of cases and they need more help and support. There are also a suite of measures to manage weeds and pest animals—very much welcome. There are new measures for weather forecasting. The government has committed a further $36.9 million to 2023 for Great Artesian Basin water security. This funding will help to drought-proof farms and maximise the availability of water. There's more money for water infrastructure and a suite of taxation measures, including the farm management deposits scheme, which has been in place for a while now. That is a very useful resource for farmers, and many farmers are using it.


You also have the instant asset write-off. There's the small business instant asset write-off, which is basically for assets that cost less than $20,000. Anyone can access that if they're in business and have a turnover of less than $10 million, but this measure today goes beyond the $20,000 cap and means that if you want to get a storage silo for your grain or a shed for storing fodder then you can get the tax benefit in the year that you purchase that infrastructure. You also have measures such as income tax averaging, which enables farmers to even out their high- and low-income years. The tax payable over a maximum of five years ensures they don't pay more tax over a number of years than do taxpayers on comparable but steady incomes.


All are valuable measures but, as I've said, we need to keep ramping it up as these conditions worsen. One of the big issues we're facing is sourcing feed and fodder. If we need to release more water from dams in order to irrigate fodder, we need to be doing it. This is an emergency situation. If the Australian government needs to underwrite grain to get it from Western Australia—where they're going to be having a bumper harvest—into the Central West, where there's not much around, then I think we should do it.


We need more rural financial counsellors, as I've said. We need to keep moving our response and ramping it up as these conditions worsen. I was very pleased to see that Major-General Stephen Day is on the ground working hard. I'm meeting him tomorrow to talk through some of these measures.


One of the distinguishing features of country communities is that when the chips are down they come together, and you see this all over our region and all over country Australia. The communities rally and support each other, and the country community spirit has particularly shone through in these dry times. For example, I'll give you just a taste of what the Bathurst RSL club are doing. This club was established in 1928 and has more than 14,000 members. The club is supporting a Buy a Bale in September campaign, kicking things off with a $10,000 donation to the appeal. They've got banners in the club highlighting the appeal so that members can donate every time they purchase a meal. The club has been creative; they've also given away a dollar from every chicken parmigiana sold in their Parma for a Farmer campaign. Deputy Speaker, I would invite you and all members to drop in for a parma for a farmer—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  I don't like chicken parmas, mate. If it were a beef parma I'd be onto it!




Mr GEE:
  I'm sure they could do that. In fact, for all of the folks listening at home, wherever you may be, if you want to support drought stricken communities come and visit us. Come and support the hotels, the restaurants, the pubs and the clubs.


Back to Bathurst RSL, 20c from every coffee sold at the club's coffee shop, The Grind, is going to the appeal. And in the popular weekly members draw, if a member wins cash the club will match that amount for Buy a Bale. So far this month the club, with the help of its many members, has raised over $22,000, with plenty more to come. Individual members have also been making donations. For example, one anonymous member left $2,000 on the bar to help those crippled by drought conditions. The Bathurst Filipino community, for example, kicked in $600. The region is looking forward to more hay on the way, with loads expected to arrive in Bathurst on 24 September.


Special thanks to Ian Miller, the president; Ron Hollebone, the vice-president and Harry Robertson, the vice-president and treasurer. Thanks to the directors: Brett Kenworthy, Les Anderson, Paul Hennessy and Coral Miller. And, of course, thanks to the general manager, Peter Sargeant, who has generally let staff wear jeans for the month if they buy a bale. Congratulations to Bathurst RSL club for all of their hard work.


The hard work continues right across the region. For example, the Millthorpe Village Committee held a hugely successful farmers day on Sunday at Redmond oval to support those affected by drought. After I attended the show, where there were many farmers, I also dropped in to see how the farmers day went. It was an opportunity for locals to gather and listen to the representatives from the various assistance bodies and organisations, to hear about what services and support are available. For example, there were representatives from the NSW Farmers Association, the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority as well as mental health workers. It was highly successful. There were about 200 people there on the day. About 400 sausage and steak sandwiches were served—it wouldn't be a country event without the sausage sizzle. It was very strongly supported by the Millthorpe branch of the CWA.


The Millthorpe Village Committee has around 100 hardworking members. Special thanks for organising the day needs to go to Sam Yeates, president; Russell Keogh, vice-president; Sue Marsh, treasurer; Nick Anagnostaras, secretary; and Mary Dowrick, publicity officer. The farmers day itself was a suggestion of committee member Lyndall Harrison, who runs the annual Millthorpe Garden Ramble. Congratulations to the Millthorpe Village Committee on their successful day. It's great to see grassroots community groups stepping in to support our farmers, and, as I said, that's what we do in the country.


Have a look at Mudgee, where you've got the 200BALES campaign. It started off with a group of volunteers getting together and asking the community to sponsor a bale of hay for farmers. They were aiming for 200 bales, but they've well and truly exceeded that target. It's been a godsend to many farmers. Many of them don't ask for the help, but when the trucks roll up they are truly grateful. I've been out in that region talking to farmers who've been the recipient of the 200BALES campaign, and it's just lifted their spirits. So to Glenn Box, Kelly Dray, Will Bateman and the whole team—all of the hay runners—I just want to thank you on behalf of a grateful community for all of the work that you're doing.


As I've said, this drought has taken a heavy mental toll on our farmers as well. There are some wonderful people out there doing wonderful work, including the folks from Lifeline. I was at the launch of Lifeline's Drought Tool Kit recently in Orange, and there were many Lifeline volunteers there who give up their time. They don't get paid for it, but they work tirelessly through the night and through the day just to make sure that, when people call, there's someone there on the end of the line, and sometimes just being able to talk to someone can make all of the difference. Being out on farms can be isolating for people, and some of the farms are very physically isolated. Some are up in the high country, for example, in different parts of the Calare electorate. I think that just being able to talk to someone and knowing that someone's there if you need them and that you're not alone can make all of the difference. So I'd like to thank Lifeline and all of their hardworking volunteers. I also thank the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health. They've got the Glove Box Guide to Mental Health. Basically, both of these resources let farmers and farming families and communities know where they can get help. I've actually been into farmers' homes, talking to them, and on the table there has been the Glove Box Guide to Mental Health. Both of these publications, from Lifeline and the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health, are distributed through local publications, and I just wanted to thank them for that, because their work is largely unseen but the community should know that they're out there working really hard in very difficult times.


So we need to be backing our farmers to the hilt in this time of drought. During the recent economic slowdown, it was the Australian farmers and the farm sector which got Australia through, so they've actually been doing the heavy lifting economically for a long time now, and we can't take them for granted. If we want a strong and vibrant farm sector, we need to keep backing them through these dry times. I think people in the cities tend to take their food for granted. They just think that it's something that appears, but we can't take our farmers for granted. We need to be backing them and ramping up relief as these conditions worsen. I fully support this bill and commend it to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:43):  Labor is supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. However, I'm speaking in support of the second reading amendment that was moved by the member for Fenner, which really highlights the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's lack of any long-term policy, planning and approach to assist primary producers in rural Australia facing drought conditions. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow primary producers to immediately deduct, rather than depreciate over three years, the cost of fodder storage assets such as silos and hay sheds used to store grain and other animal feed. This will assist primary producers by making it easier to invest in stockpile fodder. The measure applies to fodder storage assets used or installed, or ready for use or installation, on or after 19 August 2018. The measure has a fiscal impact of $75 million over the forward estimates.


Despite these measures, it's clear that there has been a lack of any long-term policy and planning to assist primary producers in rural Australia facing drought conditions by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. New South Wales, the home state that I represent, is entirely in drought. Farmers are facing falling crops, short supplies of water and diminishing livestock feed. We've already heard from farmers who say that the government's slow response has been too little too late. Unfortunately, there's been no real planning by this government for drought conditions when we know—as we've heard from climate scientists and others—that we're going to face an increase in frequency and an increase in severity of drought conditions in Australia due to climate change.


The government has been on notice for some years now that, according to climate scientists, these conditions are going to worsen; but the government hasn't adequately planned for them and that's why many farmers are saying that this is too little too late. That's what happens when you have a policy vacuum and a failure of the hodgepodge, last-minute measures from the government. Drought policy shouldn't only be designed during a period of drought. It should be planned for during other periods to ensure that adequate planning has been done to cater for the fact that climate change is occurring in this country and that all of the evidence and all of the expert advice of climate scientists is that climate change is going to worsen the effects of drought and increase the frequency of drought in Australia.


We also need to ensure that the management of water resources is better planned for around the states, in terms of their provision of access to water resources through agreements with the Commonwealth government. Again, this is something that this government has a dismal record of planning for. Importantly, through measures such as what we're discussing today, our taxation arrangements and our system of deduction—particularly for the purchase of assets—need to be appropriate and meet the needs of farmers, ensuring that they can continue to operate and survive during drought conditions.


Unfortunately, this reactive approach to policy initiation by this government is all too common. We've seen this in terms of the financial services sector, which, again, has had a big effect on farmers. We've seen the rounds of evidence that have come through the banking royal commission and the effects that some bad decisions by banks have had on many farming families and businesses in the agricultural sector. Again, the royal commission was a knee-jerk reaction from this government. We should never forget that for 600-odd days, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments voted against a royal commission. That was when many farmers were saying that what was going on in their industry was at crisis levels and the government needed to initiate a royal commission. Many National Party senators, particularly Senator Williams, had been crying out for a royal commission for some years. Crisis shouldn't be the only catalyst for change when it comes to supporting Australian farmers.


Sadly, after the five years of policy inaction by the Turnbull and Morrison governments, we now have had four drought announcements within three months. Firstly, there was the increase in the farm household allowance payments from three years to four years, which is effective from 1 August 2018. Then, on 5 August, the government announced a $190 million package, claiming that it provided immediate additional financial support for farming families and their communities—although it didn't really, given that the additional funding didn't start flowing until 5 August. Time will tell how many farmers access the farm household allowance supplementary payment. It's possible that many farming families will miss out on the full $12,000 amount because the government insisted on splitting the payment and denying farmers the option of receiving a lump sum payment.


The minister then made no mention about increased funding for mental health support, yet last week the Prime Minister tweeted an extremely insensitive video claiming that drought was 'a necessary evil' and that it can help cut the bottom 10 per cent of people that 'probably shouldn't be there anyway'. That's not what struggling farmers need at this time of drought crisis. Labor have been asking the Prime Minister to apologise and remove this video for what we believe are insensitive remarks to people that are really battling and doing it tough at the moment.


On 19 August 2018, the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day as the National Drought Coordinator. Interestingly, no mention was made on the appointment of the drought envoy position by Prime Minister Morrison, and we think that that's quite telling. The member for New England was clearly an answer to a question that farmers had never been asked. Unfortunately, when the member for New England was the agriculture minister there was a distinct lack of action and planning to deal with what was inevitably going to be another drought situation in Australia, given the advice of climate scientists. Of course, we also had the failed white paper, which was full of short-term initiatives, many of which were so poorly designed that they never saw the light of day. One of his first acts as Minister for Agriculture was to dismantle the SCoPI, the COAG council working on long-term drought reform measures.


When it comes to drought relief, farmers have not experienced any meaningful and long-term planning from the various iterations of this conservative government. The government has failed to deliver long-term policy and planning for primary producers and rural Australians facing drought conditions, including a failure to take mitigation and adaptation responses when it comes to climate change. We need to help more farmers better adapt to climate change. It's pleasing to see that many farmers are now on the front line of arguments for greater action for climate change, because those that work on the land probably understand better than all of us that the climate is changing, that it is having an effect on conditions for farming in this country and that we need to embrace best-practice regenerative farming methods to combat drought. The National Farmers' Federation support this approach, saying that real impacts of climate change will mean that drought and rain events could be more extreme and could be more frequent, yet the Prime Minister still won't say whether human-induced climate change is associated with the drought. He's saying he's not terribly interested in engaging with this crucial aspect of policy design for supporting Australian farmers.


Unfortunately, when it comes to drought, energy policy or electricity prices—which, again, have had a big impact on the profitability of farms and farming businesses—the government is willing to ignore the evidence. Their ideology overlooks the fact that, according to climate scientists, widespread and prolonged droughts like the millennium drought will occur more frequently in Australia. Researchers at the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University argue that droughts are getting worse compared to recent centuries and may be exacerbated by climate change. In particular, they say that recent shifts in rainfall variability are either unprecedented or very rare. If it's serious about supporting farmers, the Morrison government must institute some long-term planning around drought resilience and ensure that the agricultural sector can survive what are going to be increasingly frequent and more severe events. We need to be doing that planning with the states to ensure that it takes place at a coordinated national level and has the support of the states. The Morrison government must also take immediate action to restore the COAG drought policy reform process, respond to the review into the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform and update the parliament on the progress of the new agreement.


We can't, as a nation, continue to ignore the fact that, unfortunately, according to climate scientists, drought is going to happen more frequently and more severely in this country. If this parliament have the interests of the livelihoods of Australian farmers and their families in mind—those that toil and work on the land year in, year out—then we need to make sure that we are properly planning to mitigate the effects of climate change and that we're working with state governments and local governments to ensure that we have better processes in place to mitigate those effects. That is what was being approached through the COAG process. It's disappointing that this government stopped that collaborative approach, and has really put its head in the sand about the effects of climate change that we see in their approach to energy policy and electricity prices. It's been five years since this government was elected, and they still don't have a policy on energy prices in this country. That's simply not good enough.

 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (10:55):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. I've said repeatedly in this House that I believe I'm the only dairy farmer in this place with a family and a business that's still actively dairy farming, and one that's passionately committed to our farmers in this nation and very keen to speak on their behalf at any given opportunity.


The government has acted to support our farmers during this period of drought. Those of us who are farmers live by the weather, and we have no control over it. There are times when life gets really tough for those of us who live and work on the land. There is no doubt that we love our dirt, we love the grass and we love the water, and we know how essential it is for those of us who farm. In my part of the world we fortunately have access to some irrigation systems fed by a series of dams in the hills. These dams are critical to the long-term future of the region, and I'm very pleased to see that the federal government is investing in securing and improving those water supplies in the Myalup-Wellington project. This underpins that the opportunity for all of us, basically, is water and the quality of our soils and how we manage our land.


I think around 90-plus per cent of our farming land is family owned. It's really a great testament to them—their passion and commitment for their land and their farms—and that they know to pass it on to a future generation in better condition, perhaps, than it was when they inherited it. That's a great passion that the farmers I meet have, and they do it particularly well. Often they make really challenging decisions that affect their bottom lines, about how they manage their property, their water supplies and their fertiliser. They're constantly having to improve, and they always are doing more with less—less land, less water and less fertiliser. Yet look at what we contribute to the Australian economy and how many people around the world we feed. That's a great tribute and a great testament to the efforts of our Australian farmers.


I am always proud to rise in this place and stand up for our farmers, to actually represent them. I don't want to see what we saw so many years ago with Labor, when they shut down the live cattle export trade overnight, and the damage that that brought to an industry, to individual people and to Indonesia itself. How important those cattle supplies and the live trade are. So when I look at the measures in this bill and I see the efforts around fodder storage assets—including the fact that a farmer has now an incentive through the tax system to be able to write off that asset purchase or the installation, whether it's silos or whether it's sheds or bins—and we talk about how we as farmers future-proof ourselves against the constant changes. In all my years as a farmer, I've seen constant change. Whether it's in rainfall or whether it's in weather patterns, it's been a period of constant change, and I suspect that will continue. When you look at your own individual business you have to make decisions about how you're going to manage that constant change. When I look at our irrigation system in the hills, there are years when we have not received a full allocation—in fact, we've received far less—and we still have to manage our farms and our businesses.


The farmers make those decisions on-farm. They decide what paddocks they might dry off. They decide what extra cost they have to go to—whether they're going to produce additional silage or hay, and whether they actually have to feed more bales to their animals to get through that period. Those are the decisions we make on a daily basis.


So this measure that the government is applying gives those that are constructing additional fodder storage an opportunity to write it off over one single year. This is in addition to the $20,000 instant asset write-off for the eligible small businesses, which is being extended further, yet again. The $20,000 instant asset write-off is really valuable, and it's being used extensively by small businesses—not just farming businesses but right across the board. I'm a great supporter of it and, with my colleagues, fought hard for these measures for small businesses—and of course our farmers are small businesses. This is a practical measure that allows farmers to make really good decisions in their businesses.


Some of those decisions are around managing their actual land. Around 96 per cent of farmers are members of landcare groups. These are the practical groups that make a difference on the ground on individual properties and in whole areas. Farmers work with catchment councils. There are a whole lot of groups that work together through our landcare movement to get improved outcomes on each individual property and for the farmers involved. It can be to do with water sources and water resources, it can be to do with fertiliser use or it can be around how they manage their business more broadly. We've seen no-till and low-till practices come out of Western Australia. These are all very important parts of how farmers individually make great decisions in their businesses, because the future of their business and future generations relies on the great decisions they're making today, and they do it on a daily basis.


I've said before in this House that we take for granted the quality of the food that we have available to us in this nation. I think the access to quality food has been brought into very sharp relief with what we've seen recently in relation to strawberries. I've been to other countries where the quality of the food is not what it is in Australia. I look at my own area in the South West of Western Australian, and we produce some of the best quality food in the world right there. I am inordinately proud of the people who produce it, often in really extreme circumstances. Some of our local climatic conditions can be extreme, but we still keep producing. We still keep making it available for people to walk into a supermarket or their local market or wherever they buy their products. As I say, Australians have basically never been hungry. When you go to other countries in the world that, during war years, have gone hungry, they place an extraordinary value on their farmers and the food that they consume. That's something that we've never had to think about too much in Australia. It's when we have a situation, such as we have with the strawberries, that brings that into sharp relief that people are immediately made very aware of the immediate impact on those businesses of simply not being able to sell their products.


I was really pleased this morning, when I was at a breakfast for GPs with the Minister for Health, that he took up to the podium a wonderful Australian strawberry and said he wanted to encourage people to cut and consume local strawberries. The minister has just entered the House. Minister, on behalf of every strawberry farmer in Australia, thank you for you what did this morning. It is a very important message to get out to people: to cut strawberries but not cut them out. I think that's a really simple message.


We see the volume of strawberries that are being dumped. I have heard of one group of over 100 people who've lost their jobs. That's the reality for those of us who live and work in rural regional Australia who are farmers. That's how direct it is. In small communities, the loss of 100 jobs has an enormous impact on every small business. So every time there's an issue, whether it's drought or a situation such as the one we're seeing with the strawberries, there is a loss of income.


The other issue that bothers me greatly is the impact on our international reputation. I hope the law takes absolutely full effect on the people who are doing this. This is having an enormous impact on our reputation as a clean, green producer of high-quality products, worldwide. That reputation is something that we as the farmers in this country have worked so hard for so many years to create. Often, historically, we've had to compete with countries that have significant tariff protection. It's only with the free trade agreements that this government has worked on and delivered that some of those barriers are starting to be, have been and will continue to be removed. But, historically, as farmers, we've often felt as though we've had to work with one hand tied behind our back because of the tariffs that were applied and the concessions that were available to farmers in other parts of the world. We have to compete, and we do compete very well, because we have some of the most efficient producers in the world. Not only are they efficient but they produce absolutely top-quality produce. And they will continue to do that no matter the challenges they face.


I'm really pleased to see the Rural Financial Counselling Service is available to our drought-stricken farmers. I'm encouraging every farmer to take advantage of that. Sit down with these people. There are a whole lot of things happening in your family. There are a whole lot of things happening in your business. There are a lot of things happening in, and impacts on, your community, and no-one is immune. Community service organisations; emergency services, often staffed by volunteers; local volunteers; local farmers; local people and local business people are all affected when we have a drought like we're having. They're also affected when we get a crisis like we're having with the strawberry farmers. There's going to be less money in the small local communities—in community service organisations and community sporting clubs. And that's not going to be overcome overnight either. The impacts of that are like dropping a stone into a bucket of water—the ripples continue. There will be businesses that may not survive this. As I said, the impacts are significant, and I want the full impact of the law to be visited upon those who are perpetrating this. It's having a much greater impact than people actually understand. It's having a direct impact on the ground with our farmers and with the pickers, the planters and the packers.


In Australia, as I said, the farmers produce some of the best-quality food in the world. I can say to the Australian people that we'll keep doing that. My dairy farmers are going to keep producing some of the best-quality milk in the world for you. They're going to continue to produce amazing products for you. I know that once the strawberry growers get back into full production, you'll be buying the most wonderful Australian produced strawberries. Whether it's in the horticultural sector, the food sector or the fibre sector, what everybody needs to know is that every farmer goes out there every day to do their job the best way they, and often it's under really tough circumstances. There are times when the market does not return the sorts of profits that were expected and demanded in other parts of our economy. But our farmers keen producing. And they produce extraordinary products. Look at the food that we take for granted when we walk into a supermarket. As I've said frequently, I look at some of the prices that are being paid in the supermarket—I'll touch on the $1 milk—and see that the market is demanding more and paying more for water than it is for milk. It's in the hands of our consumers. Make a great choice and buy a branded product—a branded product that you know pays more for that product so that our farmers, in the broader sense, are able to keep producing the products that we all take for granted.


Every farmer in Australia, as I've said previously, works constantly. They are very, very technology savvy. They are constantly innovating and improving. They don't sit back. Most of their information now is coming electronically. They're doing amazing work, and they rely on their technology. I'm really pleased with the mobile phone black spot tower rollout that we've been so strongly supporting and putting the funding into. This has made a huge difference to small businesses, which are, of course, our farming businesses. It gives them access and opportunities. They can be sitting in a tractor—the hay season is not far away, and I am really sorry that in New South Wales it's going to be a challenging hay season because they won't be able to grow the crops that they need for the next 12 months. It's not just this last 12 months that's affected by drought. Look at the feedstocks ahead. I want to thank every one of the farmers and organisations in Western Australia and around Australia who have contributed and are contributing fodder into New South Wales. They know that this is pushing up the prices for the rest of the farmers locally, but they're still doing it to support their fellow farmers. I thank and congratulate everyone who is doing that, and I say to the farmers affected by drought: 'Hang in there, and use your rural financial counselling services as well.'

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:10):  Labor will always stand by the people of the bush. People often forget—and it is worth reminding people sometimes, especially those opposite—that Labor was born of the bush. In 1892, the Australian Labor Party was born under a tree in Barcaldine, Queensland, during the Shearers' Strike. Men were fighting for a better deal. Men were fighting for better pay and conditions and a fair go from the pastoralists. Labor was born of the bush, and its mission to fight for a fair go has never changed.


Labor are proud to stand here today and support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018, but we're not going to pretend that this bill is the answer to all the problems that are besetting farmers during this drought. The bill before us today is, at best, a mild response to what is a very serious problem affecting New South Wales and Queensland. I don't want to belittle the bill, but it really is window-dressing. What it will do is offer mild relief to some farmers who are beset by drought. It will allow some farmers a provision whereby they can get instant asset write-offs for things like silos and grain sheds, rather than waiting three years for depreciation to take effect. It will be of some assistance, but it won't do nearly enough to address the real issues besetting farmers. 


One of the concerning things throughout this whole episode has been the government's rather piecemeal approach to responding to this drought. We've heard speeches from various members on this issue. We've seen this government's piecemeal approach reflected in the fracturing and the failures of the government itself. We've had a National Party leader replaced by another National Party leader. We've had an agriculture minister replaced by another agriculture minister. We've had a Prime Minister replaced by another Prime Minister. The failures of this government are reflected in the failures of its drought strategy. It is a fractured and piecemeal approach; it is not good enough. It is not good enough that there has not been a coordinated, strategic approach to combatting this drought. 


As I said before, this bill is a very modest measure in the scheme of things. It will have a fiscal impact of around $75 million over the forward estimates—and, to be blunt, it is window-dressing. It will be of some assistance to farmers, but it won't do much—and we really should not pretend that it will. This is, as I say, the fourth drought announcement by the government in three months. Instead of planning and preparing a comprehensive response, the government is, frankly, all over the place—a little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit later on. It has all the hallmarks of the utter dysfunction that plagues the government. People who are struggling to keep their heads above water, who are in tears over the condition and misery of starving stock, deserve better. 


On 19 June the government announced an increase in farm household allowance payments from three years to four, effective 1 August 2018—a very modest measure. On 5 August, the government announced a $190 million financial support package and a $12,000 supplement to the farm household allowance. The government announced it but the funds weren't released then—no; the government has split the payment. So farmers who are beset by drought now must wait till the next financial year before they can access the second $6,000 instalment. It's unnecessary red tape getting in the way of helping farming families who are in need of assistance today. 


Later on, the minister announced some increased funding for mental health support. I welcome this initiative. Done properly, it will be of great assistance, and I do commend the minister for this thoughtful initiative. I know mental health workers in my electorate do incredibly important work and have saved scores of people, particularly men, from taking their own lives. I refer in particular to the organisation Rural Alive and Well—or RAW, as it is better known—which is based in the town of Oatlands in my electorate. The more we can do to improve the mental health and psychological resilience of farmers and other members of regional communities, especially in times of financial crisis, the better. It is difficult to get men in regional Australia to open up about mental health, but it's getting better. There is less stigma attached to discussing and disclosing mental health, and we must do all we can to ensure that we remain on this trajectory.


A couple of weeks later, on 19 August, the then Prime Minister announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day as National Drought Coordinator. I have every confidence that Major General Day will bring his expertise to bear in bringing together charities, NGOs, donors and arms of government, and I look forward to getting a progress report from the minister. It has been a month since Major General Day was appointed and I know the parliament would be keen to get an update on how things are going.


Then, following the still unexplained change of Prime Minister—and the country is still asking why: a question the government seems unable to answer—the member for New England was announced as drought envoy, a position we know little about in terms of what it is meant to achieve other than perhaps to keep the troublesome member for New England in Queensland and New South Wales as much as possible. Indeed, in his first week on the job, the drought envoy suggested diverting water that is vital for environmental sustainability to farmers and also suggested opening national parks to grazing. He has been silent, however, as far as I know, about his government's decision to allow Adani to access 12.5 billion litres of river water without going through an environmental impact study.


The fact is that the government's drought response has been a mess. Farmers have had to contend with, first, the change in the Nationals—with the member for New England out as leader, Deputy Prime Minister and agricultural minister, and the member for Riverina in as leader and Deputy Prime Minister, and the member for Maranoa in as the agriculture minister—and then the change in the Liberal leadership, with the former member for Wentworth out as Prime Minister and the member for Cook in as Prime Minister. From all the public statements flying about, it seems responsibility for the drought response is being undertaken jointly by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the agriculture minister, the drought envoy and the Drought Coordinator.


What makes this dog's breakfast even more bewildering is that the government had a template for drought response at its fingertips. Ten years ago, the Productivity Commission completed an inquiry into drought support and, in 2008, the federal and state primary industries ministers, the majority of them representing conservative governments, signed an agreement on drought reform. The ministers, sitting as the COAG committee known as SCoPI, agreed to commission the PC inquiry and report. So a coordinated drought response was ready to go, pretty much with a ribbon tied around it, but instead it has been all but ignored and discarded.


In fact, the federal coalition elected in 2013 abolished SCoPI and thereby removed an important coordinating body between the federal and state primary industries ministries. It was an act of policy vandalism, idiocy and arrogance to abolish SCoPI and it bore all the hallmarks of a born-to-rule federal coalition government that believes it, and only it, has all the answers and needs no input from the states to develop policy. The result has been a disaster. With New South Wales and Queensland suffering the worst drought in living memory, there has been no coordinated or strategic response. Ten years after a coordinated drought response was agreed to by all levels of government and backed by key farm leadership groups, we are scrambling with three piecemeal announcements in two months from a government that's changed leadership amongst both its senior and its junior coalition party partners.


The elephant in the room is climate change. The mere mention of climate change is enough to have some coalition members sticking their fingers in their ears and making loud sounds to drown out the noise. The truth hurts. Climate change is real. It is here, it is happening and it is having a real and lasting impact on our agricultural sector. The former agriculture minister, the member for New England, did nothing about mitigating the impacts of climate change because he simply doesn't believe it's real. He says, 'We've always had droughts and we always will.' He shrugs and says, 'This is no different than what's happened in the past.' It's a she'll-be-right attitude that flies in the face of scientific, measurable facts. Annual temperatures are hotter than they've ever been in recorded history. The trends are hotter and dryer. Extreme events are occurring more often and are more extreme. Any agriculture minister who seeks to respond to the drought without having a climate change strategy is not doing their job.


Climate change is the elephant in the room and it has to be contended with. Those opposite just have to deal with climate change; they have to get on board with this. They can't say, 'There's a drought on right now. We can't discuss climate change. That would be insensitive to those going through it.' Increasingly, we're getting farmers and those who represent farmers saying to us, 'Yes, climate change is real. Yes, it's having a real impact on our farms and on our ability to grow produce. We need to have a strategy to deal with it.' Farmers are calling out for this. Farmers are just as frustrated as we on this side are by the government's failure to grapple with the scientific facts that climate change is real and that climate change is absolutely contributing to the conditions that farmers face today.


This is a land of drought and flood; we know that. But the 100-year floods are now 20-year floods. The bushfires are hotter and faster. They are happening more often. The experts, the measurable data, the facts and the charts tell us that climate change is responsible. You have to have a strategy in place to deal with it. You can't have a drought response and you can't have a response to the crisis enveloping Queensland and New South Wales without having a climate change strategy. It is absolutely crucial.


I will finish where I started off: Labor will always stand by the people of the bush. We were born of the bush. We're not what those opposite like to paint us as. We're not just a bunch of inner-city lefties who go down to the cafe for a soy latte. That's not us. We represent blue-collar workers: farmers, shearers and the men and women in the shops and the IGAs. It was Labor in Tasmania that brought on the irrigation scheme that is transforming Tasmania today. It was Labor who put through the infrastructure, the roads through the regions, that allow us to get to goods to market quicker. It is Labor that looks after the bush.


The pretenders over there think that wearing a big hat and having a subscription to RM Williams is enough to make people think that they represent the bush. They say one thing out there to the people in the regions, and then they come in here and all they do is vote with the Liberals on big corporate policy. It was Labor fighting the $17 billion giveaway to the big banks. It wasn't the National Party standing up for the people of the regions when the Liberals were trying to give that $17 billion corporate handout to the big banks. It was Labor that helped get that stopped; it was Labor that brought on the policy change from the government. We brought the pressure to bear to stop the $17 billion giveaway to the big banks. It wasn't the National Party; they rolled over and had their tummies tickled on that.


I just mention here, by way of passing—and I don't want to get personal—that I can't help but smile when I recall that the deputy leader of the National Party, the self-proclaimed party of the battlers of the bush, doesn't live in the regions. She lives in inner-city Melbourne, if I recall, in the member for Melbourne's seat. The deputy leader of the National Party lives in a Greens seat. That's what I understand. I'm happy to be proven wrong.




Mr Hunt:
  If you want to go down to where your members live, we'll do that.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  That's okay. That's okay. As I say, I'm just mentioning by way of passing that the Nationals put on the big hats, the checked shirts and the RM Williams and they wear the whips on their sides as if somehow that tells the story of representing the bush, and it's not accurate. It takes more. It takes policy answers to represent the people of the bush and the people of the regions. It takes policy and a commitment to the real issues: cost of living, Medicare, access to health and access to infrastructure. These are the real issues that affect the people of the bush and the people of the regions. Instead, what the National Party does is vote with the Liberals every day of the week to back in the big corporates, even against the interests of the people of the regions, and they need to be held to account for it.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (11:25):  I too take great pleasure in rising today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. I'd hoped that the member for Lyons might stay here for a minute. He might learn something. I will not be lectured by the Labor Party about responses to drought. I have been in this place for more than a decade, and for three decades before that I was a farmer. I have lived through the Keating years, when we were paying 22 per cent interest, and I know what it's like trying to farm in that area. I was in this House when the member for Watson, as the minister for agriculture, changed drought policy. He said: 'We don't have drought policy anymore. We now won't even refer to the word ""drought"". We are going to refer to it as ""dryness"". Because of climate change, we're going to have ""dryness"".' He talks about farmers wanting to adapt to climate change. Well, I can tell you our farmers are way ahead of the field, mate. I have my colleague here with me. When he was the shadow minister for the environment, he got to see what my farmers are doing with zero-till, where they're conserving every drop of moisture and growing crops now in adverse climates. Your mates in the Greens want to ban glyphosate, so even that's going to be harder.


We hear the members opposite talking about there being no response to the drought. The federal government has committed $1.8 billion so far, and that figure is rising. The former minister for agriculture Barnaby Joyce's white paper brought in accelerated depreciation for fodder storage, water, grain silos and fencing. Previously it was 15 to 20 years; it was brought back to three years. This legislation brings it back to instant asset write-off. If the members opposite actually knew something about regional Australia, not just what they saw on Facebook or popular TV shows, they might know that that policy has made a big difference in how farmers are impacted by this drought. I've spoken to many of my farmers who are now selling grain at a good price because they took the initiative that was offered to them by the government and have invested in their own storages. This patronising idea that I'm getting from members of the Labor Party that somehow farmers need the government to tell them what to do and are somehow poor, helpless individuals is something I find deeply offensive, and so do the people that I represent.


This legislation is very much appreciated and welcomed by the farmers that I represent, because farmers are not victims. Farmers will know that this is a genuine piece of legislation that will help them plan for the next drought. It gives them greater control not only in their preparedness for drought but in the general marketing and storage of their own product. At the moment, we have a crisis because of the shortage of hay. One of the reasons for this is that the vast majority of all hay that is produced never leaves the farm that produces it. It is cut and stored in preparation for drought. This legislation will enable farmers, when the seasons return and they end up with a wool cheque or a grain crop, to instantly depreciate the cost of a hay shed so that they can store more hay on farm, ready for the next drought.


The cash storage through the farm management deposits scheme is very important. The fact that farmers can withdraw that in less than the 12-month period during a period of drought, to enable that cash to be used to help through the drought to purchase that fodder, is very important. This morning I spoke to one of my constituents, who was unloading a load of hay, and he said that load of hay has brought his fodder bill for this drought up to $400,000. That's what one farmer has spent on fodder. He said that, because he had the money in a farm management deposit scheme, put aside for that very purpose, he's managed this drought. Those opposite would have the government in control of what farmers do.


I have heard academics in the last couple of weeks saying, 'Maybe we're going to need legislation, so that farmers can be instructed where they're going to grow certain crops, or run livestock.' I can tell you one thing that farmers don't want: they don't want the government in their lives. They want the government to provide positive programs like this: legislation like this will help them.


The member for Hunter has just walked in. Some of the comments he has made about this drought over the last month I find deeply offensive to the farmers that I represent. They are getting thoroughly sick of being treated as victims. I can tell you that the farmers in Australia are the most productive and the most innovative in the world—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  A point of order: there are processes in the House. If the member wants to make allegations he needs to authenticate them. What quotes from the member for Hunter is he referring to?




Mr COULTON:
  The member for Hunter wants me to go through them. I probably wouldn't have enough time left in my speech, but I have heard comments about the lack of support—$1.8 billion going to farmers is not a lack of support. The member for Hunter was a member of the government that removed that policy when the member for Watson was the minister, so one of the advantages of—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  With your support—




Mr COULTON:
  Rubbish. One of the advantages of being here for a long time is that you have a corporate memory of these things.


This legislation is very, very important. This legislation, to be honest, is not going to help farmers through the current drought; this legislation is all about preparedness for the next one. During the current drought, we are supplying farmers with household support. That money is to provide some dignity: to take the pressure from the daily lives of farmers who need to worry about how they're going to clothe and get food for their families, and other basic essentials.


Major General Day has been appointed as National Drought Coordinator to facilitate and coordinate some of the programs that are in train now. I know that last week he was speaking to the charities to try and get a coordinated approach, so that we don't have areas that are falling through the cracks.


With the help of social media, this drought has brought the plight of farmers to people in the cities. The support that's coming from people away from farms has been exceptional, and I know it's very much appreciated. But one of the downsides of social media campaigns is that the true situation is probably not presented. When people see a picture of a skinny cow, there could be various reasons why that cow is in that condition, and it's not always as portrayed. As I've touched on earlier, one of my concerns about the current drought is that farmers are being portrayed as a group that have lost control of their own industry, and their own destiny, and that's far from the truth. They're incredibly resilient.


I don't come into this place speaking from theory or philosophy; I've actually lived through droughts as a farmer. Several times in my life I've gone through drought seasons where we haven't grown a grain for the entire year. I know what it's like trying to purchase sugarcane tops from the coast to feed cattle when you've exhausted your own supplies. I know what it's like to spend night after night on a machine baling hay in preparation for the next drought. I know the work that's involved in this. I stand up here today in support of the farmers that I represent and the farmers of Australia, knowing that this drought will end, knowing that they will step up and be back in production very, very quickly and knowing that the vast majority of them out there now, while it's incredibly difficult, are managing this because they have prepared. They have prepared because of previous policies put in place by this government.


This legislation that we're talking about today will certainly make preparation more appropriate and easier for them to do for the next drought. When production does return, they'll be able to take advantage of the markets that are opening up now through the free trade agreements that are being negotiated—some are already agreed to; some are before the House at the moment—which will enable them to trade on the global stage at an advantage over our competitors. I support this legislation. I know that the farmers I represent support this legislation. They are pleased to see a government that's actually putting in practical measures, not the philosophical, ideologically driven, patronising discussions that we're hearing from the other side.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (11:36):  What an embarrassing contribution from the member for Parkes, full of fluff and full of platitudes. Oh, my God! We couldn't have academics making a contribution to one of the most serious challenges facing this parliament and our country! We couldn't have policy based on fact! We can't have long-term planning! We just have to trust people like the member for Parkes, who, of course, is a farmer! That makes him the expert! He's practical! His approach is practical! I heard the member for Forrest saying the same thing, declaring herself a dairy farmer. Well, here's an idea: how about some of these members start declaring an interest in some of these matters. If I were a financial planner and I came in here to speak about a matter relating to financial planning, they'd be all over me like a rash. Conflict of interest, they'd be saying.


Now, let us not have this great boast from those on the other side that, because they are farmers, they don't need policy contribution from any of the experts. That's a ridiculous proposition, and it's an embarrassing proposition for this national parliament. Farmers don't want just sympathy and platitudes from their members of parliament; they want a government that reacts properly, thoughtfully and in a timely way. We are in the seventh year of this drought, and this is a government that did nothing until the media started paying this issue attention. Yes, we had some concessional loans. We had some concessional loans which, of course, were a replication of concessional loans programs that the former Labor government had in place. But concessional loans have been the policy response of choice for this government. No matter what the problem: 'Oh, we'll set up some concessional loans.' Which takes me to the point the member for Parkes made: this continual misrepresentation of what this government is spending on drought. They say $1.8 billion. Well, how did we get to $1.8 billion? Pretty simply. What they do is count the full capital value of all loans provided for, whether they're taken up by farmers or not. Have a think about that. They put a billion dollars aside for drought loans and they count that as a contribution to the drought assistant package whether or not farmers take those loans.


That takes me to the contribution of the member for Calare. I listened carefully to the member for Calare. Of course it wasn't that long ago that the member for Calare was boasting that the member for New England's so-called Regional Investment Corporation in Orange was going to create 200 jobs. Think about that. Then it was 100 jobs. I'll tell you how many jobs the Regional Investment Corporation has provided so far—one, and it's an interim job. This Regional Investment Corporation is no longer mentioned by the member for Calare. I wonder why that is. The answer, of course, is that he's moved beyond the political phase of that campaign or that idea and he's now realising what a joke the member for New England's proposition was. We all know it was a response to another very bad state by-election result for the coalition in 2016. They said: 'We'll have to do something about that. We can't have the National Party losing Orange. We'll create a pork-barrelling exercise and put a regional investment corporation into that town.' That is a regional investment corporation which still has no office, still has no staff and still has no real job to do.


We need a government that is serious about drought reform and drought policy, not a government that comes late to the party and makes three announcements within two months because the media has started taking notice. The only thing that has occurred more often in this country than drought itself has been the review of drought policy, including the one we started in 2009, the Productivity Commission's review, which was manifested in the 2013 intergovernmental agreement on drought.


Speaking of that agreement, I've got a confession to make. I changed my positioning on the speakers list, hoping to follow the member for New England. I was hoping to respond to his contribution. Alas, he's not here. I've been around this place long enough to know he may have good reason not to be here, so all I can do is express my disappointment that the member for New England hasn't presented himself to the House to make his contribution and my disappointment that I won't have the opportunity to respond to him. But I still hope he makes his way in here at some point to explain himself and to explain why, over a five-year period, he stalled drought policy reform in this country, he didn't progress the intergovernmental agreement on drought policy and he abolished the Standing Council on Primary Industries, the key COAG committee which was to progress that reform. He does need to come in here and explain himself.


He will talk about concessional loans and he will talk about the provisions in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. Labor support the provisions in this bill. We support anything that will help farmers through drought after a five-year hiatus on drought reform policy. We must. We don't agree absolutely with any of the policies this government has put forward, but we've been prepared to support them because they are the only thing on offer and it's the only thing an opposition can hope to do—urge the government to act and support anything that it does, within reason. There's nothing wrong with an immediate write-off or an investment in storage. That can only help. I do note, though, that the Productivity Commission rejected that proposal because they argued there's no market failure obvious and there's no broader community outcome or benefit in it. I'll challenge that somewhat because I would argue that, if this helps farmers better prepare for and protect themselves from drought, there is a broader community benefit. We know that it's not just farmers affected by drought; the communities around them are affected by a drop in income and therefore a drop in consumer spending in their towns.


Not only have we had a five-year hiatus but we don't even know who is in charge of drought policy in this country anymore. We had the member for New England, and then he was gone, and now we have Minister Littleproud, and he's still floating around, but we have the Drought Coordinator, Major General Day, and now we have the drought envoy, and there appears to be no coordination between them. I welcome the member to New England to the debate. I'm glad he turned up at my urging. I would have been most disappointed if he hadn't. We don't know, after a five-year hiatus, who is in charge of drought policy in this country. Is it the envoy? Is it Minister Littleproud? Is it Major General Day? We simply don't know.


Those on the other side can't have it both ways. They come in here with their platitudes and unthoughtful contributions, but they also want to tell us how well the farmers are doing. Thankfully it is true that some farmers are doing it okay. Some farmers have managed to better prepare for drought than others. Sometimes those reasons are merely geographical, sometimes it's about access to infrastructure, but it is true that some have done better than others. But it's counterintuitive for those on the other side to come in here on a daily basis and claim credit for the things that are doing well but not accept responsibility for the others.


Thank goodness the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in charge of drought policy, because he told us via tweet last week, by authorising a video, that drought is a necessary evil. What it does, he said by authorising the video, is it allows you to wipe out the bottom 10 per cent who are struggling most. What an amazing thing for a Prime Minister to say. I know the Minister for Health would have been shocked by that as well. The Prime Minister tweeted and authorised, and therefore promoted and endorsed, a video that claimed drought is a necessary evil because it wipes out the bottom 10 per cent who shouldn't be there anyway.




Mr Hunt:
  That is utterly false.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  The Minister for Health says that's a false accusation. I say to the minister that I was very careful about how I said that. He tweeted and authorised a video in which that was said. I think in anybody's language that is akin to promoting and endorsing thoughts in that video, particularly when the text of the tweet said something like 'another way of thinking about drought'. If the Prime Minister wasn't sympathetic to that statement, there is no way in the world he would have tweeted that video. What is the alternative explanation? What other conclusion could we possibly come to? Why else would the Prime Minister be tweeting that video and writing something like 'another perspective on drought'? There's only one conclusion you can come to.


Those opposite have been coming to this debate saying, 'We've been doing this; we've been doing that.' I've dealt with those issues, but members of the House don't have to take my word for it. At the National Press Club recently the president of the National Farmers' Federation, Fiona Simson, said this:


… we don't have a comprehensive national strategy to deal with drought.


That's what the president of the National Farmers' Federation said, and she is right, because the member for New England stopped the progress of the reform program.


The member for Parkes outrageously gestured over towards the opposition and said, 'They got rid of all the good programs.' I remind the member for Parkes that that historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the states in 2013 was supported by all members in this place of all political persuasions—I shouldn't say that; I'm not sure what the member for Kennedy, for example, had to say at the time, but it was supported by the major parties and that minor party they call the National Party, even though that's not really their name, and the National Farmers' Federation. This approach was the commencement of a program which had the support of all the major parties and the leading farm organisations. It is not appropriate for the member for Parkes to be pointing his finger across at this side; he should be pointing his finger at himself, because his party was very much part of that process.


You can't have a drought policy or hope to develop and progress a drought policy until you accept that the climate is changing, fairly obviously, and until you accept that it's important—if only based on the precautionary principle—to do something about carbon emissions. We have to do something about carbon emissions. Again, we've had five years of a government that is unprepared to do that and climate deniers like the member for New England, who want to continually run a political campaign on that point. It doesn't have to come at a high cost; the cheapest way to do it is through the electricity sector. The best way to prevent this ridiculous discussion about going to the farm sector for the abatement is to do something in the electricity sector. But the member for New England doesn't want to do that. If people start gesturing to the idea of going to the farm sector for the abatement, blame people like the member for New England, who don't want to do anything in the electricity sector.




Mr Joyce:
  Why don't you do something about water policy?





Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Yes, I will say something about water. It was the Labor Party that built water infrastructure projects in this country in the six years it was in government. I heard my colleague talking about the Northern Midlands project in Tasmania. That was entirely a Labor project. How about Chaffey Dam in the member for New England's electorate? That was entirely a Labor project. I give credit to the former member for New England, Mr Windsor, who urged the Labor government at the time to build that augmentation project. The member for New England has to stop taking credit for things he had no responsibility for. He needs to get on board with some decent drought policy. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England) (11:52):  What a load of nonsense. What a load of prattle and nonsense. I don't know where to start with such a load of nonsense. Let's start with the fact that there was no extension on Chaffey Dam when Labor, the Greens and Independents—that lot was a merry little bunch—left government. We had to get the approval through. They didn't have an approval. They were bent over backwards looking after the Booroolong frogs.


You have listened, ladies and gentlemen out there in radio land, to the shadow minister for agriculture. Did you hear one thing that could even vaguely relate to a policy by the Labor Party? Of course not. Oh, hang on—they have to do something about carbon emissions! They said that, before they do anything, they've got to do something about carbon emissions first. The member for Hunter is going to cool the planet and, after he's done that, he'll come back and give you a drought policy! If there's anybody still here when that happens, good luck to you. There will be nothing left. Those opposite never have the gumption, they never have the motivation and they never have the muscle to come in here and nominate something that they will actually do. What they do is say: 'Well, you know, we're going to first of all reduce carbon emissions. We'll then look after the farmers who have no money. We'll then look after the fact that there is no fodder.' They don't even mention that. There's no plan.


I'm going to give you a plan. We'll start by moving 6,500 tonnes of fodder over to Parkes. We're talking about that today. There's another 500 tonnes just up the road; that's going to join up with it as well. We're also talking about what we're going to do with the crop. There's a crop over in Western Australia that's just had to deal with a frost, and that frost means that there is a great capacity for wheat and hay to be moved to the east. We've been having discussions this morning with the Prime Minister about how we can get further stimulus into regional towns on top of the $1 million that we've put into every council in the drought areas to help them out. Ladies and gentlemen, these are policies.


Here, today, we are talking about a 100 per cent write-off for fodder storage assets. That's huge. If you spend $10 million on new silos, you can write them off straightaway. If it's associated with the drought, you can do that. That's real policy, just like we have the 100 per cent write-off for water reticulation, which is part of a white paper; just like we have the 100 per cent write-off for fencing, which is part of a white paper; and just like we've changed the farm management deposits from $400,000 to $800,000, which is part of a white paper.




Mr Drum:
  What did you ever do, Joel? What did your mob do?




Mr JOYCE:
  What did they do? We set up the Regional Investment Corporation, a new regional based bank which the Labor Party are going to get rid of. We have put money on the table to build the inland rail. The Labor Party hasn't. The Labor Party doesn't believe in it. We have money on the table for dams. The Labor Party is going to take the money out. That's the difference. Everywhere they go, they are destroyers. They are the political Shiva of rural Australia. Every time they go somewhere, they are going there to destroy it. We believe in decentralisation. Does the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, stand by the movement of APVMA to Armidale? He's silent now, isn't he? He will never actually go in to bat for regional Australia. Well, the Labor Party candidate in Armidale wants to know where you are. The Labor Party candidate in Armidale wants to know where you're going. He'd like you to go a long, long way away. That's where he'd like you to go, because you're not helping him when you arrive. Everywhere they go, they never stand up for regional Australia—never once. We always have to go back in to bat.


It's great to be sitting in the room today with the Prime Minister, with Major General Stephen Day, with the president of the NFF, Fiona Simson, and with the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, to try to make sure we take this step forward. Not once has the Labor Party gone to the dispatch box at question time and asked a question about drought. They don't do it, because the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Hunter, is so politically impotent that he does not have the capacity to get a question through tactics. He can't get a question up at tactics time. Either they just don't care about agriculture or they don't care about him. I say it's both. They don't care about either.


So we have so much more to do, and we're going to make sure that we drive ahead. I am happy to say that, in my discussions with the Prime Minister this morning, there's a real motivation. We are going to make sure that the empathy stops and the action starts, starting right now. About now, or in a few minutes time, the Prime Minister will be doing a press conference, and I'm absolutely certain that he will be mentioning the further things we have to do to assist other areas, especially with what's happening with the adulteration in the strawberry industry and the disaster and hurt that has caused. That would be something you'd believe—




Mr Drum:
  They might want to ask a question.




Mr JOYCE:
  They might want to ask a question on that. Maybe the shadow minister for agriculture might get a question today and show some interest. I'm going to help you out. I'm going to help you out. I'm going to ask the Labor leader for tactics, Mr Tony Burke, the Manager of Opposition Business, to see if he can get the member for Hunter a question today. I plead with you: give the member for Hunter a question today. Give him some relevance. I'm helping you out here. Give him some relevance.


What we are doing here is building on the $4 billion agriculture white paper. It's great to see the dam that we built, Chaffey Dam, the dams in the Midlands in Tasmania that we are building and the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline that we are building. It's great to see the pipeline that we are building in the Macalister Irrigation District. And what about Rookwood weir, which we're building? The Labor Party fought it all the way through. They ran to any rathole they could to look after their Greens mates and Greens preferences. We're trying to get infrastructure built. I know the member for Kennedy. He's a big fan of Hells Gate. This is a great project. You've got no hope of ever getting something like that past the Labor Party. They'll be looking after their Greens mates, the same Greens mates they look after when they don't want to open up Galilee Basin. It's incredibly peculiar that the member for Hunter, formerly supported by blue-collar workers, has turned his back on them as he turned his back on the farmers. They've given up and become the party for the inner suburban areas, and they're getting a vote to match.


This bill is part and parcel. It's not the fight; it's the start of a whole range of issues that we have to deal with in what is the worst drought on record in certain areas. The rainfall of Tamworth so far this year is slightly better than the annual rainfall of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. It is so devastating that what is happening right now is that there are gum trees—and they're a pretty good indicator of how dry it gets—dying because of a lack of water. We have a national crisis, and we have to deal with it as a national crisis.


We have to hope that the efforts of this parliament are put towards a constructive debate to drive policy. So I'm happy that we have made changes to the farm household allowance, and I commend the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, who's just now come into the chamber. We've gone a long way. I remember when the Labor Party were in government only 367 people got access to the farm household allowance. Now we have well in excess of 8,000 people who have had access to it, and this is so vitally important. It's uncapped. About a quarter of a billion dollars has been spent on it, and that's so vitally important. That's really money that is going on the table to help people. And I know there's more we can do to streamline that application process, and I know the minister for agriculture is working on that. We had discussions about precisely that this morning, and the minister for agriculture is doing an absolutely remarkable job, a splendid job. He's hard at work. Because of the vastness of his electorate, the member for Maranoa has such a great understanding of how agriculture works.


I know that the member for Maranoa, the minister for agriculture, would dearly love to be challenged in question time by the vociferous and cogent questions delivered by the member for Hunter. But he isn't! The member for Maranoa might as well do sudoku when he comes in here because he never gets a question from the member for Hunter.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Point of order, Member for Hunter.




Mr JOYCE:
  Oh my gosh, he's on his feet!





Mr Fitzgibbon:
  I alert the member for New England to the fact that he doesn't have to go his full 15 minutes.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for New England has the call.




Mr JOYCE:
  He's a funny man! Gosh! He's in the wrong career, the member for Hunter. He should have been at the Emmys the other night. He would have done a lot better job!


We have to make sure that we get the absolute focus of this nation's parliament on helping these people who are doing it so tough during the drought. We now know that in the abattoirs—I was speaking to one the other day—they are killing many of the cows with the calf inside. That means people are going through their breeding herds. And because they're going through their breeding herds that means when the drought is over there's going to be serious problems for abattoirs. The stock prices will go through the roof and their capacity to make a dollar is going to go through the floor. The last thing we want is for these abattoirs to shut down, because that will mean blue-collar workers, who we have to look after that, will be out of work. Part of the challenge of this parliament would be to suggest how we're going to keep these workers—many of them are probably members of the AWU—in a job. Has the Labor Party ever proposed during question time a discussion about this? Of course not. They've talked about the reduction of carbon emissions. Well, I'm sure I'll be able to hand that to someone on the boning floor of a local abattoir. I'll say, 'What the Labor party is going to do for you is reduce carbon emissions. Good luck; I hope that keeps you in a job.' But I don't think it will. I think they'll be looking for something a little more direct than that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  A little bit more tangible.




Mr JOYCE:
  A little bit more tangible. They'll want something to take home to their partner. How are they going to pay for their house if the abattoir closes down? I don't think it's going to be a policy on carbon emission reductions. I think it's going to be: what is the government doing to make sure that, if this drought continues, I, as a meat worker, still have a job? The Labor Party won't ask those questions, but we are. We are in the process of working out precisely how we deal with issues such as that.


The drought has become more pronounced in the last years. You might have been in opposition for five years, and that's very understandable. If you look at how you performed, it's a wonder you're not there for 50 years. What we have to make sure of is that we continue on this path—a 100 per cent write-off for fencing, a 100 per cent write-off for water and, now, a 100 per cent write-off for all your fodder storage, and the extension and streamlining of the farm household allowance. We're making sure that the Regional Investment Corporation that we set up and that the Labor Party wants to get rid of is focused on making sure that, when the recovery phase comes, we're able to deliver an outcome back to regional Australia to keep the cash flow going. The stimulus package is a million dollars per council. I'm sure there is more we can do. I know that the Prime Minister has been made aware of that by the ardent efforts of such people as the member for Maranoa in making sure we go forward with a drought policy that actually delivers on this crisis. A great example of how a government works is how they deal with a crisis. Away from all the theatrics there is something very important: who is providing a path of real policy to deal with the crisis of the drought? I would suggest that the National Party and the Liberal Party, supported by such people as the member for Kennedy, are doing that. I would suggest that the Labor Party have said nothing. They have shown that, when a crisis is at their door, they have nothing to say except theatre—




Mr Drum:
  Negativity.




Mr JOYCE:
  and negativity. They never come forward and challenge us with real policies. It is all a rhetorical flourish. As we are speaking here today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018 is showing precisely that. We are bringing forward the legislation to support Australian farmers. This is merely part of what is to come. I think it's going to be very important for people—it's good to see Councillor Webb and Mr Bede Burke in the gallery today—to understand that this parliament is hard at work helping them, making sure that we ask the questions and deliver on the outcomes so that we can get fodder from Western Australia over to Tamworth, Gunnedah and the Upper Hunter, an area quite relieved that they now have an advocate who takes agriculture in their area seriously. It's going to be an interesting test today: will the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, in the middle of a record drought, get a question up? Once more the only ones that people in regional Australia can truly rely upon are the National Party and the Liberal Party.

"Katter, Bob, MP",KAP,2018-09-19,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (12:07):  It was very good to go to Brisbane, where there were three ex-treasurers and two ex-premiers of Queensland, to listen to Sir Leo Hielscher. Two of the three biggest bridges in Australia are named for Sir Leo Hielscher. I think he was the outstanding figure in economic administration in the nation's last hundred years. A tribute to him was that so many important people—there were four ex-ministers as well, myself being one of them—were in that room for his address. For me it was Paradise Lost. Was the world ever really like that? The budgerigar media and the lily-pad lefties say, 'But Bjelke-Petersen; they are corrupt.' There was never a single case of corruption; there were four ministers who misused their personal travel allowance money. That's not government corruption; government corruption is when you do a job for somebody, the public benefit is involved and you get recompense for that. There was never any of that. It was all police corruption.


I am going sideways; let me return. I would ask the budgerigars supposedly in government to listen to what I am saying. You can see the minister is having a little chat with his mate over here. If he were to listen to me, he might find out what needs to be done in these situations, because I was in a government which successfully dealt with them. The price of sugar in Queensland in the eighties dropped clean in half, as it does regularly. It is a cyclical effect that occurs, like a drought. You have to be ready for it. A well-run government has to know how to handle it.


I point out to the people listening to this debate that the minister is now having a chat with somebody else, and that's what I would probably be doing if I were in his shoes, because he's been in those shoes for some time, I am informed, and he has done absolutely nothing about the drought. What we did was immediately discuss with the state bank a reconstruction loans approach. The head of the bank said no; so we asked him again and again and again. When two weeks were up, according to the media, we sacked him. Whether we sacked him or not, I will leave that to somebody else to say. After his departure from the state bank, I had primary responsibility for it. The Treasurer, Bill Gunn, and I were very close friends. We worked closely together and we discussed it. As usual, we put out, I think, about $700 million or $800 million in loans to the sugar industry. 


I want to repeat that, while I have been telling the minister what a successful government did to deal with these problems, he has been constantly talking. He is not the slightest bit interested in finding out what to do, which leaves it open to me to savagely attack him for having no interest whatsoever in solutions to this problem. We borrowed $700 million or $800 million. We bought out the banks so that the sugar industry—



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  He is now laughing, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will give a running commentary on his performance while I'm speaking. People will enjoy this. We're talking about a situation where it would appear that a farmer is doing away with himself every five or six days, and he is laughing! 



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  And now he is screaming abuse. So he talks to his mates, he laughs and then he screams abuse. What is he going to do next? We put the $700 million out so that the farmers owed nothing to the banks. They now owed it to the state bank, which was called the QIDC. We were borrowing it at a little under three per cent at the time, so we were able to put the loans out to farmers at three per cent. If they owed $1 million at the time, they were probably on about 10 per cent interest, so it was $100,000 in interest, and they were probably up for about $50,000 in repayments. So the cane farmer was up for $150,000 a year. They now owed the money to the Reconstruction Board and all they had to find was $30,000 a year—not $150,000 a year. 


Within two years, as we knew it would, the upcycle occurred—the price of sugar doubled. The farmers went to commercial interest rates, and Bill Gunn and I, as part of the Bjelke-Petersen government, made some $200 or $300 million in profit, because we now held those loans. Not only did it not cost the taxpayers any money; the taxpayers made money out of it. At all times we knew that that would occur, because we had at our disposal the greatest administrator the country has ever seen in the form of Sir Leo Hielscher. He was offered a position at the World Bank. I'm most certainly very proud to say that I am very much a protege of Sir Leo Hielscher. The greatest fighter for Hell's Gate and the Bradfield scheme in Australia was none other than Sir Leo Hielscher. It's no surprise that I was the No. 2 fighter for that area. What we did was just quietly make available Reconstruction Board loans. 


I believe that my son was not very interested in politics initially. What got him interested was when, as part of an inquiry, he went around Queensland talking about the possibility of a reconstruction board. He assumed that people on the committee were listening when every single person they spoke to said that they wanted no further debt. At every meeting—albeit I attended only three—Robbie Katter said that people wanted no further debt. You can bet London to a brick that this government will offer them further debt. They won't offer them reconstruction of their debt; they will offer them further debt, which is specifically what people said they didn't want. When it came to a vote on this committee, he expected that both Labor and Liberal would agree, because clearly that was what every single person who had gone before the committee had said. To his shock and horror—and I think 'shock' is the right word—he couldn't believe it. Here's the logical thing to do. You know it works. It's been tried a million times. Every government in Australian history has done it. It was the essence of the Country Party philosophy. Yet, here they are, both sides, voting against it. I think his shock led him to believe that he had a job to do in politics. From that day forth he was a person who didn't want to get into it and was trying to get out of it. He became very, very dedicated and passionate in his belief.


I want to say some positive things about previous people in positions of power. Wayne Swan called a debt round table with Rowell Walton, the president of Katter's Australian Party. Rowell called a meeting with Wayne Swan and myself, and we got a debt round table. Out of that debt round table we had $450 million made available. We thank former Treasurer Swan for that. Barnaby Joyce attended another meeting called by Rowell Walton at St George. It was very big of the former Deputy Prime Minister, because he knew that we were a competing political party. But he was a big enough man to go to that meeting and provided $200 million on top of the $450 million. Then Robbie Katter called the last meeting, in which Alan Jones was the main feature item. At that meeting former Deputy Prime Minister Joyce put another $150 million aside. Again, we thank him for his approach. This is the very sad part, they gave that money to the LNP government of Queensland.


I think the member for Groom—I'm never too sure of these things—might be the member sitting here at the table. I don't know—




Mr Littleproud:
  No, mate, I'm Maranoa. I'm your neighbour.




Mr KATTER:
  Again, he's laughing and joking. Whilst people out there are doing away with themselves he is laughing and joking. That is true. He just laughed and joked. Don't say it's not true. It's on the record. The radio will have picked up that you were laughing and joking.


The tragedy of this was that Wayne Swan, former Treasurer, ALP, and Joyce, National Party—not LNP; National Party—are both from outside Queensland, in the sense that their parties are controlled from outside Queensland. They gave $750 million. It was given to the LNP government of Queensland, and they did not go to a reconstruction board. They did not reconstruct the loans. They gave them further debt. Very seldom in my entire life have I heard my son shocked and in trauma, but when the figures came out he said, 'The figures have come out. At the back of Queensland, principally North and Central Queensland, the subject of the cattle collapse'—he's had a lot to do with the cattle collapse, as a result of the ALP's actions on live cattle—'out of 2,500 cattlemen who needed that assistance they have given it to four people.' Four people got that assistance. We worked like dogs down here to get $450 million. God bless former Treasurer Swan, because he took pain in getting the $450 million made available. God bless Barnaby Joyce, because he took pain in getting that money made available. In good faith they gave to it the state government—the LNP government of Queensland—and they gave it to nobody.


I said that we were suffering one suicide every three weeks and I was corrected. A number of people venomously attacked me, because it was one every two weeks in the industry. Don't think about graziers here; think about the contractors, the workers and the businesses that depend upon this industry. But four people got it. The policy of this current government is exactly the same as the policy of the LNP in Queensland. The minister comes out of the LNP in Queensland. It is exactly the same policy.


Now, I've spoken to the Prime Minister personally. I have pleaded on my bended knees to go to a reconstruction board approach. Theodore, Chifley, Curtin, McEwen and Doug Anthony, arguably the greatest men in the political history of this nation, all went to a reconstruction board. They knew what needed to be done. But if you can't go to a reconstruction board then you are simply imposing more pain and more debt upon the people. It is counterproductive in the extreme. Having said those things that needed to be said, I put it before the Prime Minister. I went to see the last Prime Minister. He stared at his watch and he stared out the window. I may as well have had a conversation with a gum tree. The next morning I went down to see Arthur Sinodinos. I told him what had transpired. He, like a good and faithful minister, said nothing. He said: 'Shut up. What do you want?' I named four things. He said, 'Have your chief of staff in my office at 10.30 tomorrow morning.' By half past 11 that day, we had the four things through.


I don't think I contributed in any way to the downfall of Mr Turnbull. I most certainly contributed to the downfall of Julia Gillard. She was responsible for the live cattle decision, and she copped it. What, did she really think that I was going to walk away and not break a leg if someone did that? Running commentary: the minister is talking again at the table. At no stage has he listened to anything we've said, just like the LNP people that went on the inquiry all over Queensland and didn't listen to anything that the people there said. They just won't listen! The second thing that needs to be done is on grain. There has to be feed. A grant to people using grain is absolutely essential. I mean, the cattle have to be fed. To feed the cattle, you have got to do that. I might add, in conclusion, that Hell's Gate would feed a million head of cattle a year. Wouldn't that be a weapon? Hughenden and Charters Towers—two little projects we put before the Prime Minister—would feed 300,000 head of cattle a year. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had that weapon at our disposal as well?

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray—Nationals Whip) (12:22):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018 is an important bill to have the opportunity to talk to, because we all know that the drought is cutting right throughout regional Australia right now. I must admit, though, I find it difficult to sit here in silence when the Labor Party come in here and start espousing the values of the Labor Party and what they're doing to try and help our farmers. What they do and what they say they will do in government is quite scary and it spreads a lot of fear through the farmers in my area of Murray.


I don't come to the parliament and profess to be an expert on the union movement. I don't understand how these new workers in the Melbourne infrastructure projects that the government is going to build are going to get $50 an hour, and $100 an hour for Sunday work. The average labourer is going to pick up $150,000 a year from Daniel Andrews. The taxpayers in Victoria are going to have to pay for that. I don't understand how the union movement works. I imagine the Labor Party have full expertise on how the union movement works. But to have the Labor Party turn up here and tell us that they are the party for the farmers, I find that a little bit of a stretch too far. I talk to the leaders of my area and I watch Labor Party policy. There is no support for agriculture from within the Labor Party's leadership.


It starts first and foremost with water policy. We know very clearly that, when it comes to setting water policy in place that is going to enable irrigators right up and down the Murray-Darling Basin to afford to grow their produce in an efficient and profitable manner, the Labor Party, along with the Greens, are the biggest opponents to those two million people that live along the Murray-Darling Basin. They are the ones who are going to make water so expensive that, effectively, we're not going to be able to grow the produce that we have been able to grow for as long as we can remember. It is the Labor Party who are going to make sure that even more water is taken out of the consumptive irrigators' pool and put into the environment, effectively creating a tipping point. We have these Labor Party people who come in here and talk about agriculture and who have no idea what their water policies are going to do to agriculture. And, yet, they still maintain that somehow they are miraculously on the side of farmers. It is just a joke. They don't understand exactly how directly their cutting policies are going to hurt people in the irrigation areas of the Murray-Darling Basin.


We understand that this drought makes the debate around water policy even more succinct and heightened to another degree again. So we have to put in place now the policies that are going to effectively help farmers today, as best as we possibly can, and help them through this time. In my patch right now, farmers are making the incredibly heartbreaking decision to maybe cut their crops for hay. Some farmers will be saying, 'No, there is enough in them that we will give them the chance to get further spring rains so that we'll be able to get the crops through and be able to harvest them around Christmas time.' But this decision is being made right now, right throughout southern New South Wales and Victoria. When you have to make that decision to cut your crop for hay, it's heartbreaking. It means that your profits in that particular crop are going to be less. You'll get your money back, plus a little bit. Ultimately it's all going to depend on the price of fodder.


To deal with this, this bill is putting in place an accounting procedure that's going to make it much more attractive for people to prepare for storage of fodder into the future. So, as has been said throughout the debate this morning, the ability for farmers to increase the numbers of bunkers for silage and the numbers of silos and various bins around farms that are going to help them store their grain won't be used to help people through this drought as much as it will be used for future dry periods right throughout Australia. We've already seen the instant asset write-off have an enormous impact on a whole range of businesses, not just farming businesses. The instant asset write-off has been able to create a real opportunity for many people in small business to further invest in their business and have that offset against their tax. It's become very, very important.


We've also seen the outcomes of some of the measures that we currently have in place, not just for the drought. Before I first came into the federal parliament, we had the milk crisis. We had processors that were offering a price that was unsustainable and then, all of a sudden, they had to make an announcement and come clean and then start clawing that money back out of dairy farmers. They had paid them at a price that was unsustainable. We saw the farm household allowance ramped up at that stage to enable more and more farmers to gain access to it. Under the government and Minister Littleproud's watch during this drought period, we've seen that farm household allowance increased to $37,000, with the new additional money being paid over two instalments. We've also seen a reduction in the amount of paperwork that is needed for mums and dads and individuals to be able to get onto the farm household allowance. We have also seen an enormous uptake in the number of people who have been able to access low-interest loans. Again, these are things that are tangible and have been able to assist farmers as they go through this incredibly tough period.


Right now, the government has Major General Stephen Day working as the Drought Coordinator. There are a whole raft of people out there in the community who are trying to assist in any way they possibly can. I bumped into a great mate of mine, Kevin Sheedy, recently. He was trying to work out with the Essendon Football Club and some of their supporters how they could move into the market and buy hay for the farmers of the Riverina and throughout New South Wales. When you've got people whose hearts are right behind the farmers and right behind the agriculture sector, you need someone like Major General Stephen Day, who can get all these different actors in the industry coordinated so that we can actually get the best bang for our buck.


Barnaby Joyce has now been appointed as the drought envoy. You've heard some of the figures. Thousands and thousands of tonnes of grain are being accessed in Western Australia and brought over to the eastern seaboard by Barnaby Joyce and his connections. Again, they are trying to source the produce from various parts of Australia where we actually have grain and fodder, and bring it over to the eastern states where the ravaging of the drought is worst. But, again, we need special people out there who understand what's really going on and who also understand the difficulty of bringing that produce over to the East. We also argued as hard and as fiercely as we possibly could with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder about whether they had the capacity to release more water into the market, to lower the price of that water so that it could have found its way to the fodder producers three weeks ago, who would then have been in a good position to grow the lucerne that we were looking for.


It's good to see that we've got both Minister Littleproud and Barnaby Joyce from this place bringing together the drought packages and drought assistance. We've also got Major General Stephen Day as the overall coordinator and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer putting in place financial bills like this that are going to assist farmers to make the investments that they need so that they can be better prepared for future droughts. This is a horrible situation that exists in our regions at the moment, and it's probably going to get worse as we move into the summer months. We need a government that is going to be receptive—in the way that the government is already—but it's a reality that we are also probably going to need more and more assistance in the months to come.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Treasurer) (12:32):  I thank all those members who have contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018. It's an important issue in our national discourse. The government well and truly recognises the need to support Australian families during difficult times, with drought being one of the most difficult. One way we're doing this, of course, is to help farmers better droughtproof their properties. Some four weeks ago, on 19 August, the government announced an instant depreciation initiative for fodder storage assets. This bill gives effect to that announcement. The government is moving, legislating, and acting quickly.


This measure amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow primary producers, from 19 August this year, to immediately deduct the cost of fodder storage assets, such as silos or hay sheds used to store grain and other animal feed. Previously, primary producers generally had to deduct the cost of fodder storage assets over an extended period of some three years. Implementing this instant depreciation initiative will certainly assist farmers. It will make it easier to stockpile fodder, and farmers will no longer have to track the depreciation of fodder storage assets for more than one year for tax purposes. I wholeheartedly commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill now be read a second time. To this the honourable member for Fenner has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment moved by the member for Fenner be agreed to.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:14):  It needs to be said: our economy does not treat women equally or fairly. It needs to be said: there is too much gender inequality in Australia, and we are making far too little progress in dealing with it. It needs to be said: our superannuation and retirement income system does not treat women equally or fairly. We know that there's a gender pay gap in Australia. We know that women earn around 19 per cent less than men, across our economy. But we also know that, over a woman's working life, that compounds year on year and is worsened by the fact that women take time out of the workforce to raise their children. It means that the income gap in retirement is even worse, and that women retire, on average, with 40 per cent less than men. If we look at the median account balances of men and women, the story is even worse. The median account balance for a man at retirement is $110,000. The median account balance for a woman at retirement is $36,000. We know that only two in 10 women in Australia in 2018 retire with a level of income high enough to be regarded as retiring in comfort. We know that the biggest single cause of a rise in homelessness between 2011 and 2016 was a 31 per cent rise in homelessness for older women.


This is not okay. In Australia in 2018, a country that prides itself on being the land of the fair go, we should be doing better. We can be doing better. Today, with the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Barton, the member for Hotham and I together, Labor announced a concrete plan. It won't fix all the problems, it won't solve all the issues, but it is a serious, concrete plan when it comes to women's retirement income. Our plan to pay the superannuation guarantee during paid parental leave will help 250,000 people a year. It will mean a payment of about $1,200. But of course it unleashes the miracle of compound interest. That $1,200 will be paid early in a woman's working life, almost by definition. It will compound year on year. Taking the example of a woman who has three children, at the ages of 27, 29 and 31—quite a common pattern—that will compound to an increase in that woman's superannuation balance at retirement of $18,590.


There's a second element to the plan we announced today. Many Australians perhaps don't realise that when we talk about universal superannuation, it's not actually universal. If you earn less than $450 a month from any one employer, you don't get paid your superannuation; it's not compulsory to be paid superannuation. This was done at a different time, when payrolls were a lot less automated than they are today. It's been that way for a long time. But the increase in casualisation has actually made it worse. Many people, not just women but mainly women, work more than one job, and they have to work more than one job because those jobs pay less than $450 a month. Those people don't get superannuation. There's no requirement to pay superannuation to those people. It's time to end that. It's time to say that superannuation should be truly universal. It's time to say that Australia's lowest-income earners deserve superannuation too.


Today we announced a plan to do just that. We'll phase it out, to give business time to adjust, but we'll get rid of it. The $450-a-month threshold should be zero and will be zero under a Shorten Labor government. Sixty thousand people will benefit from this in the first year, and, by the time we've entirely abolished the threshold, 400,000 people will benefit. If you bring these two elements together, the superannuation guarantee and the $450 threshold, and you take a woman who's had three children and spent some time doing a job that pays less than $450 a month, she'll be around $30,000 better off when it comes to her retirement income.


We've announced other things today as well. We've announced that, if an employer wants to pay more into a female's superannuation account because they're concerned about the gender imbalance in their workplace, we'll get rid of the red tape. At the moment, if an employer wants to do that, they have to go to the Human Rights Commission and seek permission. The government say they want to get rid of red tape. Let's get rid of that red tape. Let's let an employer do that.


Today we've recommitted to a Labor government also releasing—I as Treasurer in a Labor government, when bringing down the budget at the despatch box, will also release—a women's budget statement, because, when I bring down a budget, I will be comfortable with people being able to look at the budget and say, 'What's the impact of this budget on Australia's women?' I want to be held to account for that. When we make policy decisions, I want to be held to account, as Treasurer, for the impact of those decisions on Australia's women.


Of course, we would welcome it if the government adopted these plans. We would welcome it if Australians didn't have to wait for a Labor government for these plans to be implemented. I have to say, and I say in all seriousness: we've seen a lack of progress from this government on matters of gender inequality in our economy. There are some areas where they've just done nothing, and areas where they've taken very little action. Superannuation is one. They abolished the low-income superannuation contribution, before bringing it back. As I said: in fairness to the government, you can't bring something back until you've abolished it—that was probably their logic!


There has been a lack of action on domestic violence leave. The government will say they've introduced domestic violence leave—five days—



Opposition members:  Unpaid!




Mr BOWEN:
  Five days, unpaid. Well, we think Australian victims of domestic violence—not all women, but mainly women—deserve 10 days paid domestic violence leave. We can afford that in 2018 in Australia.


The things that we've announced today don't fix all the problems. There is more to do, and we'll have more to say. Women in Australia earn, on average, around 77c in the dollar compared to men. There's more to do. Women are under-represented in the most senior ranks of our economy—under-represented on boards, under-represented when it comes to senior corporate positions, under-represented in government, under-represented in parliament, and particularly under-represented on one side of parliament. We're one of the very few OECD countries that has not had a female in positions equivalent to Secretary of the Treasury, Governor of the Reserve Bank, Chair of APRA, Chair of ASIC and Chair of the ACCC—all of those positions. Not once in our history has a female filled those roles. We're pretty unique around the world for that. We can do a whole better.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  If there are more women in the senior ranks of decision-making in the economy, women will be at the centre of decision-making more often. More often, the decision-making bodies, whether they be the cabinet room or the Reserve Bank board, will say: 'What are the impacts of our decision on women? What are the impacts of what we do on Australia's women?'


Women deserve more than cliches. And this government has not only taken very little action; in many instances, they've taken adverse action. This government has sat by as penalty rates have been cut. We on this side of the House have pointed out that Australians who work on weekends and Sundays deserve to be paid that bit extra. But the majority of those people are women. The majority of people who work on Sundays are women in low-paid jobs; women, predominantly, do those jobs, and younger women do those jobs, to make ends meet. This government has sat by while their wages have been cut—the first non-negotiated, non-traded-off wage cut we've had in Australia since the Great Depression. And the government says: 'That's okay.' 'There's nothing we can do,' they say. Well, there's something they can do—they can legislate, as an incoming Shorten Labor government will do, to correct the error, so that women and all people who work on Sundays get paid what they deserve.


Women deserve more than cliches. They don't need to be told that women hold up half the sky. They don't need to be told that women are an important part of our economy and our society and we couldn't do without women. Women actually deserve action. It's Australia, in 2018. That's why: because it's 2018, and Australia can do better when it comes to women in our economy.


A lack of females at senior levels makes a difference; a lack of females in the senior levels of government makes a difference. I'm very proud of the fact that I've worked with great colleagues—the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, the member for Barton and others—in getting this policy done. We're men and women working together, men and women who know that women deserve better—men and women who actually think it should be a priority for a Prime Minister and a Treasurer to say: '27 years of uninterrupted economic growth is good, but women deserve a slice of the action.'

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Jobs, Industrial Relations and Women) (15:24):  I welcome the opportunity to be able to contribute to this debate. I welcome it because it's almost like a dorothy dixer for our side, because it allows us the opportunity to talk about our proud record in working hard in this place each day to help the financial security and financial retirement of millions of Australian women.


We understand that the best way to achieve financial security and to boost your retirement savings is to be able to get a job. I'm pleased to say that under our government there are more Australians in work than ever before. And there are more Australian women in work than ever before, and they are working full-time. There are more Australian women working full-time than ever before—unlike the statements that those opposite have made.


By contrast, when Labor left office, women's full-time employment was going backwards. In fact, on other measurements, like the gender pay gap, under the previous Labor government the gender pay gap increased. It increased from 15.5 per cent to 17.2 per cent. But under our government it's, in fact, come down. It's come down to a record low of 14.5 per cent. But, of course, we're not prepared to accept that pay gap. We will continue to work hard to make sure that it is closed even further.


We hear that Labor claim that they are interested in improving women's superannuation. I'm pleased to hear that, and I'm pleased to hear that they are interested in measures that will assist with this. Let me just remind them of the coalition's record. In the 2016-17 budget, the government announced a number of changes that directly improved the flexibility, sustainability and equity of our superannuation system. Most of these changes commenced on 1 July, and they include the low income superannuation tax offset. This supports low-income earners and makes sure they are not paying more in tax on their superannuation than they would otherwise be paying at their marginal tax rate. The LISTO benefits around 1.9 million women by over $500 million.


We've levelled the playing field by expanding access to personal deductible superannuation contributions. We've removed the restriction on individuals earning more than 10 per cent of their income through salary and wages. This benefits around 800,000 Australians and is particularly useful for those men and women working in roles without access to formal salary-sacrificing arrangements. From 1 July this year, we're allowing the rollover for five years of unused concessional contribution cap amounts, which means that individuals for the first time will have the capacity to catch up on their superannuation contributions if they are in a financial position to do so. It benefits around 230,000 people—in particular, those people with interrupted work patterns or irregular incomes. We are increasing the number of people who can claim a tax offset of up to $540 for spouse contributions to superannuation by increasing the income test threshold for recipient spouses to $40,000. Previously, the limit was $13,800.


These measures complement the government's existing superannuation co-contribution scheme, which matches after-tax contributions of low-income earners at a rate of 50 per cent up to $500. In 2015-16, almost 320,000 low- and middle-income women were paid $100 million of co-contributions as a result of this.


We are not resting on our laurels though. We know that there is more to do in protecting people's superannuation. That is why the government has introduced a Protecting Your Superannuation Package, which caps fees on low-balance accounts—those accounts with less than $6,000 in them. This will help around seven million Australians save around $570 million in fees in just the first year. Why is it necessary? It is necessary because the Leader of the Opposition, when he occupied the treasury bench, scrapped the protections for low-balance accounts. He let it be a fee free-for-all. It is not acceptable and not right, which is why it will change under us.


We are banning exit fees on all accounts. These exit fees are charged by about a third of the industry and cost people around $52 million in the most recent year. We are going to make insurance opt in rather than opt out for those categories of people who are most at risk of having their superannuation eroded. Those are young people aged under 25, low-balance holders and those with inactive accounts. This will provide around five million Australians with the opportunity to save up to—wait for it—$3 billion in insurance premiums in just one year, whilst still giving them the opportunity to have insurance cover should they wish to do so. For the first time ever, as a result of our bill, we are going to provide the Australian Taxation Office with the power to proactively reunite people with inactive funds that they have scattered about. We know from the Productivity Commission that this multiplicity of accounts is costing people billions of dollars in retirement income. It will mean around $6 billion will be reunited with around three million Australians.


This is legislation that those opposite should support, but they're not supporting it. I'll tell you why they should support it. As Minister for Revenue and Financial Services I received letters from so many people right across the country who talked about why it was necessary. Young people wrote to me to say:


In year 10 I learned that ""money is exchanged for goods and services"". In this case I had paid for a service—


because they had a part-time job and were putting money into their superannuation—


that quickly took what I had and shut me down. I didn't receive any of these elusive 'goods' or 'services'.


We also had letters from older Australians who said:


I've just spoken to your office regarding superannuation. My problem, and that of many others I know, is that we only work part time now and then—


this is from an elderly woman—


My position is I am 76 years old and I work at a school supervising exams on a casual basis, I also supervise the HSC at the end of each year. I have been forced to have another super fund for this purpose, but each year it gets eaten up with fees and I have to open another.


She goes on to say:


I now have a letter to say that it has been closed (again eaten up with fees). This is happening to so many people I know, we are all cross, as it is the employers money and our money going to a superannuation fund for free. I now have to open another fund so that I can work for the HSC this year, and I won't see any of the money going into that fund. I am a self-funded retiree, not costing the Gov a cent as such, pay my own way everywhere and all I want to do is keep my mind busy, enjoy working supervising exams so I'm not a burden on society.


These people are crying out for these changes that would make a difference, but those opposite refuse to support them. They like to talk about how people will benefit from their changes, but let's test that. As part of their announcement today they said they had removed the $450 threshold and said that would increase retirement savings by around $30,000 for those impacted. Let me tell you: our bill will benefit Australians by billions of dollars. Let's take the example of Emily, who's 32 years old, earning $40,000 a year and, like many Australians, has more than one superannuation account. She would be, after our bill passes, more than $36,000 better off by retirement. Julie, who started her first job at 25 with an annual income of $24,000, changed jobs, defaulted into another superannuation account, would be better off to the tune of $57,000 if our bill passes. Those opposite, who claim—

I'm very proud to be in a political party that places this issue right at the front and centre of the political debate.

Labor is incredibly proud of our superannuation system. It is a system that we designed, that we put into practice and that has helped millions of Australians retire into more comfort. But the truth is it's a system that's not working perfectly today for Australian women. We know that Australian women retire on average with 40 per cent lower superannuation accounts than Australian men. In 2015-16, the average retirement balance for a man was $270,710. For a woman it was just over $157,000, a difference of $113,600. That's a very significant difference in the standard of living that you're going be able to achieve in retirement. We also know that women who are at that lower end when they retire are growing in number. The shadow Treasurer spoke earlier about the fact that just two in 10 women in today's Australia are retiring with the level of comfort in retirement that we would expect for them. We know that Australian women who are over the age of 55 are the fastest growing group of Australian people living with homelessness.


This is not something that the group of people who sit behind me in the chamber can stand by and watch happening without doing anything to fix. That's why today Labor made this incredibly important announcement about some big changes that we will make to retirement incomes for women if elected in the future. The most important part of the change that we're announcing today, the most significant amount, is that for the first time Australian women will receive superannuation payments when they're taking paid parental leave. That's an 18-week payment that, again, Labor members of parliament brought into Australian law in this parliament. For the first time we're going to pay superannuation on those accounts.


Deputy Speaker, you're also probably aware that there's a $450-a-month threshold that has to be met before an employee can be due superannuation. We're going to scrap it. The reason we're doing that is that we acknowledge that, especially in the workforce of today, there are so many people who are working casually and part time who are not reaching that $450 threshold. There are other important changes that Labor has proposed today, but the two that I've talked about are the ones that are going to have the most impact.


What is so exciting about these changes is that we talk in the parliament about the different regulations and that sort of thing, but what really matters is what happens at the end of a woman's working life and how much money, essentially, she ends up with in retirement. One of the examples that we've talked about today is that a woman under the age of 30 who has two children, with the combination of the changes that Labor's announced today, would be $24,000 better off. This is a powerful difference. A woman who has three children around that same age bracket might be $30,000 better off in her retirement just because of the changes that Labor is announcing today.


Again, can I just say how incredibly proud I am to be in a political party that is willing to accept the centrality of this issue to the Australian people. I have to say I don't think it's an accident that you see two very different political parties that oppose one another in this chamber: one party in which almost half of our members of parliament are female, and one which is having a very significant and deep-seated problem in getting and keeping talented women in this parliament. I take no delight in that problem, because the truth is that, above being a member of parliament and a member of the Labor Party, I'm an Australian woman, and I need governments to make good public policy, and we don't see that on that side of the chamber, because they just can't get the representation they need. Today Labor showed once again that we are there for Australian women when they need us.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite—Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services) (15:39):  It's my great pleasure as a strong Liberal woman to rise and speak in this MPI debate on retirement income, following a wonderful Minister for Women and soon to be followed by the member by Boothby, another wonderful Liberal woman in this parliament. There's one way to keep Liberal women in the parliament, and that's to vote Liberal at the next federal election. So I call on all my constituents in Corangamite to vote Liberal at the next federal election, for a strong Liberal woman.


It is quite ironic that the member for Hotham, for whom I have a lot of respect personally, didn't mention the member for Lindsay in her contribution. And where is the member for Canberra? Have we heard from the member for Canberra about what she has endured over her terrible preselection loss? She has been absolutely savaged, kicked out. It is absolutely appalling what we are seeing—and such great hypocrisy. But the most hypocritical part of this whole debate is the $10.7 billion tax slug—which hurts women more than men—because of Labor's retiree tax. That is $10.7 billion, hitting some pensioners and self-funded retirees. Do you know how much this is impacting Australians around this nation? Almost 900,000 Australians will be worse off as a result of this terrible, terrible policy. Women are impacted around 30 per cent more than men. If Labor cared about women in retirement they would reverse this dreadful policy, which is the most inequitable policy for women, hitting those who earn the least and who rely on this for their futures—both women and men who rely on these franking credits for their savings. This has been absolutely ripped away by the Labor Party, and they know it—$10.7 billion. It is savage, and it is a disgrace.


We as a government are incredibly proud of our achievements for women. Look what we are doing: looming at 17 per cent under Labor, the gender pay gap now has been reduced to 14.5 per cent. We've got more work to go, but this is a record low. Economic security for women is clearly a critical priority for us, and more than one million jobs have been created since the government's election in 2013, the majority of which have been taken up by women. Women are now employed at record levels. The other very significant change we have introduced is our childcare changes, which are encouraging greater workforce participation, for both women and men who are parents, by improving access to child care by investing an additional $2.5 billion in childcare assistance. Of course, we have a really proud record of introducing tangible measures to help women save for their retirement, including the low-income superannuation tax offset, which benefits around 1.9 million women by over $500 million, levelling the playing field by scrapping restrictions on who can make personal deductible contributions, and the catch-up concessional contributions, which will benefit 230,000 Australians, including women who have interrupted work patterns or irregular income, and including cohorts such as farmers and carers. Shame on Labor for opposing those measures.


The government has very proudly introduced a comprehensive Protecting Your Super package, which will stop the rorts and rip-offs in the superannuation sector, providing significant benefits for the financial security of millions of Australian women. And I say, shame on Labor for opposing this package.




Ms Claydon:
  That's all you've got to say—'shame'.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Newcastle is warned.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Yes, shame—and it is shameful. It is shameful that the package has been opposed by Labor, leaving many thousands of women worse off. We've heard from the Minister for Women how important this is, and I would urge those opposite to pass this package in this Senate.

 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (15:44):  It's a great day, it's a momentous day, to be a member of this parliament. It's a great day to be a Labor woman. It's a great day to be one of the 29 women who sit on this side of the chamber, representing electorates around this country. It's a great day because Labor created superannuation, and today Labor has committed to making superannuation fairer for Australian women. It is a great day. 


I'm pleased to follow the member for Corangamite, because the member for Corangamite made some extraordinary statements that need to be corrected for the record. For the record, the member for Lindsay was in this chamber and delivered a 90-second statement. The proud secretary of Labor's caucus for women was in here talking about this very issue on this very day. Also, I think the member for Corangamite cast an aspersion on the member for Canberra, which cannot be left unchallenged. The member for Canberra has made a personal decision to leave politics. There was no preselection battle for the member for Canberra, Member for Corangamite. 



Ms Henderson interjecting—




Ms RYAN:
  There was no preselection battle for the member for Canberra. It is typical of those opposite to get their facts confused in this place. They have their facts confused not only in this space but in many other parts of the debate today. 



Ms Henderson interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Corangamite is warned!




Ms RYAN:
  I have sat with many women in my electorate office, women over 50, who were on the verge of homelessness. I am proud to be a member of the Labor Party that commits today to making that a thing of the past. Those opposite scoff and say, 'What difference will $30,000 make to your retirement income?' As a woman who had three children before she turned 30, I would have appreciated the compound interest on that $30,000 in my retirement income, if this superannuation package had been there then. Like many teachers who took time out of work to have their families, I would have appreciated this policy being in place back then. I'm proud to be part of a party that is making sure that it won't happen to other women in the future. 


Sitting beside me is the member for Newcastle. She led Labor's Setting the Agenda consultation program across this country. The No. 1 issue that women—not just Labor women but women from business and all walks of life—raised with us around the country was women's superannuation. I am absolutely thrilled today to speak on this MPI to highlight what the government won't do but what Labor will do, and that is make a start down the road to making superannuation fairer for Australian women. 


I want to give a shout-out to the labour movement. On my desk is a photograph of me with Ingrid Stitt and other members of the ASU, which was taken when they came to talk to me about this very issue. It sits on my desk to remind me every day that my job in this place is to ensure that women are given a fair go from the government of the day. I just want to mention this very important thing. When I joined the caucus, I was shocked on budget night in 2014 to learn that the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, had made himself the Minister for Women and had cut—cut!—the overview of the budget's impact on women, and I am shocked that three Prime Ministers later we still don't have a commitment to bringing that back in. Documents and actions like that highlight the problems in our economy where women are suffering, where this government is failing to look at things through that particular lens. It's not a surprise that they're failing to look at it through that particular lens. We've seen it all this week: 29 women on this side of the chamber; 29 women proudly fighting for things in our policies and helping to take the tough decisions so that we can do things like we've done today. It's not a surprise that those opposite don't understand women's issues or women's place in the economy. It's clear on their benches that they don't understand the importance— (Time expired)

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (15:49):  I am pleased to speak on this matter today because our government has a very strong record of introducing real measures to help women to ensure that they are financially secure not just in retirement but right throughout their lives. This is an issue that young women are increasingly aware of—the need to be financially secure throughout their lives. More and more young women are thinking about what they need to do to ensure their financial security from the start of their working life right through to when they retire. Young women around Australia are taking responsibility for their financial security and for their financial literacy, and they're informing themselves about how they can best look after themselves and prepare for their future. In fact, I was recently contacted by some thoughtful young women, Georgina Southcott and Miranda Stahl, who are year 9 students studying the issue of equality in the workplace, particularly equality of income. For many industries where there is an award in place or where there is legislated pay, like we're paid here in parliament as members of parliament, women and men are already paid equally. Where a job is not subject to set wages, one of the key things, we know, is to help women gain the skills they need to negotiate and bargain when it comes to their incomes so that they can get the best deal for themselves.


Our government is taking a range of steps to improve economic security for women, whether these women are school leavers, jobseekers, new mums returning to the workforce or senior Australians nearing retirement age. Unlike those opposite, we on this side of the House know that no-one gets superannuation if they're unemployed. You need to have a job to earn money to put into your super and to top up your super. So we are supporting women—and, in fact, all Australians—to get a job. So I say to Georgina and Miranda: one of the most important things that we are doing for women in Australia is making sure that they can get a job. Almost one million jobs have been added to the Australian economy since September 2013, when the Liberal-Nationals coalition came to government, and, significantly, 58 per cent of these jobs went to women. In the year 2015-16 alone, around 90,000 more women than men joined the labour force. By contrast, when those opposite left office, when the Labor Party were kicked out of government, women's full-time employment was going backwards.


What we're doing on this side is helping women access the job market by providing affordable and accessible child care, because we know this is one of the biggest barriers for a lot of women returning to work. We've started the national rollout of the ParentsNext program, which helps eligible parents prepare for employment, with approximately 96 per cent of participants expected to be women, including around 10,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. In the May budget we committed $64.3 million to establish a Jobs and Market Fund to grow the National Disability Insurance Scheme workforce and service providers, because we know that women make up almost 80 per cent of employees in the health, social assistance and disability-care industries. We've extended the pension work bonus to allow pensioners to earn more income without reducing their age pension, and mature aged women will benefit from expanded access to the Restart wage subsidy, offering an incentive of up to $10,000 to encourage businesses to hire and retain mature aged employees. Women aged 45 to 70 will benefit from the Skills Checkpoint for Older Workers Program.


When it comes time for women to retire, our government has provided a superannuation system with flexibility, sustainability and equity. We introduced the low-income superannuation tax offset to support the accumulation of super for low-income earners. We have levelled the playing field by scrapping restrictions on who can make personal deductable contributions, benefitting 800,000 Australians, including those women working in roles without access to formal salary-sacrificing arrangements. In fact, in 2015-16, almost 320,000 low- and middle-income-earning women were paid $100 million in co-contributions. And we, of course, have the Protecting Your Super Package, which will help many, many women. Also, we are assisting 1.6 million women who are still contributing to low-balance accounts by helping to protect their super as well. We know the biggest risk to some of our senior Australian women is actually those opposite and their retiree tax, which is going to do so much damage to people who've worked hard and saved for their retirement.

"Swanson, Meryl, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (15:54):  I am pleased to speak on today's MPI, as indeed it is a matter of public importance and, I contend, a matter of historic importance. This December marks the 46th year since the arbitration commission ruled that women should be paid the same rates as males for the same jobs. A couple of years later, the basic wage was applied to women as well as men. The idea that male wages, as was contended by the Higgins decision of 1908, should be designed to be family wages and support a wife and children was gone. It was a historic decision, and it was the Whitlam government in that year that sent Mary Gaudron to fight for equal pay for equal work. However, here we are 46 years along, and there is still a full-time gender pay gap of approximately 14.6 per cent, or $244.80 less than men per week on average. We're told it's going to take 150 years to close that gap. I have been joined by the terrific ADF Squadron Leader Dominique Hoffman. When I shared that news with Dominique, she said, 'I hope not.' I thought, 'Indeed.' She is a woman serving her country, wearing the uniform and making an observation.


Aside from the real-time earnings, this often has far severer ramifications when women stop earning. On average, women currently retire with superannuation balances that are over 40 per cent lower than men's. The poorest people in our country today—and the numbers are on the rise—are women over 50, many of them trying to survive on Newstart, $590 or thereabouts a fortnight. It is absolutely crippling for them.


So this is why today's announcement is another milestone and another step towards a fairer system for Australian women. Interestingly, all of the landmark positive decisions about superannuation have been taken by Labor. In 1983, after the Whitlam years paved the way, the Hawke-Keating government began the Accord process, which really paved the way for the implementation of the superannuation guarantee that was set in place in 1992, where wage rises were given away by workers in lieu of superannuation co-contributions. Of course, in 1992 we saw that increase to nine per cent. An interesting point is that the other seminal moment in superannuation came in 1977, under the Fraser government, when cabinet took the decision—decision 3435 on 20 July 1977—not to establish a contributory national superannuation scheme.




Ms Ryan:
  Shame!




Ms SWANSON:
  It is indeed a shame that that conservative government didn't have the mettle to take that decision. So, in the fashion of Hawke and Keating, a Shorten-Bowen Labor government, should we be given the honour of being elected, will take the higher road. We will set another milestone in this country for superannuation. We will really create a platform that paves the way for future decisions for women, paying the superannuation guarantee on paid parental leave and, I might add, dad and partner payments, because we want everyone to do well. But we know that women have a way to go and need to catch up.


We're also going to phase out the $450-per-month minimum income threshold for eligibility for the superannuation guarantee. That is so important to all of those young people, particularly women, who are working two, three or sometimes even four jobs where the monthly income may not rack up to $450. But I tell you what: in the next 50 years they are going to need that superannuation and, more to the point, our tax base and our income generation are going to need that as well.


When I was talking about this this morning with an employee here in Parliament House, he said to me, 'Don't tell me that you guys are starting to plan more than three years ahead,' and I said, 'Well, we are, because now, if we start to include more people in the truly universal superannuation system, we will have more money put aside in years to come, and this will add an infinite amount of discretionary spending in the economy, but also it will take the pressure off the tax base in the future.' It's an important decision. (Time expired)

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (15:59):  I want to say in the House today and to all the people in my electorate that I really encourage people to put away money for their superannuation. As your federal MP, I'm a big believer in superannuation. My father gave me some great advice as a 19-year-old. He said, 'Luke, put away $80 a month,' when I was 18. At the time, I thought: '$80 a month! That's a lot of money!' But, in hindsight, it helped me build a superannuation balance. So I say to all women and all men in my electorate that I would encourage you to put away money into super because you can put your cash away and save a lot of tax. At the moment, most people are on a 32½ per cent tax rate. Under super, they can put in contributions at 15 per cent and save a lot of money, so it's well worth doing.


I want to congratulate the coalition's first speaker today, the Minister for Jobs, Industrial Relations and Women, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, for reducing the gender pay gap since the Labor years. In the Labor years, just five short years ago, the gender pay gap was 17.2 per cent. That's a fact. Now it's down to 14.5 per cent. That's also a fact. If we were to keep that rate up for the next few years, the gender pay gap would be solved very quickly. So congratulations to the minister for women. Congratulations to the government. We've got a lot more work to do, but we'll keep going.


Labor, on the other hand—we hear a lot from members opposite. They don't talk about the $200 billion in new taxes that they want to hit the ADF and everyone else who works in this country with—another $200 billion in new taxes because they can't balance the budget or organise spending properly. The fact is that Labor's retirement tax will hurt women the most. For women who might be on a pension, who are being left shares and who are getting a refund, they're going to take that refund from them—fact.


They also talk about the Fair Work Commission and penalty rates. They don't talk about the fact that penalty rates are being reduced from double time and a half to double time and a quarter in many rates and that the reason the Fair Work Commission mentioned that was that they thought it would give more women increased hours.



Ms Lamb interjecting—




Mr HOWARTH:
  Don't shake your head at me, Member for Longman. You're the one who supports Coles under EBAs that have cut the guts out of penalty rates. You get up there with your Easter card. I'm onto you.


The fact is that those opposite—I like the member for Longman; it's all right—voted against the First Home Super Saver Scheme as well. The First Home Super Saver Scheme is a good scheme. It helps women get into their first home, and it helps them keep more of their own cash, taxed at 15 per cent rather than 32½ per cent.


Those opposite also voted against the massive income tax cuts that will help members of the ADF, people who work at Coles, teachers and a lot of people in the gallery. Everyone earning up to $200,000 will pay no more than 32½ per cent. Labor have stated that they'll unwind that and they'll reinsert a 37 per cent tax rate, with everything over $180,000 at 45 per cent. Higher taxes—that's what you'll get if you vote for Labor.


The fact is that we're helping women into work. We heard the minister for women say there have been a million jobs created in the last five years. Fifty-eight per cent of those new jobs have gone to women.


We've also brought in the Protecting Your Superannuation Package. The Protecting Your Superannuation Package will basically stop the rorts and the rip-offs in the superannuation sector, providing significant benefits to the financial security of millions of Australian women. It helps their super not to be eroded. We've also brought in the superannuation policy top-up for women. At the moment, women can put in $25,000 a year maximum, but, if you have a child and you're out of work for three years and you can afford to perhaps put in $55,000 the next year when you're back in the workforce, we're enabling women to do that.


Finally, I want to say, on the Labor policy, that I think, as a member of the government, that super on paid parental leave is actually not a bad idea. I actually support that idea, and I'm happy to put that on the record. I would encourage the government, if we can afford it, to implement that. I don't, however, think that the $450 a month is relevant at all. It equates to a $16,200 saving over 30 years and with compound interest might reach $30,000. We do have a strong pension scheme that will help women.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (16:04):  I don't think the member for Petrie is a bad bloke. I think he supports bad policy, but I don't think he's a bad bloke. We're both parents of young men and we both know that on average our sons will retire with more money than their friends who are women. I'm a proud member of a party that comprises many different people from many different backgrounds who stand together and represent all Australians. Just this morning at a special meeting of Labor women's caucus I looked around the room and saw a number of very strong, meritorious women who all share a goal—that is, to make our country a better, fairer place for all Australians.


This is not a goal that's shared by the LNP—or if it is, and I'm wrong, I think they're doing a pretty atrocious job of showing it. There's a lot to do before women are treated equally and have the same opportunities available to them as men do. This government has made far too little progress in closing that gap. Over these past few weeks we've seen just how vehemently government members have fought against making things a little fairer for the women of their party. How could we ever expect them to do a complete about-face and start making things fairer for the women of this country?


There is still a pay gap in this country. Multiple factors have contributed to that, like glass walls, glass ceilings, undervalued work and underappreciated motherhood, which combine over the years, snowballing over a woman's working lifetime before ultimately coming to a head in retirement. On average women currently retire with superannuation balances that are over 40 per cent lower than men's. It's truly shameful. It is very true that super is not super if you're a woman. In 2015-16 the average super balance for a man was $270,710; for women it was only $157,050. This is a huge difference. We're talking $113,000.


It's no wonder, then, that we've seen a 31 per cent rise in homelessness amongst older women. This government needs to take action immediately. It is indefensible that they stand idly by while one in three Australian women retire into poverty. I'm not going to hold my breath. We all know that this government doesn't represent the needs of women. This government has no analysis on how their budgets will affect women, ultimately resulting in haphazard policies like their proposed income tax cuts that benefit men twice as much as they benefit women. This government has stood in the way of providing paid domestic violence leave for victims to get their affairs in order and escape abusive relationships. Members of this government argued for a tax cut to the GST on a superyacht but fought tooth and nail against a GST cut for tampons—go figure!


Labor pride ourselves on our policies that give a fair go to regular Australians. We pride ourselves in the superannuation policies we have announced today. This is a suite of policies that bring fairness to the superannuation system and will help close the gender gap in super balances. Labor will ensure that the superannuation guarantee is paid on all paid parental leave, and dad and partner pay, from 1 July 2020. This means parents can take time off work to care for their newborn without sacrificing their retirement. Ultimately this will strengthen the superannuation system for 167,000 recipients of paid parental leave and 80,000 recipients of dad and partner pay in the 2020-21 financial year. The other feature of Labor's policy is to phase out the $450-per-month minimum income eligibility threshold for the superannuation guarantee from 2020. We know women are more likely to work in Australia's lowest paid industries, so they are most likely to be affected by this policy. This policy ensures that low-paid workers aren't discriminated against and are able to contribute to their superannuation accounts even when they're on a low income.

Mr GEE
 (Calare) (16:09):  Those opposite really do have a hide. They really do have a hide bringing to this place this fraudulent proposition, which is critical of the government, and dressing it up as a matter of public importance. The opposition talks of fairness of the retirement income system, but what jaw-dropping hypocrisy—




Mr Christensen:
  Hear, hear!




Mr GEE:
  Yes. As the member for Dawson knows, it is jaw-dropping hypocrisy, especially when you consider the raid that those opposite are perpetrating on the retirement savings of ordinary Australians. They are coming like thieves in the night. Make no mistake about it, they are coming for the money of hardworking Australian retirees, about 900,000 of them.


On the weekend I went to the Eugowra Show. On the way to the Eugowra Show I passed a place called the Escort Rock, which in 1862 was the scene of Australia's biggest gold heist, perpetrated by Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall. It still is Australia's greatest gold heist, but that heist has nothing on the heist that those opposite are about to perpetrate on Australia's retirees. They're planning to snatch $56 billion from Australia's hardworking retirees. It's a stick-up job on 900,000 Australians who have saved in good faith, served their country, paid their taxes and are entitled to retire on the incomes that they've planned for. It's not going down very well for them. The retirees are not happy.


For example, John Kalkman, who is a former vice-president of the Australian Investors Association—most of whose members are self-funded retirees—said, in The Australian Financial Review, that seniors of modest means would suffer if Labor's changes came to pass, not the rich. Then The Australian Financial Review goes on:


""This policy treats some retirees very unfairly it creates perverse incentives for some to give up their self-reliance in retirement and allow the taxpayer to take responsibility for their income, healthcare and age care,"" he said.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr GEE:
  It is shameful. John goes on to say:


They are offended at the misrepresentation with the sneering suggestion that all self-funded retirees are multimillionaires who are using a tax rort at the expense of hard-working Australians.


It is a sneering suggestion. If you look at the figures though, John, I think you're right. Check out the figures, because who is going to be hit by the $56 billion tax heist? Low-income earners. More than half a million Australians on taxable incomes of less than $18,200. Yes, just over 40 per cent of individuals impacted are 65 years old or older, so big hits there. It overwhelmingly hits low- and middle-income earners. Eighty-five per cent of the individuals impacted are on taxable incomes of less than $37,000—




Mr Christensen:
  That would be mainly women—




Mr GEE:
  Yes. And 96 per cent of the individuals impacted are on taxable incomes below $87,000. Around 40 per cent of all self-managed superfund member accounts will lose their tax refunds—




Mr Christensen:
  Why do they hate grandmas so much?




Mr GEE:
  Here's the kicker, member for Dawson: Labor's retiree tax grab will hit around 30 per cent more women than men. This is what they're doing. What arrant hypocrisy of those opposite! They come to this chamber with platitudes about fairness of retirement income systems for women on the one hand, yet they grab their retirement savings on the other. It's absolutely disgraceful. You're not about helping women in retirement; you're all about taking their hard-earned money.


In contrast to the hypocritical opposition, those robbers of Australian retirees, we are helping women and men save for their retirement by giving them jobs. We've got more women working than ever before. We've got more women working full-time than ever before. Employment overall is at a record high of over 12.5 million people. We have the runs on the board, as opposed to the hypocrisy and the bushranger-like behaviour—I'm looking at you, member for Paterson—of those opposite, which is absolutely disgraceful.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:17):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I present the committee's report entitled Report 473: Defence major projects report (2016-17): inquiry based on Auditor-General's report 26 (2017-18).


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HILL:
  by leave—Every year the Department of Defence and the Australian National Audit Office work together to produce a consolidated review of selected major Defence acquisition projects, with the resulting report called the major projects report, or MPR. I pay tribute to the member for Canberra, who just left the chamber, for her work over her time in parliament in getting this reporting process together and her years of strong interest in bringing greater accountability to the enormous sums of taxpayer money that are spent on defence expenditure and sustainment. This year's MPR reviewed risks, challenges and complexities facing major projects in general as well as the status of 27 selected major projects in terms of cost, schedule and forecast capability. The total approved budget for the projects in this year's MPR was approximately $62 billion, covering nearly 59 per cent of the budget within the Approved Major Capital Investment Program of $105.9 billion.


The MPR is reviewed annually by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and of course we hold a public hearing into something so significant. The committee's focus on Defence's business management goes to the core of the committee's work on effective public administration. Possible improvements in this area are focused on risk management approaches and the sometimes optimistic assessment of delivery of capability estimates. The committee recommended reform in updating project maturity scores several years ago. However, Defence remains behind the committee's expectations, and changes remain slow and uncertain. Defence indicates that progress will be seen in the 2018-19 major projects report. The committee will continue to monitor developments in this area. A significant continuing issue to the committee and its MPR review was the Auditor-General's second consecutive qualified audit finding on the ARH Tiger helicopters project. The committee supports the Auditor-General's statement that audit standards require a judgement to be made on the substantive nature of an issue. So concerns remain about the status and costs of this project, requiring it to remain on the MPR in the near future.


The committee's report makes three recommendations aimed at continuing to drive improvements and transparent reporting of Defence's major project expenditure, recommending that Defence report on (1) progress in updating the project maturity scores within three months of the tabling of the committee's report, (2) a methodology which shows how acquisition projects can transition from spreadsheet risk registers to tools with better version control measures and (3) outcomes of the sea trials of the LHD landing craft within three months of the tabling of the committee's report. I commend the report to the House.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:20):  I present the report of the Parliamentary Delegation Field Visit (Mental Health) to the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Sweden and Canada. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr WALLACE:
  Senator Siewert, Senator O'Neill and I travelled during October 2017 to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden and Canada as delegates on the Parliamentary Delegation Field Visit (Mental Health). We met with more than 50 researchers, medical practitioners, policymakers and officials at 35 meetings to examine mental health practices and policy perspectives in each of these four countries.


My own focus for the trip was to find out more about the treatment approaches deployed in these countries in the areas of eating disorders and the mental health of veterans and emergency services personnel. My electorate of Fisher is an emerging national leader in Australia in the treatment of eating disorders, with a $3.2 million Commonwealth government treatment trial taking place on the Sunshine Coast and the nation's first residential treatment facility for eating disorders being constructed, with the coalition government's support, in Mooloolah Valley by the local charity EndED in conjunction with the Butterfly Foundation. I would have to say that this trip that I went away on last year was instrumental in me pushing for these two trial projects on the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast is also a popular location for former members of the ADF to live after their service, with as many as 15,000 veterans calling our community home. As such, these issues are of substantial interest to my constituents.


Overall, one especially notable finding from the trip was the perception we encountered among many international experts that in fact Australia is a global leader in the treatment of mental health. The most common question that we were asked as we moved around was, 'Why are you here?' If anything, many overseas experts felt that there were lessons that their systems could learn from us. It is pretty disconcerting when you have been involved in the mental health space, as I have been, to think that many countries are looking towards us as world leaders. I know, as a matter of fact, that we have got a very, very long way to go.


However, I want to take a couple of minutes of the House's time to summarise some of the things that we learned about the issues on which I focused. On veterans' mental health, we saw strongly contrasting approaches in each country. Lacking a particular department for veterans' affairs, the United Kingdom has sought to build closer links between the National Health Service and charities which can provide services like housing and drop-in support. They have created a network of British Armed Forces champions within key NHS services and are supporting these new staff with a comprehensive directory of NHS services that can be offered to veterans to encourage a patient-centric approach.


In Sweden the focus of their approach is on the proactive and pre-emptive management of service men and women's mental health. Their armed forces engage in extensive predeployment training on mental health to prepare personnel for the experiences that they are likely to encounter and to provide them with coping strategies. During deployments, officers use a structured tool including weekly assessments to manage stress, while following deployment Sweden uses a five-year active assessment process and follow-up reunions to promote normalisation of reactions to veterans' experiences.


The Canadian Armed Forces have a very different and very impressive approach, with the Canadian Armed Forces delivering outpatient services directly through its Canadian Forces Health Services arm and purchasing other services from the civilian sector. The Canadian Forces Health Services has its own Directorate of Mental Health, which provides clinical programs, education and training. They have 31 clinics with mental health services across Canada and Europe, and access to a further 1,200 private practitioners. This work is supported by a range of workplace outreach programs, family resources and vocational transition schemes. It is no surprise that the Canadian emergency services are now looking to adopt a similar national strategy.


On eating disorders, in London we heard from the renowned research group at King's College who are at the cutting edge of research in this field. They told us about the recent classification of diabulimia as an eating disorder, and about the science they are doing on the role that genetics has to play in eating disorders. Professor Treasure and the team emphasised the importance of involving family members and carers in an understanding of eating disorders and making sure they are part of building resilience in sufferers. King's College's Eating Disorders Research Group as well as Novarum and the Mandometer clinic in Sweden provide training and consultancy for other practitioners around their respective countries to ensure that their successful approaches are adopted nationwide.


In Sweden we visited the Mandometer clinic, who claim to have achieved very impressive outcomes through minimising the use of traditional therapies and antidepressants and instead relying on the use of mealtime feedback and counselling to normalise eating behaviours.


However, in the Netherlands we met with Novarum who deliver cognitive behavioural therapy enhanced, or CBTE, for the treatment of eating disorders. We were told about how this therapy is more effective and lower cost than other approaches, reducing the average treatment time from nine months to just eight weeks. Novarum avoid group therapy, focusing on treatment which is personalised, and varies according to the individual circumstances. As they say it is 'better to do a few things right than many things badly'. The strong results of cognitive behavioural therapy enhanced were also emphasised by the Karolinska Institutet Centre for Psychiatry Research in Sweden.


These are only a tiny selection of the research and approaches we benefited from during the trip, and the report I'm tabling today contains more than 50 pages of information that we gathered. I would encourage all members of the House that have an interest in mental health to review the report and consider how we might incorporate these lessons into our own policy deliberations.


I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the many officials, policymakers, and practitioners, and particularly those from our overseas missions, who were very generous with their time and expertise during our visit and, of course, as I said, officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who accompanied us throughout. In particular, on behalf of the delegation I would like to thank High Commissioners their Excellencies then the Hon. Alexander Downer, Dr Brett Mason, Mr Jonathon Keena, and Mr Tony Negus. I'd also like to thank their staff, Matt Anderson and Duncan Hewitt in the United Kingdom, Maaike den Besten in the Netherlands, Antony Lynch and Susanna Fridlund in Sweden and Andrew Clarke and Brittany Noakes in Canada. The professionalism and knowledge of all of these representatives of Australia was absolutely first rate and made a huge difference to the delegation's success. Finally, I'd like to thank my fellow delegates Senators Siewert and O'Neill for a very productive and successful trip, and the Chief Government Whip for choosing me to undertake this trip.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:30):  I rise to speak in favour of the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. After I elaborate on the details of this very sensible bill, I want to make some broader comments about Commonwealth procurement policy. The bill establishes jurisdiction for the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, rather than just the Federal Court of Australia, in regard to matters of dispute within the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. It will vest power with the Federal Circuit Court to grant injunctions and to order payment of financial compensation when the procurement rules are contravened. It comes out of a response to the 2014 Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee's assessment and recommendations to create an independent and effective complaints mechanism for people supplying to the Commonwealth government and various entities. It also arises out of the need for us to comply with our obligations under World Trade Organization agreements and our free trade agreements.


Australia is also making sure that small and medium enterprises in regional, rural and metropolitan Australia have an avenue through the Federal Circuit Court, which is the only court which has a continuous presence in regional Australia where many of these businesses reside and produce goods which are procured by Commonwealth entities. As I mentioned, the Federal Circuit Court will be able to receive complaints from both local and international suppliers who feel that the Commonwealth Procurement Rules have been breached. And it is that which triggers the ability for them to issue an injunction, correct things or order financial compensation.


In introducing this bill, the government doesn't want to generate a so-called lawyerfest. There are many sensible requirements under the bill for the supplier to engage directly with the Commonwealth entity in the first instance in relation to their complaint and to do it in a timely fashion—within 10 days and in writing. The compensation is limited to reasonable costs for the preparation of the tender and/or the costs related to the challenge. The Federal Circuit Court, as I mentioned, will be much more accessible than the higher court because it does sit regularly around regional Australia, and, as I said, many of the people supplying to Commonwealth entities are based in regional Australia. Their raw products and their production are in regional Australia—not exclusively, of course, but it will be a much better fit. It will make it more accessible and more timely, and it will allow much more transparency because of the time constraints that one has to comply with. Evidence of the breach and evidence of the attempts to resolve the matter with the Commonwealth entity must be provided in these disputes. There is facility and a requirement to do this so that the supplier can continue to supply during this dispute resolution. And the remedies and compensations are going to be the solution, rather than just leaving matters in a continual state of litigation.


I have to state that, to qualify to go before this dispute resolution mechanism through the Federal Circuit Court, contracts have to be eligible. For the procurement contract to be covered by this legislation, both the first and second divisions of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules must apply. There are many exemptions under the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, including on the basis that the procurement is essential for maintaining international peace and security, for human health, or for protecting essential security facilities or national artistic, historical or archaeological treasures. There are exceptions for specific defence procurements and specific free trade agreement conditions. The accountable authority may issue a public interest certificate where the public interest or safety would be compromised by ceasing the procurement—that is, if something is a really important facility or product, say a bit of equipment that is essential, you don't want to have loss of delivery of that just because you're entering into a dispute resolution. In this case, if a public interest certificate is issued, it will allow for the delivery of the goods to continue whilst the issue in dispute is sorted out.


The Commonwealth Procurement Rules set aside 10 per cent of Commonwealth procurement across all entities that must go to small and medium-sized enterprises. I would like to comment on some of these Commonwealth Procurement Rules, because it's hard to separate the rules from this dispute resolution process and the bill that we're discussing today. I think the 10 per cent should be an absolute minimum. I think all Commonwealth entities, whether they're corporate government entities, non-corporate government entities or Commonwealth government departments, should be looking at the value that small and medium-sized enterprises deliver when you look at the holistic value-for-money principle, which is mentioned in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. I also note that there is a propensity among Commonwealth government departments, corporate and non-corporate government entities to take the easy way out and go straight to a prime contractor. The reality, though, is that in many instances the prime contractor isn't the actual builder or supplier of the goods; they just act as a giant middleman. They can organise plenty of other tier 2 suppliers of equipment, goods or services—but really, if we're going to try to deliver on the provisions in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules regarding value for money, I put it to the House that it's much better value to go to the direct supplier of the good or service, rather than doing everything through a prime. There are, obviously, some things that are too big for a small or medium-sized enterprise, or a large mid-level enterprise but, really, if you look below the tier 1 contractors, for all these procurements you will see a lot more capability used than if it is all done through a prime.


The other comment I would like to make is that nowhere in the value-for-money principles is there a mention of assessing the value to other Commonwealth, state or local government entities that benefit when a Commonwealth entity makes a decision about value for money. The feature that I want to highlight is that, if Commonwealth entities are procuring goods from local Australian businesses, there will be a return benefit, not necessarily in that particular department but in Treasury, or in Finance. If we procure from Australian providers, we get a GST payment or PAYE tax receipts. State governments receive payroll tax receipts. Local governments—if it's a local provider of services—will have many more businesses paying rates. We who have the responsibility for unemployment services and retraining will have reduced unemployment costs if we consider the value of procuring goods from local Australian companies rather than international suppliers. Think of all the retraining and stimulus packages in various parts of the country—these replace companies that used to rely on government contracts but now have people out of a job and are no longer viable, because they haven't got their base, large, long-term government supply contracts.


We also miss out on the multiplier effect. If we purchase goods and services from local or domestically-based companies, we get a local economic multiplier effect. This is particularly the case if the local supplier is in a regional community. Receiving a long-term government contract is, essentially, much more valuable to a local company—whether it's in paper goods, uniforms, boots or high-tech IT services—than giving grants and other stimulus payments. Rather than going to the big primes, we have a burgeoning IT industry with a lot of capability here. I talk about other IT services like cloud computing. We could have that all based here with Australian based companies that pay their taxes here, rather than with multinationals. As we know, we've had a whole tranche of legislation proposed to avoid all the issues of cost shifting—that is, instead of paying tax here in Australia, paying tax in low-taxing jurisdictions.


We also need to make allowance for the fact that a lot of the people who are supplying goods and services, including built and processed products, to the Commonwealth are hamstrung in Australia by high energy costs which overseas people and suppliers aren't necessarily subject to. We also have very high environmental standards in this country. When you're producing goods in Australia, in many cases, costs are higher because we do look after the environment. These added costs come from—mainly—federal and state legislation, particularly some of our energy market rules, and our environmental policies that have put up the costs of electricity and energy. If we're putting these extra burdens onto Australian producers and suppliers to the Commonwealth, it seems only fair and reasonable to account for that in the value-for-money equation.


Getting back to this bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, it will make it a lot easier for suppliers—local, regional and metropolitan suppliers—to make a complaint. It will allow the supply of critical goods and services to continue while the complaint is sorted out. There are exemptions, as I mentioned, with free trade agreements and defence contracts that must be supplied. But, overall, this is a very good piece of legislation. Legislation that makes things easier is what we're all about in the coalition. Our coalition government is trying to make it easier for all companies to do business with the Commonwealth, and this initiative will go a long way towards making that happen.


I commend this bill to the House. As I said, Commonwealth procurement in the value-for-money decision matrix must take account of value outside the department or entity that is actually doing the procurement. Entities should look at a whole-of-government return benefit, and at the benefit to the whole of the local, regional and national economy from procuring goods and services from local providers. I commend this bill to the House.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (16:44):  I am glad for the opportunity to speak on this bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, and to speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. I acknowledge the work that he has done and continues to do in this space. Government procurement in Australia is very important for a number of reasons. Chiefly, we want to get procurement right. We want procurement to achieve its ends. We want the outcomes of government contracts to be fit for purpose and to be good value. We also want procurement processes to be accessible to Australian businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, which face greater difficulties because of their scale when it comes to dealing with bureaucratic processes and when it comes to dealing with Commonwealth Procurement Rules.


There are some aspects of this bill that appear beneficial. They give access to the Federal Circuit Court, a magistrates court, rather than the full Federal Court for resolving issues or taking up what seem to be breaches of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules in a way that will be much less time-consuming and much less costly. So, on the face of it, that's good for small and medium enterprises.


But it's worth considering where this bill comes from and why we are going into it in this way and at this time. It is related to the comprehensive and progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's part of our obligations under that agreement. So it's important to see that what we really are doing is making some changes to our procurement framework that are balanced by changes that will be made elsewhere. The concept is that not just that small and medium businesses in Australia will benefit from the changes to our own Procurement Rules but Australian companies more broadly will benefit from similar changes elsewhere where Australian companies want to be involved in procurement processes that are conducted by other governments. Whether that is actually achieved or not is an open question. I'll come back to that in the context of some of our other trade agreements.


The timing of this bill is interesting, and what it seeks to achieve is interesting, if you look at the context of what's been happening in this space over the last little while. Australia is in the process of acceding to the government procurement agreement framework that exists under the WTO. We have been going through that process for some time. In fact, my understanding is that the Australian government position with respect to our accession to that agreement is going before the relevant committee in October. It is passing strange that we're entering into the framework covered by this bill at the same time that there's an equivalent set of mechanisms and measures covered under the WTO GPA in prospect. Certainly, when the Joint Select Committee on Government Procurement handed down its report, titled Buying into our future: review of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules,a bit more than a year ago, last June, its recommendation was that this kind of arrangement, the framework that this bill introduces, not be advanced until that WTO process has been resolved. There is basic logic in that, I think.


But, coming back to what I said before, there are benefits in harmonised procurement arrangements for companies in Australia that want to take advantage of Commonwealth procurement opportunities and for Australian companies in other jurisdictions in other countries. I think, when we look at these things and we balance up those benefits, it's valuable and important to have regard to instances of this kind of effort in the past. I'm mindful that there were some procurement arrangements put in place under the Australian-US Free Trade Agreement that, on the face of it, would have given Australian companies greater opportunities to participate in American procurement processes and, yet, since that time, the evidence is that those opportunities haven't really eventuated.


In fact, the Australian Industry Group made a submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry into Australia's bilateral and regional trade agreements, and, in so doing, cited a survey they'd conducted of Australian exporters to the US five years after that free trade agreement came into effect. The survey found that 87 per cent of Australian exporters to the US took the view that the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was either of low effectiveness or no effectiveness in assisting their access to US government contracts. As we do these things, we must always keep track of, on the one hand, what they purport to achieve or secure for Australian companies and, on the other hand, what they actually deliver. As is the case with many aspects of trade agreements, they tend to overpromise and underdeliver. I think that's probably a relevant consideration with regard to other aspects of the TPP. I know that's been discussed elsewhere in this place this week.


It's important to note, as the previous member did, that when you change procurement rules those changes carry risks. There is very good reason for governments to have control, discretion and flexibility when it comes to government procurement. Government procurement is extraordinarily costly. In any given year, government procurement in Australia is worth something like $50 billion. In the 2016-17 year, Commonwealth procurement involved 64,000 separate contracts with a total value of $47 billion. In the 2014-15 year, the total value was closer to $60 billion. It's an extraordinary amount of money. First and foremost, we have to ensure that those procurement processes deliver the outcomes that we need. Inevitably, because they're being undertaken by government, what we're seeking to procure is of great importance to the wellbeing of Australians.


In addition to there being this imperative for procurement to achieve its ends and to do so at good value, there are other aspects of broad national and community wellbeing that governments should think about when they undertake procurement processes. One that has been mentioned here is being able to support small and medium businesses and recognise that, when it comes to Commonwealth procurement in particular, those kinds of enterprises do stand at a disadvantage to large companies—in some cases, large foreign companies. There is also the desire to use government procurement to achieve other ends: to build and sustain local industry and capacity, to address particular kinds of workforce shortcomings and those sorts of things.


The changes that this bill puts in place do contain exemptions for defence procurement. Again, that's an area where government wants to retain the ability to make choices with its mind squarely on our security needs. There are also some changes that allow some preferential, or you would say discriminatory, treatment in the interests of small and medium enterprises. In this case, any entity can have access to the changed procedures, the faster and cheaper procedures, but whether they end up being for the benefit of small and medium enterprises or for the greater benefit of larger companies—in some cases, foreign companies—is something we'll have to watch. In a submission on this issue, AFTINET made the following point:


There is much evidence to suggest that the main beneficiaries of open procurement markets are large global companies which have the capacity and economies of scale to monitor overseas procurement markets and tender for large government contracts. This means it is not a level playing field for most Australian companies.


I take the opportunity to make some general remarks on procurement more broadly. I think there are some process shortcomings with this bill around the timing and the way in which it's not consistent with relevant committee recommendations. I also think that procurement is a space in which the government has been less than active. There are a number of recommendations in the Buying into our future report that are yet to result in any real action, such as recommendation 2:


… that the Attorney-General's Department oversee the introduction and application of a procurement connected policy requiring Commonwealth agencies to evaluate suppliers' compliance with human rights regulation.


and recommendation 3:


… that the Department of Environment oversee the introduction and application of a procurement connected policy requiring Commonwealth agencies to evaluate the whole-of-life environmental sustainability of goods and services to be procured.


There are a range of way in which procurement processes can be designed and operated for the broad social welfare of Australia, and I'm not sure that's happening at the moment.


I have spoken before about the value of a debarment framework. Other countries make use of that sort of filter when it comes to any company—foreign companies in particular—that has been found to engage in any kind of exploitative, criminal or fraudulent conduct. Canada has such a framework. The OECD has noted this kind of thing on a number of occasions. It's not something we have here in Australia at this stage, and I think it's something we should consider.


On defence I would make the broad point that, while you can have exemptions in procurement arrangements that allow government to have a particularly free hand when making defence contracting provisions, the government of the day still has to use that free hand. When the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties inquired into and reported on the high-level agreement between Australia and France in relation to the Future Submarine program, it set out some high-level principles that should govern specific contracting arrangements in future, and I found it odd that the relevant provisions around achieving maximal Australian industry participation were pretty weak. The obligation put on France was that it require DCNS, the French prime, ensure Australian businesses participated in related work on an equal footing with French companies. I don't understand why, when you're paying $50 billion to a French prime for a massive multidecade project, you wouldn't require the participation of Australian companies to occur on a preferred basis, all other things being equal. If we're going to spend $90 billion on defence ships, at the end of the day we have to make sure a strong, secure, sustainable Australian shipbuilding industry comes out of that, which addresses the current problems we have in relation to how our defence procurement leads to related export opportunities. Most other countries do that much better than we do.


I note that Labor is active in this space and has done things. For instance, we talked about the requirement that one in 10 personnel in government contracts be apprentices. That's the kind of thing you can do through government procurement where you get both a good value-for-money, fit-for-purpose outcome and a broader social benefit. I was happy to meet this week with a delegation from AMWU pushing to get more young women involved in male dominated trades. That's another objective that could be met by properly framed procurement arrangements. To conclude, I support the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. It's good to see some procurement changes that have the potential to benefit small and medium-sized Australian enterprises. It could have been done via a better process than we've seen with this bill, and we'll have to watch the results.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:59):  The Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017 is one of the enabling pieces of legislation supporting the implementation of the TPP agreement. It will amend the Commonwealth Procurement Rules to include an appeals mechanism and ensure that the CPRs are consistent with free trade agreements like the TPP and the WTO's Agreement on Government Procurement. But I would be doing a disservice to the number of Australian small and medium businesses who contract their goods and services to the Australian government if I didn't highlight—and we're talking about very macro international government procurement here, but we do really need to focus on this—what's actually happening here on the domestic front in terms of government procurement. There are significant challenges for Australian small and medium businesses getting a piece of the action when it comes to government procurement here in Australia. Despite the perceptions that they're getting between 20 and 60 per cent of the work, they are not.


The Australian National Audit Office's December report on Australian government procurement contracting reporting gave an extremely good read. It was a very good insight into the procurement environment of Australian Commonwealth entities. In the 2016-17 period the overall procurement activity by Commonwealth entities was worth $47.4 billion, which was represented by 64,092 contract notices published on AusTender. The ANAO's report analysed financial years over a five-year period from 2012-13 through to 2016-17 and found the number of contracts to be 290,867 and their overall value to be close to $217 billion. That's a huge amount. Of these contracts, the highest number were, not surprisingly, from the Department of Defence: 123,319 contracts, worth almost $112 billion. The second-highest number of contracts was with the non-reporting agencies: 56,000 contracts, worth $33 billion.


Of the identified Commonwealth agencies, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection was the second-highest in the ANAO report, with 13,198 contracts awarded, with a value of $15 billion. This report shows us that procurement accounts for a huge amount of government spending—in the 2016-17 period, $47.4 billion, and over that five-year period, $217 billion, with Defence topping out at $112 billion. They are very significant numbers. As a result of that, Commonwealth procurement should provide a significant opportunity for Australian small and medium businesses. The Commonwealth Procurement Rules set a government commitment to sourcing at least 10 per cent of its procurement by value from SMEs. But this opportunity is balanced against the competition Australian SMEs face, as the Commonwealth Procurement Rules also allow for international businesses to compete on the same playing field.


The CPRs outline the government's procurement policy framework and the core objective. They ensure that entities achieve value for money in their procurement activities. But the CPRs provide guidance to ensure accountability and transparency in government contracts by requiring contracts over a certain threshold to be publicly reported by AusTender. Another requirement is for tenders not to be split or divided into separate parts to avoid the relevant procurement threshold. The ANAO's report assessed the level of compliance by government entities with this requirement and found noncompliance to be low, with as little as 1.6 per cent of 290,867 contracts having discrepancies. The ANAO's analysis identified 2,457 pairs of contracts where both contracts were with the same entity, each of the contracts was entered into with the same supplier, the contracts had a start date within the same quarter and the combined value of the two contracts was above the relevant threshold but each of the reported contract values was below the threshold.


The ANAO notes that 4,914 of the individual contracts would need to be reviewed to determine whether they were for discrete procurements, whether there were data errors, like duplication, or whether a single procurement had been split to avoid reporting against the procurement threshold. It is interesting that the highest proportion of potentially related contracts, 30 per cent, were for the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science—a Commonwealth entity that accounts for only 2.7 per cent of all contracts entered into between that five-year period of 2012 to 2013 and 2016 to 2017. However, on the other hand, the Department of Defence accounts for 42 per cent of the total number of contracts awarded across the same period, with less than 10 per cent of those contracts having any potential contract discrepancies. 


The one thing missing from the current CPRs is a complaints mechanism, and that is what this bill puts forward. This bill attempts to create a type of complaints mechanism that was recommended by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee in 2014. While the committee didn't specify a model, this change to Australia's procurement arrangements will let SMEs more easily hold the government to account. It designates the Federal Circuit Court to receive and review local and international supply complaints about breaches of the CPRs, but, aside from that, the government really hasn't explained what this new process will add alongside current review mechanisms. Currently, suppliers can make complaints to the procuring entity, the procurement coordinator within the Department of Finance, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Federal Court. The judicial review process set out in the bill will give small and medium-sized businesses located in regional areas greater access to justice, with local magistrates or circuit courts hearing their complaints rather than having to have the case listed in major or capital cities. 


While anything that makes undertaking business easier for small and medium-sized businesses is welcome, I have wondered whether this outcome was more by accident than by design. This bill amends the CPRs to include appeal mechanisms to ensure that Australia meets the requirements set out in future FTAs, including the TPP. The changes will also satisfy Australia's obligations as a proposed party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and will allow Australian businesses access to significant government procurement markets in other countries. Whether this international opportunity can be realised by Australia's small to medium-sized enterprises remains to be seen, but I sincerely hope it does. 


The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit held a public hearing into Australian government procurement contract reporting in August. Representatives of the 'big four'—PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte—all commented on the success of Australian SMEs in being awarded contracts through government panel arrangements. They were applauding themselves. EY noted: 


I understand from a recent report from the Digital Transformation Agency that in July 73 per cent of the contracts awarded through that mechanism—


the digital marketplace—


were to small and medium enterprises. 


When specifically asked about the effectiveness of panel arrangements in providing opportunities to the SMEs, it was noted that the panels are effective from a government buying perspective but that it can be very difficult for SMEs when trying to access a panel. Evidence provided at the JCPAA hearing noted:


For a larger firm, it wouldn't be unusual for a larger organisation to spend $20,000 or $30,000 just on getting into the panel agreement. That is not an amount that many SMEs are able to withstand, certainly if they need to bid into multiple panel agreements, especially when there is no guarantee of work at the end of it.


This is from PWC:


… the tendering environment in government is highly competitive, and so I do see that there are challenges for SMEs in respect of panel arrangements. But … we also try to work to put the best team forward so that we can be successful and that includes involving SMEs and other subcontractors. When we think about AusTender, AusTender does only record the prime contractor and so there could be … an improvement that could be made to disclose the other organisations that are … part of that consortium.


Before entering politics, I had my own microbusiness. I was mainly contracting to Defence and to government agencies for 10 years, so I know the challenges. I know the challenges of getting on a panel. I know the challenges of getting work once you are on the panel. I know how many highly skilled and experienced microbusinesses and small businesses are being forced to contract to primes and multinationals just to get work. I know that quite often when you're going on a panel, particularly when you are doing that first bid, you basically have to give years and years of financial records, and for a microbusiness that's a challenge—not that we don't have the records. But, really, do we need that much detail? Basically, you have to give half your body in blood and also your firstborn just to get onto a panel. That's been my experience.


My experience has also been that, as a micro, to get onto a panel you have to subcontract to a medium or small outfit, and in some cases you have to subcontract to a prime, a multinational. In that process you are completely at the mercy of those primes and those subcontractors. It wasn't me, but when I was contracting in Defence I knew of other consultants who were billing themselves out to the prime or to the subcontractor for $150 an hour, and they were being billed out at $500 an hour.


I made a speech in this place just recently about the fact that small and medium businesses, and micros particularly, provide extraordinary opportunities for government agencies. They are agile. They are flexible. They are innovative. They are creative. They can deliver efficiencies that larger outfits, particularly large multinational primes, just cannot deliver. They deliver an agility that those large multinational primes just cannot deliver. Our system, unfortunately, is geared to recognising and encouraging those large multinational primes and those large subcontractors at the expense of small and medium businesses and micros. This is particularly the case in regional and remote Australia. In my shadow defence portfolio, I do a lot of travelling to bases around the country, and I usually take the opportunity to go and speak to the local business chamber. They're tearing their hair out about the fact that they can't get a cut of the work. They can't get a cut of the significant Defence work arising from the base. That work tends to go to primes and subcontractors that are invariably based in the major centres on the eastern seaboard or potentially overseas. So those local businesses—I'm talking here about the local electrician, engineer or ICT person—just cannot get a look in in terms of the work.


We really need as a nation to be thinking creatively about how we can maximise the potential of our micros and our small and medium businesses and capture that innovation, agility and creativity that they offer, because at the moment, the way the procurement arrangements are established, they favour being big. They favour low risk, and big is usually low risk. They favour tried and tested solutions that are not necessarily as innovative as they could be. I know this from conversations I've had with some of the cybersecurity outfits that we have here in Canberra, world-class outfits. I'm thinking here about Penten. They're coming out with amazing innovations, particularly for mobile highly secure devices, allowing devices to be mobile and secure. Their mantra when I was leaving was: 'All we ask is that government agencies, particularly Defence, just buy one. Just have a go. Just have faith in us as a creative Australian outfit here in Canberra and as an innovator. Just buy one and just try it.' That's all they ask, particularly those in start-ups, in the innovation sector, in the cybersecurity sector, in virtual reality and in artificial intelligence: 'Just buy one. Take a punt. Develop and manage risk. Mitigate risk. Develop an appetite for risk that is mitigated and managed.' That's all they're asking.


So we are talking here about potential opportunities for micros and small and medium businesses. That said, I want opportunities not just internationally but also here domestically for micros and small and medium businesses in Australia. I want us to realise their potential. I want us to unlock their innovation. I want us to unlock their agility, their flexibility and their creativity.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:14):  This legislation, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, implements commitments that the Australian government is signing up to under the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and possibly the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement whereby, if an entity is aggrieved by the awarding of a government contract, that entity has an ability to appeal that decision through the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, which is an easier process than what currently exists. The appeal would challenge the government's compliance with its own Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which in turn must comply with Australian obligations under free trade agreements, other World Trade Organization obligations and the government procurement agreement which the government is currently negotiating.


The comprehensive and progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has been mainly dealt with via other enabling legislation that was debated in this place a few days ago. In that debate, Labor highlighted several shortfalls with the TPP. Firstly, there is the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution clauses which give overseas corporations rights that domestic corporations simply don't have. Secondly, there is the recognition of overseas skills that may not meet Australian standards. Thirdly, there is the ability to more easily recruit overseas labour in Australian workplaces. And, fourthly, there is the likelihood that pharmaceutical companies will have longer periods of monopoly over costly medicines.


What has not been talked about so much but should be of real concern to all Australians is that under the TPP and the government procurement agreement overseas entities can bid for Australian government work on an even playing field with Australian bidders. That means that, other than where exceptions are provided for within the agreements, Australia cannot give favourable treatment to local entities for government contracts. That may sound like a good idea, but when analysed it not always is. If the government does give preferential treatment, under this legislation the aggrieved entity also has an easier appeal process.


The enabling legislation for the TPP is currently before the other place, and the government procurement agreement has already been signed by some 47 countries around the world. Nine other countries, including China and Russia, are currently in accession talks to join the WTO GPA. In June 2018, Australia received support to join the GPA and it is expected that final approval will be granted in October of this year—that is, next month. So, from next month onwards, we may be a full member of the government procurement agreement that currently exists amongst 47 countries, with another nine also in the process of getting approval. At this point in time, Australia is not a signatory to the GPA, but it certainly may well be and, like the TPP, the GPA—that is, the government procurement agreement—has its own risks for Australia.


Members of the House would recall that it was only about a year ago that there was a Joint Select Committee on Government Procurement that looked at the issue of government procurement within Australia and how we could ensure that that procurement better benefited local Australian companies. There were recommendations at the end of that inquiry. Recommendation 8 of that committee report said:


The Committee recommends that, in negotiating future trade or World Trade Organisation agreements, Australia not enter into any commitments that undermine the Australian government's ability to support Australian businesses.


The government's response to the report was pretty weak, if I should say so. Indeed, with respect to recommendation 8, the government's response was:


Noted. The Australian Government enters into commitments in trade agreements that are aimed at supporting Australian business, in particular to open up new market access opportunities internationally and to put in place a framework of rules and standards that support transparency and competition on a level playing field.


In other words, it didn't support a process that would have ensured that Australian businesses would have got preferential treatment but, rather, the opposite.


In 2015-16 Commonwealth agencies reported entering into 70,338 contracts valued at $56.9 billion. My estimate—because accurate figures are simply not available—is that the $56.9 billion figure that the Commonwealth spends would probably be doubled if state and territory government procurement were also included. That means that in this country around $120 billion of government procurement is spent each year. That's $120 billion that could be directed to support Australian businesses and their employees and the economy of this country. Yet all the local benefits of that procurement are increasingly being chipped away by free trade agreements—and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and, soon to come, the World Trade Organisation's government procurement agreement.


Even with the exclusions and the reservations that are carved out within those agreements, every agreement weakens the Australian government's rights to favour Australian businesses. This legislation weakens those rights even further, because it makes it easier for aggrieved parties—and that includes the foreign entities—to challenge Australian contracts. In the past, there may have been a process—and I know that there is some process where the government does favour local businesses, particularly small and medium ones. But in the future, if the government chooses to do that and it has signed up to the GPA and the TPP, it will be easier for those overseas competitors to challenge the decision to award those contracts. The argument that what Australia may lose by being a signatory to such an agreement is more than offset by what Australia may gain from winning contracts in other countries is wishful thinking at best. The figures on the trade agreements that Australia has signed to date simply do not show a net gain to Australia, or there are no figures on which we can make accurate comparisons. The fact that there are no figures is of itself concerning, because it indicates that the claims about the benefits to Australia about these agreements are simply not met.


But the risk if Australia joins the government procurement agreement is even greater for this reason. Most of the agreements we have entered into to date rely heavily on the export of agricultural products and minerals in order to justify the benefits that are to come to Australia. However, with the GPA, no minerals and no agricultural products are to be exported to offset the possibility of overseas companies bidding for government contracts, which are in most cases services or the building of infrastructure. Additionally, whereas Australia acts ethically and complies with the spirit of trade agreements, that can't be said of all the countries we have signed agreements with. Indeed, I refer to the 47 countries from earlier on, with another nine to join the GPA in the future—possibly the near future. Governments in other places have been known to use what we call 'behind the border' barriers to make it much harder for overseas jurisdictions to continue doing business with them than it is for their local companies.


A good example of that is that it was only a couple of years ago that it was brought out that the Reserve Bank of Australia's subsidiary, Securency, had got caught up in a note-printing scandal. The reason it did was that we had a product that was wanted overseas—that is, the printing of banknotes—and we could do so better than anybody else. But the reality was that, in order to win the contracts, bribes had to be paid. That's what happened with the Securency scandal. That just highlights that, whilst Australia signs agreements and then ethically goes about complying with them, it's not always the case with overseas jurisdictions, which can use all sorts of tactics to continue to favour their local businesses. That is a concern with this legislation and, indeed, with all of the trade agreements that Australia has to date been a signatory to.


If Australians cannot rely on the Australian government to give preferential treatment to Australian businesses in the issuing of government contracts then they cannot expect any support whatsoever with respect to the trade agreements that the government is prepared to sign up to. With government contracts, the government is in total control of who gets the work and how it is awarded. So, if we can't rely on the Australian government for the $120-odd billion dollars of work that governments give out every year, then what hope do Australian businesses have of being supported by the government in respect to overseas contracts and in respect to the conditions within these trade agreements?


The government could easily fix the problem it has, where it says that it cannot give preferential treatment to Australian businesses, simply by broadening the meaning of the words 'value for money' in respect of the criteria used when it comes to the awarding of Australian government contracts. The definition of 'value for money' should include whole-of-life benefits that accrue when a contract is awarded here within Australia and that should also include the additional revenue that the government gets back in taxes both by the sale of the product and from the workers who work there and pay pay-as-you-go income tax and the like. It should be a whole-of-product cost and not simply the bottom-line price as to how the product can be delivered.


Unfortunately, that is not the case and that is why, in my view, Australia doesn't always get the best deal with respect to these contracts. Deputy Speaker Georganas, you would be fully aware of this with respect to the Rossi Boots factory that was in your electorate. It lost a contract simply because it was undercut by an overseas supplier. But if you had factored in all of the benefits to the local economy and put a dollar value to those factors, it would have been the case that Rossi Boots would have got the contract. It is not unreasonable and it is not unethical to include the whole-of-life costs of the product when a contract is awarded, whether it is a product or whether it is a service, and all of the income that accrues to the government should be factored into the final decision as to who gets it.


I haven't seen, and none of us have seen, the actual text of the government procurement agreement that the current government is negotiating. As with all of these agreements, we only ever see the text once it has been agreed to. But I would have thought that, at the very least, if we're going to enter into new agreements, we should—with that agreement—also carve out protections with respect to national treasures of artistic, historical and archaeological value and we should also carve out any measures for the economic advancement, health, welfare and social advancement of our Indigenous Australians. If that can be done in the GPA then I believe it ought to be done and we should be doing our best to ensure that it is done.


I finish with this comment, and it relates to a submission made by Dr Elizabeth Thurbon, who contacted the inquiry committee with respect to government procurement:


… World Trade Organization (WTO) membership requires governments to curtail the use of local content requirements, direct export subsidies and preferential government procurement policies (which involve using government purchasing to support local firms).


That quote, where Dr Thurbon makes it clear that we cannot give preferential treatment to Australian businesses, is concerning. I hope the government ensures that that is not the case with respect to new agreements that we enter into.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-09-19,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:30):  This bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, will make it easier for multinational corporations to take the Australian government to court over how the Australian government spends its money, and Labor and Liberal are about to join together with the Nationals to vote for it. The trickle-down troika of Labor, Liberal and big business is trucking on and saying, 'How can we change the rules to make it easier for big multinational companies to come and restrict how this government wants to spend its money?'


Why are we here debating this bill? We're debating this bill, in the words of the government—which have been echoed by the opposition—because Australia has recently signed up to the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a blueprint for giving corporations greater rights over everyday people, and also because the government wants to go off and negotiate another deal with the World Trade Organization that will make it easier for overseas companies to take the Australian government to court. The previous speaker has just said that he hasn't even seen the text of that, yet Labor and Liberal are about to pass this bill through this place.


This bill deals with what's called government procurement, which is about how government spends its money. We know that the government has some very deep pockets and can drive significant change and influence what Australia looks like by how it spends its money. The government can decide, when it awards contracts, that it is going to do so in a way that it thinks is of benefit to the local population. For example, it could say, 'We have a youth unemployment crisis in this country,' which we do, because under this government one in three young people either hasn't got a job or doesn't have enough hours of work, and it's at crisis levels that have not got better since the GFC, when we, together with the mining boom, effectively destroyed a huge number of manufacturing and entry-level jobs in this country. The government could, for example, if it wanted to—this government won't, but a good government could—say: 'We're going to spend our tax revenue to help young people get jobs and increase apprentices, and we're going to give priority to local businesses in doing that. We want to give some preferential treatment to local businesses, because we know that it's going to be better for the long run in this country if everyone has a sustainable, meaningful job.' You implement those things through your procurement policy. You set some rules about how government spends its money. When you do that, you can make the judgement calls about saying: 'Well, on paper, a bid from somewhere else might appear to be a couple of hundred thousand dollars cheaper, but by the time we factor in the people who will get a job if we give it to a local business and the avoided welfare costs of that, and the additional environmental benefits of doing it here locally and the ability to regulate local companies, perhaps on balance it's better.' That's why you have local procurement rules that can have preferential treatment built into them.


Big multinational companies don't like this, because they look at governments and they just see dollar signs. They see bank accounts and cheques being written for them. They want the right to come to countries, including Australia, and say: 'Well, hang on. We can sell you the product much more cheaply—perhaps because we're getting it made by someone in a country where we don't have to pay Australian wages—and we want the right to do that. We don't want to have our hands tied by you deciding that you might want to give preference to local businesses in some way.' So these big multinationals have got together and written a blueprint for a set of rules that will make it much more difficult for the Australian government to spend its money in a way that looks after its population. Those rules are found in things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and also in things like this procurement agreement being negotiated by the World Trade Organization.


What this bill does—and the reason that this gives us an entry ticket into the very bad TPP and the very bad WTO agreement—is allow a multinational company, when it hears about how the Australian government has decided to award a tender, to go to court to get an injunction to stop the government from proceeding. Why does it want to get an injunction, get compensation, run a claim against the government or take it to court? Because, if it can put a brake on the Australian government doing it, it can then go and lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization or with some other body under the TPP, and have it resolved in an international forum behind closed doors where they apply the rule of trickle-down economics and don't care about governments looking after their own population.


Who is that going to work to the benefit of? I've heard the government and even the opposition saying: 'Actually, this is all right, because it works the other way around. Australian companies will be able to do the same overseas.' Do you really think that an Australian small or medium-sized business is going to have the capacity to go to the WTO and lodge complaints against overseas governments? No. This isn't going to benefit local businesses accessing overseas markets. This is designed to give a leg-up to multinational corporations against Australian small and medium-sized businesses. When a company has won the tender, looks like it's going to win the tender or has rules that appear to give preference to local companies for some very, very good reasons, all of a sudden it's going to find itself in court—not against another Australian company, but against an overseas company with much deeper pockets—facing an injunction, facing a compensation order and facing a complaint through a different authority before they go to the court. These new rights that companies will have are only going to work to the disadvantage of local companies.


This is why, in part, when the Senate looked at this, many senators, including government senators, said: 'Don't pass this. At the very least, don't pass it until we know what the final rules are that we're signing up to as part of this WTO agreement. Don't pass it until we know whether the TPP contains protections.' Well, now we know that it doesn't contain adequate protections. We now know that the senators who looked at it and said, 'Look, hang on for a moment,' were right to say that. Now we've got the TPP in front of us. We know that under the TPP the government did not remove the so-called ISDS provisions, the ability for companies to take the Australian government to court. Jacinda Ardern, over in New Zealand, had the good sense to negotiate some get-out clauses for New Zealand, but the Australian government did not. The Australian government doesn't care, so it signed up to these awful deals. It doesn't care that it's going to give corporations much more significant rights.


We now know that these deals have some huge traps in them. That's why the Greens think we shouldn't be signing up to them. That's why half of the Labor Party thinks that we shouldn't be signing up to them. That's why civil society thinks we shouldn't be signing up to them. That's why the ACTU—and the member for Batman when she was the head of the ACTU—put in a submission to the Senate inquiry to say, 'Don't rush ahead with this, because we can only see that this is going to disadvantage local businesses.' And they were right.


We've got an opportunity now to say: 'Let's park this bill until the opposition and everyone else gets to see the full text of this agreement.' They're coming in here, complaining they haven't. 'Let's park it until we've gone back and renegotiated the TPP to include some better protections for labour and the environment, and to remove the ability for corporations to sue governments.' That is the opposition's policy, so it should be unobjectionable to say: 'We're not going to rush this bill through until we've gone back and negotiated a better deal.'


So, as an amendment to the amendment moved by the opposition, I move the following:


That all words after ""whilst"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House appreciates the significance of this measure, the House defers further consideration of the bill until the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement contain:


(1) better protections for labour rights, the environment, and local business; and


(2) no investor-state dispute settlement provisions"".


I'm moving that amendment, which the member for Denison is going to second, because it is no good to sit in your party room and say, 'We don't agree with the TPP,' or, 'We don't agree with these deals that the government is negotiating secretly,' but then, when you have the opportunity on the floor of parliament to do something about it, when you've got the most precious thing that the Australian people trusted you with when they elected you—which is your vote in this place—go and vote with the government to fast-track this bill through. We should not be pushing this bill through when we absolutely do not need to. This bill has been sitting around for a while. It could very reasonably sit and wait until the TPP has gone back and been renegotiated.


I'm very sceptical of the Labor Party's view that it somehow is going to be in this magical position where it can renegotiate the TPP, if and when it gets elected—and I do hope there's a change of government at this election. But the idea that Labor's putting out there, that we can go back and renegotiate it, is fanciful. That's why we've separately moved to park the TPP agreement as well. We should not be signing up to that. But it's crystal clear that, even if you think that's right, even if you think that the new Prime Minister is going to be a negotiator who's going to be able to go back and take all these terrible clauses out of the TPP, then we should not pass this bill now. Wait until all of that has happened. So I'm moving what is a very simple, reasonable and unobjectionable amendment to park consideration of this until we have that opportunity.


I must say, by way of comparison, that I personally wish that the government were willing to allow people the freedom of movement to the same extent that they're allowing it for multinational corporations. If you're some person who has suffered torture, war or famine and you decide that you want to come to this country to make a better life here and to contribute, this government locks you up. Even if you are an 11-year-old child, this government, with the support of the Labor Party, will lock you behind wire until you no longer have the will to live. As we've heard this week, 11- and 12-year-olds are now saying that they no longer have the will to live, and a 12-year-old girl has reportedly set herself on fire in a camp under our watch. So, if you're a person who wants nothing more than to come here and seek a better life, you get locked up until you die or you kill yourself. But if you're a multinational company wanting to come here, Labor and the Liberals roll out the red carpet and say: 'What protections would you like us to remove? You're welcome here. The door is open. Don't worry; if you think there are any pesky rules that we've set up that might give benefits to the local Australian population, feel free to take us to court.'


What the government and the opposition don't seem to understand is that we keep playing by rules that no-one else plays by, in the hope that somehow it's going to result in the economy magically growing. Yet speaker after speaker from the Labor Party comes in here and says, correctly, that there's no evidence that these deals deliver any meaningful benefit for the Australian population at all. It's not often that the Greens and the Productivity Commission are on the same page, but they are on this one. They've said that the tangible benefits of these deals are overstated and that we should know about them before we sign up.


So let's find out first, before we sign up. Before we give a blank cheque, let's park this bill. I am going to oppose it, but I imagine others might support it. At the very least, everyone should agree to park it until we have gone back and put some things in those multinational agreements that reflect what the Australian people want and, probably, what the majority of this parliament want as well. It is time to stand up, use the vote and support this amendment. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Is the amendment seconded? 




Mr Wilkie:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment to the proposed amendment that all words after 'Whilst' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment to the proposed amendment be agreed to.

"Katter, Bob, MP",KAP,2018-09-19,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:45):  I rise to speak to the original bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, but, obviously, that has gone sideways. I have risen again and again on this issue. I have a unique position in this place, because I have been a member of parliament for longer than anyone else in Australian history, with the exception of Billy Hughes—not good company to be in, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you. I have seen the complete destruction of manufacturing in my country, and, if you go back to my speeches from 35 years ago, I was probably advocating a movement towards free trade, but you have to judge policy upon its outcomes. 


I wrote a book, and some would argue it was based, to a very large extent, around the views of Edward Theodore, who Malcolm Fraser said was one of his two heroes and who Paul Keating said was one of his two heroes. I have a picture of Jack McEwen and Ted Theodore on my wall. I am not an important person. I'm not the Prime Minister of Australia; I am a relative nobody, but I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you couldn't find three more unalike people on the planet as those three people. But they agree on one thing. The whole existence of the Labor Party was to get arbitration, which has been removed by free markets, undermined for the worker and completely removed for the farmers. So we have been left to the tender mercies of Woolworths and Coles and the foreign marketplace, where every farmer on earth gets 40 per cent of his income from the government—and we get none of our income from the government. So that is real fun. But, you have to be judged on your outcomes. You have completely closed down the motor vehicle industry. You have completely closed down the whitegoods industry. Every single thing that you use in your house, from an air conditioner to a washing machine to a fridge, is now produced overseas. 


I remember vividly when Keating said: 'We are going to be the most free market economy on earth.' That was one promise that he did keep! It was six o'clock in the morning. I picked up a boot and threw it at the wall. I thought, 'From now on, I have to look after the workers in this country. What does this imbecile think? Do we go down to slave labour wage levels, give massive subsidies like our competitors, or close down industry in Australia?' They were the alternatives. Clearly, we were never going to go to subsidies. So we had two alternatives, not three, and one was to close down the industries here. So we closed down the industries. Were you surprised? That morning I knew that, if he were fair dinkum, every industry in this country was going to be closed down. Your motor vehicle industry has gone. Your whitegoods industry has gone. Your glass industry has gone. Your textile, footwear and clothing industry has gone. Your steel industry is about 60 per cent gone, and soon it will be gone completely. Your cement industry has gone—well, 40 per cent gone, but soon it will be gone completely. I was referred to by Keating as the 'last socialist' left in this place. I don't know. What the hell.


When QCL, Queensland Cement and Lime, was in a bit of trouble—we could see that it would be mopped up by a foreign corporation, and the entire cement market in Queensland would not be buying cement produced in Queensland but would be buying cement being produced overseas—we went in and bought the company. If you said to Bjelke-Petersen that you were going the pay $1,000 million to a foreign corporation to build a rail line into the Galilee he would have had you put in a lunatic asylum. But now we're the people being put in a lunatic asylum.


Where is the benefit? I have waited for a single speaker from that side, or from this side, to point out a single benefit. They all got up and said 'rural industries'. If there is one person in this place that represents rural industries it is me. There is no doubt about that one. I don't think anyone would contest that one. I represent the biggest agricultural industry in Australia. I represent about a sixth of the Australian beef industry. No-one represents more beef cattle than I do, and we are down 23 per cent. After this drought we are going to be down even further in our numbers. The beef industry has to help the sugar industry—one of the four giants of the Australian agricultural economy. We're now 17 per cent. In fact, we're closing a sugar mill every three or four years in Australia. Soon we will have no sugar industry at all. It didn't help the sugar industry. Did it help the dairy industry, which is one of the big four? Their production is down 31 per cent, so it most certainly didn't help the dairy industry.


The next one is the wool industry. This industry had carried the Australian economy for 160 years. In the year that Keating chose to deregulate it, it was bigger than coal. It was the biggest export commodity this country had. It was the biggest and greatest asset this nation had, and Keating destroyed it. These people participated in the destruction. Seventy-two per cent of our sheep industry has gone. There are your big four in agriculture. It didn't help them. Who did it help? Please, stand up and tell me who it helped.


When I walk into this place I walk past a magnificent portrait of the first member for Kennedy, Charles McDonald. If you ever watch me walk past I never walk past without saying, 'Good on you, Charlie.'


When we got arbitration, what the government did was allow blackbirding, indentured labour in the sugar industry, and they allowed coolies, indentured labour in the mining industry. They said, 'Take that one, Mr Trade Union Movement, Mr Theodore and all your mignons. Take that one between the eyeballs.'


A bloke on a bicycle in a place called Chillagoe north of Cairns had a dream that we weren't going to live like slaves any longer. He lived not far away from Mount Mulligan, where 72 human beings were blown to pieces in the Kennedy electorate. Seventy-two human beings were blown to pieces in one explosion. In my hometown, Charters Towers, 23 people were blown to pieces in a matter of seconds. This is what was going on. We fought the fight. He had this dream this he could actually make it better. Do you know what he did? Within seven years he had taken over control of Queensland and said: 'Righto. You blokes did that, so what we are going to do is take all your plantations off you and hand them over to the cane cutters, the people who actually work it and actually live here in North Queensland. We are going to take all your pastoral runs off you, you big foreign corporations, and we are going to hand it over to Queenslanders.'


There is a political message here. Do you know that the people that lived outside of Brisbane loved that bloke so much so that for 56 straight years the labour movement won every single seat outside of Brisbane in almost every single election. When you do the right thing, people see that you are doing the right thing. With Bjelke-Petersen, every single election we increased our majority. That was because we strained every muscle and nerve and sinew to see that the people of Queensland owned the assets. We owned the electricity industry. We owned the railways. We owned the ports. And—it would be unthinkable—we owned the cement and lime company that was producing cement in Queensland. I don't know how many things we owned, but the people of Queensland owned them, and we produced from them and, yes, we enabled foreign corporations to come in and use those facilities, but we charged like a wounded bull. They said that sometimes our rail charges were a bit high. Well, I didn't notice.


The famous Sir Leo Hielscher is the greatest Treasurer and financier the country has ever seen by a long way. Two of the three biggest bridges in Australia are named the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, and quite rightly so. I think at his address last weekend he had five ex-treasurers, one or two ex-premiers and about seven or eight ex-cabinet ministers. He's one of the most famous men in Australian history and he is the architect of the economic miracle which was Queensland. It was wonderful to hear that man speak. He took a state where we had chooks in the backyard—he had chooks in the backyard; my family had chooks in the backyard. We were poor people; everyone in Queensland was poor. But we suddenly became rich because we owned the assets; we put government money into developing those assets. We didn't build pleasure domes on the South Bank of the Brisbane River. We built railway lines where the men with the hard hats and the hard hands could go and earn a big quid. If they got off their backside in the city and were prepared to go out there and work hard, they made big money. And I'm proud to say that the workers in the state of Queensland were the most highly paid workers in the world when the government fell in 1990. And they could only bring us down by backdoor, backstabbing methods.


I have written a best-selling history book. It was published by Murdoch Books, and it was launched by Kevin Rudd no less, with over 1,000 people in Sydney. We turned away 200. In Melbourne we had 750 people when it was launched by Barrie Cassidy. That was not my choice; that was Murdoch Books' choice. I'm proud to be associated with both those men. When they write a history book of this period, they will spit upon all you people sitting over on that side and all you people sitting over on the other side. When you read my history book and you read about those people who reduced us by 72 human beings who were blown to death at Mount Mulligan and 23 who were blown to death at Mount Leyshon—and my own son worked at Mount Leyshon—you spit upon those people. When people listened to Sir Niemeyer from the Bank of England instead of listening to our own people and we had the worst depression of any country on Earth, they spit upon those people. If you read that book and that history of Australia, you'll say there were great men and there were little pissants.


God help the people in this place when the history books are written, because this period has presided over the most disastrous destruction of the Australian economy. This country now has only two things left that we can export from two quarries, an iron ore quarry and a coal quarry. Let me be very specific: more than 50 per cent of our income comes from two quarries. That's all we've got left. And quarries run out. I'm a mining man; I've been in mining all my life. Eventually your mine runs out. What have you got when the mine runs out? You've got nothing. Let me just say that they're at about $120 billion to $130 billion a year. The next item down is maybe gold or aluminium or beef, which is at $11 billion. You've got nothing left. All you've got is two quarries. That's all you've got left. And who did it? And what are you doing today? Are you apologising? Are you reversing it? No, you're doing just the opposite. I said it again and again about the car industry.


I hope that somewhere in my country will rise up in righteous anger and destroy the people who are in this place. My brothers in North Queensland, where the last explosion came from, have a look at the figures; have a look at the One Nation and KAP figures. We're ready for the explosion up there, I can tell you. And we'll lead the same as we did last time. But, when that explosion occurs, one of the first things to do is to restore the motor vehicle industry, which is as far away from me as the South Pole. But I love my country. One of the greatest stories in the history of Australia is the story of Laurence Hartnett and Ben Chifley, who created the car industry. It is so easy to do that, because all you've got to do is say, 'All motor vehicles purchased under a government contract will be Australian made.' That's all you've got to do. But the right to do that—that little piece of sovereignty—is being removed, to their eternal shame, by the ALP and the Liberal Party. So that right is being removed by those people. And I promise you, you will be recorded in the history books.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer—Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories) (18:00):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate on the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. The bill implements recommendation 11 of the July 2014 report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into Commonwealth procurement procedures that the Department of Finance establish an independent and effective complaints mechanism for procurement processes.


The bill ensures that regional suppliers and small and medium enterprises have timely access to justice to raise complaints about procurement processes. The bill also complies with international trade obligations to maintain an impartial and independent body where suppliers can raise complaints about government procurement processes and be awarded remedies and compensations. It will give Australia the opportunity to access the government procurement benefits of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP-11.


By designating the Federal Circuit Court with concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court, the courts can decide which is the most appropriate court to deal with the matter. This will allow complaints to be heard in a timely manner. The bill specifies a 10-day time frame for suppliers to make an application to the courts to encourage timely efforts to resolve any concerns about a procurement process. However, the bill also provides a flexibility for the courts to allow a longer period for applications if there are genuine reasons for the delay. The courts may order remedies to preserve a supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement, but will not be able to overturn awarded contracts. Where a procurement cannot be delayed, the courts will be able to order compensation limited to the costs or damages which occurred in the preparation of the tender or in bringing the complaint or both.


Before a complaint reaches the court, the supplier must first complain to the Commonwealth entity responsible for conducting the procurement. The entity will investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint with the supplier. Suppliers must provide evidence of their complaint, including attempting to resolve the complaint with the procuring entity in the first instance. Regional suppliers and small and medium enterprises will now have timely access to justice to raise complaints about procurement processes and seek remedies. The Federal Circuit Court is the only court at the federal level with a continuous presence outside major capital cities. Suppliers in rural and regional Australia will have easier access to have their complaints heard without the need to attend major cities.


I will briefly correct some errors made by speakers during the second reading debate. First, I note that the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement is already publicly available. It has, in fact, been in the public domain since 2014 on the WTO website. We're not negotiating a new text. Indeed, 47 countries are already members. If some members have not seen the agreement, it is because they haven't looked. Second, in relation to value-for-money assessments under the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, the procuring official must consider relevant financial and non-financial costs, which include whole-of-life costs. I also note that, in 2017, the Procurement Rules were changed to take into account economic benefit of a tender to the Australian economy.


The government does not support the second reading amendment proposed by the opposition criticising the level of opportunity for participation by Australian business in the Commonwealth procurement. I inform the House that Australian suppliers are already well represented in government procurement, with over 95 per cent, by number, of contracts being awarded to suppliers in Australia in 2016-17. As much as $40.8 billion of the $47.3 billion contracts were with suppliers operating from an Australian address. The government also does not support the amendment proposed by Mr Bandt, the member for Melbourne. There is an important advantage to Australia being an early entrant to the TPP.


Once again, I thank all members for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House, and I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment to the proposed amendment that all words after 'whilst' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. So the immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne be agreed to.




A division having been called and the bells having been rung—




The SPEAKER:  As there are fewer than five members on the side for the ayes in this division, I declare the question negatived in accordance with standing order 127. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.


Question negatived, Mr Bandt, Mr Katter and Mr Wilkie voting aye.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Rankin be agreed to.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-09-19,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:30):  I rise to speak in favour of the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. After I elaborate on the details of this very sensible bill, I want to make some broader comments about Commonwealth procurement policy. The bill establishes jurisdiction for the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, rather than just the Federal Court of Australia, in regard to matters of dispute within the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. It will vest power with the Federal Circuit Court to grant injunctions and to order payment of financial compensation when the procurement rules are contravened. It comes out of a response to the 2014 Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee's assessment and recommendations to create an independent and effective complaints mechanism for people supplying to the Commonwealth government and various entities. It also arises out of the need for us to comply with our obligations under World Trade Organization agreements and our free trade agreements.


Australia is also making sure that small and medium enterprises in regional, rural and metropolitan Australia have an avenue through the Federal Circuit Court, which is the only court which has a continuous presence in regional Australia where many of these businesses reside and produce goods which are procured by Commonwealth entities. As I mentioned, the Federal Circuit Court will be able to receive complaints from both local and international suppliers who feel that the Commonwealth Procurement Rules have been breached. And it is that which triggers the ability for them to issue an injunction, correct things or order financial compensation.


In introducing this bill, the government doesn't want to generate a so-called lawyerfest. There are many sensible requirements under the bill for the supplier to engage directly with the Commonwealth entity in the first instance in relation to their complaint and to do it in a timely fashion—within 10 days and in writing. The compensation is limited to reasonable costs for the preparation of the tender and/or the costs related to the challenge. The Federal Circuit Court, as I mentioned, will be much more accessible than the higher court because it does sit regularly around regional Australia, and, as I said, many of the people supplying to Commonwealth entities are based in regional Australia. Their raw products and their production are in regional Australia—not exclusively, of course, but it will be a much better fit. It will make it more accessible and more timely, and it will allow much more transparency because of the time constraints that one has to comply with. Evidence of the breach and evidence of the attempts to resolve the matter with the Commonwealth entity must be provided in these disputes. There is facility and a requirement to do this so that the supplier can continue to supply during this dispute resolution. And the remedies and compensations are going to be the solution, rather than just leaving matters in a continual state of litigation.


I have to state that, to qualify to go before this dispute resolution mechanism through the Federal Circuit Court, contracts have to be eligible. For the procurement contract to be covered by this legislation, both the first and second divisions of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules must apply. There are many exemptions under the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, including on the basis that the procurement is essential for maintaining international peace and security, for human health, or for protecting essential security facilities or national artistic, historical or archaeological treasures. There are exceptions for specific defence procurements and specific free trade agreement conditions. The accountable authority may issue a public interest certificate where the public interest or safety would be compromised by ceasing the procurement—that is, if something is a really important facility or product, say a bit of equipment that is essential, you don't want to have loss of delivery of that just because you're entering into a dispute resolution. In this case, if a public interest certificate is issued, it will allow for the delivery of the goods to continue whilst the issue in dispute is sorted out.


The Commonwealth Procurement Rules set aside 10 per cent of Commonwealth procurement across all entities that must go to small and medium-sized enterprises. I would like to comment on some of these Commonwealth Procurement Rules, because it's hard to separate the rules from this dispute resolution process and the bill that we're discussing today. I think the 10 per cent should be an absolute minimum. I think all Commonwealth entities, whether they're corporate government entities, non-corporate government entities or Commonwealth government departments, should be looking at the value that small and medium-sized enterprises deliver when you look at the holistic value-for-money principle, which is mentioned in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. I also note that there is a propensity among Commonwealth government departments, corporate and non-corporate government entities to take the easy way out and go straight to a prime contractor. The reality, though, is that in many instances the prime contractor isn't the actual builder or supplier of the goods; they just act as a giant middleman. They can organise plenty of other tier 2 suppliers of equipment, goods or services—but really, if we're going to try to deliver on the provisions in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules regarding value for money, I put it to the House that it's much better value to go to the direct supplier of the good or service, rather than doing everything through a prime. There are, obviously, some things that are too big for a small or medium-sized enterprise, or a large mid-level enterprise but, really, if you look below the tier 1 contractors, for all these procurements you will see a lot more capability used than if it is all done through a prime.


The other comment I would like to make is that nowhere in the value-for-money principles is there a mention of assessing the value to other Commonwealth, state or local government entities that benefit when a Commonwealth entity makes a decision about value for money. The feature that I want to highlight is that, if Commonwealth entities are procuring goods from local Australian businesses, there will be a return benefit, not necessarily in that particular department but in Treasury, or in Finance. If we procure from Australian providers, we get a GST payment or PAYE tax receipts. State governments receive payroll tax receipts. Local governments—if it's a local provider of services—will have many more businesses paying rates. We who have the responsibility for unemployment services and retraining will have reduced unemployment costs if we consider the value of procuring goods from local Australian companies rather than international suppliers. Think of all the retraining and stimulus packages in various parts of the country—these replace companies that used to rely on government contracts but now have people out of a job and are no longer viable, because they haven't got their base, large, long-term government supply contracts.


We also miss out on the multiplier effect. If we purchase goods and services from local or domestically-based companies, we get a local economic multiplier effect. This is particularly the case if the local supplier is in a regional community. Receiving a long-term government contract is, essentially, much more valuable to a local company—whether it's in paper goods, uniforms, boots or high-tech IT services—than giving grants and other stimulus payments. Rather than going to the big primes, we have a burgeoning IT industry with a lot of capability here. I talk about other IT services like cloud computing. We could have that all based here with Australian based companies that pay their taxes here, rather than with multinationals. As we know, we've had a whole tranche of legislation proposed to avoid all the issues of cost shifting—that is, instead of paying tax here in Australia, paying tax in low-taxing jurisdictions.


We also need to make allowance for the fact that a lot of the people who are supplying goods and services, including built and processed products, to the Commonwealth are hamstrung in Australia by high energy costs which overseas people and suppliers aren't necessarily subject to. We also have very high environmental standards in this country. When you're producing goods in Australia, in many cases, costs are higher because we do look after the environment. These added costs come from—mainly—federal and state legislation, particularly some of our energy market rules, and our environmental policies that have put up the costs of electricity and energy. If we're putting these extra burdens onto Australian producers and suppliers to the Commonwealth, it seems only fair and reasonable to account for that in the value-for-money equation.


Getting back to this bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, it will make it a lot easier for suppliers—local, regional and metropolitan suppliers—to make a complaint. It will allow the supply of critical goods and services to continue while the complaint is sorted out. There are exemptions, as I mentioned, with free trade agreements and defence contracts that must be supplied. But, overall, this is a very good piece of legislation. Legislation that makes things easier is what we're all about in the coalition. Our coalition government is trying to make it easier for all companies to do business with the Commonwealth, and this initiative will go a long way towards making that happen.


I commend this bill to the House. As I said, Commonwealth procurement in the value-for-money decision matrix must take account of value outside the department or entity that is actually doing the procurement. Entities should look at a whole-of-government return benefit, and at the benefit to the whole of the local, regional and national economy from procuring goods and services from local providers. I commend this bill to the House.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,2
"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (16:44):  I am glad for the opportunity to speak on this bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, and to speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. I acknowledge the work that he has done and continues to do in this space. Government procurement in Australia is very important for a number of reasons. Chiefly, we want to get procurement right. We want procurement to achieve its ends. We want the outcomes of government contracts to be fit for purpose and to be good value. We also want procurement processes to be accessible to Australian businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, which face greater difficulties because of their scale when it comes to dealing with bureaucratic processes and when it comes to dealing with Commonwealth Procurement Rules.


There are some aspects of this bill that appear beneficial. They give access to the Federal Circuit Court, a magistrates court, rather than the full Federal Court for resolving issues or taking up what seem to be breaches of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules in a way that will be much less time-consuming and much less costly. So, on the face of it, that's good for small and medium enterprises.


But it's worth considering where this bill comes from and why we are going into it in this way and at this time. It is related to the comprehensive and progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's part of our obligations under that agreement. So it's important to see that what we really are doing is making some changes to our procurement framework that are balanced by changes that will be made elsewhere. The concept is that not just that small and medium businesses in Australia will benefit from the changes to our own Procurement Rules but Australian companies more broadly will benefit from similar changes elsewhere where Australian companies want to be involved in procurement processes that are conducted by other governments. Whether that is actually achieved or not is an open question. I'll come back to that in the context of some of our other trade agreements.


The timing of this bill is interesting, and what it seeks to achieve is interesting, if you look at the context of what's been happening in this space over the last little while. Australia is in the process of acceding to the government procurement agreement framework that exists under the WTO. We have been going through that process for some time. In fact, my understanding is that the Australian government position with respect to our accession to that agreement is going before the relevant committee in October. It is passing strange that we're entering into the framework covered by this bill at the same time that there's an equivalent set of mechanisms and measures covered under the WTO GPA in prospect. Certainly, when the Joint Select Committee on Government Procurement handed down its report, titled Buying into our future: review of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules,a bit more than a year ago, last June, its recommendation was that this kind of arrangement, the framework that this bill introduces, not be advanced until that WTO process has been resolved. There is basic logic in that, I think.


But, coming back to what I said before, there are benefits in harmonised procurement arrangements for companies in Australia that want to take advantage of Commonwealth procurement opportunities and for Australian companies in other jurisdictions in other countries. I think, when we look at these things and we balance up those benefits, it's valuable and important to have regard to instances of this kind of effort in the past. I'm mindful that there were some procurement arrangements put in place under the Australian-US Free Trade Agreement that, on the face of it, would have given Australian companies greater opportunities to participate in American procurement processes and, yet, since that time, the evidence is that those opportunities haven't really eventuated.


In fact, the Australian Industry Group made a submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry into Australia's bilateral and regional trade agreements, and, in so doing, cited a survey they'd conducted of Australian exporters to the US five years after that free trade agreement came into effect. The survey found that 87 per cent of Australian exporters to the US took the view that the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was either of low effectiveness or no effectiveness in assisting their access to US government contracts. As we do these things, we must always keep track of, on the one hand, what they purport to achieve or secure for Australian companies and, on the other hand, what they actually deliver. As is the case with many aspects of trade agreements, they tend to overpromise and underdeliver. I think that's probably a relevant consideration with regard to other aspects of the TPP. I know that's been discussed elsewhere in this place this week.


It's important to note, as the previous member did, that when you change procurement rules those changes carry risks. There is very good reason for governments to have control, discretion and flexibility when it comes to government procurement. Government procurement is extraordinarily costly. In any given year, government procurement in Australia is worth something like $50 billion. In the 2016-17 year, Commonwealth procurement involved 64,000 separate contracts with a total value of $47 billion. In the 2014-15 year, the total value was closer to $60 billion. It's an extraordinary amount of money. First and foremost, we have to ensure that those procurement processes deliver the outcomes that we need. Inevitably, because they're being undertaken by government, what we're seeking to procure is of great importance to the wellbeing of Australians.


In addition to there being this imperative for procurement to achieve its ends and to do so at good value, there are other aspects of broad national and community wellbeing that governments should think about when they undertake procurement processes. One that has been mentioned here is being able to support small and medium businesses and recognise that, when it comes to Commonwealth procurement in particular, those kinds of enterprises do stand at a disadvantage to large companies—in some cases, large foreign companies. There is also the desire to use government procurement to achieve other ends: to build and sustain local industry and capacity, to address particular kinds of workforce shortcomings and those sorts of things.


The changes that this bill puts in place do contain exemptions for defence procurement. Again, that's an area where government wants to retain the ability to make choices with its mind squarely on our security needs. There are also some changes that allow some preferential, or you would say discriminatory, treatment in the interests of small and medium enterprises. In this case, any entity can have access to the changed procedures, the faster and cheaper procedures, but whether they end up being for the benefit of small and medium enterprises or for the greater benefit of larger companies—in some cases, foreign companies—is something we'll have to watch. In a submission on this issue, AFTINET made the following point:


There is much evidence to suggest that the main beneficiaries of open procurement markets are large global companies which have the capacity and economies of scale to monitor overseas procurement markets and tender for large government contracts. This means it is not a level playing field for most Australian companies.


I take the opportunity to make some general remarks on procurement more broadly. I think there are some process shortcomings with this bill around the timing and the way in which it's not consistent with relevant committee recommendations. I also think that procurement is a space in which the government has been less than active. There are a number of recommendations in the Buying into our future report that are yet to result in any real action, such as recommendation 2:


… that the Attorney-General's Department oversee the introduction and application of a procurement connected policy requiring Commonwealth agencies to evaluate suppliers' compliance with human rights regulation.


and recommendation 3:


… that the Department of Environment oversee the introduction and application of a procurement connected policy requiring Commonwealth agencies to evaluate the whole-of-life environmental sustainability of goods and services to be procured.


There are a range of way in which procurement processes can be designed and operated for the broad social welfare of Australia, and I'm not sure that's happening at the moment.


I have spoken before about the value of a debarment framework. Other countries make use of that sort of filter when it comes to any company—foreign companies in particular—that has been found to engage in any kind of exploitative, criminal or fraudulent conduct. Canada has such a framework. The OECD has noted this kind of thing on a number of occasions. It's not something we have here in Australia at this stage, and I think it's something we should consider.


On defence I would make the broad point that, while you can have exemptions in procurement arrangements that allow government to have a particularly free hand when making defence contracting provisions, the government of the day still has to use that free hand. When the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties inquired into and reported on the high-level agreement between Australia and France in relation to the Future Submarine program, it set out some high-level principles that should govern specific contracting arrangements in future, and I found it odd that the relevant provisions around achieving maximal Australian industry participation were pretty weak. The obligation put on France was that it require DCNS, the French prime, ensure Australian businesses participated in related work on an equal footing with French companies. I don't understand why, when you're paying $50 billion to a French prime for a massive multidecade project, you wouldn't require the participation of Australian companies to occur on a preferred basis, all other things being equal. If we're going to spend $90 billion on defence ships, at the end of the day we have to make sure a strong, secure, sustainable Australian shipbuilding industry comes out of that, which addresses the current problems we have in relation to how our defence procurement leads to related export opportunities. Most other countries do that much better than we do.


I note that Labor is active in this space and has done things. For instance, we talked about the requirement that one in 10 personnel in government contracts be apprentices. That's the kind of thing you can do through government procurement where you get both a good value-for-money, fit-for-purpose outcome and a broader social benefit. I was happy to meet this week with a delegation from AMWU pushing to get more young women involved in male dominated trades. That's another objective that could be met by properly framed procurement arrangements. To conclude, I support the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. It's good to see some procurement changes that have the potential to benefit small and medium-sized Australian enterprises. It could have been done via a better process than we've seen with this bill, and we'll have to watch the results.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:59):  The Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017 is one of the enabling pieces of legislation supporting the implementation of the TPP agreement. It will amend the Commonwealth Procurement Rules to include an appeals mechanism and ensure that the CPRs are consistent with free trade agreements like the TPP and the WTO's Agreement on Government Procurement. But I would be doing a disservice to the number of Australian small and medium businesses who contract their goods and services to the Australian government if I didn't highlight—and we're talking about very macro international government procurement here, but we do really need to focus on this—what's actually happening here on the domestic front in terms of government procurement. There are significant challenges for Australian small and medium businesses getting a piece of the action when it comes to government procurement here in Australia. Despite the perceptions that they're getting between 20 and 60 per cent of the work, they are not.


The Australian National Audit Office's December report on Australian government procurement contracting reporting gave an extremely good read. It was a very good insight into the procurement environment of Australian Commonwealth entities. In the 2016-17 period the overall procurement activity by Commonwealth entities was worth $47.4 billion, which was represented by 64,092 contract notices published on AusTender. The ANAO's report analysed financial years over a five-year period from 2012-13 through to 2016-17 and found the number of contracts to be 290,867 and their overall value to be close to $217 billion. That's a huge amount. Of these contracts, the highest number were, not surprisingly, from the Department of Defence: 123,319 contracts, worth almost $112 billion. The second-highest number of contracts was with the non-reporting agencies: 56,000 contracts, worth $33 billion.


Of the identified Commonwealth agencies, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection was the second-highest in the ANAO report, with 13,198 contracts awarded, with a value of $15 billion. This report shows us that procurement accounts for a huge amount of government spending—in the 2016-17 period, $47.4 billion, and over that five-year period, $217 billion, with Defence topping out at $112 billion. They are very significant numbers. As a result of that, Commonwealth procurement should provide a significant opportunity for Australian small and medium businesses. The Commonwealth Procurement Rules set a government commitment to sourcing at least 10 per cent of its procurement by value from SMEs. But this opportunity is balanced against the competition Australian SMEs face, as the Commonwealth Procurement Rules also allow for international businesses to compete on the same playing field.


The CPRs outline the government's procurement policy framework and the core objective. They ensure that entities achieve value for money in their procurement activities. But the CPRs provide guidance to ensure accountability and transparency in government contracts by requiring contracts over a certain threshold to be publicly reported by AusTender. Another requirement is for tenders not to be split or divided into separate parts to avoid the relevant procurement threshold. The ANAO's report assessed the level of compliance by government entities with this requirement and found noncompliance to be low, with as little as 1.6 per cent of 290,867 contracts having discrepancies. The ANAO's analysis identified 2,457 pairs of contracts where both contracts were with the same entity, each of the contracts was entered into with the same supplier, the contracts had a start date within the same quarter and the combined value of the two contracts was above the relevant threshold but each of the reported contract values was below the threshold.


The ANAO notes that 4,914 of the individual contracts would need to be reviewed to determine whether they were for discrete procurements, whether there were data errors, like duplication, or whether a single procurement had been split to avoid reporting against the procurement threshold. It is interesting that the highest proportion of potentially related contracts, 30 per cent, were for the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science—a Commonwealth entity that accounts for only 2.7 per cent of all contracts entered into between that five-year period of 2012 to 2013 and 2016 to 2017. However, on the other hand, the Department of Defence accounts for 42 per cent of the total number of contracts awarded across the same period, with less than 10 per cent of those contracts having any potential contract discrepancies. 


The one thing missing from the current CPRs is a complaints mechanism, and that is what this bill puts forward. This bill attempts to create a type of complaints mechanism that was recommended by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee in 2014. While the committee didn't specify a model, this change to Australia's procurement arrangements will let SMEs more easily hold the government to account. It designates the Federal Circuit Court to receive and review local and international supply complaints about breaches of the CPRs, but, aside from that, the government really hasn't explained what this new process will add alongside current review mechanisms. Currently, suppliers can make complaints to the procuring entity, the procurement coordinator within the Department of Finance, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Federal Court. The judicial review process set out in the bill will give small and medium-sized businesses located in regional areas greater access to justice, with local magistrates or circuit courts hearing their complaints rather than having to have the case listed in major or capital cities. 


While anything that makes undertaking business easier for small and medium-sized businesses is welcome, I have wondered whether this outcome was more by accident than by design. This bill amends the CPRs to include appeal mechanisms to ensure that Australia meets the requirements set out in future FTAs, including the TPP. The changes will also satisfy Australia's obligations as a proposed party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and will allow Australian businesses access to significant government procurement markets in other countries. Whether this international opportunity can be realised by Australia's small to medium-sized enterprises remains to be seen, but I sincerely hope it does. 


The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit held a public hearing into Australian government procurement contract reporting in August. Representatives of the 'big four'—PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte—all commented on the success of Australian SMEs in being awarded contracts through government panel arrangements. They were applauding themselves. EY noted: 


I understand from a recent report from the Digital Transformation Agency that in July 73 per cent of the contracts awarded through that mechanism—


the digital marketplace—


were to small and medium enterprises. 


When specifically asked about the effectiveness of panel arrangements in providing opportunities to the SMEs, it was noted that the panels are effective from a government buying perspective but that it can be very difficult for SMEs when trying to access a panel. Evidence provided at the JCPAA hearing noted:


For a larger firm, it wouldn't be unusual for a larger organisation to spend $20,000 or $30,000 just on getting into the panel agreement. That is not an amount that many SMEs are able to withstand, certainly if they need to bid into multiple panel agreements, especially when there is no guarantee of work at the end of it.


This is from PWC:


… the tendering environment in government is highly competitive, and so I do see that there are challenges for SMEs in respect of panel arrangements. But … we also try to work to put the best team forward so that we can be successful and that includes involving SMEs and other subcontractors. When we think about AusTender, AusTender does only record the prime contractor and so there could be … an improvement that could be made to disclose the other organisations that are … part of that consortium.


Before entering politics, I had my own microbusiness. I was mainly contracting to Defence and to government agencies for 10 years, so I know the challenges. I know the challenges of getting on a panel. I know the challenges of getting work once you are on the panel. I know how many highly skilled and experienced microbusinesses and small businesses are being forced to contract to primes and multinationals just to get work. I know that quite often when you're going on a panel, particularly when you are doing that first bid, you basically have to give years and years of financial records, and for a microbusiness that's a challenge—not that we don't have the records. But, really, do we need that much detail? Basically, you have to give half your body in blood and also your firstborn just to get onto a panel. That's been my experience.


My experience has also been that, as a micro, to get onto a panel you have to subcontract to a medium or small outfit, and in some cases you have to subcontract to a prime, a multinational. In that process you are completely at the mercy of those primes and those subcontractors. It wasn't me, but when I was contracting in Defence I knew of other consultants who were billing themselves out to the prime or to the subcontractor for $150 an hour, and they were being billed out at $500 an hour.


I made a speech in this place just recently about the fact that small and medium businesses, and micros particularly, provide extraordinary opportunities for government agencies. They are agile. They are flexible. They are innovative. They are creative. They can deliver efficiencies that larger outfits, particularly large multinational primes, just cannot deliver. They deliver an agility that those large multinational primes just cannot deliver. Our system, unfortunately, is geared to recognising and encouraging those large multinational primes and those large subcontractors at the expense of small and medium businesses and micros. This is particularly the case in regional and remote Australia. In my shadow defence portfolio, I do a lot of travelling to bases around the country, and I usually take the opportunity to go and speak to the local business chamber. They're tearing their hair out about the fact that they can't get a cut of the work. They can't get a cut of the significant Defence work arising from the base. That work tends to go to primes and subcontractors that are invariably based in the major centres on the eastern seaboard or potentially overseas. So those local businesses—I'm talking here about the local electrician, engineer or ICT person—just cannot get a look in in terms of the work.


We really need as a nation to be thinking creatively about how we can maximise the potential of our micros and our small and medium businesses and capture that innovation, agility and creativity that they offer, because at the moment, the way the procurement arrangements are established, they favour being big. They favour low risk, and big is usually low risk. They favour tried and tested solutions that are not necessarily as innovative as they could be. I know this from conversations I've had with some of the cybersecurity outfits that we have here in Canberra, world-class outfits. I'm thinking here about Penten. They're coming out with amazing innovations, particularly for mobile highly secure devices, allowing devices to be mobile and secure. Their mantra when I was leaving was: 'All we ask is that government agencies, particularly Defence, just buy one. Just have a go. Just have faith in us as a creative Australian outfit here in Canberra and as an innovator. Just buy one and just try it.' That's all they ask, particularly those in start-ups, in the innovation sector, in the cybersecurity sector, in virtual reality and in artificial intelligence: 'Just buy one. Take a punt. Develop and manage risk. Mitigate risk. Develop an appetite for risk that is mitigated and managed.' That's all they're asking.


So we are talking here about potential opportunities for micros and small and medium businesses. That said, I want opportunities not just internationally but also here domestically for micros and small and medium businesses in Australia. I want us to realise their potential. I want us to unlock their innovation. I want us to unlock their agility, their flexibility and their creativity.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:14):  This legislation, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, implements commitments that the Australian government is signing up to under the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and possibly the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement whereby, if an entity is aggrieved by the awarding of a government contract, that entity has an ability to appeal that decision through the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, which is an easier process than what currently exists. The appeal would challenge the government's compliance with its own Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which in turn must comply with Australian obligations under free trade agreements, other World Trade Organization obligations and the government procurement agreement which the government is currently negotiating.


The comprehensive and progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has been mainly dealt with via other enabling legislation that was debated in this place a few days ago. In that debate, Labor highlighted several shortfalls with the TPP. Firstly, there is the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution clauses which give overseas corporations rights that domestic corporations simply don't have. Secondly, there is the recognition of overseas skills that may not meet Australian standards. Thirdly, there is the ability to more easily recruit overseas labour in Australian workplaces. And, fourthly, there is the likelihood that pharmaceutical companies will have longer periods of monopoly over costly medicines.


What has not been talked about so much but should be of real concern to all Australians is that under the TPP and the government procurement agreement overseas entities can bid for Australian government work on an even playing field with Australian bidders. That means that, other than where exceptions are provided for within the agreements, Australia cannot give favourable treatment to local entities for government contracts. That may sound like a good idea, but when analysed it not always is. If the government does give preferential treatment, under this legislation the aggrieved entity also has an easier appeal process.


The enabling legislation for the TPP is currently before the other place, and the government procurement agreement has already been signed by some 47 countries around the world. Nine other countries, including China and Russia, are currently in accession talks to join the WTO GPA. In June 2018, Australia received support to join the GPA and it is expected that final approval will be granted in October of this year—that is, next month. So, from next month onwards, we may be a full member of the government procurement agreement that currently exists amongst 47 countries, with another nine also in the process of getting approval. At this point in time, Australia is not a signatory to the GPA, but it certainly may well be and, like the TPP, the GPA—that is, the government procurement agreement—has its own risks for Australia.


Members of the House would recall that it was only about a year ago that there was a Joint Select Committee on Government Procurement that looked at the issue of government procurement within Australia and how we could ensure that that procurement better benefited local Australian companies. There were recommendations at the end of that inquiry. Recommendation 8 of that committee report said:


The Committee recommends that, in negotiating future trade or World Trade Organisation agreements, Australia not enter into any commitments that undermine the Australian government's ability to support Australian businesses.


The government's response to the report was pretty weak, if I should say so. Indeed, with respect to recommendation 8, the government's response was:


Noted. The Australian Government enters into commitments in trade agreements that are aimed at supporting Australian business, in particular to open up new market access opportunities internationally and to put in place a framework of rules and standards that support transparency and competition on a level playing field.


In other words, it didn't support a process that would have ensured that Australian businesses would have got preferential treatment but, rather, the opposite.


In 2015-16 Commonwealth agencies reported entering into 70,338 contracts valued at $56.9 billion. My estimate—because accurate figures are simply not available—is that the $56.9 billion figure that the Commonwealth spends would probably be doubled if state and territory government procurement were also included. That means that in this country around $120 billion of government procurement is spent each year. That's $120 billion that could be directed to support Australian businesses and their employees and the economy of this country. Yet all the local benefits of that procurement are increasingly being chipped away by free trade agreements—and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and, soon to come, the World Trade Organisation's government procurement agreement.


Even with the exclusions and the reservations that are carved out within those agreements, every agreement weakens the Australian government's rights to favour Australian businesses. This legislation weakens those rights even further, because it makes it easier for aggrieved parties—and that includes the foreign entities—to challenge Australian contracts. In the past, there may have been a process—and I know that there is some process where the government does favour local businesses, particularly small and medium ones. But in the future, if the government chooses to do that and it has signed up to the GPA and the TPP, it will be easier for those overseas competitors to challenge the decision to award those contracts. The argument that what Australia may lose by being a signatory to such an agreement is more than offset by what Australia may gain from winning contracts in other countries is wishful thinking at best. The figures on the trade agreements that Australia has signed to date simply do not show a net gain to Australia, or there are no figures on which we can make accurate comparisons. The fact that there are no figures is of itself concerning, because it indicates that the claims about the benefits to Australia about these agreements are simply not met.


But the risk if Australia joins the government procurement agreement is even greater for this reason. Most of the agreements we have entered into to date rely heavily on the export of agricultural products and minerals in order to justify the benefits that are to come to Australia. However, with the GPA, no minerals and no agricultural products are to be exported to offset the possibility of overseas companies bidding for government contracts, which are in most cases services or the building of infrastructure. Additionally, whereas Australia acts ethically and complies with the spirit of trade agreements, that can't be said of all the countries we have signed agreements with. Indeed, I refer to the 47 countries from earlier on, with another nine to join the GPA in the future—possibly the near future. Governments in other places have been known to use what we call 'behind the border' barriers to make it much harder for overseas jurisdictions to continue doing business with them than it is for their local companies.


A good example of that is that it was only a couple of years ago that it was brought out that the Reserve Bank of Australia's subsidiary, Securency, had got caught up in a note-printing scandal. The reason it did was that we had a product that was wanted overseas—that is, the printing of banknotes—and we could do so better than anybody else. But the reality was that, in order to win the contracts, bribes had to be paid. That's what happened with the Securency scandal. That just highlights that, whilst Australia signs agreements and then ethically goes about complying with them, it's not always the case with overseas jurisdictions, which can use all sorts of tactics to continue to favour their local businesses. That is a concern with this legislation and, indeed, with all of the trade agreements that Australia has to date been a signatory to.


If Australians cannot rely on the Australian government to give preferential treatment to Australian businesses in the issuing of government contracts then they cannot expect any support whatsoever with respect to the trade agreements that the government is prepared to sign up to. With government contracts, the government is in total control of who gets the work and how it is awarded. So, if we can't rely on the Australian government for the $120-odd billion dollars of work that governments give out every year, then what hope do Australian businesses have of being supported by the government in respect to overseas contracts and in respect to the conditions within these trade agreements?


The government could easily fix the problem it has, where it says that it cannot give preferential treatment to Australian businesses, simply by broadening the meaning of the words 'value for money' in respect of the criteria used when it comes to the awarding of Australian government contracts. The definition of 'value for money' should include whole-of-life benefits that accrue when a contract is awarded here within Australia and that should also include the additional revenue that the government gets back in taxes both by the sale of the product and from the workers who work there and pay pay-as-you-go income tax and the like. It should be a whole-of-product cost and not simply the bottom-line price as to how the product can be delivered.


Unfortunately, that is not the case and that is why, in my view, Australia doesn't always get the best deal with respect to these contracts. Deputy Speaker Georganas, you would be fully aware of this with respect to the Rossi Boots factory that was in your electorate. It lost a contract simply because it was undercut by an overseas supplier. But if you had factored in all of the benefits to the local economy and put a dollar value to those factors, it would have been the case that Rossi Boots would have got the contract. It is not unreasonable and it is not unethical to include the whole-of-life costs of the product when a contract is awarded, whether it is a product or whether it is a service, and all of the income that accrues to the government should be factored into the final decision as to who gets it.


I haven't seen, and none of us have seen, the actual text of the government procurement agreement that the current government is negotiating. As with all of these agreements, we only ever see the text once it has been agreed to. But I would have thought that, at the very least, if we're going to enter into new agreements, we should—with that agreement—also carve out protections with respect to national treasures of artistic, historical and archaeological value and we should also carve out any measures for the economic advancement, health, welfare and social advancement of our Indigenous Australians. If that can be done in the GPA then I believe it ought to be done and we should be doing our best to ensure that it is done.


I finish with this comment, and it relates to a submission made by Dr Elizabeth Thurbon, who contacted the inquiry committee with respect to government procurement:


… World Trade Organization (WTO) membership requires governments to curtail the use of local content requirements, direct export subsidies and preferential government procurement policies (which involve using government purchasing to support local firms).


That quote, where Dr Thurbon makes it clear that we cannot give preferential treatment to Australian businesses, is concerning. I hope the government ensures that that is not the case with respect to new agreements that we enter into.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-09-19,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:30):  This bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, will make it easier for multinational corporations to take the Australian government to court over how the Australian government spends its money, and Labor and Liberal are about to join together with the Nationals to vote for it. The trickle-down troika of Labor, Liberal and big business is trucking on and saying, 'How can we change the rules to make it easier for big multinational companies to come and restrict how this government wants to spend its money?'


Why are we here debating this bill? We're debating this bill, in the words of the government—which have been echoed by the opposition—because Australia has recently signed up to the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a blueprint for giving corporations greater rights over everyday people, and also because the government wants to go off and negotiate another deal with the World Trade Organization that will make it easier for overseas companies to take the Australian government to court. The previous speaker has just said that he hasn't even seen the text of that, yet Labor and Liberal are about to pass this bill through this place.


This bill deals with what's called government procurement, which is about how government spends its money. We know that the government has some very deep pockets and can drive significant change and influence what Australia looks like by how it spends its money. The government can decide, when it awards contracts, that it is going to do so in a way that it thinks is of benefit to the local population. For example, it could say, 'We have a youth unemployment crisis in this country,' which we do, because under this government one in three young people either hasn't got a job or doesn't have enough hours of work, and it's at crisis levels that have not got better since the GFC, when we, together with the mining boom, effectively destroyed a huge number of manufacturing and entry-level jobs in this country. The government could, for example, if it wanted to—this government won't, but a good government could—say: 'We're going to spend our tax revenue to help young people get jobs and increase apprentices, and we're going to give priority to local businesses in doing that. We want to give some preferential treatment to local businesses, because we know that it's going to be better for the long run in this country if everyone has a sustainable, meaningful job.' You implement those things through your procurement policy. You set some rules about how government spends its money. When you do that, you can make the judgement calls about saying: 'Well, on paper, a bid from somewhere else might appear to be a couple of hundred thousand dollars cheaper, but by the time we factor in the people who will get a job if we give it to a local business and the avoided welfare costs of that, and the additional environmental benefits of doing it here locally and the ability to regulate local companies, perhaps on balance it's better.' That's why you have local procurement rules that can have preferential treatment built into them.


Big multinational companies don't like this, because they look at governments and they just see dollar signs. They see bank accounts and cheques being written for them. They want the right to come to countries, including Australia, and say: 'Well, hang on. We can sell you the product much more cheaply—perhaps because we're getting it made by someone in a country where we don't have to pay Australian wages—and we want the right to do that. We don't want to have our hands tied by you deciding that you might want to give preference to local businesses in some way.' So these big multinationals have got together and written a blueprint for a set of rules that will make it much more difficult for the Australian government to spend its money in a way that looks after its population. Those rules are found in things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and also in things like this procurement agreement being negotiated by the World Trade Organization.


What this bill does—and the reason that this gives us an entry ticket into the very bad TPP and the very bad WTO agreement—is allow a multinational company, when it hears about how the Australian government has decided to award a tender, to go to court to get an injunction to stop the government from proceeding. Why does it want to get an injunction, get compensation, run a claim against the government or take it to court? Because, if it can put a brake on the Australian government doing it, it can then go and lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization or with some other body under the TPP, and have it resolved in an international forum behind closed doors where they apply the rule of trickle-down economics and don't care about governments looking after their own population.


Who is that going to work to the benefit of? I've heard the government and even the opposition saying: 'Actually, this is all right, because it works the other way around. Australian companies will be able to do the same overseas.' Do you really think that an Australian small or medium-sized business is going to have the capacity to go to the WTO and lodge complaints against overseas governments? No. This isn't going to benefit local businesses accessing overseas markets. This is designed to give a leg-up to multinational corporations against Australian small and medium-sized businesses. When a company has won the tender, looks like it's going to win the tender or has rules that appear to give preference to local companies for some very, very good reasons, all of a sudden it's going to find itself in court—not against another Australian company, but against an overseas company with much deeper pockets—facing an injunction, facing a compensation order and facing a complaint through a different authority before they go to the court. These new rights that companies will have are only going to work to the disadvantage of local companies.


This is why, in part, when the Senate looked at this, many senators, including government senators, said: 'Don't pass this. At the very least, don't pass it until we know what the final rules are that we're signing up to as part of this WTO agreement. Don't pass it until we know whether the TPP contains protections.' Well, now we know that it doesn't contain adequate protections. We now know that the senators who looked at it and said, 'Look, hang on for a moment,' were right to say that. Now we've got the TPP in front of us. We know that under the TPP the government did not remove the so-called ISDS provisions, the ability for companies to take the Australian government to court. Jacinda Ardern, over in New Zealand, had the good sense to negotiate some get-out clauses for New Zealand, but the Australian government did not. The Australian government doesn't care, so it signed up to these awful deals. It doesn't care that it's going to give corporations much more significant rights.


We now know that these deals have some huge traps in them. That's why the Greens think we shouldn't be signing up to them. That's why half of the Labor Party thinks that we shouldn't be signing up to them. That's why civil society thinks we shouldn't be signing up to them. That's why the ACTU—and the member for Batman when she was the head of the ACTU—put in a submission to the Senate inquiry to say, 'Don't rush ahead with this, because we can only see that this is going to disadvantage local businesses.' And they were right.


We've got an opportunity now to say: 'Let's park this bill until the opposition and everyone else gets to see the full text of this agreement.' They're coming in here, complaining they haven't. 'Let's park it until we've gone back and renegotiated the TPP to include some better protections for labour and the environment, and to remove the ability for corporations to sue governments.' That is the opposition's policy, so it should be unobjectionable to say: 'We're not going to rush this bill through until we've gone back and negotiated a better deal.'


So, as an amendment to the amendment moved by the opposition, I move the following:


That all words after ""whilst"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House appreciates the significance of this measure, the House defers further consideration of the bill until the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement contain:


(1) better protections for labour rights, the environment, and local business; and


(2) no investor-state dispute settlement provisions"".


I'm moving that amendment, which the member for Denison is going to second, because it is no good to sit in your party room and say, 'We don't agree with the TPP,' or, 'We don't agree with these deals that the government is negotiating secretly,' but then, when you have the opportunity on the floor of parliament to do something about it, when you've got the most precious thing that the Australian people trusted you with when they elected you—which is your vote in this place—go and vote with the government to fast-track this bill through. We should not be pushing this bill through when we absolutely do not need to. This bill has been sitting around for a while. It could very reasonably sit and wait until the TPP has gone back and been renegotiated.


I'm very sceptical of the Labor Party's view that it somehow is going to be in this magical position where it can renegotiate the TPP, if and when it gets elected—and I do hope there's a change of government at this election. But the idea that Labor's putting out there, that we can go back and renegotiate it, is fanciful. That's why we've separately moved to park the TPP agreement as well. We should not be signing up to that. But it's crystal clear that, even if you think that's right, even if you think that the new Prime Minister is going to be a negotiator who's going to be able to go back and take all these terrible clauses out of the TPP, then we should not pass this bill now. Wait until all of that has happened. So I'm moving what is a very simple, reasonable and unobjectionable amendment to park consideration of this until we have that opportunity.


I must say, by way of comparison, that I personally wish that the government were willing to allow people the freedom of movement to the same extent that they're allowing it for multinational corporations. If you're some person who has suffered torture, war or famine and you decide that you want to come to this country to make a better life here and to contribute, this government locks you up. Even if you are an 11-year-old child, this government, with the support of the Labor Party, will lock you behind wire until you no longer have the will to live. As we've heard this week, 11- and 12-year-olds are now saying that they no longer have the will to live, and a 12-year-old girl has reportedly set herself on fire in a camp under our watch. So, if you're a person who wants nothing more than to come here and seek a better life, you get locked up until you die or you kill yourself. But if you're a multinational company wanting to come here, Labor and the Liberals roll out the red carpet and say: 'What protections would you like us to remove? You're welcome here. The door is open. Don't worry; if you think there are any pesky rules that we've set up that might give benefits to the local Australian population, feel free to take us to court.'


What the government and the opposition don't seem to understand is that we keep playing by rules that no-one else plays by, in the hope that somehow it's going to result in the economy magically growing. Yet speaker after speaker from the Labor Party comes in here and says, correctly, that there's no evidence that these deals deliver any meaningful benefit for the Australian population at all. It's not often that the Greens and the Productivity Commission are on the same page, but they are on this one. They've said that the tangible benefits of these deals are overstated and that we should know about them before we sign up.


So let's find out first, before we sign up. Before we give a blank cheque, let's park this bill. I am going to oppose it, but I imagine others might support it. At the very least, everyone should agree to park it until we have gone back and put some things in those multinational agreements that reflect what the Australian people want and, probably, what the majority of this parliament want as well. It is time to stand up, use the vote and support this amendment. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Is the amendment seconded? 




Mr Wilkie:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment to the proposed amendment that all words after 'Whilst' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment to the proposed amendment be agreed to.

"Katter, Bob, MP",KAP,2018-09-19,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:45):  I rise to speak to the original bill, the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017, but, obviously, that has gone sideways. I have risen again and again on this issue. I have a unique position in this place, because I have been a member of parliament for longer than anyone else in Australian history, with the exception of Billy Hughes—not good company to be in, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you. I have seen the complete destruction of manufacturing in my country, and, if you go back to my speeches from 35 years ago, I was probably advocating a movement towards free trade, but you have to judge policy upon its outcomes. 


I wrote a book, and some would argue it was based, to a very large extent, around the views of Edward Theodore, who Malcolm Fraser said was one of his two heroes and who Paul Keating said was one of his two heroes. I have a picture of Jack McEwen and Ted Theodore on my wall. I am not an important person. I'm not the Prime Minister of Australia; I am a relative nobody, but I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you couldn't find three more unalike people on the planet as those three people. But they agree on one thing. The whole existence of the Labor Party was to get arbitration, which has been removed by free markets, undermined for the worker and completely removed for the farmers. So we have been left to the tender mercies of Woolworths and Coles and the foreign marketplace, where every farmer on earth gets 40 per cent of his income from the government—and we get none of our income from the government. So that is real fun. But, you have to be judged on your outcomes. You have completely closed down the motor vehicle industry. You have completely closed down the whitegoods industry. Every single thing that you use in your house, from an air conditioner to a washing machine to a fridge, is now produced overseas. 


I remember vividly when Keating said: 'We are going to be the most free market economy on earth.' That was one promise that he did keep! It was six o'clock in the morning. I picked up a boot and threw it at the wall. I thought, 'From now on, I have to look after the workers in this country. What does this imbecile think? Do we go down to slave labour wage levels, give massive subsidies like our competitors, or close down industry in Australia?' They were the alternatives. Clearly, we were never going to go to subsidies. So we had two alternatives, not three, and one was to close down the industries here. So we closed down the industries. Were you surprised? That morning I knew that, if he were fair dinkum, every industry in this country was going to be closed down. Your motor vehicle industry has gone. Your whitegoods industry has gone. Your glass industry has gone. Your textile, footwear and clothing industry has gone. Your steel industry is about 60 per cent gone, and soon it will be gone completely. Your cement industry has gone—well, 40 per cent gone, but soon it will be gone completely. I was referred to by Keating as the 'last socialist' left in this place. I don't know. What the hell.


When QCL, Queensland Cement and Lime, was in a bit of trouble—we could see that it would be mopped up by a foreign corporation, and the entire cement market in Queensland would not be buying cement produced in Queensland but would be buying cement being produced overseas—we went in and bought the company. If you said to Bjelke-Petersen that you were going the pay $1,000 million to a foreign corporation to build a rail line into the Galilee he would have had you put in a lunatic asylum. But now we're the people being put in a lunatic asylum.


Where is the benefit? I have waited for a single speaker from that side, or from this side, to point out a single benefit. They all got up and said 'rural industries'. If there is one person in this place that represents rural industries it is me. There is no doubt about that one. I don't think anyone would contest that one. I represent the biggest agricultural industry in Australia. I represent about a sixth of the Australian beef industry. No-one represents more beef cattle than I do, and we are down 23 per cent. After this drought we are going to be down even further in our numbers. The beef industry has to help the sugar industry—one of the four giants of the Australian agricultural economy. We're now 17 per cent. In fact, we're closing a sugar mill every three or four years in Australia. Soon we will have no sugar industry at all. It didn't help the sugar industry. Did it help the dairy industry, which is one of the big four? Their production is down 31 per cent, so it most certainly didn't help the dairy industry.


The next one is the wool industry. This industry had carried the Australian economy for 160 years. In the year that Keating chose to deregulate it, it was bigger than coal. It was the biggest export commodity this country had. It was the biggest and greatest asset this nation had, and Keating destroyed it. These people participated in the destruction. Seventy-two per cent of our sheep industry has gone. There are your big four in agriculture. It didn't help them. Who did it help? Please, stand up and tell me who it helped.


When I walk into this place I walk past a magnificent portrait of the first member for Kennedy, Charles McDonald. If you ever watch me walk past I never walk past without saying, 'Good on you, Charlie.'


When we got arbitration, what the government did was allow blackbirding, indentured labour in the sugar industry, and they allowed coolies, indentured labour in the mining industry. They said, 'Take that one, Mr Trade Union Movement, Mr Theodore and all your mignons. Take that one between the eyeballs.'


A bloke on a bicycle in a place called Chillagoe north of Cairns had a dream that we weren't going to live like slaves any longer. He lived not far away from Mount Mulligan, where 72 human beings were blown to pieces in the Kennedy electorate. Seventy-two human beings were blown to pieces in one explosion. In my hometown, Charters Towers, 23 people were blown to pieces in a matter of seconds. This is what was going on. We fought the fight. He had this dream this he could actually make it better. Do you know what he did? Within seven years he had taken over control of Queensland and said: 'Righto. You blokes did that, so what we are going to do is take all your plantations off you and hand them over to the cane cutters, the people who actually work it and actually live here in North Queensland. We are going to take all your pastoral runs off you, you big foreign corporations, and we are going to hand it over to Queenslanders.'


There is a political message here. Do you know that the people that lived outside of Brisbane loved that bloke so much so that for 56 straight years the labour movement won every single seat outside of Brisbane in almost every single election. When you do the right thing, people see that you are doing the right thing. With Bjelke-Petersen, every single election we increased our majority. That was because we strained every muscle and nerve and sinew to see that the people of Queensland owned the assets. We owned the electricity industry. We owned the railways. We owned the ports. And—it would be unthinkable—we owned the cement and lime company that was producing cement in Queensland. I don't know how many things we owned, but the people of Queensland owned them, and we produced from them and, yes, we enabled foreign corporations to come in and use those facilities, but we charged like a wounded bull. They said that sometimes our rail charges were a bit high. Well, I didn't notice.


The famous Sir Leo Hielscher is the greatest Treasurer and financier the country has ever seen by a long way. Two of the three biggest bridges in Australia are named the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, and quite rightly so. I think at his address last weekend he had five ex-treasurers, one or two ex-premiers and about seven or eight ex-cabinet ministers. He's one of the most famous men in Australian history and he is the architect of the economic miracle which was Queensland. It was wonderful to hear that man speak. He took a state where we had chooks in the backyard—he had chooks in the backyard; my family had chooks in the backyard. We were poor people; everyone in Queensland was poor. But we suddenly became rich because we owned the assets; we put government money into developing those assets. We didn't build pleasure domes on the South Bank of the Brisbane River. We built railway lines where the men with the hard hats and the hard hands could go and earn a big quid. If they got off their backside in the city and were prepared to go out there and work hard, they made big money. And I'm proud to say that the workers in the state of Queensland were the most highly paid workers in the world when the government fell in 1990. And they could only bring us down by backdoor, backstabbing methods.


I have written a best-selling history book. It was published by Murdoch Books, and it was launched by Kevin Rudd no less, with over 1,000 people in Sydney. We turned away 200. In Melbourne we had 750 people when it was launched by Barrie Cassidy. That was not my choice; that was Murdoch Books' choice. I'm proud to be associated with both those men. When they write a history book of this period, they will spit upon all you people sitting over on that side and all you people sitting over on the other side. When you read my history book and you read about those people who reduced us by 72 human beings who were blown to death at Mount Mulligan and 23 who were blown to death at Mount Leyshon—and my own son worked at Mount Leyshon—you spit upon those people. When people listened to Sir Niemeyer from the Bank of England instead of listening to our own people and we had the worst depression of any country on Earth, they spit upon those people. If you read that book and that history of Australia, you'll say there were great men and there were little pissants.


God help the people in this place when the history books are written, because this period has presided over the most disastrous destruction of the Australian economy. This country now has only two things left that we can export from two quarries, an iron ore quarry and a coal quarry. Let me be very specific: more than 50 per cent of our income comes from two quarries. That's all we've got left. And quarries run out. I'm a mining man; I've been in mining all my life. Eventually your mine runs out. What have you got when the mine runs out? You've got nothing. Let me just say that they're at about $120 billion to $130 billion a year. The next item down is maybe gold or aluminium or beef, which is at $11 billion. You've got nothing left. All you've got is two quarries. That's all you've got left. And who did it? And what are you doing today? Are you apologising? Are you reversing it? No, you're doing just the opposite. I said it again and again about the car industry.


I hope that somewhere in my country will rise up in righteous anger and destroy the people who are in this place. My brothers in North Queensland, where the last explosion came from, have a look at the figures; have a look at the One Nation and KAP figures. We're ready for the explosion up there, I can tell you. And we'll lead the same as we did last time. But, when that explosion occurs, one of the first things to do is to restore the motor vehicle industry, which is as far away from me as the South Pole. But I love my country. One of the greatest stories in the history of Australia is the story of Laurence Hartnett and Ben Chifley, who created the car industry. It is so easy to do that, because all you've got to do is say, 'All motor vehicles purchased under a government contract will be Australian made.' That's all you've got to do. But the right to do that—that little piece of sovereignty—is being removed, to their eternal shame, by the ALP and the Liberal Party. So that right is being removed by those people. And I promise you, you will be recorded in the history books.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-09-19,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer—Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories) (18:00):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate on the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. The bill implements recommendation 11 of the July 2014 report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into Commonwealth procurement procedures that the Department of Finance establish an independent and effective complaints mechanism for procurement processes.


The bill ensures that regional suppliers and small and medium enterprises have timely access to justice to raise complaints about procurement processes. The bill also complies with international trade obligations to maintain an impartial and independent body where suppliers can raise complaints about government procurement processes and be awarded remedies and compensations. It will give Australia the opportunity to access the government procurement benefits of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP-11.


By designating the Federal Circuit Court with concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court, the courts can decide which is the most appropriate court to deal with the matter. This will allow complaints to be heard in a timely manner. The bill specifies a 10-day time frame for suppliers to make an application to the courts to encourage timely efforts to resolve any concerns about a procurement process. However, the bill also provides a flexibility for the courts to allow a longer period for applications if there are genuine reasons for the delay. The courts may order remedies to preserve a supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement, but will not be able to overturn awarded contracts. Where a procurement cannot be delayed, the courts will be able to order compensation limited to the costs or damages which occurred in the preparation of the tender or in bringing the complaint or both.


Before a complaint reaches the court, the supplier must first complain to the Commonwealth entity responsible for conducting the procurement. The entity will investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint with the supplier. Suppliers must provide evidence of their complaint, including attempting to resolve the complaint with the procuring entity in the first instance. Regional suppliers and small and medium enterprises will now have timely access to justice to raise complaints about procurement processes and seek remedies. The Federal Circuit Court is the only court at the federal level with a continuous presence outside major capital cities. Suppliers in rural and regional Australia will have easier access to have their complaints heard without the need to attend major cities.


I will briefly correct some errors made by speakers during the second reading debate. First, I note that the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement is already publicly available. It has, in fact, been in the public domain since 2014 on the WTO website. We're not negotiating a new text. Indeed, 47 countries are already members. If some members have not seen the agreement, it is because they haven't looked. Second, in relation to value-for-money assessments under the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, the procuring official must consider relevant financial and non-financial costs, which include whole-of-life costs. I also note that, in 2017, the Procurement Rules were changed to take into account economic benefit of a tender to the Australian economy.


The government does not support the second reading amendment proposed by the opposition criticising the level of opportunity for participation by Australian business in the Commonwealth procurement. I inform the House that Australian suppliers are already well represented in government procurement, with over 95 per cent, by number, of contracts being awarded to suppliers in Australia in 2016-17. As much as $40.8 billion of the $47.3 billion contracts were with suppliers operating from an Australian address. The government also does not support the amendment proposed by Mr Bandt, the member for Melbourne. There is an important advantage to Australia being an early entrant to the TPP.


Once again, I thank all members for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House, and I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The honourable member for Melbourne has moved as an amendment to the proposed amendment that all words after 'whilst' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. So the immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne be agreed to.




A division having been called and the bells having been rung—




The SPEAKER:  As there are fewer than five members on the side for the ayes in this division, I declare the question negatived in accordance with standing order 127. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (19:29):  When people talk about environmental protection, too often we only think about the more distant and remote parts of our country. Those more remote areas often are very well deserving of protection and, from time to time, I have been involved in campaigns for exactly that protection. But we have often missed the importance of conservation projects in areas where many people live. If I go through the Nepean, the Parramatta, the Cooks, the Maribyrnong, the Yarra, Darebin Creek, Merri Creek, the Brisbane, Scrubby Creek, Karrawirra Parri, the Tamar and the Swan, I'm talking about waterways in our urban areas. These are waterways which, to varying extents, have historically been treated with almost environmental disdain. When heavy industry first arrived in Australia, it found its way lining the creeks for the very simple reason that all the waste products could be deposited immediately there. Heavy metals still lie at the bottom of a number of these waterways. Since that time, we have managed to match what is at the bottom with plastics at the top, and our waterways in our urban areas have become one of the great environmental challenges about which we are yet in a comprehensive way to say, 'We need to fix that.'


The need to fix it is incredibly important. Think about the nutrients, chemicals and heavy metals that are at the bottom of the waterways and you think about the plastics that are at the top. It's a direct pathway from when those plastics are first littered from the gutter to the drain to the river and then to the ocean and each piece of marine life and seabird on the way through. The environmental protection of remote areas is contingent on us looking after the areas where a whole lot of people live, but that's not the only reason it's important. The most degraded of the urban rivers are always in the poorest and most working class areas, and they should not be. Whether a river looks like a river or like a stormwater drain should not be connected to the average income of a postcode, but in many cities in our country it is exactly like that. 


This is something that can be fixed. Years ago, the idea was you could fix every river that was already a problem and the way to fix them was to line them with concrete. Increasingly, as those concrete banks require replacing, the opportunity is there to make sure that the banks are properly remediated. There are also increasingly opportunities to treat not just the river but the entire catchment, to intercept the waste products before they reach our rivers, whether that interception is through gross pollutant traps that just make sure the material never gets there or by diverting the water through natural processes by adding new wetlands. When new wetlands are added it is the ultimate example of 'build it and they will come' because what comes isn't just the plants and water that are put there; in so doing, habitats are created there.


We have in the Cooks River an area that was completely degraded, but now the native birds have shown up again. I'm not sure where they came from. The pelicans are along the river again now. It is still too degraded, but we need to see that this can be fixed and we need to understand that the parts of our environment where we have tended to place our cities have historically been sites where large numbers of people have been living since the first sunrise on this continent. There are stories that live on these rivers that if we allow them to continue to be degraded will have nowhere to go. We have an Indigenous rangers program that has focused on the remote areas and played a magnificent role, but I think it will also have a role to play in preserving and restoring the stories and ecology of our urban rivers. It should not be the case that simply because a whole lot of people live somewhere and they're not as wealthy as others they are somehow less entitled to go for a walk where they can hear Australian native birds or walk past habitats with trees and shrubs that have always lived there or look at a river that looks like a river and not a stormwater drain.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (10:00):  This week I was proud to host, along with Senator Linda Reynolds, the launch of Australian Reading Hour 2018. Senator Reynolds and I are the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Books and Writers, a group formed only one year ago. But over the last 12 months we've held some wonderful events and, more importantly, have promoted Australian books and Australian writers to the parliament and beyond.


The purpose of the event was to launch this year's Australian Reading Hour. On Thursday, 20 September, we want all Australians to stop what they're doing for an hour and to pick up a book. I love books. I've always enjoyed reading, just for the sheer wonder and pleasure that it brings. There's nothing better than being so totally engrossed in a book that you are transported away from your own reality to the other world created by an author. But there are actually other more tangible benefits that come from reading.


In adults, reading has been shown to reduce stress by 68 per cent—that's more than listening to music and more than going for a walk or having a cup of tea. The more leisure books that people read the more literate they become and the more prosperous and equitable the society they inhabit. Reading a gripping novel causes positive biological changes in the brain that can actually last for days. And even more lasting changes occur: readers of narrative fiction, when tested for empathy, achieved significantly higher than other groups. Reading helps us to understand our own identity.


For those of us with children, the benefits of reading to them are also significant. Reading to children six to seven days a week puts them almost a year ahead of those kids who are not being read to. So it was a pleasure this week to hear Australian Children's Laureate and 2018 Australian Reading Hour Ambassador Morris Gleitzman talk about the importance of stories for young people to equip them to embrace their futures in a sometimes dark and uncertain world. Author and actress Judy Nunn is also an Australian Reading Hour Ambassador for 2018. She shared how one book had transformed her life when she was nine years old.


Last year, I went to many schools in my electorate to read the Mem Fox book I'm Australian Too to some of the students. Then I donated that book to many of my schools' libraries. It was a wonderful experience. So I'm very excited about Australian Reading Hour 2018. This year I'm going to invite book clubs in my electorate to share with me the history of their book club: how they started, how long they've been going and what special things they do to celebrate books—and perhaps if there is any alcohol involved. I have heard of book clubs that do involve alcohol; I've been a member of a few of those, in fact!—and also what books they're reading so that I can recommend those books to other book clubs in Moreton. So, everybody, happy Australian Reading Hour! Find one hour on Thursday, 20 September to read your book.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (11:00):  I'm glad to make some remarks on Report 182, from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is titled Oil stocks contracts: Netherlands. This report and the arrangement it puts in place between Australia and the Netherlands are an example of how our place in the world and our engagement with the world can be wonderfully complicated and terribly simple at the same time. At the end of the day, this arrangement is about fuel security. It's about Australia's fuel stocks and, to put it simply, we're not in a very good place. Our situation, when it comes to liquid fuel reserves, is parlous.


We are a member of the International Energy Agency. There are 30 member countries around the world. The IEA came about in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the early seventies. Member countries are part of that group to make a contribution separately—more importantly, collectively—to greater fuel security on a global basis. You make commitments as a member of the IEA, and the key commitment is the 90-day commitment. Each participant country maintains reserves equivalent to 90 days worth of fuel. We have been non-compliant since 2012, so we have been non-compliant for six years.


What does that mean? You can look at it in simple terms, and you can look at it within the terms of our international commitments. In simple terms, it means we don't have the kinds of fuel reserves we ought to have. If there were another oil crisis we wouldn't be well prepared for it. We wouldn't be able to make a contribution to any kind of international response. Comparatively, are there other member nations from time to time that are non-compliant? Yes, of course. Just to give you a sense of the scale of our noncompliance, since 2008 only two other member countries have been non-compliant: Turkey and Luxembourg. Their noncompliance was relatively minor. In the case of Luxembourg, it fell to 89 days of fuel reserves—one less than the 90-day commitment—on three occasions. Turkey fell from 90 to 88 days once in 2009 and from 90 to 86 days earlier this year.


Those are the instances of other member countries being non-compliant since 2008. We currently have reserves equivalent to about 50 days worth, so we are non-compliant by an enormous margin. We have been non-compliant since 2012, so for the last six years. When you think of 50 days worth of fuel reserves, what does that mean? It covers a range of different kinds of fuel—aviation fuel, petrol, diesel. My understanding is that at various times since the beginning of this year our petrol reserves have been probably about three weeks worth.


I note that retired Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn AO had some things to say about this earlier in the year, in the context of what's going on in Syria and the kinds of circumstances that could give rise to a disruption in global supply. He noted that Australia had no plan B. He said:


In a major disruption … we would have major problems within two weeks.


It's not hard to imagine how that would occur. Liquid fuel accounts for 37 per cent of Australia's energy use, but most importantly it accounts for 98 per cent of the energy used in transport. If we had a crisis in relation to our liquid fuel reserves, if global supply were disrupted, if there were some sort of crisis akin to circumstances we have seen a number of times over the last few decades, within three weeks we would have a major problem in our cities, in our freight networks.


It's not as if the 1973-74 crisis was the last time we experienced this kind of issue. Obligations under the IEA have been triggered a number of times since then: in 1991, in the context of the first Iraq war; in 2005, around the time of Hurricane Katrina; and, more recently, in 2011, with the turmoil in Libya. So there are times when obligations of member countries are triggered under the IEA arrangements. Of course, we couldn't meet our obligations. We are not currently meeting our obligations. It is true to say—and it was certainly noted in this report—that other members look at Australia with a bit of a jaundiced eye. They take a bit of a dim view of our performance in that respect, because it is a collective arrangement; it only really works if all member countries hold up their side of the bargain, and we are not holding up our side of the bargain.


What this treaty facilitates is the purchase of tickets from the Netherlands. Those tickets are essentially an option to take or otherwise disperse fuel reserves that the Netherlands have. It comes at a cost. Those tickets, over the next two financial years, will cost the Commonwealth some $24 million, just to have that option. Why are we doing it? We're doing it because the government has made some commitments to the IEA in relation to our noncompliance. Those commitments have two phases. Phase 1 is this early stage where we purchase tickets that give us access to these reserves that the Netherlands hold. Phase 2 is the much more interesting, important and difficult phase, because in phase 2, apparently, we're going to get to full compliance. I think it's important to note that we don't know, as members of the JSCOT, or as parliamentarians, much about how that phase 2 part of the exercise is going to occur.


The government is currently undertaking a sort of a review of Australia's liquid fuel reserves, and apparently that review will report by the end of the year. I'll be very interested to see what it puts forward. We're currently at about 50 days of fuel reserves, a long way short of the 90 days that we need to be at. This arrangement effectively amounts to an additional 3.8 days worth of fuel. In each of the 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years, we are purchasing 400 kilotonnes worth of fuel reserve tickets, at a cost of $24 million, as I said. That will really only lift our effective reserves, or access to fuel, from around 50 days to around 55 days. How we're going to make up the other 35 days between now and 2026, which is the commitment we've made to the IEA under phase 2 of the arrangement that's described here, remains to be seen. We've got to this situation without enough scrutiny from government, without enough attention from government. Three of the seven domestic refineries in Australia have closed in the last decade. Our domestic production of liquid fuels has declined by a third.


There is one further thing that I want to raise, and I've raised it in this place a number of times in the last 18 months. We currently do not have an Australian-flagged fuel tanker. Our fuel security depends on fuel production and fuel imports. Of course it depends on fuel reserves, and we know that they are in a parlous state. But everything that comes to this country comes by sea, and it is intolerable that we are in a situation of not having the sovereign self-sufficiency, the sovereign capacity, to transport fuel here. That is a result, unfortunately, of this government's very, very harmful policies in relation to shipping. They seem to be intent on bringing Australian shipping as we know it to an end.


I want to thank all the members of the JSCOT who participated in this report. The member for Macquarie, who's going to speak after me, did a lion's share of that work. I actually wasn't on the committee for the last several months. I'm very glad to be back on the committee. This is an example of the important work that it does.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (11:10):  There are some members in this place who will remember the petrol queues of the seventies when, because of a world shortage, petrol was in very short supply in Australia. I can't remember all the details of it, but I remember my mum and dad being really stressed about getting a full tank of petrol. I certainly didn't know much about the OPEC oil crisis back then, but I certainly saw the effects. It seems like a long time ago. While it would be tempting to think that this agreement is about shoring up local fuel supplies, what we are recommending in this report is actually more about our role as a global citizen.


Just as we saw post GFC, the world looked to put in place a series of things that were really to make sure the same mistakes weren't repeated. In the wake of the OPEC oil crisis in the late seventies, in 1979, we became a member of the International Energy Agency. We are one of 30 members required to hold the equivalent of 90 days of the previous year's average net oil imports. The idea is that if there's a major disruption of global fuel supplies, members' stocks can be pooled and can contribute to a collective effort to maintain global supply. The action has only been triggered three times since we signed that treaty in 1979. It happened in 1991 during the Iraq conflict. Hurricane Katrina triggered it in 2005, and the turmoil in Libya activated that agreement in 2011.


To be clear, the committee sought some clarification about Australia's physical stocks of oil. The advice that we received from the department was that they are separate but interrelated areas, and that this treaty action only applies to the IEA obligation. Just because we're not compliant with the IEA obligation doesn't directly imply that we have a liquid fuel security problem, although we did hear evidence of only around three weeks supply of liquid fuel in Australia. I note that the government is doing an inquiry to really assess what the circumstance is, and that is certainly warranted. The department advised us that because there's quite a diverse supply—we import crude oil from 21 countries and we refine product from 47 countries, so there are multiple sources—that it does give us some resilience to a disruption. But, fundamentally, we have international obligations that we need to meet, and that's the purpose for entering this treaty: to make sure that we have sufficient fuel security to contribute back to the world. This really does speak to Australia's place in the global order.


One of the points that I found quite interesting in the evidence that we took—and I have to say that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is always an education—was one of the reasons given for why Australia doesn't hold a strategic reserve. That is that we've never had a significant disruption in this country which has impacted on Australian supplies in the history of the IEA. So you probably do have to be in your 50s to go back to a time when you remember the previous impacts. Over 40 years of the different disruptions that we've had, none of them have actually impacted on Australia.


The bottom line is that Australia has not been a good corporate citizen. We have been one of nine countries over the course of that treaty not compliant with the 90 days. Our current holdings are around 49.6 days, so fewer than 50 days. The minister says this is less than we would like, and the IEA says this is way less than what we are required to have—it's significantly less. By comparison, when you look at the others that have been noncompliant in the last decade or so, there have only been two noncompliant countries. Their noncompliance just pales in comparison to ours. Three times Luxembourg, instead of 90 days, had 89 days of fuel supplies. Turkey, in 2009, found itself with 88 days and, in 2018, with 86 days. So we really are dragging our heels on this one.


While there is a cost attached to the solution that has been put forward, it's an important step for us to be taking if we want to be taken seriously on the world stage. About two years ago Australia submitted a plan to the IEA's governing board to demonstrate how we would for the first time be compliant. Under phase 1 of the plan we are procuring these 400 kilotonnes of tickets. This first agreement, which is with the Netherlands, is with only one country. We will have to make separate agreements with every country we do this with. We said we will buy 400 kilotonnes in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years, so that is what this applies to. Phase 2 is much longer term and there is much less clarity around what that would look like in order to get us to compliance by 2026. The way to do that is still under consideration. I certainly urge a close and ongoing look at that.


Let's keep in mind that the steps we're taking with this agreement are tiny. We're talking 3.8 days at a cost of $23.8 million. It is being considered a pilot phase, hence the decision not to take a larger chunk of ticketing. We look forward to hearing the result of the pilot and the finding as to what is the most cost-effective way for us to return to compliance.


I think it's worth noting that the oil tickets that we are spending money on are actually a right to either purchase a reserved oil stock outright or release that stock back to the host market. There was some discussion about how quickly that oil could get to Australia. Of course, it would take a really long time to get here—several weeks. That's really where the committee recognised that this was not about Australia's domestic fuel supply but about our ability to contribute to the world's fuel supply.


We sought an assurance that Australia would return to full compliance within the proposed time frame—that is, by 2026. I think we could only describe as limited the assurance by the department that the plan we currently have is going to achieve the outcomes we would like to see. I think that's the worry we should all have. 2026 is going to come around very rapidly, so I urge the relevant parties to keep focus on this.


The member for Fremantle, who spoke before me, said that our ability to play a part internationally does depend on our willingness to live up to the promises that we have made as part of these agreements. We're certainly showing good intent here in accessing the Dutch ticket sellers. The Netherlands is the largest seller of tickets globally, so it has done this before. We're not so experienced at it. In addition to the Netherlands, we do have bilateral arrangements with the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany and we are negotiating or exploring bilateral relationships on this matter with a further six countries. I expect that those agreements will be a matter for this chamber before too long.


In conclusion, we have serious concerns about Australia's own domestic fuel supplies. I want people to be very clear that this isn't seen as the solution, but it still has a very valid role to play in ensuring that Australia meets its international obligations. It is too easy to make promises and then let them slide. We have clearly done that for a really long time on this agreement. It is a show of good faith by Australia that we're progressing this agreement. I look forward to seeing more progress on this as we head towards 2026.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (11:00):  I'm glad to make some remarks on Report 182, from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is titled Oil stocks contracts: Netherlands. This report and the arrangement it puts in place between Australia and the Netherlands are an example of how our place in the world and our engagement with the world can be wonderfully complicated and terribly simple at the same time. At the end of the day, this arrangement is about fuel security. It's about Australia's fuel stocks and, to put it simply, we're not in a very good place. Our situation, when it comes to liquid fuel reserves, is parlous.


We are a member of the International Energy Agency. There are 30 member countries around the world. The IEA came about in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the early seventies. Member countries are part of that group to make a contribution separately—more importantly, collectively—to greater fuel security on a global basis. You make commitments as a member of the IEA, and the key commitment is the 90-day commitment. Each participant country maintains reserves equivalent to 90 days worth of fuel. We have been non-compliant since 2012, so we have been non-compliant for six years.


What does that mean? You can look at it in simple terms, and you can look at it within the terms of our international commitments. In simple terms, it means we don't have the kinds of fuel reserves we ought to have. If there were another oil crisis we wouldn't be well prepared for it. We wouldn't be able to make a contribution to any kind of international response. Comparatively, are there other member nations from time to time that are non-compliant? Yes, of course. Just to give you a sense of the scale of our noncompliance, since 2008 only two other member countries have been non-compliant: Turkey and Luxembourg. Their noncompliance was relatively minor. In the case of Luxembourg, it fell to 89 days of fuel reserves—one less than the 90-day commitment—on three occasions. Turkey fell from 90 to 88 days once in 2009 and from 90 to 86 days earlier this year.


Those are the instances of other member countries being non-compliant since 2008. We currently have reserves equivalent to about 50 days worth, so we are non-compliant by an enormous margin. We have been non-compliant since 2012, so for the last six years. When you think of 50 days worth of fuel reserves, what does that mean? It covers a range of different kinds of fuel—aviation fuel, petrol, diesel. My understanding is that at various times since the beginning of this year our petrol reserves have been probably about three weeks worth.


I note that retired Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn AO had some things to say about this earlier in the year, in the context of what's going on in Syria and the kinds of circumstances that could give rise to a disruption in global supply. He noted that Australia had no plan B. He said:


In a major disruption … we would have major problems within two weeks.


It's not hard to imagine how that would occur. Liquid fuel accounts for 37 per cent of Australia's energy use, but most importantly it accounts for 98 per cent of the energy used in transport. If we had a crisis in relation to our liquid fuel reserves, if global supply were disrupted, if there were some sort of crisis akin to circumstances we have seen a number of times over the last few decades, within three weeks we would have a major problem in our cities, in our freight networks.


It's not as if the 1973-74 crisis was the last time we experienced this kind of issue. Obligations under the IEA have been triggered a number of times since then: in 1991, in the context of the first Iraq war; in 2005, around the time of Hurricane Katrina; and, more recently, in 2011, with the turmoil in Libya. So there are times when obligations of member countries are triggered under the IEA arrangements. Of course, we couldn't meet our obligations. We are not currently meeting our obligations. It is true to say—and it was certainly noted in this report—that other members look at Australia with a bit of a jaundiced eye. They take a bit of a dim view of our performance in that respect, because it is a collective arrangement; it only really works if all member countries hold up their side of the bargain, and we are not holding up our side of the bargain.


What this treaty facilitates is the purchase of tickets from the Netherlands. Those tickets are essentially an option to take or otherwise disperse fuel reserves that the Netherlands have. It comes at a cost. Those tickets, over the next two financial years, will cost the Commonwealth some $24 million, just to have that option. Why are we doing it? We're doing it because the government has made some commitments to the IEA in relation to our noncompliance. Those commitments have two phases. Phase 1 is this early stage where we purchase tickets that give us access to these reserves that the Netherlands hold. Phase 2 is the much more interesting, important and difficult phase, because in phase 2, apparently, we're going to get to full compliance. I think it's important to note that we don't know, as members of the JSCOT, or as parliamentarians, much about how that phase 2 part of the exercise is going to occur.


The government is currently undertaking a sort of a review of Australia's liquid fuel reserves, and apparently that review will report by the end of the year. I'll be very interested to see what it puts forward. We're currently at about 50 days of fuel reserves, a long way short of the 90 days that we need to be at. This arrangement effectively amounts to an additional 3.8 days worth of fuel. In each of the 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years, we are purchasing 400 kilotonnes worth of fuel reserve tickets, at a cost of $24 million, as I said. That will really only lift our effective reserves, or access to fuel, from around 50 days to around 55 days. How we're going to make up the other 35 days between now and 2026, which is the commitment we've made to the IEA under phase 2 of the arrangement that's described here, remains to be seen. We've got to this situation without enough scrutiny from government, without enough attention from government. Three of the seven domestic refineries in Australia have closed in the last decade. Our domestic production of liquid fuels has declined by a third.


There is one further thing that I want to raise, and I've raised it in this place a number of times in the last 18 months. We currently do not have an Australian-flagged fuel tanker.
