Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (09:57):  I move: 


That the following address-in-reply be agreed to.




To His Excellency the Governor–General



MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY—


We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.


I indicate that this is not my first speech, but I wanted to say briefly that it is an honour and a privilege to move this address-in-reply to His Excellency the Governor-General's speech yesterday to the 45th Parliament. I reserve my right to speak in reply at the end of debate on this motion.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:58):  I second the motion. In doing so, can I congratulate Senator Hume and all other senators who are taking their seat in this chamber for the first time. There can be no greater honour than to serve your country in this place. Can I also take this opportunity, Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, to acknowledge the large number and diverse range of crossbenchers that we have in the Senate and to note, with some degree of satisfaction, that it was the people of Australia who elected the Senate crossbench this time, entirely on the strength of their primary vote and not by some sort of backroom preference deal, as has been the case in the past. The crossbench is here because the people of Australia elected them, and I believe that this truly is a Senate of the people.


I also acknowledge the uncontested re-election of Senator Parry as the President. It is a reflection of the extraordinary non-partisan way in which he has conducted this chamber over the two years he has presided over it. I also acknowledge the manner in which the Deputy President of the 44th Parliament, Senator Gavin Marshall, took his role and the impartial way he conducted business in this chamber. I certainly look forward to the new Deputy President, Senator Sue Lines, continuing in that vein. 


In 2013, it was my privilege to deliver the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's opening speech in the 44th Parliament, and it is indeed an honour to second the motion in this new parliament. I echo His Excellency's sentiments about the purpose of this parliament. We must be responsible, we must be diligent, but above all we must be sensible as we debate and implement this government's legislative agenda. I acknowledge the comments that have been made by many of the crossbenchers to date indicating that it is their intention to undertake their role in this government in exactly the way that the Governor-General suggested that we should all behave.


There is no senator in this chamber that is under any illusion that this must be a parliament, and a term, of delivery. We are a second-term government, and we intend to start this term ready to deliver on our election agenda. We are not going to shy away from scrutiny. However, the people of Australia rightfully expect that we should be allowed to deliver the promises that we took to the election. I am glad to see that many of those opposite have already indicated that they intend to support us in doing exactly that.


The Turnbull government, of which I am privileged to be a member, stand ready to be judged on what we do and not on what we say. First and foremost, we have to address one of the great moral dilemmas of our time: intergenerational debt. As a generation, we are inflicting on our children and their children excesses of our own making. It is born of our own greed, and we must stop. We are racking up on the federal credit card a debt that we can only pass on to the next generation, if we do not do something about the continued spending that is occurring. Worse still, the ultimate outcome of continuing to spend more and more, year upon year, is eventually you will end up going broke. One day, we are going to wake up and realise that nobody is prepared to lend us any money anymore. 


The government of which I am a member stand ready to address this situation through our commitment to responsible fiscal repair and strong and stable leadership. Our policies are all focused on strengthening the economic growth while reducing our spending growth. We need to make Australia more resilient to economic shocks. To achieve this, the Turnbull government have a plan and a detailed method of delivery. We are going to focus entirely on economic growth, both within Australia and in our export markets. Through our trade policy and initiatives, we intend to make sure that Australia is protected, because we are a very trade exposed nation. We are never going to get rich selling to ourselves, so our focus must always be on ensuring that we have adequate and lucrative export markets to which we can export our wonderful Australian produce.


The importance of this cannot be understated for our rural and regional communities—communities like the one that I come from. Some 67 per cent of our exports are generated in our rural and regional communities outside of our capital cities. For this reason, we cannot underestimate the importance of ensuring that we have trade arrangements in place that enable our farmers and our primary producers to sell their products, not just in Australia but at the lucrative prices that we can get in the emerging markets, particularly those that are immediately to our north. That is why the free trade arrangements that were negotiated under the previous government are so terribly important, and we must continue to make sure that these trade arrangements are negotiated in the best interests of Australian producers.


To that end, this government and the previous government of the 44th Parliament have been very focused on the development of agricultural policy. There is no doubt that Australia's competitive advantage in the international marketplace comes on the back of the fact that we are a clean, green and safe producer of primary produce. It is for that reason that we need to continue to maintain our competitive advantage. Our policy, the Agricultural competitiveness white paper, focuses very much on a number of initiatives which will deliver that security for our primary producers. We have a very strong focus on research and development and making sure that we continue to be the best producers in the world. We place a very high level of importance on biosecurity and making sure that we are able to continue to protect that clean, green, safe image. We all know that, with the high standards of living and compliance we have in Australia, we are never going to be the cheapest producers in the world, but we certainly can continue to be the best producers in the world.


We also, as part of our agricultural policy, are making sure that we have quick and adequate drought response. We acknowledge the change in climatic conditions that is occurring across Australia and we need, as an agricultural sector, to be ready to respond to this change. We need not only to ensure that we are planting the right crops in the right places but also to make sure that when our farmers go through times of great adversity not of their making we, as a government, are ready to stand by them to help them through some tough times.


Lastly, one of the major platforms of our agricultural policy and, more broadly, our government policy is the provision of infrastructure. We cannot possibly hope to get our farmers, our primary producers or our business sector to realise rewards and opportunities if we do not provide the infrastructure through which they can deliver them. We are very proud, in the agricultural space, of the amount of money that we are putting towards ensuring water security through our dams policies. More broadly, the Turnbull government believe that public infrastructure—economic infrastructure—is a very strong basis and platform on which we need to build the economic growth and prosperity of this country.


To do so we also need to be prepared to deal with issues like taxation reform. There is no doubt that everybody in this country would accept that everybody needs to pay their fair share of tax to make sure that we can continue to provide the level of public amenity that I think we have all become used to. Certainly, one of the areas in the 2016 budget that I think was a very positive one was the addressing of the importance of small business. We all know that every large business was once a small business. The government of which I am a member are very keen to make sure that we support all of our small businesses so that they can prosper and flourish and hopefully one day become medium businesses and large businesses or just successful small businesses in their own right. For that reason we increased the tax threshold for eligibility to qualify as a small business from $2 million to $10 million. We also undertook a number of other taxation measures in support of small businesses and their ongoing prosperity. 


One of the other areas that is very, very important and is constantly of concern to the Australian public is the number of multinationals that seem to have the capacity to undertake tax avoidance and not pay the level of tax in Australia that we believe they should. For that reason the Treasurer was very clear about the importance of cracking down on multinational tax avoidance to make sure that everybody pays their fair share and that it is not just the little guy who gets to pay the majority, or the lion's share, of the taxation burden in Australia.


Another platform of the Turnbull government in this 45th Parliament is going to be breaking down the stifling hold of unions on our economy and our society. When I say 'unions', I do not mean every union. There are certainly some very responsible unions. But, if you have a look at the kind of activities that we have seen over the last little while with unions like the CFMEU and the unlawfulness on our building sites, I think every Australian has a right to expect better management and control over the part of our economy that employs over one million people and provides in excess of eight per cent of the gross domestic product of this country. You only have to look at the advertisement that is currently playing on television to realise the length and extent that some of our unions are prepared to go to protect their position. I do not believe anybody in Australia—whether they are a union, whether they are a business or whether they are an individual—should be above the law.


We saw during the election campaign the disgraceful hold on firefighters by their firefighting union in Victoria. We stand ready to support the volunteer firefighters in Victoria by making sure that we pass legislation to protect their interests and to make sure that their interests are not being stifled or quashed by a selfish union that is only interested in looking after its own members and not the safety of the community it is supposed to be protecting.


Another example that occurred during the election campaign was the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. We in the government were very pleased to be able to successfully abolish that tribunal, which once again was trying to destroy the mum-and-dad small businesses of the transport industry—owner-drivers. So I think that, if we were to bring back into this place the ABCC and registered organisations bills and introduce the emergency services volunteers bill, those bills, along with the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, would all go towards making sure that unions are held to account to the same level as everybody else in Australia is held to account.


Nothing can be as important as national security. Of course, Australians have taken for granted for many, many years that, when they go to bed at night, they will be safe. There was no greater example of that than last year's commemoration of the Anzac centenary and the commemoration of the Battle of Long Tan, amongst many other celebrations or commemorations that we have had this year and last year, which constantly remind us of the extent that those before us have gone to protect our safety.


It is for that reason that this government places a massive level of importance on national security. To that end, my home state of South Australia has been a great beneficiary of the new continuous naval shipbuilding program, including the $50 billion submarine program, which will directly sustain 1,100 jobs and an additional 1,700 jobs in the supply chain. In addition to that, there is the $35 billion frigate program. Both these programs provide not just national security benefits for the country but also long-term economic sustainability benefits for the country. Importantly, they underpin our education system by providing the opportunity and the reason for our education system to focus on educating our young people for the jobs of the future. A nearly $90 billion spend on shipbuilding provides a long-term opportunity for many young Australians who wish to undertake a career in this particularly high-tech industry and these very lucrative jobs. It is a whole-of-government, whole-of-economy initiative which will see Australia, and particularly my home state of South Australia, as great beneficiaries of a great and very important government program that is part of this government's agenda. It also fits in very well with the National Innovation and Science Agenda, which once again underpins the absolute necessity for Australia to continue to be the smartest, the most innovative and the most technologically advanced country in the world, because we are never going to be the cheapest.


We are also, as a government, very focused on the fact that we have not only a large population base in the city but eight million Australians that do not live in our capital cities. As I said before, 67 per cent of our export earnings are generated in rural and regional areas. To this end, the Turnbull government places a huge amount of emphasis on rural, regional and remote Australia. We have announced a $200 million Regional Jobs and Investment Package. We are certainly working towards reducing the number of mobile black spots, the development of northern Australia, one of the most underdeveloped areas of our country, and our $10 billion investment in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, all of which not only go towards ensuring that rural and regional Australia has the opportunity to have the same benefits and opportunities as our cousins in the city but because the economic and growth opportunities that exist in rural and regional Australia are so great.


Equally, the rollout of the NBN network has been focused to a much greater degree on rural and regional Australia. We saw the launching of the Sky Muster satellites so that people who otherwise would have had no capacity at all to get access to high-speed connectivity are now able to get access at a similar rate to many of those that live in less remote areas.


Can I say in conclusion that I can absolutely assure the parliament that their government always puts the customer first. When it comes to education, it is the children's interests that are primary. In our healthcare system, we focus on delivering the best outcomes for our patients. In agriculture, our policies strive to return better farm gate prices to our farmers.


However, the ability to continue to pay for these much-needed and justifiably expected services is the reason that we have placed budget repair at the front of our economic agenda for the 45th Parliament. I know budget repair is not a particularly sexy thing to put at the front of your agenda, but I can assure you that unless we do something about the continuing increase in the debt and the deficit, and unless we have got a strong budgetary position and have reserves in the bank so that we are able to be more resilient, we are not going to be in a position to stand in this place and talk about all the wonderful things that are on the government's agenda to support the Australian economy and to provide the things that the Australian public want and expect. There is no doubt that we live in a time of great global uncertainty, and we are never quite sure what is around the next corner.


We have certainly seen great unrest on the international front, but we have also seen political uncertainty, the uncertainty of decisions like Brexit. Australia need to make sure that we are prepared so that we are resilient when international shocks come our way. So I would call on those opposite and ask them to please support us in our endeavour as we undertake what we believe is the absolute responsibility of government—that is, to repair the budget and to put us on a sustainable path so that we can continue to afford all of the things that we take for granted in Australia.


We take for granted our high standards of living, and nobody is suggesting for a minute that we should not continue to have those high standards of living, but they come at a price in the budget. We also need to recognise that we marvel at the fact that we have world recognised levels of environmental protections in this country. Equally, they come at a price. We also need to be able to maintain our clean, our green and our safe image, which is our competitive advantage when it comes to exporting our primary produce to the rest of the world. The ability to do that comes at a price. Biosecurity is probably one of the most expensive things that a government needs to deliver.


We are absolutely and completely committed to getting our debt under control for the simple and primary reason that we can no longer continue to spend the money of our children and their grandchildren. No responsible economic manager, whether it be in a business or when you are dealing with your family, would. There is no way that anybody here, as a parent, would be spending money and racking up a debt which they expect their children or their grandchildren to pay. I believe governments should be exactly the same. We should spend within our means and we should never ever think that it is okay to pass on a debt for something that we have consumed in this time to a generation in the future.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-08-31,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (10:18):  I rise today to speak in reply to the Governor-General's speech of yesterday. But before I do that, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his re-election and Sue Lines on her election as the new Deputy President. I would also like to place on the record my thanks to Gavin Marshall for the leadership that he demonstrated during his tenure as Deputy President of the Senate.


Today I want to reflect on Labor's federal election results in Tasmania, my home state. I urge those opposite to take heed of this result and listen to the people of Tasmania, something which they have failed to do over the previous three years, and I encourage those opposite to deliver in full every election commitment they made to the people of Tasmania.


Firstly, I would like to congratulate Labor's new members elected to the House of Representatives and to the Senate and, in particular, those elected from Tasmania. Congratulations to Ross Hart, the new member for Bass, Justine Keay in Braddon and Brian Mitchell in Lyons. I would like to particularly acknowledge Julie Collins, the federal member for Franklin, on her re-election for the fourth consecutive time. In fact, she increased her margin.


I also acknowledge my Tasmanian Senate colleagues. I congratulate senators Carol Brown, Anne Urquhart, Catryna Bilyk and Lisa Singh and I look forward to continuing to work with them for the people of our home state of Tasmania. I also want to acknowledge Jane Austin, our Labor candidate for the seat of Denison, who put up a great fight but, unfortunately, was not elected. The House of Representatives will miss the contribution that I am sure she would have made. I also thank my colleague John Short, who was on our Labor Senate team. John is a stalwart of the Labor movement, and he would have made a fantastic contribution in this place. He is one of those people who roll up their sleeves and get into it. He is a team player. We sat together on many occasions stuffing envelopes and making phone calls to the electorate, so I will miss the opportunity of serving in this place with John.


I would like to draw your attention to what happened in Bass. I am the duty senator for Bass, which is in northern Tasmania. Labor witnessed a swing of 10.1 per cent—an extraordinary outcome, particularly as there were three fairly new members of the House of Representatives from the government's benches. In Braddon we saw a swing of 4.8 per cent, in Lyons it was 3.5 per cent, and in Franklin there was a swing of 5.6 per cent. This was only possible because of the passion and dedication of our election campaigners, who were fighting for fairness. I thank each and every one of them. They know who they are. They helped elect our candidates who now sit in the House of Representatives, and they helped to ensure that the five Labor senators were returned to this place. We should never forget those people, and we had so many people who came from outside the Labor Party to work on this campaign because they knew of the horror and terror of the policies of this government. Each and every one of them should be immensely proud of their achievements. I would also like to place on record—because sometimes we do not do this enough—my thanks to my own staff for the way they committed themselves not only during the election campaign but for the previous three years. Being in the shadow ministry has been a great honour. There is a lot of work attached to it, and I want to say to them each and every one of them: thank you. 


Federal Labor is very well represented here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, but the reason we were so successful in Tasmania was that we took policies to the people and stood up for the things that they value most: education, saving Medicare, protecting penalty rates and being there for the people. Most importantly, we listened to them and we delivered. The promises and commitments that we made reflected what the Tasmanian community are all about. 


Labor has a strong jobs policy. We took that to the last election. I would also like to acknowledge the fact that it was Bill Shorten who instigated our setting up of the Tasmanian task force, where we went out and consulted across the length and breadth of Tasmania and across all sectors to find out what people were looking for from an alternative government. We did that. We went out to the community over a long period of time, and I believe that we came up with really good policies. What the government forget is that we actually do not just live in an economy; we live in communities. I am hoping that the people on the government side of the chamber will take heed of the message that the Tasmanian community has sent to the Turnbull government.


The rejection of this government's agenda by the people of Tasmania could not have been shown more starkly than by this election result. The reason Labor won four House of Representatives seats and five in the Senate is that we had a comprehensive plan for the future. We know that those opposite—and I have said it enough times in this chamber—have no vision. They have no policies and they have no plan for the future.


A good example of this comprehensive plan for the future was borne out by the election campaign. The University of Tasmania wanted to relocate one of its campuses from outer Launceston to the suburb of Inveresk at the edge of the city, and they were going to do the same thing in Burnie. We took to the community a 21st century solution to a very old problem concerning Launceston's sewerage and infrastructure issues. We had major investments in multiple tourism and community building infrastructure initiatives. We had a positive plan for our hospitals: more beds and more staff—not fewer beds, and staff walking out, as they have been at Launceston General Hospital. We had a plan for education, with more investment in our teachers and funding for years 5 and 6 of Gonski. Bill Shorten and Labor articulated a strong policy agenda for Tasmania, and I thank Bill for his work, not only in the policy area that he took around the nation but for the fact that he spent time in Tasmania listening to what Tasmanians wanted from their leaders. The Tasmanian task force was a great manifest for us to build our policies and our announcements around.


I was on the polling booth on election day so I know that Tasmanians knew how they were going to vote. They were determined. They knew that this government had let them down for three years already. They knew, because they had firsthand experience of cuts to our schools and our hospitals, the GP tax, an attack on Medicare and the threat of $100,000 degrees, which is still a real threat. There were cuts to pensioners' concessions, the increase in the retirement age to 70 and the cuts to pathology services, although they did manage to do a deal to give the pathologists a little bit of time to themselves, because for the first time we had pathology services around this country out campaigning against a conservative government. This is a government that had GPs—not the most radical people in our community, I would have to say—campaigning against cuts in health and a tax to see their GP.


In Tasmania, we also knew what it would mean if there were going to be an increase in the GST. We know that was their plan and that it is still in their bottom drawer. If they thought they could get it through the states, by starving them of funds, that is exactly what those opposite will do. We have a Prime Minister who goes over to Western Australia and makes a commitment that Western Australia will get more funding out of the GST—they will get a greater share. That share has to come from somewhere, and no doubt it will come from Tasmania, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. But what he forgets is that we are pretty smart people here in Tasmania. We understand that he will say one thing in Western Australia and then come to Tasmania and the eastern states and say something very different. Well, the Tasmanian community is much smarter than Mr Turnbull is, because they were not hoodwinked again by this government. We know, firsthand, that the Liberal members of Lyons, Bass and Braddon failed to listen to their communities. Those former members and the senators opposite have still failed to accept any responsibility for losing those seats in Tasmania.


We understand, as the Tasmanian people understand, that a $50 billion tax cut to big business and the undermining of our universal health care system—Medicare—were never going to be fair policies. They sent a very strong message to Mr Turnbull, because they understand how out of touch his representatives were in Tasmania and how out of touch he really is. People who voted for Malcolm Turnbull have gotten somebody very different as Prime Minister, because we know he has backed away from so many things. A lot of people in the community—not me—believed very much that he would be a better Prime Minister than Tony Abbott. Well, we have all learnt that they were very wrong about that—very wrong indeed.


We on this side feel very humble for the result that we got at this last federal election. We accept responsibility for the policies that we put forward to the people. But the blame games have already started in Tasmania from those opposite. They are looking around blaming everyone else but themselves. First it was GetUp!'s fault that they lost the seat of Bass. Then they tried to pin the defeat on a Tasmanian Legislative Council member, who is quite conservative and one of them, for holding a press conference and talking about the crisis at our local Launceston General Hospital under the Liberal's watch. They blamed Malcolm Turnbull's national campaign. Those opposite have not for one second taken the time to reflect on their policies to see how unfair they were. It might be the fact that they ignored Tasmanians and took them for granted. There is no greater example of scapegoating on Tasmania's political issues. Own it, Senator. Own the defeat. You owe the Tasmanian people at least that much. How about some self-reflection from those opposite? You may actually learn something about yourselves and your failed campaign.


Professor of Political Science at the University of Tasmania, Richard Eccleston, said of the election campaign in Tasmania that health was clearly an issue. Yes, it was most definitely an issue. Yet the former federal member for Bass kept saying throughout the election campaign that the crisis at the Launceston General Hospital was a 'state issue'. Mr Nikolic denied the fact that the Commonwealth, alongside states and territories, has been funding public hospitals since World War II. On his watch in Bass, Mr Nikolic just ignored the community and ignored the crisis at the Launceston General Hospital.


So what has the Liberal Party learnt from this election result? From the disunity and dysfunction already demonstrated by those since they were elected, I do not believe they have learnt anything at all. I hope that they will look very seriously at the health and education policies that they are putting forward—the threat of $100,000 degrees. I hope that they will listen to the conversations of people in our communities. I hope that they come up with some decent plans for jobs, plans for TAFE graduates to ensure that we have apprentices, plans to ensure that essential funding for schools and hospitals continue and plans to protect penalty rates and Medicare and I hope that they will not pursue any change to the GST.


The Liberals came kicking and screaming to support the University of Tasmania's move to Inveresk in Launceston and Burnie, but it took them seven weeks. Labor came out early because we understand that we have such a low retention rate and that we need something to drive our local economy to create the jobs so that our young people will not leave the state. We had the support of the state Liberal government and we had the Launceston City Council and the five surrounding councils all supporting this. We had the conservative newspaper, The Examiner, back this move and we had support within the broader community. But the Liberals were kicking and screaming when they had to come out at the very end of the election campaign and commit. That is not a good message to send to the people of Tasmanian.


Tasmanians will not forget that it was Labor and the community who put the pressure on this government to come forward. That was because Labor understand that the economy will be richer, as long as these people opposite keep their commitment to fund the university. In the north and north-west of Tasmania, this expansion is set to create 430 construction jobs and 230 academic and support jobs, but this government could not really see the writing on the wall of how important this was.


We have also learnt from the last election campaign that those people opposite, like Senator Abetz—who belong to the conservatives, who belong to the Liberal Party—are still about getting GetUp!. After the election Senator Abetz said: 


What we need to do as a Liberal Party is inoculate against that and expose the money sources of these organisations and what their true agenda is.


Senator Abetz, how can you argue against a third-party organisation campaigning in a democracy during an election campaign? We live in a free society. Making public comment and campaigning during an election campaign is free speech. Those opposite espouse the fundamental principal of free speech and yet when anyone criticises them they cannot handle it. I think that is a great shame. According to the Liberals, free speech is only allowed when you agree with the Liberal Party.


The fact is that those opposite ignored the Tasmanian community. They ignored the crisis in our health system. It is not just in the Launceston General Hospital; it is in the Hobart Mercy Hospital. We do not want to keep going on and on about our health problems there. I always like to talk up my home state. Through this election campaign there was such heavy campaigning and so many ads going on about millions of dollars being spent, but they did not work in Tasmania because they did not reflect the policies that were important to our community—the policies of providing jobs, of enabling young Tasmanians to go on to university, of ensuring that Tasmanians can get a hospital bed when they need it and that they can go to the GP. Labor stood firm and said time and time again that we would never, ever stop fighting to protect Medicare.


We know that the former member for Bass used to block people on Facebook and social media and we know that he used to turn constituents away from his offices and refuse to seem them, but I only just learnt recently that of a morning in his office he and his staff would have a daily chant of 'jobs and growth, jobs and growth'. I truly believe that Mr Nikolic believed that if he kept saying that same slogan—jobs and growth, jobs and growth—that jobs would magically appear. Quite frankly, they did not. But the arrogance does not stop there. The federal members for Bass, Braddon and Lyons were so arrogant and out of touch they actually proclaimed themselves 'the three amigos'. The arrogance of a member of parliament refusing to meet with their constituents and blocking people on social media because they failed to support their views! I have not even begun to talk about aged care and the fact that that was so badly neglected, but I will be speaking later today about aged care. But I do have a message from the Tasmanian community to these three arrogant, out of touch former members of the House of Representatives who called themselves 'the three amigos': adios amigos, get on your horses and ride out of town.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Polley, as entertaining as that was, I do not think it was quite parliamentary. 

",Senate,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH,4,1
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-08-31,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:38):  I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land that we are meeting on, the Ngunawal people, and I want to pay my respects to their elders past and present. I want to acknowledge that their land was stolen and never ceded, and I look forward to a respectful dialogue in the 45th Parliament to achieve a just settlement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in this country.


Our Constitution says:


… the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.


It is not just some aspirational statement; it is the law of the country. Our country's future is determined by this chamber as much as it is in the other place across the Marble Foyer. We have the same powers and we are elected to represent the interests of our constituency, our state and the nation. We are not elected to placate the needs of lobbyists in the government's ear and the donors in their pocket.


The government, of course, will argue that it has a mandate to implement its entire election agenda, but it is a facile argument. People cast their vote for a variety of reasons and motivations, and no government can claim to have popular support for each and every issue they hold—especially a government elected with the slimmest of majorities. Let us not forget that those of us elected to this place also have a mandate. We Greens have a mandate to honour and respect the wishes of more than one million Australians who voted Green at this election. They supported us because we believe in tackling dangerous global warming as a matter of urgency. We believe that unless we act now we risk leaving the planet uninhabitable and we will see entire nation states disappear, coastal inundation affect our own homes, our food production threatened and our cities bombarded with heatwaves and storms. 


We believe that we are a country that should care for people irrespective of their background and life circumstances and whether they have arrived here by boat or by birthright. We believe that poverty and inequality are corrosive, that trickle-down economics has failed and that if we are to realise this nation's true potential we need to make decisions in this place that narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. We believe in a country that enshrines equality in its national laws, whether it be the right to marry someone you love or to live a life free from hate speech.


Caring for people and for the environment that sustains us is what the Greens believe and that is what we will fight for in this, the 45th Parliament. Yet here we are at a critical juncture not just here in Australia but right around the world, and here we see a government totally unprepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead of us. It is not mitigating catastrophic global warming, eliminating harmful inequality or ending the needless suffering of those seeking our protection. Instead its No. 1 legislative priority is the abolition of the ABCC, which seems to come out of the Prime Minister's desperation to unite a divided party room through a bit of good old-fashioned union bashing. We have seen the carbon price, described globally as template legislation, scrapped. We have seen the renewable energy target wound back and we are on the cusp of destroying research into renewable energy in this country, with over $1 billion taken away from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Australia is on its own in the world. No other country has gone backwards on clean energy policy. We are swimming against the tide of global investment.


Last year's Paris agreement told business and policymakers that we are all heading towards a zero-pollution world. Last year was also the hottest year ever recorded, smashing the previous year's record, which smashed the record before that. We are entering very dangerous territory where any hope of humans curtailing runaway climatic effects and extreme weather is almost out of reach. Yet in the midst of this we have a government whose very own climate policy has little or no chance of achieving its own measly pollution reduction targets. Just look at what is going on in Queensland right now, where the negative impact of tree clearing over the last few years has wiped out the paltry gains made under the government's policies to pay polluters. A staggering one-third of the $6 billion in spending cuts in the government's omnibus bill comes from cutting research, which just makes a mockery of this government's election commitments around innovation.


Under this government poverty is growing, people that need support are falling further behind every year, and regions are becoming more depressed or abandoned in part as a result of trade deals that further concentrate wealth within privileged cliques. We have seen out-of-pocket costs for Australians' medical care on the rise as universal health care is gradually eroded through policies like freezing Medicare indexation and increasing co-payments. Household debt is now the highest in the world, while the astronomical explosion in property prices means that aspiring first home owners can never hope to keep pace with the gains enjoyed by propertied investors, yet the government refuses to tackle negative gearing or capital gains tax reform. We are pricing young people out of the Australian dream.


It seems that Malcolm Turnbull has not learnt the lessons of his predecessor, and he continues to balance the budget off the back of Australia's poorest people. Consider this: he is halting the only real-adjusted improvement in government payments for over 20 years: the clean energy supplement that helps people on low incomes keep the lights on. We like to talk about the great Australian tradition of egalitarianism and the spirit of the fair go, but they are slowly becoming a thing of the past.


We have to note, with disappointment, that Labor appears set to support both the cuts to renewable energy and to the most vulnerable Australians. I just call on them to reconsider their position and to join with us to oppose those cuts.


We are being told that we need to cut support for the vulnerable—that those with limited means are the ones that have to pay so the government can live within its means. Do not believe it. There are other choices.


Of course we understand that there are structural issues within the budget. It cannot continue on its current trajectory. We accept that.


We should also acknowledge that the structural problems we now face are, in part, due to the huge cash giveaways of the Howard-Costello era that could not be sustained once the rivers of gold from the resources boom dried up: giving successive tax cuts for high-income earners, making superannuation earnings tax-free for retirees, taxing capital gains lighter than income and freezing fuel excise. All four of these measures were short-sighted, finely tuned to the electoral cycle and designed to curry favour with their targeted constituencies.


Taxing capital gains as income has been ruled out by the government, despite three-quarters of the benefit going to the top 10 per cent of income earners. And, not content with having inflicted around $40 billion in lost revenue through those massive income-tax cuts of the Howard-Costello era, the Liberals now want to go further in this budget by reducing taxes for the top 25 per cent of taxpayers.


The Greens stand unequivocally against this failed trickle-down theory that pretends that somehow tax cuts for high-income earners will magically create prosperity for everyone else. The US writer Will Rogers took on the theory when he said of President Hoover: 'President Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn't know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night. But at least it will have passed through the poor fellow's hands.' That is what we are dealing with right now: a failed ideology that this government continues to pursue.


It comes down to priorities. Tough decisions cannot be made until we get priorities lined up with what the public wants and deserves. How on earth is it possible that we can go to an election campaign with a bipartisan commitment for a two per cent spend on defence spending—an incredible increase in the defence budget—and yet have no targets for spending on health or education? Few everyday Australians would support that nonsense. Yet it is the policy of both of the major parties. How is it that industry policy is only directed at military hardware in marginal states? Again, remarkable—having industry policy dressed up as defence policy.


Why are we not declaring war on runaway greenhouse pollution—something that we know actually threatens us right here right now? We could use industry policy to create jobs and secure a bright future through building clean energy right across the country. We could get investment in the right places through investing in productive infrastructure and investing in people to break entrenched inequality, and pricing harm so that the community no longer has to wear the costs and we put an end to big business and big polluters getting big benefits.


Solid, stable revenue means we can create jobs and prosperity in areas that the private sector simply will not invest in: public education; public health care; Indigenous rangers to care for country; protecting the reefs and forests; preventive health and research into new frontiers that will help us reap benefits into the future. These are all jobs-rich pursuits that enhance the national interest. When the Treasurer says, 'You need to cut taxes for the wealthy to create jobs,' the jobs that he is talking about are jobs like tax advising, financial planning and property conveyancing, and jobs for luxury car salesmen.


The choices that we make today determine the character and quality of our nation. And these choices—let us forget all the posturing and rhetoric—are ultimately made by us. We senators decide who carries the burden of budget decisions. Should it be single parents or multinational tax dodgers, superannuants, polluting industries or workers whose jobs have disappeared? It is our heavy responsibility, because it is we who will make these decisions.


We senators also have to choose whether we want to unite this nation or to divide it. This country will be watching some new senators' first speeches very closely in the coming days to see whether it is division or unity that is offered to the Australian people. When I had the great privilege of giving my first speech, I said:


Multiculturalism is one of this country's enduring successes. Rather than dividing us it compels us to be clear about those things that unite us as a community: respect for our democratic institutions, for universal human rights and for equality of opportunity. The real value of multiculturalism lies … in the fact that relationships with people from different cultures offer important insights into our own.


We often hear about newly arrived migrants having to adopt our values—to share our values. But let us remember: we also learn from theirs. And I stand here today as the proud son of an immigrant family. It was national leadership, embodied in the courage and vision of politicians who came before us who made some tough decisions, that enabled my parents to seek out and create a better life for themselves and for their children. But I do fear that we are on the precipice of damaging support for what I think is one of this nation's greatest achievements: our multicultural nation.


Let us always remain united against harmful views that scapegoat one group of people for the problems of another. I understand that people who advocate that division often do so because they feel frustrated or marginalised and left behind. We need to work hard. We need to engage with them. We need to understand people's concerns. We need to address, first and foremost, their social and economic needs. But hurtful and divisive attacks on people from different cultures or religions should be called out, not given a silent nod of approval or used in some proxy war to weaken the Racial Discrimination Act. And make no mistake: the Greens will call them out. There is no place for racism or bigotry in this chamber or indeed in the Australian nation—no place at all. Let's not use mealy-mouthed words to justify actions that have no justification in this parliament. Racism damages people, it harms people, and we have a duty to call it out whenever we see it, wherever we see it.


Thankfully, we know that the overwhelming majority of Australians are with us. They embrace diversity. And we must give strength and support to the positive voices of hope and inclusion in our communities so that they can speak out and shine a light on the path forward that we must take together as a nation. The indifference to the future of First Australians cannot continue as it is. In his 1968 Boyer Lecture, WEH Stanner called out the 'great Australian silence'—that Indigenous voices were completely missing from the Australian story. While our history books may have been corrected somewhat, our statutes and policy books are still part of that great Australian silence. On that note I want to acknowledge Senator Pat Dodson and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy: you will both make this chamber a better place, and we welcome you here.


The First Australians have still not seen any fundamental shift towards involvement in policy development or control over service delivery really since the apology to the stolen generations. I was there as an observer, sitting there on the lawn watching that speech. It was an inspiring gesture to open the parliament almost 10 years ago with the apology to the stolen generations—a rare moment of unity, something that we all should embrace. There were very high expectations that a new dawn had arrived: the First Australians and all Australians with political power, walking on a shared pathway together. But it is with great sadness that I have to say that things in many respects have gone backwards since that moment. The bipartisan approach, with the heavy-handed intervention in the Northern Territory, and the BasicsCard, show that we have so much more work to do. Whitefellas are still making all the decisions.


We remain the only postcolonial country without a treaty, and crucial Closing the Gap indicators are either stubbornly unchanged or going backwards as a result. We Greens stand here ready to offer a brighter future. We offer the Australian community a voice for a long-term vision for this country that does not take the easy way out, that has the courage to take up these difficult challenges and to turn them into national advantages, national prosperity. We do not fear being the lone advocate in this place for the thousands of innocent people who are being locked up in detention centres under laws sanctioned by this chamber. We will never tolerate knowingly and willingly punishing these people to send a message to another group of people. No decent society does that. And we do not fear the political cost for advocating against the damage done to innocent people in this government's name. The Prime Minister talks about the morality of budget repair, but what about the immorality of locking up innocent people—innocent children—indefinitely in those offshore hellholes?


We do not fear arguing forcefully for the opportunities of shifting towards a clean energy economy as the global transition moves forward, with or without us. We do not fear raising debt to build crucial public infrastructure that will enhance our national productivity. We understand that debt is sometimes necessary for the nation to advance and prosper. The outgoing Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, told us that monetary policy has reached its limits in our current economic environment and that now it is up to fiscal policy, and particularly infrastructure spending, to carry us through into the new economy. We will carry this message through the parliament.


We do not fear increases in spending on quality health care and education. What is the purpose of having a debate around our budget if we are not talking about the things that advance us as a society? What is the purpose of raising revenue if not to provide for universal essential services to the citizens of this country? We do not fear raising revenue to fix our budget challenges. For years we have advocated that we have a problem with revenue in this nation, and we welcome the reluctant acknowledgement of that, only recently, by the Treasurer. We have options available to us to fund the public services that Australians want and deserve. We can charge mining companies excise on their fuel, like ordinary, everyday Australians pay, and charge the big four banks for the huge advantages they get from being too big to fail. We can put a price back on pollution and crack down on tax avoidance by companies and wealthy individuals and redirect the wasteful private health insurance rebate into prevention and dental care.


The election platform that the Greens took to this most recent election shows that we can create a fairer society—one that protects the environment, one that cares for people, one that invests in public infrastructure—while reducing the budget deficit. We can re-create the Australia of the fair go, and this is the vision the Australian Greens put forward to the 45th Parliament.

",Senate,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH,4,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:58):  From the outset, I congratulate all my colleagues in the Senate on their election. We have a lot of work to do as a collective team. We have differences of opinion and differences of views, but I think that if we act and work towards getting outcomes for the people of Australia we can have a productive parliament.


But to say that is not to hide the fact that we do have what I would perceive to be a crisis of confidence in politics around the world and also here in Australia. Successive elections have seen the growing rise of minor parties, a growing crossbench in this place and in the other place, as Australians have taken their primary votes away from the major parties. Of course, I accept and I welcome the will of the Australian people in this regard, and once again I congratulate all my colleagues on their election to this place. They have been rightfully endorsed by the Australian people. But what the minor parties are actually doing is tapping in to a wide cross-section of community concerns about the direction in which our country is headed.


The government, quite rightly so, is concerned about debt and deficits and is about getting the budget back on track not just for our benefit today but also for the benefit of future generations. We also, quite frankly, have to restore faith in politicians and in the political process. If we do not, we risk losing something that is truly significant. I will not say that it is unique to Australia but it is a very special part of Australia's body politic. As I said in my 2014 address to the National Press Club, broken promises, politicians' perks, spin over substance, scandals, little perceived difference between the major parties and a lack of focus on the issues that truly matter all add to the gaping chasm between politicians and the people.


We have just had a double dissolution election. Many of us were optimistic that this would enable the country and the body politic to embark upon a fresh start. I regret to say that that fresh start has not occurred. One of the most damning things that has already condemned aspects of this parliament is the stench of possible improper use of and requests for money by a member of the ALP—that is, Senator Sam Dastyari. Senator Dastyari declared in October of last year that he had received compensation from a Chinese linked company for a personal debt that he owed to the Commonwealth caused by his own mismanagement of his office resources. This is a personal debt owed by a senator being paid by a third party that is linked to a foreign country.


Senator Dastyari overspent the relatively modest amount of $1,670.82 on his staff travel budget. This was a debt that he was required to pay. Yet Senator Sam Dastyari—one of the highest paid officials in the country; in the top one per cent of income earners—could not find it within his own resources to pay back $1,670.82 to the Commonwealth. For some reason, which he has not explained to this chamber or to the Australian people, he got the Top Education Institute to pay his bills. This education institute has made donations to both sides of politics. Making a political contribution to a political party is legitimate conduct that has been accepted as appropriate. But never in my recollection, never in my memory, has it been appropriate for an entity linked to a foreign government to pay the personal debts of a member of parliament.


I invite anyone who thinks that can be justified in any way, shape or form to come into this chamber and explain it today. I invited Senator Dastyari to come in and explain it, and he gave a statement saying that, yes, he did the wrong thing. But let me tell you: it is not just about accepting our responsibilities and requirements under the parliamentary act to disclose benefits or various other support mechanisms that we may have received in the course of our duties; we owe the people of Australia our good judgement. How can the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate stand up in this chamber and say that his judgement should be relied on by his colleagues, by the people of Australia or by the ALP nationally when he does not see it as wrong to get reimbursed for a personal expense by a company linked to the Chinese government? This is absolutely wrong.


Senator Dastyari needs to come in here and provide a full disclosure of how the circumstances came to be. It is simply not credible that the Top Education Institute just discovered that Senator Dastyari had a debt to the Commonwealth and thought, 'I'll pay those bills for him.' Did Senator Dastyari write to them and ask them? Did he go and visit them? Did he call them in one of his extravagant phone calls—which clocked up $15,000 to the taxpayers? This is an organisation with very close links to the Chinese government—the head of this organisation has had photos taken with both a Chinese premier and the education minister of China—which received a special sanction from the Chinese government as the only approved nonspecialist education provider in 2013. How did Senator Sam Dastyari have his expenses reimbursed by this organisation?


We are right to question this. This is a question of judgement; this is not a question of political ideology. This is a question about anyone in this place who thinks it is okay to go and ask a company linked to a third entity, another country, a sovereign nation, to pay their personal bills. It has the stench of corruption. How deep and how widespread this is is the question that needs to be asked. If you go through Senator Dastyari's statement of interests, it all seems linked to the Chinese government. Typical Labor: they leave others to pick up the tab—such as the catering for an afternoon tea sponsored by the Australia China Relations Institute. For goodness sake, can't a senator—a highly paid senator and a good political operator—pay for the afternoon tea himself?


The links between Senator Dastyari and the Communist Party of China are extraordinary. Yes, they have been disclosed in his register of interests, but there is a pattern here. We are right to question what influence, if any, a foreign power has over Senator Dastyari when they are not only sponsoring his travel and his hospitality bills but also paying or supporting, in one way, shape or form, his personal bills.


I do not know the truth about Senator Dastyari's involvement. I do not know the truth about whether Senator Dastyari has disclosed everything he should. But I do know that under no circumstances could any person that is fit and proper to hold the position of Manager of Opposition Business in this place think it is okay to have his personal expenses paid by a company linked to a foreign government. As I said, this is not about political donations per se. This is about a personal benefit, a benefit that has been paid by a foreign linked corporation to cover someone's personal expenses, which were incurred in the course of their political duties.


Earlier today, as she was defending Senator Dastyari, Senator Wong took me to task—quite rightly so—for asking a rhetorical question about who pays her mortgage, and I withdrew that. But the rhetorical nature of the question was simply because Senator Wong pays her own mortgage, as we all do. So how can she defend the fact that Senator Dastyari has a debt to the Commonwealth that was paid by people linked to the Chinese government? That is a judgement issue, and if Senator Wong or anyone else on the other side wants to defend that, then they have judgement issues too. 


The only answer is for Senator Dastyari to stand aside from his position as Manager of Opposition Business, for the ALP to conduct a full inquiry, for Senator Dastyari to be asked to fully disclose to this place all the dealings he has had and what other remuneration or benefits he may have received and not disclosed, and for Senator Dastyari to explain the nature of the benefits more fully than he has disclosed. We are quite right to question whether we should undermine the integrity of this parliament and the confidence of the Australian people in the incorruptibility of those that are here, for a seemingly minor amount of $1,600. The amount does not matter. It does not matter if it is $1,600 or $16,000; what matters is the principle applied here.


The Manager of Opposition Business could not manage his own office budgets. He could not manage his own office budgets and he had a debt to the Commonwealth. That in itself is not unknown in this place, but what is unknown in this place is expecting a foreign entity to pick up your personal bills. Other senators—and I do not have to name them—have worked out debt repayment plans, because mistakes can happen. This is not a mistake. This is a grievous error of judgement that brings into question the influence of foreign entities on our body politic.


Just yesterday the AustralianFinancial Review reported that one of the significant donors to both major parties was complaining, in a Chinese language paper, that they were not getting enough value for money out of their donations. This individual, who, as I say, has donated to both major parties through their company, is the same individual who also bailed out Senator Dastyari from legal obligations he had, and that was fully disclosed as well. But the fact is that it comes back to this: how does it come to pass that a foreign controlled entity with close ties to another sovereign government is paying the legal bills of a senator? It has got the stench that should inflame the nostrils of every single person in this place and every single person outside this place. The only conclusion I can draw, in the absence of any other information coming to hand, is that Senator Dastyari is not fit for his current position and he should question whether he is suitable and appropriate to remain as a senator in this place. 


We clearly have a problem. Personal benefits have been given to a senator by people associated with foreign entities, and one of those people has complained in recent days about not getting enough value for their money. Just what did they expect? Is it okay for individuals to travel at other governments' expense? Yes, it is, because in this place we go on delegations and we cooperate in official functions all the time. Maybe on occasions it is right for some of us to avail ourselves of information by going to other lands to attend formal sponsored events. But when there is a historical pattern of largesse, personal benefit, that has been directed to a senator, we are right to ask: do we have a bigger problem?


One of the stories doing the rounds is from an ALP member who was going to Hong Kong to meet with someone. They received a phone call from a close associate of the Chinese embassy suggesting that they do not meet with that individual. Quite rightly so, they said, 'No, I'm going ahead with it.' Yet, when they were in Hong Kong about to meet with this individual, one of their colleagues from the ALP rang them up and begged them not to go, because it would upset the Chinese embassy. Who do you think that person was? I would like them to come in here and explain the circumstances. I would like them to explain why our own members of parliament are being warned off, by their own colleagues, from meeting with individuals because it might upset the local embassy.


Do we have a problem in this country? I do not know. If I keep tugging this thread, I do not know how deep and wide and far it is going to unravel. But what I can tell you is that the aroma, the scent, that is emanating from just this one small, seemingly innocuous payment of $1,600 and the pattern to which it is attached make Senator Dastyari's position as Manager of Opposition Business entirely untenable. He needs to come in here and he needs to provide a more full explanation than he provided this morning, when he said: 'I disclosed it; I'm within the parliamentary requirements. It was just an error of judgement.' There is much more to this than that. How did it come to pass that another company paid his legal bills? How did it come to pass that the Top Education Institute was made aware of Senator Dastyari's obligations and debts to the Commonwealth? What sort of member of parliament thinks that it is okay to take the fat salary and all the benefits and perks that go with it but not repay the $1,600 themself? That person is not fit to occupy the position he currently occupies and, until a full explanation can be brought forward, I think it is incumbent upon the ALP to ask Senator Dastyari to stand aside. If he will not do that, then we need to have a much broader investigation into what is going on with the body politic in this country.


I make no bones about it: I have been on the record for years saying that we need donation reform. We need donation reform and we need to start thinking about how hospitality and donations to individuals are influencing parliamentary behaviour. As I said, I do not know of any other circumstance—and I am happy to stand corrected on this—where the personal debts of an individual senator, where they are owed to the Commonwealth of Australia, have been paid by what is effectively a very close entity of another sovereign government. This is not a case of raising a legal fund and crowdfunding it, or staving off bankruptcy or anything else like that; this is a case of a seemingly minor debt. All giant scandals begin with the tugging of just one thread, and I suspect that there is a giant scandal here. Until we can get to the bottom of it and until Senator Dastyari fully discloses and can assure the people of Australia, the people of this chamber and the parliament that there is nothing untoward in this, or in anything else that he has done, he needs to stand aside.


It gives me no pleasure to do that and to say that, but it is the integrity of this place that is more important in the eyes of the people than anything else. We can have our disagreements on policy views, we can call each other names, we can do a whole range of other things; but the fact that there is even a whiff, a hint, that there may be some corrupt practices going on is enough to justify our concern. The crisis of confidence in politics is universal because people are in it, seemingly, for themselves rather than for the people they are meant to represent. We need to change that. We need to change it, and we can start changing it by getting to the bottom of exactly what has transpired here.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-08-31,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:18):  I am pleased to participate in the address-in-reply to the Governor-General, and I will take up some of the issues that Senator Bernardi has raised in his contribution. For those who are listening in, bear with me; I have had the flu. A lot of people will understand how bad it has been for some people, so I hope my voice will last for the full 20 minutes.


This is the 45th parliament. It is a parliament where we see a weakened government and a weak Prime Minister for this country. I think that is the biggest threat to this country—not what Senator Bernardi has been talking about, but the threat of a weak Prime Minister; a Prime Minister who would stand up to Senator Bernardi. It is a bit rich for Senator Bernardi to be talking about outside influence when he has been influenced by the United States Tea Party and by some of the most right-wing groups ever in the US, and he brings that type of political culture—a culture of dividing the community—back into this country. It is a culture of destroying multiculturalism, a culture of denying that climate change is a serious issue in this country. So I will not be lectured by Senator Bernardi on anything to do with morality or the right thing. Senator Bernardi is the last person who should be standing up here lecturing anyone about people's judgement in this place.


If you had proper judgement you would not be taking the position Senator Bernardi is taking in leading the coalition on. He leads the right wing of the coalition in this place, and he is about destroying the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull. When I use the term 'leadership' I use it lightly, as the current Prime Minister has not demonstrated much leadership at all. He is completely at the mercy of people like Senator Bernardi; he is completely at the mercy of people like the right wing of the coalition, who hold the most extreme views in this country. You only have to look at the press over the last few days to see who is leading this Prime Minister by the nose. I will come back to the issue that Senator Bernardi raised a bit further down the track, but first let me get to the key issues I want to get on the record here today.


As I have said, we have a weak Prime Minister, a vacillating Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who owes his job to the right-wing extremists in the Liberal Party. We have a Prime Minister who said he had a plan for the economy during the last election, but let's remember what the plans for the economy were that the Prime Minister was backing. You cannot simply say that conservatism and liberalism in this country started afresh when Mr Turnbull became Prime Minister. It started under Tony Abbott, the former Prime Minister, with the lifters and leaners argument when he tried to divide the community by attacking those who were at the bottom of society in this country—attacking unemployed youth, attacking pensioners, attacking the working poor—while defending the big end of town and defending the banking industry in this country. We see that thread go straight from Prime Minister Abbott to Prime Minister Turnbull—a clear position—where they will defend the big end of town, where they will defend those who are rich and powerful against the working poor in this country. That is why we see Senator Bernardi so determined to attack Senator Dastyari, because Senator Dastyari has been exposing day in, day out this linkage between the right wing of the Liberal Party and the big end of town, and between the Liberal Party in general and the big end of town. 


So what did we get from the Prime Minister before the election? He indicated that he supported every aspect of that 2014-15 budget: young unemployed people with no money for six months; cuts to pensions; cuts to family tax benefits; cuts to the poorest in this country; attacks on penalty rates; attacks on the trade union movement—all designed to diminish the living standards of ordinary people in this country so that the money can flow back to the big end of town. That is what the current Prime Minister stood for. He stood for every aspect of that 2014-15 budget that increased inequality in this country and made this country a poorer country, because we would not stand up and look after the poorest people in the economy. 


So then we had Mr Turnbull stab Mr Abbott in the back. We had Mr Turnbull take over the leadership on the basis that he was going to articulate the issues that were required for the economy. He had a plan while the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, did not have the capacity to articulate the issues that were important for the economy. Well, Mr Turnbull has been an abject failure. It is not just Labor people who are saying that; the press are saying it and his own party members are saying it when you talk to them. They say: 'This guy is not delivering. He's weak. He won't stand up for anything. He's got no values. He's got no principles.' You have only got to look at how he performs every day. Having a deep baritone voice and presenting your case as if you are a Queen's Counsel does not make up for the fact that your case is wrong, that your case is bad, that your case is just not resonating with the Australian community.


This guy squeaked into power. If the election had probably gone another week, we would be sitting over there and the Liberals would be sitting on this side, because he was so incompetent. He just would not put the hours in. He was just lazy, incompetent, and had no vision, no policies and no priorities for ordinary working people in this country. That is the Prime Minister that we have at the moment in this country—a Prime Minister who cannot be trusted. Worse still, we have a Prime Minister who is incompetent. So he just gives up his values and his principles, if it means that he will personally benefit. 


Let's talk about people who personally benefit. Let's talk about Prime Minister Turnbull: he personally benefited by knifing the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott—the biggest personal benefit anybody would have: you knife the Prime Minister and you become the Prime Minister. You say you have a great plan for the economy, so what is the first plan you come up with? The first plan you come up with is a goods and services tax—a tax that will put more strain on working-class families' budgets, more strain on their standard of living and increase inequality in this country. 


That was the first economic plan from the Prime Minister, and the states said: 'No way. This is not fair. It's not good for our constituents.' Both Liberal and Labor premiers said: 'You've got it wrong. We're not going to accept this. This is not a plan that is fair. It's not a plan that is equitable. It's not a plan we're prepared to accept.' So the Prime Minister's first plan for the economy lasted a few weeks and then it just died. Then the Prime Minister, this incompetent Prime Minister, moved on. 


So what was the next big plan? The next big plan was reforming the Federation: the federal government would fund the private school system and the state governments would fund the state system. We all know what that would mean. It would mean that private schools would continue to get access to funding that would give them an opportunity to have wealthy families have their kids looked after in private schools while public schools would absolutely struggle to get more funding into the schools. So that was the second proposition: we would give taxing powers to the states, and the federal government would opt out of these areas.


This is classical conservatism—that you want small government. But I have to alert you to the fact that small government means nothing for Kerry Packer, for the billionaires in this country. It is not a problem. But if you are a working class family, if you are an Aboriginal person, if you are sick or if you are trying to get your child educated and you do not have a lot of money, small government means that you will never get a fair go in this country. You will never get a fair go. So, when you hear them talk about cutting taxes, when you hear them talking from the other side about small government, realise what that means. That means that working-class families in this country will get screwed by the conservatives. That is what it means.


That was his second big economic plan, and it was torpedoed. It did not last long. I think it lasted one day. I do not know why. I will tell you what. I do not think any Leader of the Liberal Party should ever go to the Panthers stadium in Penrith again, because every time they go out there they stuff it up so badly. You know that the former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, went out to the Panthers stadium and talked about no cuts to tax, no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to the SBS and no cuts to the ABC, and in the next budget they did all of those things. And then we had Prime Minister Turnbull going out and, in the morning, announcing this great change, the reform of Federation; the next day it was off the agenda.


Prime Minister Turnbull is simply incompetent. Prime Minister Turnbull just has not got it. I cannot think of a better analogy than Paul Keating's analogy: he is all tip and no iceberg—absolutely all tip and no iceberg, this guy. His own people do not believe he is competent, because they sacked him when he was the leader. They do not believe he can take this government through the full term, because he is incompetent. We know he is incompetent. Look at the two economic plans, and look at the third economic plan. This is his third economic plan in 12 months.


His third economic plan was jobs and growth, innovation, $50 billion of tax cuts to the big end of town, and what he describes as export trade agreements. Well, I do not see the jobs and growth. All I see is, in places like Elizabeth, in South Australia, jobs disappearing as the coalition—which Malcolm Turnbull was part of—chased GM and Toyota out of this country and destroyed high-skilled, high-paid jobs in this country. I do not see the jobs and growth there. On innovation, they were setting out to destroy the CSIRO. They had no care about innovation until the public said, 'We want to keep our scientists.' And tax cuts: $50 billion of tax cuts, including $8 billion of tax cuts to the banks that are ripping people off, day in, day out—$8 billion of tax cuts to the banks. Where is the economic sense and credibility in that? Again, the Prime Minister and his team are incompetent—absolutely incompetent.


Trickle-down economics has failed. Look at the United States. You can draw a graph in the United States from when Ronald Reagan slashed the taxes in the United States. If you put another line up against it which is inequality in the United States, you see taxes coming down for corporations, taxes coming down for the wealthy, and inequality shooting up. Well, this is Australia, Mr Turnbull; this is not the United States. Trickle-down economics has failed, and we will fight trickle-down economics. We would rather spend $50 billion on health, on education, on infrastructure, than hand it over on tax cuts on a failed economic theory.


Let me just go back. I just want to say quickly that I am very pleased to have been appointed shadow minister for skills and apprenticeships and shadow minister for housing and homelessness. We had Homelessness Week, and not one minister in this government thought it was important enough to make one statement about homelessness in this country—not one minister. I think that says everything about this government. It will look after its mates in Collins Street and at the big end of town, but if you are a rough sleeper, if you are living in overcrowded accommodation, if you cannot afford to buy a house, that is just bad luck. You are collateral damage to this mob's economic theories. This is a bad government. This is a weak, incompetent Prime Minister. I do not think they will see the three years out.


I just want to finish up on this. I have not known Sam Dastyari for that long, but I do know Sam Dastyari, Senator Dastyari, and I am convinced that Senator Dastyari is honest and capable and a good politician. Senator Dastyari himself, I think, has conceded that he made a mistake, and he has come in and he has indicated that here this morning. I think that what has been put forward by Senator Bernardi today is a big overstep in terms of the coalition. If you want to talk about corruption, let us talk about Stuart Robert. If you want to talk about corruption, let us talk about Senator Sinodinos and his appearances at ICAC. If you want to talk about corruption, let us talk about the Millennium Forum and the money that gets poured in by the big end of town, into the Liberals' pockets, day in, day out. Let us talk about the brown paper bags getting handed over in the back seats of the Bentleys in Newcastle. Do not come here and try to come after a decent politician, a good politician, on the basis of one mistake, when there have been systematic breaches of the law by the Liberal Party in New South Wales.


Do not tell me that if you are getting handed a brown paper bag in the back of a Bentley by a property developer, as a Liberal politician, you do not know there is a problem. Well, there is a problem. There should be a forensic examination of every Liberal politicians' election fund in this country, and then we will see where the Chinese money is going, then we will see where the money is coming from—the big end of town—and then we will see where the property developers' money is going.


Sam Dastyari is a decent human being. Senator Dastyari has stood this mob up on their ears. He has exposed their link to the big banks; they do not like it. Senator Dastyari will continue to do that. He will be a great politician in this place, and I support Sam Dastyari.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2016-08-31,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:38):  Well, what a difference a year makes. This time last year, Mr Turnbull's challenge to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's cringe-worthy prime ministership was actually still on the horizon and the coalition were still locked into the pretence that everything was going to work out fine for them. A year on, with 2016 election now receding fast into the political rear-view mirror, it is a good time to think about what has happened in the intervening year and what role this chamber is going to play as we enter more complex times.


I have on occasion seen the Hon. Sir Peter Cosgrove's ability to hold a room. He can be an excellent public speaker so none of what I am about to say is intended with any disrespect to him because obviously he has to deal with the material that he is given. What was presented to the parliament yesterday when we were all in here, I suppose, was meant to stand in for some kind of manifesto of the point of the Turnbull government for the next couple of years. The government were meant to really be establishing for the benefit of this chamber and for anybody watching outside of this room what their purpose is, why we would bother with them for the years to come. It felt to me as though he had been handed a bunch of crumpled notes, this weird laundry list of thoroughly mediocre incoherent talking points that were almost entirely indifferent to the actual challenges that face the country. With no disrespect to the Governor-General, whose role it was quite rightly to deliver this address to the parliament while we were all in here, but of those who wrote that material, you can only imagine a handful of people sealed into a room with their eyes glazed over.


What kind of agenda was presented to us yesterday? Where was the housing affordability crisis or the fact that $40 million was ripped from homeless services' capital budgets in the 2014 budget and not returned? Where was housing stress? Where was rental affordability? Where was the self-inflicted humanitarian catastrophe unfolding inside our immigration detention centres—many of them established by the Labor Party, the offshore islands in particular, when they were in government and retained and entrenched by those who hold office now? Where was the climate? Where was the single most important economic, humanitarian, environmental and security threat facing this country in that speech yesterday? Where was it?


A large fraction of the world is decarbonising, phasing out fossil fuel combustion. The agreement signed in Paris, imperfect as it was, sets a rough pathway forward for phasing out the fossil underpinnings of the crisis that is beginning to overwhelm the world. The coal industry is hitting the wall, one bankruptcy after another, including here in Australia. The international oil price is approaching historic postwar lows. The fracking industry has been fought to a standstill across large parts of the country. Where was all of that in yesterday's speech? 


I have discovered in these addresses that only happen reasonably infrequently that it is important to listen for what is not in the speech. What is the government seeking not to highlight? What is it less proud of? What is it choosing to ignore? What is being deprioritised or subordinated in these infrequent and rare addresses to the nation? There was certainly talk of innovation. If I can recall anything from the turnover between former Prime Minister Abbott and Minister Turnbull, which ignited a small spark of hope—it did not last long but was there—for myself and probably for many others in the country, was this talk of innovation. It was the talk of somebody who was digitally literate, who did not have his head stuck in a vanishing coal industry but who knew something about the telecommunications sector, by way of one single example, and recognised that we needed to transition to a more diversified economy. Where has all that talk of innovation gone? The words are still used. 


In the meantime, a bill is shortly to be presented to this parliament which would cut $1 billion from ARENA, which does the essential R&D and early commercialisation work for innovative clean energy technologies that will buy us a bit of time in the clean energy transition. The extraordinarily reckless attacks on CSIRO and the rest of the research community, and the unfolding debacle of the National Broadband Network will be revisited again within this parliament. These are the entities and the enabling infrastructure that can actually carry us into that more diversified and resilient economy. So the government can read all the buzzwords it likes into the parliamentary record or deliver impressive sounding headland speeches about agility and innovation, but we do not even really have to look under the bonnet to see what is going on here. It is a government that is desperately in hock to the fading fortunes of the extractive industries that have bordered with government on more than one occasion and have played backstop during debates like on the mining tax, for example, which completely skittled a Prime Minister and put the country fiscally on the backfoot for years. It is a government that is wedded to these industries. Instead of talking transition on behalf of the workforce in towns like Collie in the south-west of Western Australia, which has a very narrow economic base because it has provided the underpinnings of the power system—no pun intended—in Western Australia, or at least in the south-west, for a century, and instead of talking measured, realistic transitions for those workers, the government is simply burying its head in the sand and undercutting the very industries that could provide a pathway forward.


I want to quote briefly from Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III, a former US Pacific Commander of the US Navy. He has retired now. This is what he said in November 2015:


Today we find ourselves in a period of unprecedented global change – change that is … introducing significant emerging challenges to the global security environment. Foremost among these emerging challenges are the long-term security implications of climate change … 


These changes are prompting U.S. policymakers, decision-makers, and military planners … reevaluate and adjust our long-term ‘whole of government’ strategic priorities and approaches in the region.


We can critique all we like the way that the climate debate has played out in the United States—and, if anything, it has been uglier than what has unfolded here. But that is a very clear and precise statement from a very senior US military commander who is seeing the climate imperative roll through every dimension of his work. I—and no doubt Senator Whish-Wilson and my other Greens colleagues—will have more to say in this parliament about what security means in the 21st century, in a world where this energy transition is well underway, where the old priorities of protecting oil pipelines and shipping lanes out of the Persian Gulf may change quite rapidly in an energy transition where we are finally reaping the benefits of the near infinite supplies of solar energy, wind energy, wave energy and other renewable sources. Where was any of that in yesterday's speech? If this Prime Minister, who professes to understand the urgency of climate change and the importance of diversifying our economy away from low-value extractive industries toward value-adding, toward true green economics, uses the buzzwords—and what we saw yesterday was something completely different—where in the speech was the optimism?


In my home town at the moment there is a proposal afoot from Mr Turnbull's Liberal-National colleagues for the Perth Freight Link, a 19th-century piece of infrastructure—or we could be generous and say at least a mid-20th century piece of infrastructure. It has four to six lanes of tarmac through precious wetlands, through areas of great significance to the Whadjuk and Noongar people who have traversed and camped in that area for 40,000 years. The Barnett government is proposing to smash a freeway through that area to take trucks not all the way to Fremantle port but, actually, to several kilometres short of the port of Fremantle, where there will be a huge traffic pile-up.


Where were the 21st-century priorities for our settlements, for our cities? Where was the talk of rapid telecommunications, of rapid transit, of clean energy, of innovative fast-build housing to solve our housing supply crisis, of rebuilding biodiversity and, perhaps, most importantly, of becoming reunited with the concept of country by entering into treaty and measured negotiations that recognise sovereignty with the people who occupied this country for tens of thousands of years before the colonists arrived from over the horizon? These are the issues that the Australian Greens believe should be brought into the frame in the kind of speech that we heard yesterday. If the government had any vision to present for this country beyond the almost macabre political self-destruction that appears to be occurring behind the scenes on the first and second days in parliament, surely yesterday was the day to put it to us. There is nothing there but a kind of fevered emptiness.


I think there is a reason why media oligarchs beam 24/7 race hate and paranoia into outer metropolitan suburbs—and I gather we will be discussing media reform in this parliament before too long, because the government has a proposition to put to us to consolidate and entrench media ownership even more tightly than it already is. I think there is a reason why that race hate and that fear and that division is such a preoccupation of certain corners of the press—the beaming of those messages of division into outer metro suburbs and regional towns hit very hard by the slow-motion collapse of the commodities boom. There is a reason why people facing intergenerational unemployment and privatisation of basic health and education services are being offered Syrian refugees as convenient targets of their discontent. I would suggest that it is an old bait-and-switch trick that is probably as old as politics itself. If you are focusing your grievances on people even less fortunate than yourselves—Aboriginal mob, people fleeing Aleppo, people in cages on prison islands—then it is a lot less likely that you will end up on the barricades going up against the one per cent?


So our commitment and our priorities in this parliament and in those to come, as we link arms with those in our region and further afield who are doing it a lot tougher than ourselves, as we combine our numbers to support those here at home fighting for sovereignty, treaty and to get kids out of prison, and as we work every single day for the kind of economy that serves people and planet rather than treating both as disposable assets to be stripped and discarded, I cannot help but recall the words of Arundhati Roy, who said:


Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:52):  I rise to support my colleague Senator Hume's motion on the address-in-reply to the address by the Hon. Governor-General of Australia in this place yesterday. Madam Deputy President, I firstly congratulate you on your election to the position of Deputy President of the Senate. I also congratulate those who have been elected or re-elected to this place and to the other place for the 45th Parliament. I place on record my acknowledgement of the excellence of colleagues who in the 44th Parliament were in this chamber with me and, to my disappointment, were not re-elected: David Johnston, from Western Australia; Sean Edwards, from South Australia; Richard Colbeck, from Tasmania; and Jo Lindgren, from Queensland. The place will be poorer for their absence. I also note that Luke Simpkins, the previous member for Cowan, was unsuccessful. I congratulate his successor, Ms Anne Aly, who is now the new member for Cowan.


What the Governor-General yesterday highlighted for this country was the awesome responsibility that the 226 of us—150 in the other place and 76 in this place—have in the 45th Parliament, and beyond, and our responsibility to the people of Australia. Each of us is accountable to the wider community for how we manage the Australian economy in the immediate future, and beyond, and for the signals that we will give to the business community and the welfare community, pensioners and those with disabilities, those who will be relying on the decisions of this parliament to guide their future. I say that in the context of contrasting 2007-08 with 2016. I do so because in 2008-09 we faced a global financial crisis, and, from my experience of many years in business and my contacts both here in Australia and overseas, I can say without any doubt or contradiction that there are black clouds over the world economy and, whilst Australia is strong, with a AAA rating, we are by no means immune from the impact of the world economy. 


I want to explain that in some more detail, but let me give you these figures by way of setting the scene, Deputy President. In 2007 this country had no net debt. It was debt free. By 2013 it had $317 billion of debt. Now we have $430 billion and we are racing to $667 billion. I turn to deficit. For those of you in the public gallery perhaps not so familiar with it, deficit is the difference between what you earn and what you spend. If you spend more than you earn, then you have a deficit. There was no deficit in this country in 2007. By 2013, when the Abbott government assumed power, the accumulated deficit was $240 billion, and of course it is now even higher. In 2007, facing what was to become a global financial crisis, we had money in the bank. We had some $30 billion to $40 billion earning interest. Today the bickie barrel is empty. We have no cash in the bank.


Reserve Bank Governor Stevens in 2008, at the commencement of the global financial crisis, had a cash rate of some 7.25 per cent with which he could manipulate monetary policy, at a time when other advanced economies around the world—the UK, the US, Canada, France, Italy, countries with whom we are often compared—were already down at 1½ per cent in their cash rates. Our cash rate was 7.25 per cent in 2007-08. As we know today, in one of his last acts as Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Stevens—and I congratulate him as he moves towards his retirement—brought the cash rate down to a historic level of 1.5 per cent. Effectively there is nowhere else to go. He cannot use that as a manipulative tool anymore. Why? Because generally one of the effects of reducing the cash rate is to also bring down the value of the Australian dollar, which makes our exports more competitive, but, as we all know, the other day, following the reduction in the cash rate from 1.75 to 1.5 per cent, the Australian dollar actually went up. So clearly that manipulative tool has now ceased to work.


In 2007-08 China was wanting to buy everything that Australia had—iron ore, coking coal, thermal coal, gas, you name it. Today the Chinese economy is looking very, very subdued. In 2007-08 the value, the price, of iron ore—and, for that matter, LNG—was up over $150 a tonne. Today they are both scratching at around $45 and $50 a tonne. I say these things because there are those who do not understand that, if this country is to move, as the rest of the world is moving, towards stark economic times, we have got very little fat left in our system. I urge people to be well aware of it. If ever there was a time to help your generation—through you, Deputy President, to the young people in the gallery—and indeed your children's generation, when and if you have them, it is now, by returning the budget to balance.


What is the impact of those figures I just gave you? Just reflect on this for a moment. This country is borrowing $1.2 billion a month not to repay the debt, just to pay the interest. We are borrowing offshore against your futures just to pay the interest on the debt. What does that translate to? It translates to two to three new primary schools per day, seven days a week, that this country is not building because we are borrowing $1.2 billion a month. In the Deputy President's and my home city of Perth, we are just concluding the construction of a new children's hospital. One point two billion dollars, one month's interest on the debt, would pay for that hospital in its entirety. Those are the sorts of figures that we are talking about.


I then ask you to reflect on what is happening in the world and what happened in Britain recently, where they voted to leave the European Economic Community, and all of the impacts that is having. The United States would have the two least popular candidates in history leading up to their presidential election in November, and who knows what the impact will be on the United States. Russia will technically be in recession today and Eastern Europe is looking very, very shaky. I am pleased that a person with much more economic background than me is in the chamber, Senator Whish-Wilson. Japan and Switzerland, both First World countries, at the moment have negative interest rates. If somebody puts money in the bank in Tokyo or in Bern, they are actually paying the bank to have those funds in the bank with them. China, as I mentioned, has some significant difficulties and its growth rate has declined. As my predecessor speaking before me mentioned, there is a downturn in the oil and gas industry. Have a look at those countries in the world that produce oil and gas—the Middle East region, Eastern Europe, Africa. With the exception of the United States, most of those countries have difficult economies.


The Australian community expects us to have money for homelessness, for affordable housing, for health and for education, but as we all know in our own homes, in our small businesses—if we have been or are in small business—and indeed as it is in the nation, it is the case that if we are spending more than we are earning then we are in deficit, then we accumulate debt and then we must pay the interest on the debt. As the Minister for Employment comes into the room, I remind you all again that the $1.2 billion a month interest that we are paying on the debt is at the low rate of 1.5 per cent. Imagine if and when interest rates go up to three or four per cent where we are going to be in that space.


Where are our income taxes being spent? I received my own tax return only the other day and printed on it for me was an indicator of where my tax goes, and it would be similar for those who pay tax in this country. Thirty-nine per cent of my tax goes on welfare and, within that 39 per cent, 40 per cent on the aged, just 25 per cent on families and 24 per cent on disability. Eighteen and a half per cent of my tax goes on health, 8.7 per cent on education and 8.7 per cent on defence. My contribution to the interest on that government debt is absorbing four per cent of my tax that I pay and it is more than our transport and communications cost of 2.3 per cent. I say to my colleagues in this place that we have an awesome responsibility to the people of Australia to see that we return this budget to surplus so that we will have the adequate cash necessary to maintain the services across our community at the highest level that we all enjoy.


In the time available I want to speak a little about legislative issues. The first one I want to speak about is the legislation that will come, I think, before the chamber associated with Country Fire Authority of Victoria volunteers. The minister, much more eloquently than I, will be able to share with the parliament what the objectives are in this space, but they are largely directed at ensuring that volunteers in our emergency services—fire, rescue, marine rescue, the State Emergency Service et cetera—will enjoy the continued protection that all of our volunteers must have. I declare my interest here, as a past chief executive of the Bush Fires Board of Western Australia—a proud organisation which, when it existed, and I was its last chief executive, had 58 staff and 19,000 volunteers. Why do I make that point? I make it because it is not just about the CFA at all; it is a national issue and everybody in Australia is watching what is happening.


I am disappointed that my colleague, Senator Gavin Marshall, is not in the chamber at the moment because it has been put to me that in some way I am opposed to the United Firefighters Union. Let me place on the record that I have no such opposition. If the head of the United Firefighters Union of Australia, Mr Peter Marshall, was in the chamber now, I am sure he would acknowledge that. And why would he? He would acknowledge it because he sat in the public gallery of this very chamber in November 2011 when this place unanimously passed legislation which would ensure that firefighters who had picked up carcinogens and now have cancers due to their firefighting activities would be covered by workers compensation. Prior to that, they would not have been covered. If they could not prove which fire it was in the past, what the carcinogen was or where they were and when they were there, they did not have a workers comp claim.


Mr Peter Marshall came to a committee of the Senate and he asked for seven cancers to be recognised as those that would be supported in terms of cancers which firefighters in Australia now have. I say with a high degree of pride that, by the end of that process, we did not accept Mr Peter Marshall's request for seven such cancers; we widened it to 13 cancers, because international evidence from the Canadians, the Americans, the British and others was that there were 14 cancers that could be ascribed through medical epidemiology to be due to their jobs as firefighters. The one that I was not willing to accept was that of melanomas and skin cancers. Why? Because Australians have such a propensity for them.


I know Senator Marshall had a task in his caucus, as indeed I did, but I acknowledge fully the support I got from the now foreign minister, Ms Julie Bishop, from my then leader, Senator Abetz, and from my then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, for that contention by the union to allow us to pass that legislation. I give you that background simply because, as Mr Peter Marshall was right in 2011, he is wrong in 2016 to pick volunteers. The CFA is the senior fire organisation in this country, and I believe it probably has the highest number of paid and volunteer officers of any fire service in the world. 


I will make this point for the first time ever. My mentor, when I ran the Bush Fires Board, was a gentleman by the name of Mr Len Foster, who at the time was the head of the Country Fire Authority in Victoria. He is now in his retirement. In 2011, I rang him up, I got him off a golf course and I said: 'Len, the firefighters union and Slater & Gordon, the legal firm representing them, have come before us with a request for seven cancers to be recognised. Do you think the case is valid?' He said: 'Chris, this is something we should have dealt with years ago. If you can achieve this for firefighters, you will have done the right thing.' So it is now known publicly for the first time ever that the advice that I took was from none other Len Foster. 


I will tell you the other thing that Len Foster taught me. He said to me, 'Do not ever make the mistake of equating volunteerism to amateurism.' He said, 'If I have appropriately trained, equipped, skilled and resourced paid officers and volunteers in the CFA, each of them will do the exactly equivalent job.' Unfortunately, Mr Marshall is trying to arrange a situation in which, for example, volunteers would never have to give orders to a paid officer and in which if a scale of operation got to a certain level, only paid officers would be eligible to go ahead and do that work. In other words, volunteers would be downgraded and belittled. I have even heard this in our home state of Western Australia following the bushfires that occurred in the summertime at Esperance, Yarloop and Waroona. That is why I say that this is not confined to the CFA; it is linked nationally. The representative of the firefighters union in Perth mentioned, 'We have the professionals who are the paid officers and we have the volunteers,' meaning the well-meaning amateurs. That is a fundamental error. It is an insult. 


Of course, in our home state of WA, with its one million square miles of land mass, it is volunteers who have the skill, the equipment, the interest, the devotion and the availability to actually handle the fires and the incidents of the type about which I speak. So if and when this legislation comes before this chamber, I will speak in far greater detail and I will urge this place to ensure the passage of the legislation that Minister Cash will be proposing.


In the few minutes left available to me I will stay on the theme of fire, because we are coming up to another bushfire season. 




Senator Williams:
  You're on fire!




Senator BACK:
  Of course, around Australia we know that there are going to be significant bushfires even in New South Wales. Through you, Deputy President: I understand, Senator Williams, for once you are having a decent cropping season.


I say this following a Senate inquiry chaired by my old colleague Senator Bill Heffernan, who we also miss dearly. We had an inquiry following the Black Saturday fires in Victoria in February 2009. Amongst other things, the recommendation of that inquiry was that the Productivity Commission be tasked to see where the Commonwealth government's funds could best be spent in mitigation and reduction of fires, which ultimately are a state and territory responsibility. The Productivity Commission indicated that if the Commonwealth spent its money in prevention and preparation there was a $9 to $1 return to the Australian community, but if the Commonwealth did nothing but wait around for what we call the response and recovery—in other words, waiting for the fires to occur and then trying to be involved in combating them and in recovery afterwards—there was scarcely a $1 for $1 value. The message I want to leave you on that theme is there needs to be far more expenditure in prevention and in preparation rather than in response and recovery.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Back, and thank you for your congratulations.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-08-31,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:12):  The Governor-General's speech on behalf of the Turnbull government failed on many counts. It failed on one of the most critical issues that this government should be grappling with: how we protect our democracy. The word democracy did not actually appear in the speech at all. There was a vague mention of democracies in general but not Australian democracy and the urgent reforms that are needed. 


We know that critical issues bedevil our society. Democracy—that is, the involvement of people in every way possible, in a most democratic way—will be critical to solving those issues, particularly around climate change but also in addressing inequality, environmental issues and social justice issues. People have a right to have a say and a right to be involved. It is particularly critical for this parliament, where corporate power dominates. It is so hard to get reforms in around lobbyists, around political donations and around how parliament itself works. This new parliament has just kicked off, but again you can bet your bottom dollar that corporate power will be the core problem in how this parliament works.


The Greens have a suite of measures to deal with this, and I hope I have time to get to them. But right now what I think is particularly relevant—and it is relevant because it comes from the Prime Minister's home state—is the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, ICAC. It is also very relevant because Malcolm Turnbull is the Prime Minister and he needs to be learning those lessons in New South Wales and ensuring that we improve and safeguard our democracy at a federal level. Yesterday, in New South Wales, the Spicer report was handed down. Now what is centre stage of so many of the problems that have come out through the work of ICAC and through the Spicer report is the Free Enterprise Foundation, and it rears its head time and time again. Essentially, it is a slush fund for the Liberal Party, and it should be wound up by the Prime Minister as a first step in a major overhaul of political donations. That should have happened before the election. We went through a whole election where, again, the Prime Minister was not addressing this, and neither was the Leader of the Opposition. At the very least, they should have disclosed the donations they were taking. It is long overdue to have donations disclosed in real time. But I will come to the changes that are needed shortly.


The New South Wales Electoral Commission has confirmed what many have suspected for a long time: that the Free Enterprise Foundation has been used by senior Liberal officials as a way to offer anonymity to donors. The New South Wales ICAC has received evidence that the Free Enterprise Foundation was used to wash prohibited donations. So it sits there as a major problem, and a problem at the heart of the Liberal Party and this very government.


But let us look at the Spicer report itself. It probably was a bit unfortunate that it came out on the first day of parliament. Maybe some of my colleagues here did not have time to give it the attention that it deserved. But I certainly urge that they really tune in to what is going on here. The statements I have heard previously from members, in the numerous debates we have had about political donations, and particularly about corruption, that, 'We don't need a national ICAC because we don't have corruption here,' are just sounding more and more ludicrous. How do you know what goes on if you do not have a body to investigate it?


But back to the Spicer report: the findings are damning. It is an explosive report of prohibited donations, funds and non-disclosures leading up to the Liberal Party state election campaign in 2011. The report found that groups associated with the Liberal Party funnelled political donations through the Free Enterprise Foundation to avoid scrutiny. There it is again—more evidence, clearly set out in the findings. Clearly, the intent of senior Liberals here was to accept money from developers, who are prohibited donors in New South Wales—and they knew it. They knew it. This was clearly meant, once those laws came in in New South Wales, to get around them. The great irony here is that, coming into that election in 2011, the Liberals and Nationals were clearly going to win—Labor was so on the nose. But they were so locked in to taking political donations that they were actually breaking the law to do it.


Going back to the report: former Liberal MPs also sought to evade the law around the disclosure of donations and a ban on property donors in New South Wales. They included former police minister Michael Gallacher, former energy minister Chris Hartcher, and former Liberal MPs Garry Edwards, Tim Owen, Andrew Cornwell and Chris Spence. How embarrassing—all those Liberals caught up in these scams, in this breaking of the law. Another two former Liberal MPs, Craig Baumann and Darren Webber, evaded the disclosure of developer donations.


But it does not stop with the Liberals. Former Labor MP Joe Tripodi engaged in serious corruption.


And, while there were no adverse findings against Senator Sinodinos by the New South Wales ICAC, the Australian Electoral Commission found that he had been involved in what they called 'arrangements'—again, in their words—that:


… provided the factual and legal matrix upon which non-disclosure was made by the Party.


It is quite delightful, the way that was expressed! But I will come back to Senator Sinodinos shortly.


The Free Enterprise Foundation, as I have said, was used to channel donations to the Liberal Party for its state election campaign in New South Wales, again—and it needs to be repeated time and time again—to disguise the true identity of donors. That means that you are getting around the law; that is what is going on here. There are all these people who get up and say they want to uphold the law, and who abuse people who try and improve society. This is about undermining democracy and thwarting attempts to ensure that the public knows who is donating to political parties. What it really highlights is that we need to bring in bans and caps on political donations.


To go back to the report: there was an example of a cheque sent to the Free Enterprise Foundation from Lindsay Partridge, the managing director of Brickworks Limited. The cheque was to the value of $125,000. It came with a letter that said: 'We trust this donation will provide assistance with the 2011 New South Wales state election campaign.' Brickworks received government grants totalling $17 million, including $14.6 million of grants relating to the Clean Technology Investment Program.


The relationship between the government and Brickworks Limited does warrant federal investigation, and I pay tribute to the former Greens parliamentary leader, Christine Milne, who requested that Operation Spicer investigate the grants in 2014. She was told that the New South Wales ICAC does not have the jurisdiction to do that, and I would again say that that is further evidence of why we need a national ICAC.


The Operation Spicer report has shone a light on the deep web of lies, dishonesty and corruption in New South Wales, but it does not stop at borders. Nobody can argue that any further.


Some of the findings of the report, including the commentary on Brickworks, warrant investigation at a federal level. This really does put the spotlight on the need, as I have said—and we will say it more often and more loudly: there is a need for a national ICAC.


It is no wonder that the Liberal, Labor and Nationals parties do not want to back the Greens' call for such a commission or our call for far-reaching reforms around political donations, because they are just locked in. Just as we saw Labor, Liberal and Nationals voting together today on the terms of parliament, doing a deal there to benefit themselves, here we are seeing them backing each other up and not bringing in the reforms that are so needed.


I saw it in New South Wales: the scandals get to a point where you cannot but bring in the reforms. Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten should really move before their parties get caught up in the scandals that inevitably will flow.


What is happening with the New South Wales ICAC is getting us closer. It is starting to open up this Free Enterprise Foundation. But we have not heard the whole story by any means.


In April this year, Labor and the coalition voted down a Greens Senate motion for an equivalent of a federal corruption watchdog, and in May they voted down a motion calling for political donation reform. So it is on the record—how Liberals, Nationals and Labor are working together on these issues.


I will just say a little bit, which is obviously relevant to this discussion, about Senator Sinodinos. Senator Sinodinos had both a relationship with Australian Water Holdings and his role as treasurer of the Liberal Party. This issue has been canvassed considerably, and I acknowledge that the Liberal Party is out there saying that he has been cleared of any wrongdoing. But, again, I would urge people to read much of the evidence as well as the final report, because while there were no adverse findings against Senator Sinodinos the Electoral Commission did find it necessary to report, as I said, on the so-called arrangements he was engaged with.


What we do know is that Senator Sinodinos in 2009 signed a letter as finance director of the New South Wales Liberal Party to MPs and senators, warning that the changes that occurred in the law in New South Wales with regard to donations would have a significant adverse impact on the party's fundraising ability. Now, I acknowledge that the fact that that was said could be interpreted as the now senator doing his job. What is interesting is that in three days the Liberal Party received $629,000 from one donor, but no-one on the finance committee, including Senator Sinodinos, admitted to knowing anything about this. What is significant—and remember the figure, $629,000, which is obviously a lot of money—is that the records show that in the year before the prohibition on donations from property developers the Free Enterprise Foundation donated only $50,000 to the New South Wales Liberal Party. So is it a fair assumption that there were those working in the Liberal Party who realised that once the law came in they needed a way to launder donations, and that is why we saw such a huge increase in the amount of money coming from the Free Enterprise Foundation once the ban on developer donations came in? And I do want to put on the record that the Greens, in the early 2000s, moved a bill for a ban on developer donations, something that we were ridiculed about in the New South Wales parliament.




Senator Williams:
  I bet you didn't ban Wotif.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I am happy to acknowledge the interjection from the senator. What we saw, and why eventually Labor brought in the change to the law, is that it became so onerous, so smelly in terms of how developers were interacting with the Labor government, that Labor, at the death knell of their time in government, brought in this legislation. We now know that people who were connected with the Liberal Party then came up with ways to accept the money.


When Senator Sinodinos was questioned by ICAC, when he gave evidence, his replies regularly were, 'I cannot recollect one way or the other'. Another response from him was, 'It was not a process I involved myself in.' He certainly had many phrases that would trip off his tongue to say that he was unaware of these things going on. Again, when you read the evidence, when you read the reports, you are left with the impression that when it comes to Senator Sinodinos we have not heard the full story. There are now more and more voices coming out talking about the need for political donation reform. And, while I have expressed concern at the failure of the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister to take this up during the election period, people associated with their parties have taken it up. I pay tribute to former senator Mr Faulkner, because it is something that I know he really did try to advance. And I was very interested that just recently former Treasurer Mr Wayne Swan spoke about the possible adverse influence of overseas donations. So the voices are starting to build up, and the momentum is there for change. This is where we need leadership from both sides, for the opposition and government to actually act.


What is also very relevant when considering the momentum that is occurring around the need for reforms regarding political donations is a High Court case last year that was precisely about developer donations. Again, I have spoken about this before, and I will continue to use this case in this debate, because it is very significant in that the court analysed the very nature of corruption, the nature of political donations and the impact they are having. The case makes the point that corruption in Australia has largely moved beyond quid pro quo corruption to what the High Court describes as a more subtle kind of corruption known as 'clientelism'. This kind of patron-client corruption comes about when a politician or a political party becomes so dependent on the financial support of a wealthy patron that they—and these are the words of the High Court—'compromise the expectation, fundamental to representative democracy, that public power will be exercised in the public interest'. The essence of the problem we have here—




Senator Williams:
  Just like the CFMEU.




Senator RHIANNON:
  and I again acknowledge that we have a Nationals senator keen to interject on this issue—is that we are starting to have a really serious breakdown in MPs who come into this place with the commitment to work for the public good. And it has been set out so clearly by the High Court. The High Court also said:


Unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalise. The best means of prevention is to identify and to remove the temptation.


That is precisely why the Greens have brought forward a series of private member's bills on this issue, and we will take it up in the JSCEM in great detail and do everything we can to advance the need for reform here. 


I also want to acknowledge the words of the former Leader of the Opposition, when the Liberals and Nationals were in opposition, John Hewson. He wrote yesterday that 'the major parties know exactly what needs to be done' but they do not act because they 'each believe that they can better exploit' the current system, where political donations can be taken, 'to their electoral advantage'. It is really disturbing that you can have a former opposition leader identifying that the self-interest of the major parties in this parliament is absolutely undermining democracy because they are so hooked on taking political donations. Effectively, I would argue that Mr Hewson endorses the Greens position to cap donations and to have them declared in real time and online. Today, TheSydney Morning Herald editorial echoes these calls. It concludes:


Money should not buy access to, or influence with, public officials. The intention to evade the law relating to donations is unacceptable, even if the ICAC cannot legally call it corruption any more.


So there is momentum for change here.


As I said in my opening remarks, it is incredibly disappointing that the word 'democracy' did not figure in this major speech that supposedly is to outline the priorities of the current Turnbull government. That is why I have given over my whole speech to this issue of democracy and to the need for reform around political donations. It really goes to the heart of how we work as senators. Are we able to represent the public good or are we going to be compromised by the corporate interests who continue to attempt to—and so often do—dominate this place?

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2016-08-31,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  I rise to contribute to this debate. It is always good to follow Senator Rhiannon when we talk about political donations. It is very interesting that $1.58 million, I believe, was donated by Wotif founder, Graeme Wood, to the Greens for the 2010 election. I wonder about the loyalties there.


The election we just had was about the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Who is voting against it? The Labor Party are and, of course, the Greens are. What is this policy that we want to introduce—which we went to a double dissolution on—about? It is about corruption in the building industry. Deloittes say it costs $6 billion a year through loss of production, rorting and overcharging, whether it be for private buildings or for public sector buildings like hospitals et cetera. Of course, the CFMEU vehemently oppose this. And who donates to the Greens and to the Labor Party? Madam Acting Deputy President Polley, you would be aware of how many hundreds of thousands of dollars the CFMEU have given to the Greens and to the Labor Party. That is just part of the contribution of some $100 million over the last 20 years from the union movement to the Australian Labor Party. We talk about political donations and influence. I wonder why the Greens so vehemently oppose cleaning up corruption in the building industry. Why is that? Do they condone the behaviour? Do they condone the $6 billion worth of rorts?


It was quite amazing to read in the Guardian that, in a recent interview with former Senator Bob Brown on the ABC's 7.30 program, former Senator Bob Brown 'intensified his attack on sitting NSW Greens senator Lee Rhiannon, accusing her of holding the party back, not hitting a chord with voters and introducing factionalism to the party'. Those are pretty powerful words from a former leader, aren't they, Madam Acting Deputy President? The article went on to say:


The power struggle between elements of the NSW party and the other states has long been a feature of internal Green politics but it is increasingly spilling into the public arena—this time ahead of a NSW preselection.


Brown said the NSW Greens party was a 'long term disappointment' which 'lags right behind' and had consistently opposed simple party reforms which the public expected.


'The incumbents in New South Wales—certainly that’s Lee in the Senate—have given great service, but are not hitting a chord with the voters at the moment and we need to move on,' he told the ABC’s 7.30 program.


That is what he told the ABC's 7.30 program.


Following on from Senator Back's comments here in relation to fires and the CFA, the dispute in Victoria and the union bullying by the Victorian government as we went to the federal election, I have said for years that the biggest problem we have with bushfires in Australia is actually controlling the vegetation, the fuel, in national parks. The Greens, with their great friends the National Parks Association, pursue this policy of locking up and leaving country. When it rains this leads to the fuel level getting higher and higher as the grass grows and then of course it gets struck with lightning and away it goes. We cannot control the heat—although some think we might—and we cannot control the wind, but, to a certain extent, we can control the level of fuel on the ground by allowing grazing and reducing the fuel. Once you get to five or 10 tonnes per hectare of fuel, on a 40 degree day with 50 kilometre winds the fire is uncontrollable—as we saw on Black Saturday, with all that country, a lot of it in national parks, burned and, sadly, with so many lives and houses lost. I remember seeing the story of one bloke who cleared the country around his house and his sheds. I think he faced a $50,000 fine under vegetation laws in Victoria. His house was the only house not burned down. The insurance company should have paid his fine, because they did not have to rebuild his house. He used a common-sense approach to reduce the fuel levels around his house and its surroundings and his house was saved—but, of course, it is wrong to disturb the native vegetation, according to some of the greenies and their policies.


I will go back to the Governor-General's speech yesterday. I am glad the election is over. It was a filthy election campaign. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would have heard things like, 'The coalition government is going to privatise Medicare.' What a load of rot!




Senator Rhiannon:
  You would if you could.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take the interjection, Senator Rhiannon. How are you going to privatise a business—that is, Medicare—that earns $10 billion a year and spends $20 billion a year? Who is going to be the foolish investor that would buy that company? Perhaps the Greens would be foolish enough to buy it. It would be like having a coffee business that collects $10,000 a week in business and spends $20,000 a week. Who is going to buy that? It was just a political scare campaign.


But it got worse as you went north in New South Wales to the seat of New England, where former member Tony Windsor came out of retirement to take on the agriculture minister and Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce. We had the CFMEU, the MUA, the nurses union, the Teachers Federation—all the unions. We had GetUp! All the lefties lined up behind Mr Windsor, putting in their resources and manning the booths. They came from everywhere. I was even speaking to a bloke from Canberra who travelled up to Tamworth to hand out in a pre-poll. The left-wing alignment had a big orchestrated campaign to oust Minister Barnaby Joyce. Of course, it did not happen. The result was almost 60-40 two-party preferred. It was an outstanding win for Minister Joyce, and he deserved it, because he works hard and he has good policies. But it was a grubby campaign, the grubbiest I have seen—tearing down corflutes, removing corflutes, putting paintwork on corflutes and signs. It was just disgusting and it was getting worse.


From the Governor-General's words yesterday, there is certainly a lot to be very optimistic about. I refer to agricultural industries. We have record beef prices. In fact, they are so high I am getting very worried they might be too high in some regards. If they become too high, our processors would find it very hard to compete overseas. They would probably lose money. I have been around long enough to know what happens when markets get too high—we often have a crash. I hope that does not happen to the beef industry. The lamb industry is looking brilliant, with good demand even though sheep numbers are down. Lamb prices and mutton prices are very good. There are record prices for chickpeas. The cotton industry is doing very well. The wool industry is going great. There are certain concerns in relation to the grain industry, and of course the dairy industry is having a very tough time. I am pleased that the ACCC is having a good look at that industry and at some of the contracts that the milk producers have had to face. I does make it tough when the world price of milk products falls. We produce around nine billion litres of milk a year in Australia and we consume around 4½ billion litres, so about half our milk production relies on the world price and the Australian dollar. It is good to see that the situation is improving. Milk powder, having dropped to around $1,500 a tonne, is now back up to $2,300 a tonne. It had been over $5,000 a tonne. In tough times it is good to see that Minister Joyce and the government are out there supporting dairy farmers and giving them all the help they can.


Manufacturing has been a tough industry in Australia. Can I say proudly that we have a company in Inverell, where I live now, called Boss Engineering. Seven years ago when they kicked off they employed seven people. They build air seeders, tillage machinery. They now employ 90 people, so they have gone from seven employees to 90 employees in seven years. They build a great product—I would say the best in the world. They have a great future. If we can do it with agricultural machinery, we can do it with other things.


The big discussion at the moment is the backpackers tax. I said in my maiden speech in this place on 15 September 2008 that some of our unemployed needed a touch on the backside with a cattle prod to get them off their backside to go and get a job. I stand by that. We have some 735,000 people unemployed, but they cannot pick our fruit and they cannot work in our abattoirs. We are relying on backpackers to do that work. What is wrong? When I was a young fellow, it was an absolute shame to be unemployed. That is why I picked up a handpiece and learnt to shear sheep. Once I could shear sheep, I was never out of a job—never. I was shearing during the shearing season and crutching during the autumn season et cetera.


We have a problem with labour, with people doing basic work. It might not be the highest paid job in the world, but it is an important job to pick our fruit, to get our harvest done, to actually feed people—and much of the product is exported. But, with 735,000 people unemployed, we cannot do it; we are relying on backpackers. I think the backpackers tax should be reduced to a 15 per cent flat rate. I think 32½ per cent is far too high. Sadly, so many businesses rely on backpackers to come and do that important work when it needs to be done, at harvest time especially. The government is reviewing this, and, no doubt, I hope, it will be sorted out very soon. 


As far as the debt goes, are we just going to be a selfish generation? Are we just going to borrow and borrow and borrow each and every day, build government debt and make our children and grandchildren pay for it? All senators in this chamber, when it comes to budget savings, must think about the future generations of Australians. Look what our forebears did for us—built the nation, fought the wars, developed a great country. We need to preserve that for future generations. But, of course, politics will be played. In the last parliament we saw the Labor Party propose some $5 billion of savings in their budget, and then they oppose their own savings in here, just to play politics, to add more debt, to add more to the interest bill. That is bad policy. My greatest concern is the debt we are growing up—now some $435 billion of gross debt and growing. We cannot touch the Future Fund. We cannot demand that the $25 billion or so of HECS-HELP fees be paid up tomorrow. That cannot happen. I think we all have to take a bit of pain. 


Under the proposed superannuation changes, I am going to be paying about $9,000 extra a year. I do not have a lot of super. I came into this place eight years ago with virtually no super and I will be retiring in three years time—I have made no secret of that. I am here for a three-year term and then I am off to spend some time with my wife, my children and my grandchildren. I am looking forward to my fourth grandchild being born in early October. The due date is 4 October; it might be a bit earlier. Becky, all the best to you and your husband, Pat, for the safe arrival of your second child.


I will wind up, because in the matter of a minute or so we will move on to senators statements, and you have a very interesting speaker first up, Madam Acting Deputy President.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  I noted that you will be called very promptly, Senator Williams.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  In this parliament, let us hope that we work together to see that we get the budget in order, that we get our businesses growing, that we get jobs out there and that we get exports growing. We do rely a lot on exports in this country, especially agriculture. It is good to see the agricultural industry looking good and the future looking very bright. 


I am worried about the grain industry: $205 a tonne for wheat is a very disappointing price. I remember back in 2002 that it was $330 a tonne, and it is now back to $205 a tonne. I wonder if any workers out there were working on $330 a day back in those days and are on $200 a day now, but that is what the wheat growers are facing. There are some tough times with oversupply around the world. I hope they hang in there and look after their industries well and market the wheat well. I would be very happy if the Australian dollar fell another 5c or 6c and went back to 70c. 


But the future is looking good. I do hope that everyone in the Senate makes a good contribution to the future of  our nation in this upcoming 45th Parliament.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much for your contribution, Senator Williams.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2016-08-31,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I want to talk about white-collar crime, which I have pursued in this place, basically, since day one. In 2009 I launched the inquiry into the liquidators industry. We went through the liquidators industry, where many wrongdoings and corruption were highlighted. One liquidator went to jail for six years with a non-parole period of three years and is now out. There were other wrongdoings there. It was a good report. We produced a unanimous bipartisan report, but, sadly, the Labor Party in government did absolutely nothing with the insolvency practitioners industry—nothing at all. They did not even introduce the recommendations. We got nowhere until this government came in, and now we have cleaned that industry up. Most importantly, come 1 January next year, liquidators doing a job liquidating a business can be sacked by a majority vote of the creditors. That is going to keep them right on their toes.


We had a situation where Stuart Ariff, who was jailed, was liquidating a business called CarLovers. It cost CarLovers—a Malaysian car wash company—$1.8 million, from memory, in legal fees to have their liquidator removed. From now on, that will cost nothing but a vote of the creditors. Liquidators should be working for the creditors, and I am very pleased to say that we have made great steps forward to clean the industry up.


In relation to ABCC, as I said in my previous speech in this place today, Labor and the Greens will not support cleaning up the building industry. Why? It is probably because of the huge donations that the unions, especially the CFMEU, make to those political parties. It is amazing that Senator Rhiannon always talks about doing the right thing here with donations, et cetera. Perhaps Senator Rhiannon would like to come into this chamber and give us a speech on the Greens and their donations from the CFMEU and other unions, and on why they will not support the cleaning up of the building industry.


In 2011 I launched an inquiry into banks here in Australia. It was a very good inquiry. It was amazing—we came across a lot of problems. I remember one very clearly: a bank manager had given a 30-year loan to a 97-year-old lady who was in an aged-care facility. I remember Senator Cameron saying in the inquiry: 'How old did you say she was, Senator Williams?' I said: 'Ninety-seven, Senator Cameron, and she's in an aged-care facility.' Senator Cameron's response was: 'It must be a bloody good aged-care facility!' A 30-year-loan was given to a 97-year-old lady! The investment, of course, went bad; it was a Ponzi scheme. We cleaned it up. I am not mentioning the bank; it was an institution. There were about 12 of those cases, and we cleaned them up. We made good steps to see that their processes are much more transparent and much more honest. I believe that bank manager is now facing criminal charges.


I, along with others in this place, launched an inquiry into ASIC. We brought out the wrongdoings in the financial planning industry. We saw the treatment of whistleblowers. We saw some 650,000 Australians written to to have their financial advice reviewed from Commonwealth Bank financial planning, from Macquarie Private Wealth and others.


In the very near future I am going to launch an inquiry into the life insurance industry. I am very annoyed about the program on Four Corners, with Fairfax and with my friend Adele Ferguson, about the treatment of people who would not have their life insurance paid, their TPD paid, and the crazy excuses these insurance companies use to avoid payment—especially in relation to one with an industry super fund, REST Industry Super fund. I have spoken to the boss, Mr Damian Hill, about a young fellow who, sadly, committed suicide at the age of 22, I think. The young fellow had life insurance with his superannuation. His policy was paid up, his premiums were paid up, but his estate was not paid because he did not have $1,200 in his superannuation—he only had $1,110. The policy was: we will not pay you unless you have $1,200 in your super. I asked: then why did you take the premium? Why did you take the person's money? Why did you give them the policy knowing you would not pay it under those conditions? I believe those conditions have now changed. That infuriates me, Madam Acting Deputy President O'Neill, and it probably infuriates you, as well, when you hear things like that. So I will be launching an inquiry into the life insurance industry as soon as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services is re-established. I have the terms of reference drawn up. I hope that many in the chamber will support me.


What has the Labor Party done in relation to all of this corruption? Let me give you a few facts. The notable scandals and collapses within the financial services sector occurred under Labor's watch, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible for financial services. That is a fact. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as the then minister responsible for financial services, neither initiated a royal commission into the banking sector nor took meaningful action against the banks. When the Murray inquiry came along—it was a promise by the Abbott government when we were elected in 2013—the Murray inquiry was opposed by Labor with the then Treasurer, Chris Bowen, stating:


The financial system is strong, well-regulated and well managed and I have not seen a case for a full-blown inquiry.


The Labor Party actually opposed the Murray inquiry. It is unbelievable that the Labor Party is now grandstanding about a royal commission when I pursued a royal commission into white-collar crime for years.


I am very pleased to see that we now have the Ramsay review to see that a proper tribunal is established where those who have been done over, or think they have been done over and treated badly, can seek justice; where it is not a case that they simply have to have so much money.


It is amazing to see that Senator Dastyari is in the headlines today:


High-profile New South Wales Labor senator Sam Dastyari is facing mounting calls to explain why a company with links to the Chinese government repaid a debt on his behalf. Sydney-based Top Education Institute paid the bill of around $1,600.


I agree with my colleague Senator Bernardi: a senator who owes a debt to the Commonwealth for mismanaging his electorate budget is now being bailed out by a company that is closely linked to the Chinese government—the director of it has very close links to the Chinese government. That is cause for a Senate inquiry, I agree. It was not long ago that Senator Dastyari was saying that we need to get right into white-collar crime. Perhaps a good look in the mirror might be my advice to Senator Dastyari. 


On 24 June last year Senator Whish-Wilson moved a motion that called for a royal commission into misconduct within the financial services sector. I crossed the floor—I sat over there and voted with the Greens. Senator Conroy, Senator Dastyari—all those over there—Senator Polley and Senator Urquhart all sat there opposing an inquiry into the banking sector. They did not have the courage to stand up. Now of course they are holier than thou, saying: 'We've got to do this and do that.' I crossed the floor as I have done probably nine times before. 


It is amazing that David Murray on 24 August in a report in the Australian newspaper said: 


Over the past two years, industry super funds have paid more than $5.4 million to unions and the ACTU, with a handy portion flowing upstream to Labor.


This is incredible. When you are pursuing a royal commission, can you please add in white-collar crime and look at industry super funds, insurance payments and what they are doing? In 2014-15 construction industry fund CBUS gave $927,940 to the CFMEU. I wonder where that ended up—probably in the Labor Party coffers to help them with their election. 


I will be moving amendments to Senator Wong's motion No. 12 today, to see that we get a proper inquiry into white-collar crime, not just the banks but those unregistered managed investment schemes, industry super funds and where their moneys flow, their superannuation, their life insurance and those who do not hold an Australian Financial Services licence. Let's clean the place right up through the financial sector, which I have pursued for seven years, then we may progress with a far more appropriate system where people can have total faith and confidence in this sector in Australia. At the moment, you are only half doing the job over there in the Labor Party. Do the job properly, do it once and do it right through the financial sector. Clean up the Ponzi schemes et cetera.

As others today have noted, this is not my first speech. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 came into effect just over 40 years ago. The legislation has been one important pillar of our success as a multicultural and diverse nation, where people of many cultures have come to this country and built our national success—both our physical and our social infrastructure.


This law was made in response to an agreed international consensus in the form of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The convention is included in section 7 of the Racial Discrimination Act, which gives approval to the ratification of the convention, and appears as a schedule of the act.


It is important legislation. It was, I understand, our first national human rights law, and it has given each of us as Australians some sense of assurance that under the law every Australian can be treated fairly, regardless of our colour or background. It signalled a point of maturity for us as a good global citizen. This law is of special importance to those of us who, because of our colour, our culture and our language, have been subjected to racial slurs or racial violence and to discrimination when we have sought a place at a school, at a job, at the local supermarket, to rent a house or to enter a cinema.


It has helped us in our collective task of nation-building. In 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam said that the Racial Discrimination Act would help to 'entrench new attitudes of tolerance and understanding in the hearts and minds of the people'. It can be said that the act has done so for the nation as a whole and for those who have sought to escape the scourges of racism and racist speech.


We now see rejuvenated attempts to repeal section 18C of this important but quite succinct act, which makes it unlawful to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' someone because of their race. But in response we have seen widespread community support for the legislation as it exists. The vast majority recognise that we should not give people the social licence to inflict racial bigotry onto others. The proposed repeal of section 18C was rightly abandoned by the Turnbull government. It puzzles me that government members here have reawakened this supposedly dead debate. The Prime Minister indicated that it was not a national priority at this stage. He should now be unequivocal in his opposition to this proposal, and get his house in order.


But the protection of legislation that prevents discrimination is a national priority for those of us who are opposed to discrimination, to violence and to hate speech in all its multiheaded forms. It shapes our nation, showing that we are committed in our society to mutual respect and to racial tolerance. We know that this act is there not just to protect all Australians from discrimination but to build and maintain our harmony as a modern, tolerant cosmopolitan community—a national community built from many nations and many cultures, with a growing sense of our common humanity.


We know, especially those of us with lived experience of racism, that racism at the end of the day is about power and hurt. My late friend David Ervine was an Irish politician and good friend who hosted me at Stormont, in Belfast. He was a militant unionist who became a champion for tolerance. In a speech he gave while visiting Australia he said, 'I can smell racism. It does not grow wild in the field. It is tended in a window box.'


It can be seen clearly in the colonial history of Western Australia that a misguided sense of moral and social superiority historically legitimated the prolonged and violent dispossession of people. But the colonial notion of racial superiority was just an ideological mask for greed. It placed a small fig leaf— (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:10):  Congratulations to Senator Dodson on what is not his 'first speech' but it is his first speech! It was obviously a thoughtful contribution to the chamber. But if I could suggest to the senator it is important that in speeches to the chamber he actually is factual in some of the things he says. Can I assure Senator Dodson—and I think I can say this on behalf of almost every Australian—that every Australian abhors racial discrimination or any other form of discrimination. That is a given in our country of Australia. It is what makes us all so proud to be Australians. But the comments that the senator mentioned are simply not accurate.



First of all, can I repeat the response of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to Senator Dodson's question, and that is that as far as the government is concerned this is not a priority and it will not be introduced by the government. That is the government's official line and I make it clear at the start of my contribution that that is what the executive government has a view of.



Having said that, as an individual member of the coalition government and a proud member of the Liberal Party and Liberal National Party of Queensland I have the right in this parliament to exercise not only my view on what is correct or not correct but also to represent the views of my constituents, who are the people of Queensland. I am again fairly confident in saying that most people in Queensland, whilst abhorring any form of discrimination, particularly racial discrimination, are offended and insulted by the fact that these words 'offend' and 'insult' are in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Dodson said that the proposal was to delete the paragraph or to amend it to remove two other words. This is plainly incorrect. We are not proposing to remove from 18C the words 'humiliate' and 'intimidate'. So I proudly am one of those on our side, as an individual member of this parliament, not directed by my party and not directed by the government, who choose to support this private member's bill to amend section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult'. The words 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' will remain and should remain. But when Australians have to legislate against offence and insult, I think it is a sad day for a country as free and open as Australia.


Most Australians who understand what happened at the Queensland University of Technology, in a celebrated case that is still before the courts, will appreciate how absolutely awful this legislation is that it would cause those young students, who, on anyone's standard, could not possibly have offended or insulted anyone, to be hauled before the courts under the provisions of this particular piece of legislation. The fact that the Human Rights Commission, which I almost think at times is poorly named, is taking that particular case on with the gusto that it is really brings into question the relevance and the approach of the Human Rights Commission.


Now, I repeat that I and most other Australians—and certainly all of those on this side of the chamber—abhor any form of discrimination, racial or otherwise. But removing the words 'offend' and 'insult' from section 18C is, I think, a step in the right direction and ensures that Australia is a free, open country that abhors and rejects any form of discrimination but encourages and celebrates free speech and the ability to say things that some others might not like. If 'offence' and 'insult' were an offence in this chamber, Senator Cameron, for some of the things that he says to me, would be out on his ear, and I would be a quivering mess. But we put up with those things in Australia— (Time expired)

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Brandis. It is incredibly important and quite reasonable that those of us on this side of the chamber should be seeking reassurance from the government that they have no intention of amending the Racial Discrimination Act. I find it quite extraordinary that all but one of the Liberal-National coalition backbenchers in this place have in fact signed up to support Senator Bernardi's private member's bill. This is an extraordinary act to be taking place that goes completely against the government's stated agenda. 


Indeed, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, appears to continue to change his mind on this issue. We know that in early 2015, before he became Prime Minister, he said that he was not opposed to changes that would water down protections in 18C. Indeed, the Prime Minister said he was comfortable with the amendments and did not think they would cause any harm. It was only when he became leader that he ruled out making any changes. 


So, yes, I am pleased that Senator Brandis was able to give such an unequivocal 'no' this afternoon, given that so many of the others on his side of the chamber are not of this view. So many of those on whom you rely to govern, be they in your own party or others you look to to pass legislation in this place, are also of this view. I look forward to Senator Brandis saying, 'No, no, no', every time this question comes up, because, given the level of activity and momentum around this question that is gathering from those on the other side, we will need to keep seeking those reassurances.


I think there is a real question before this place as to whether we can indeed trust the Prime Minister or Senator Brandis on this issue. It is clear from events of recent days that there is no cohesion in the coalition on this issue. When we see the entire backbench—almost, bar one—signing up to radical changes to 18C, it is clear that the Prime Minister has no control over his own government. So how are the people of our nation supposed to trust a government that cannot even agree internally on fundamental questions of protecting the minorities in our own community?


Much like the Prime Minister, I am concerned that Senator Brandis himself has had contradictory views on this matter. His views, which have been stated loud and clear in the past, are that he believes people do have a right to be bigots. Make no mistake: we on this side of the chamber will keep this issue on the table and keep holding the government to account. We know that there are those of you on that side of chamber who want to create rights for bigots in this country who think it is reasonable to expose Australians to racist and insulting acts. This, in my view, is an extraordinary thing. It seems pretty clear to me that those on the other side would not ever have been exposed to such racist attacks, because they do not have the same diversity on their side of the chamber.


Today in this place, even though the coalition has had their agenda of wanting to see 18C amended rejected many times by the Australian people and even though Tony Abbott also recognised the folly of amending 18C, we continue to see this issue bubble away on the other side. On that basis it is critical that this side of the chamber keeps holding them to account. We do not want to see amendments to 18C, and we will keep asking those questions in this place.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  It is arguable whether it was the French philosopher Voltaire who made the comment—from the French translation to English it is even more obscure—but the words were along the lines of: I disagree with you on what you say but I will die to defend your right to say it. In this place, of all places in Australia, we must surely be free to be able to debate without fear or favour. 


I recall once, when I was on the other side, Senator Wong reminding me that the whole question of 'take note' relates directly to taking note, and, with deep respect, I say to my good colleague Senator Dodson: the motion was to take note of what Senator Brandis said. It is not for me to correct him, except to say that, whilst I was particularly interested in the content of what he had to say, he was not in fact speaking to the motion, which was to take note of the leader of the government's comments.


Can I also draw, with respect, Senator Dodson to his statement that this effort is to repeal section 18C. With respect, it is not; it is to amend 18C, to leave in terms related to 'intimidate, humiliate or vilify', but simply to remove the words 'offend or insult'. Surely in a country in which we pride ourselves for our freedom of speech, we must feel free for people to make comments which might in fact be insulting or offensive to another. 


As Senator Macdonald correctly said, probably Senator Cameron and I over the years have offended and insulted each other on many occasions. But it allows me to make the point that one cannot predict whether or not a statement is likely to insult or be offensive. The point was made in this place a few minutes ago with the Queensland University of Technology incident that has exercised the minds of so many recently, when three young people went up to a computer lab and were told that it was a laboratory to be used only by Indigenous students. One of those students subsequently put, I think, on social media—Facebook—words to the effect of, 'I didn't know I wasn't able to enter that laboratory'. 


We know that the young person who was the attendant in that laboratory must have taken offence or felt insulted, because she came out and said so, and we know that Professor Triggs has subsequently taken action against that student. It simply makes the point that you cannot predict whether a person is likely to be insulted or offended. But I do join with Senator Macdonald in his comments, and I join with Senator Brandis on the statements he has made on many occasions in this place when same-sex marriage has been debated—the fact that it is illegal in this country to discriminate against another person. 


But I am going to give you an example where an offence and an insult took place against myself. I was in mass in Applecross, and the priest in his homily gave, as part of a joke, a comment about a blind mouse and a blind snake. I will not tell you the details of it except to say that it was about politicians. It was something on which I took deep offence—you can imagine it was the analogy of the snake—but I have no right to feel insulted or offended by the comments or to actually bring an action in the court against that priest. 


What I did do was go up to him and do two things. I suggested, firstly, he finds out who is in his congregation—and, secondly, the fact that I was not happy with that event. I only use that analogy because I do not want to belittle in any way the comments made by Senator Dodson except to say that 'insult' and 'offend' do not have a place in 18C, because he could not predict the likely effect on me as a result of his comments.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:26):  I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Brandis to Senator Dodson's questions relating to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. In doing so, I have to say I am completely perplexed. Yesterday was the opening of parliament, and the best that the Liberal backbench could run around and do was to get enough signatures on a motion by Senator Bernardi, to ensure that they could introduce legislation to amend our Racial Discrimination Act and, in doing so, water down the protections provided to ethnic communities across Australia. 


Now, how on earth are they representing their constituency? This is a multicultural country. Every part of our community has people from different ethnic backgrounds living amongst us. It makes us such a diverse and strong society that we are so proud of living in. And yet, including my own Tasmanian senators—the Liberal senators Senator Bushby, Senator Duniam, Senator Abetz—were all part of leading that charge of signing on to that motion, rather than of course standing up to the issues and interests important to the people of Tasmania. They were completely ignoring the people of Tasmania and putting their extremist views within the  Liberal Party and ahead of their own constituents.


I asked Senator Bushby and I asked Senator Abetz and I asked Senator Duniam: 'What is it that you want to say to those ethnic communities in your electorate in Tasmania that you currently cannot say under the current Racial Discrimination Act?' Answer me that question, because I cannot understand where you are coming from if it is not from the basis of racism and of bigotry. You have questions to answer if you are going to sign your name onto a motion to water down race-hate protections. 


Quite rightly, Senator Brandis abandoned the government's attempts to water down or change section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in 2014, and for good reason. We remember at the time—and I will remind Senator Brandis of the response to the changes the government wanted to make from a number of ethnic communities. For example, Kirstie Parker the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, said:


We are horrified to consider the kind of Australia that could grow out of what is now being proposed.


We know intimately the impact that racist abuse has on our peoples. It undermines our sense of personal security and safety, can disenfranchise us even further from the rest of society, and literally makes us sick.


That is just one response from the time in which the government tried to water down the protections provided in this particular piece of law. 


As Senator Dodson said, we should not give people the social licence to show bigotry to others. That is exactly what a few backbenchers within the Liberal Party are trying to do in bringing forward this motion. I also ask the Prime Minister: what are you doing? Who is leading this country? Is it led by you, or is it led by the backbench of the Liberal Party? Is it led by the extreme right-wing backbench of the Liberal Party? Why will he not rein in Cory Bernardi? Why will he not rein in the senators who have come to sign this motion and who are getting away with the open rebellion that they are displaying within the Liberal Party? There is division going on within the Liberal Party. It seems to me—and I think it seems to many in the public—that the coalition backbench are determining government policy instead of the leadership or the executive of the government. I think that is something that the Australian people should really question.


I have never understood why it is that so many people in the Liberal Party think it so important to be able to insult and offend other Australians on the basis of their race and their ethnicity. Why is it okay, and why are you so fixated on wanting to offend and insult other people on the basis of their race? Is it something that you have ever experienced, because I have the feeling you do not know what you are talking about. (Time expired)

I do not want to turn this into an auction. Is leave granted for Senator Brandis to speak for five minutes? I need a no if anyone objects. Leave is granted for five minutes, Senator Brandis.




Senator BRANDIS:
  The government has had discussions with the opposition in relation to this motion. As I foreshadowed yesterday, the government will not be opposing the motion, but I do want to place on the record a serious misgiving we have about the manner in which the motion has been structured. I am told by Senator Wong that it has been prepared on the Clerk's advice. If it has been prepared on the Clerk's advice then I think that advice is poor advice with respect to the clerks.


My particular concern relates to paragraphs (5) and (6) of the motion, which provide for a mechanism whereby the documents that are the subject of this privilege claim may be inspected by a third party, an independent expert, only if the matter is brought back to the chamber by the Privileges Committee and the chamber resolves to appoint an independent assessor. That has not been the practice in the past. The most recent practice, the case of former Senator Winston Crane, was where a reference to the Privileges Committee was made and an independent assessor, Mr Stephen Skehill, was appointed by the motion that referred the matter to the Privileges Committee. That is what should have happened on this occasion.


It seems almost impossible that the Privileges Committee can competently perform the task referred to it without the inspection of the content of the documents, because what we are here concerned with is an investigation into a suspected crime. The search warrant concerned could not have been validly issued unless there was a reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. It is not for the Privileges Committee to determine whether or not a crime was committed. It is for the Privileges Committee to determine whether or not the documents concerned relate with sufficient directness to the proceedings of parliament that parliamentary privilege in this case can properly be invoked, because if they do not bear a sufficiently direct relationship to the privilege of parliament then they are not covered by the Parliamentary Privileges Act or, indeed, by section 49 of the Constitution.


The matter has been considered by a number of decisions of courts: in Australia, by a decision of the Court of Appeal in Queensland about 20 years ago called Rowley v O'Chee; and in the United Kingdom some six years ago by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom called the Crown v Chaytor. Chaytor's case seems to be the most recent occasion on which a superior court has considered the question. The Supreme Court decided in that case that if a claim of parliamentary privilege is made but the documents do not sufficiently bear upon the proceedings of parliament then the claim is invalid. How, I ask, can the Privileges Committee possibly determine the validity of a claim of parliamentary privilege where the question before it is whether the documents seized contain material relating sufficiently directly to proceedings in parliament without looking at the documents? It is not possible that the Privileges Committee could rationally arrive at that conclusion on the basis merely of a description of the character of the documents. The very issue presented to it depends upon its analysis of the content of the documents to determine whether parliamentary privilege has been sufficiently or validly invoked.


The precedent of a third-party assessor, an experienced silk, has been adopted by this Senate before. It has been somewhat departed from, although anticipated as a contingency by this motion. The observation I make, not in a opposition to the motion but to express concern about the way in which the motion has been structured, is that this provides an additional and unnecessary complication in what could have been, and ought to have been, a relatively straightforward reference.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:57):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The June flooding caused extensive damage to communities in Tasmania. The Australian government has provided a range of assistance to help support affected communities during this difficult time. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those lost, as they grapple not only with the impacts of the flooding but the loss of their loved ones. Events such as this are a tragic reminder of the unforgiving nature of natural disasters, and it will be felt for years to come. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the hardworking volunteers and other emergency services for their tireless efforts.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:59):  I present the explanatory memorandum and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Freedom of speech has been described as 'the freedom par excellence: for without it, no other freedom could survive (Campbell and Whitmore, 1966).' 


It allows us to express our beliefs and thoughts.


It acts as a check against abuses of power.


It is – as Lord Steyn put it – the 'lifeblood of democracy (Steyn, 1999)'.


Yet in this world of heightened communication, where we can exercise our voice in more ways than ever before, this freedom is being eroded.


And one cause of this is section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (RDA).


Jennifer Oriel described the situation well when she wrote: 


'… the world's most humanising principle is that we are each born free and equal, endowed with reason. Under the regime of minority privileges enshrined in the Racial Discrimination Act, however, we are once again unequal and endowed with emotion (Oriel, 2016).'




An Orwellian environment



It's been almost two years since I spoke to the earlier version of this Bill, of which I was a co-sponsor.


Within those last two years we've seen, overseas and here in Australia, continued attacks on free speech; on an individual's right to express their beliefs and opinions.


Two notable cases in Australia showcase with crystal clarity the problem that exists.


The first relates to three university students in Queensland who continue to fight a three-year battle through the Australian Human Rights Commission and federal courts because they were kicked out of a computer lab due to their skin colour, and complained about it on Facebook.


These students were asked to leave the unsigned computer lab – where computers were not being used – because they were not Indigenous.


After leaving peacefully, one student made the following post on Facebook:



Just got kicked out of the unsigned Indigenous computer room. QUT stopping segregation with segregation.



Frankly, I don't know how any reasonable person can take offence at that.


Yet the staff member who asked the students to leave was so offended by this post (and others) that she lodged complaints with the university and the Human Rights Commission, and has been unable to return to work for two-and-a-half years because she felt 'at risk of imminent but unpredictable physical or verbal assault (Thomas, 2016).'


The claimant is seeking almost $250,000 in damages.


Confidential settlements have been paid by some students who couldn't afford the costs required to defend themselves.


And the remaining students continue to face claims of racial vilification that will have impacts – even if the case is eventually dismissed – on their reputations and future careers. 


In fact, the allegations have already caused one student to abandon his teaching career before it's even started. 


All because one person took offence under section 18C.


Incredibly, not one of the advocates of the existing provision have – to my knowledge – publicly defended 18C in relation to this Queensland case. 


To those who support 18C as it currently stands, it is incumbent on you to justify its use in regard to cases like this.


Surely, if this provision cannot be defended by its supporters, it needs to be reformed or repealed.


Then we have Bill Leak's cartoon in The Australian.


It's a cartoonist's job to offer provocative commentary on current issues.


And his cartoon sought to highlight family dysfunction in Aboriginal communities.


This should have prompted reasoned debate about this issue and what can be done to improve outcomes for Indigenous families – or indeed, any family of any colour experiencing problems.


Instead, the Race Commissioner encourages the public to lodge complaints if they are offended; prejudging Leak and fuelling a grievance culture.


How can we even begin to have meaningful discussion when the senior bureaucrat in charge essentially brands someone guilty of vilification from the outset?


This is the same Race Commissioner who says it could be racist if you don't pronounce someone's name correctly.


It's like something out of Yes, Minister… except this is the brave new world of the Government-funded grievance industry.




Same as 2014 bill



The Bill I introduce today is the same in substance as the Bill that Senator Day introduced in 2014, of which I was a co-sponsor.


Section 18C currently states that it is unlawful for someone to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people' based on their 'race, colour or national or ethnic origin'.


This Bill merely seeks to remove two words: 'offend' and 'insult'.


It is a very modest change, and one that is supported by a wide range of Australians, including Julian Burnside, David Marr, Justice Robert French, Justice Ron Sackville, Paul Howes, Mark Latham; along with other lawyers, academics and commentators across the political spectrum.


We are not talking here of removing section 18C completely.


It would still remain unlawful for someone to humiliate or intimidate another person or group based on their race, colour or ethnicity.


I believe that this is an elegant solution that strikes the right balance.


Offending or insulting someone should not be cause to drag someone before a commission or a court.


'I'm offended therefore you're wrong' – as Jennifer Oriel put it – has no place in a modern legal system and democratic society (Oriel, 2016).


This is echoed by the treasurer of the Law Council of Australia and a past President of the Law Society of SA, Morry Bailes, who recently said:


'I neither condone offence nor insult on racial grounds; indeed, I am implacably opposed to it. But I do treasure the right to allow citizens to speak freely.


'We do ourselves a great disservice as a society utilising the Parliament to enforce the niceties of language. If you wish to be a rank racist and offend and insult, let society judge your actions rather than the courts (Bailes, 2016).'


Today I wish to acknowledge the co-sponsors of this Bill.


It is an extraordinary achievement that so many of my colleagues – from so many different political parties – are putting their names to this Bill.


It demonstrates how significant free speech is for so many Australians. 


And it should give the Australian people confidence that members of this Senate can come together to work for the benefit of the nation and that we will stand up to represent their concerns in this place.




Law Reform Commission conclusions



Even one of this country's most influential legal reform bodies concludes there are valid concerns about the inclusion of the word 'offence' in section 18C.


The President of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) has said that 'by extending to matters only likely to offend, section 18C may go beyond the permissible limitations on freedom of speech' set out in international law (Croucher, 2016).


And the Law Reform Commission echoed these concerns in its report: 


'… there are arguments that s 18C lacks sufficient precision and clarity, and unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech by extending to speech that is reasonably likely to 'offend' (ALRC, 2015).'


Equivalent provisions in New Zealand and Great Britain do not cover offensiveness, and Canada recently repealed its broad provision because it conflicted with free speech.


Also, it was found that 18C is broader than article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.


This led the Commission to conclude that: 


'In some respects, the provision is broader than is required under international law, broader than similar laws in other jurisdictions, and may be susceptible to constitutional challenge (ALRC, 2015).'


Such conclusions lend significant weight to amending 18C.


As does the views of Justice Ron Sackville, a former Federal Court judge, who says that 'the balance at present is not quite what it should be (Merritt and Martin, 2016).'


Like this Bill, he proposes removing the words 'offend' and 'insult' – and then goes further in removing 'humiliate' and 'intimidate', replacing them with 'degrade, intimidate or incite hatred or contempt' – a much more stringent standard (Doig, 2016).


And he believes an objective test based on community standards should be used instead of the more subjective test in the current Act.


Given that some of the best minds in our legal system hold serious concerns about section 18C, surely it is time to make a modest change to it in order to better protect free speech. 




Coalition's position



Unfortunately, the Abbott Government took a backward step two years ago when it decided not to act on 18C.


But I welcome recent comments by the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, who admits he got it wrong.


He said that in hindsight, he 'should have persisted with a simpler amendment along the lines of Senator Bob Day's … private member's bill (Abbott, 2016).'


Our current Prime Minister had also indicated his support for what I'm pursuing here today.


Just last year he told Andrew Bolt that he didn't think that removing 'offend' and 'insult' 'would have any negative impact' and that he 'was very comfortable about that (Breheny, 2015).' 


So I am disappointed – along with many Australians - that the Prime Minister and others now say that amending 18C is 'not a priority.'


Surely the Government is capable of doing two things at once. 


In fact, this Bill makes things even easier for the Government … the hard work has been done: a Bill has been drafted, we've had the negotiations and all that's left for the Government to do is get on board.


Some have said amending 18C isn't a priority because it will not create extra jobs or build more roads or reverse the deficit.


Yet this argument rings hollow when this Government continues to put significant resources and time into Indigenous Constitutional recognition and the homosexual marriage plebiscite. 


Removing two words from the RDA is more modest than the policy of reform the Coalition took to the 2013 election; an election they won convincingly.


Coalition policy at the time said:


'Prohibitions on inciting racial hatred or intimidation of particular groups should be focused on offences of incitement and causing fear but not a prohibition on causing offence (Liberal Party, 2013).'


It's now time to return to defending this most basic principle - contained in our Party's statement of beliefs – in order to stop the detrimental impact that 18C has on our society.


I am pleased that 19 of my Senate colleagues are prepared to stand for what is right and have the courage of their convictions in supporting this Bill.




18C infantilises us



Reform of 18C is important.


Laws like 18C infantilise each one of us. 


It erodes our ability to challenge ideas in open debate.


It assumes that we need the law to protect us when we are offended, rather than trusting Australians to assess and repudiate views.


Brendan O'Neill put it well when he said:


'Hate-speech legislation is not only an attack on the speaker — it is also an attack on the rest of us, the audience. It undermines our right, and our responsibility as citizens, to expose and confront bigotry; to use the tools of freedom and reason to challenge those who say genuinely racist things (O'Neill, 2016).'


He continues:


'Censorship … makes us lazy and childish and stupid. It turns us into infants who don't have to worry about what is right and wrong because that has already been decided for us by our good, gracious rulers and betters. It weakens our moral muscles; it retires our moral judgment. It encourages passivity, thoughtlessness, obedience — all of which are anathema to a healthy democratic society (O'Neill, 2016).'


The remedy for offensive and insulting words is more speech, not less.


In recent years, I have had the following levelled at me:


'… the world will be a better place when you and your ilk of conservative, out of touch, middle-aged white men finally expire.' 


'You are the lowest common denominator of society, and are the definition of white trash.' 


'You, as a wealthy, white, Christian male, appear to have a revolting sense of entitlement …' 


Under current 18C I could probably take each of these people to the Human Rights Commission. 


Their comments are based on the colour of my skin and could be deemed offensive by white people.


But I won't do that – although I do see the merit in Senator Leyonhjelm taking the Commission to task in order to expose potential double standards in how 18C is applied.


I can counteract these views through debate and discussion – in the battle of ideas.


That is the way to a better society.


Bad ideas can be brought out in the open rather than festering in the shadows, so that they can be challenged and exposed for what they are.


Citizens become more engaged as we entrust ourselves to consider ideas and formulate opinions.


More freedom in the exchange of ideas allows us to develop thoughts, find the truth and foster a more transparent, open and honest society.




Conclusion



To conclude, I don't want to see our country turn into a place where someone is arrested for quoting the Bible, or taken to court for calling a religion 'stupid', or sentenced to jail for singing a song at the football.


Sounds fanciful, but these things have happened in Britain and France.


We have an opportunity in this Parliament to make a difference, to fortify one of our most fundamental freedoms from the tyranny of censorship and group think.


I am encouraged by the support of the thousands of Australians who have signed my petition, and others who have engaged in the debate.


And I am heartened by the support of my colleagues in this place, from many different parties, who are willing to put principle above all else in pursuit of this 'freedom par excellence'.


In the coming debate, I urge all involved to remember these words by a young Australian, Matthew Lesh:


'Ultimately, freedom of speech is meaningless if it applies only to those with whom you agree. 


'It works only if you defend the right of people you fundamentally disagree with to express ideas you find deeply offensive (Lesh, 2016).'


Offending or insulting someone should not be cause for legal action.


The law as it stands can have damaging implications for our freedoms and way of life.


This Bill seeks to defend a founding principle of our democracy; to maintain a fearless pursuit of truth.


The removal of two words. That's all this Bill is asking for. 


It's a common sense solution for a free and vibrant Australia.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

   (iii) the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens, crossbench, Liberal and Nationals parliamentarians have supported a thorough investigation of the culture and practices within the financial services industry through a Royal Commission, which is the only forum with the coercive powers and broad jurisdiction necessary to properly perform this investigation, and


   (iv) Australia has one of the strongest banking systems in the world,


but Australians must have confidence in their banks and financial institutions, making it necessary to sweep away doubt and uncover and deal with unethical behaviour that compromises that confidence;

  The Greens will be supporting this motion and, had we seen your amendment, Senator Williams, we probably would have supported that, too.

I would like to say this: it is really important. Those senators who sat through the Economics Committee's inquiries into financial misconduct would all be supporting this motion had they seen and heard the evidence that we heard. It is trust that holds our financial system together. That trust have been shattered by a series of financial scandals. We need a commission of inquiry with coercive powers with full resources to get to the bottom of this issue. If the government does not act and they do not have a royal commission, then the Greens will be pushing for a parliamentary commission of inquiry. Parliament must step up and hold the executive to account on this issue. Australians want to see this royal commission. It is absolutely necessary. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS:
  Mr President, for seven years I have pursued a royal commission into white-collar crime in this place. With the amendments I put forward and circulated in the chamber, I want to include many things such as industry super funds and life insurance. I do that on the grounds of what Mr David Murray said just recently in the newspaper. And I will make this point: over the past two years, the industry super funds have paid more than $5.4 million to unions and the ACTU, with a fair portion of that flowing to the Labor Party. In 2014-15, construction industry fund CBUS gave nearly $1 million to the CFMEU which, of course, would have passed it onto the Greens and others, and the Labor Party, as well, for their campaigns. If we are going to have a royal commission into white-collar crime and clean-out the crooks with the Ponzi schemes, the unregistered managed investment schemes et cetera, so we have a good clean financial system for the future—that is what I have been chasing for seven years and that is what I have been rejected to do today.

The PRESIDENT
 (16:06):  Just before you go into the substance: you are seeking leave to amend the motion. Leave is not granted, Senator Culleton. Others are still seeking leave to speak on this matter. I just want to make a statement first.


The Procedure Committee in June 2011 determined that the discovery of formal business was just that: the discovery of formal business, and not a free-range debate. Over a period of time, what has happened is that senators are seeking leave to interrupt formality or the discovery of formal business, where matters are supposed to go through the chamber at a relatively easy pace without debate. We are now getting into a de facto debate, and we are getting other amendments added to this.


Secondly, and it has just been evident in the chamber, it is common practice—and courtesy, but common practice—that if you do have other material that you wish to introduce, such as tabling of other documents, then at least the whips of parties are consulted first, and then you will find that there will be a free flow, and you will have an indication prior. So I will just remind you of those two points, and that might facilitate debate in the chamber and also take us back to what discovery of formal business is all about. There are other places to debate these matters in a more fulsome way.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The government does not support a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector, because a royal commission will not benefit consumers or the Australian economy. A royal commission would go over old ground and would delay well-developed and important reforms that will strengthen consumer protections, ensure that malpractice is detected and punished and provide a one-stop shop for consumer complaints. It would also send the signal internationally that the government believes that there are structural problems with our banking and financial system. This would have significant repercussions for confidence, for international investment and for our AAA credit rating.

  I want to begin by apologising to the new senator from Western Australia and explain that the process is that normally we see amendments and so on beforehand. Our decision not to grant leave was not a passing judgement on the nature of the amendments but rather was based on the process and the fact that we had not had the opportunity to see them. I do want to note that the amendment being moved by Senator Williams is nothing more than an attempt to find a way to not support a position that Senator Williams has held in this place and others.




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr President, a point of order: I do not think it is appropriate that Senator Dastyari can reflect on the motivations of another senator in moving an amendment to a bill.




Senator Fifield:
  On an amendment that he's—




Senator Bernardi:
  Exactly.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Senator Williams has been a strong advocate in the past, both publicly and privately, for a royal commission. Yet when a royal commission motion is before him in the Senate he finds a way to make an amendment in which proper notice was not given for the sole reason of finding an excuse and reason to vote against the motion.

  Mr President, a point of order against what Senator Dastyari claimed: it was circulated at 3.25 pm through the chamber—the amendments, right throughout here.

Senator XENOPHON:
  I just want to pay tribute to the work Senator Williams has done in this area in terms of people who have been ripped off by financial institutions, by banks, and his fearless advocacy for them. I was aware that he was planning to move an amendment. I was not aware of the extent of the amendment until very recently. I strongly support him in terms of the issues he has raised about the failed managed investment schemes and illegalities in the financial planning industry. I have difficulties with respect to the other matters that seem to go much broader than what I thought they would. It is not a criticism of Senator Williams, but in the circumstances I think there are two courses that the chamber could take. Either we could adjourn this until tomorrow, or, alternatively, I could move an amendment to Senator Wong's motion to include reference to failed managed investment schemes and illegalities in the financial planning industry. I will perhaps get your guidance, Mr President, as to whether I can move that this matter be adjourned until tomorrow, and if the chamber's wish is not to do that then I can simply move an amendment to Senator Wong's motion in terms of managed investment schemes.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. You will need to seek leave to take that course of action. So, you are seeking leave to have this matter postponed until tomorrow.

A formal motion shall be put and determined without amendment or debate.


I have just got clarification from the Clerk. Because we have actually discovered the motion, which has been postponed until tomorrow, can we take it that in that motion the matter be taken at formal business again for the next day of sitting? That way, we are definitely going to rediscover it and deal with it in the same appropriate manner. Thank you.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:26):  I seek leave to make a one-minute statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator LAMBIE:
  Like all members of this chamber, my heart goes out to all families who have been affected by drug overdose. While I agree with the majority of the points in this motion, I will not support it, because of the final call to action found in point (b)(iv), which tries to stop the use of drug sniffer dogs at festivals. More families would feel the heartache of losing loved ones from drug overdoses if we listened to the Greens. The Greens policies on illegal drugs do harm. Their attempt in this motion to make it easier for our younger people to access dangerous drugs is plain reckless. My policy of giving parents the power to involuntarily detox their drug addicted children will truly lessen the chance of harm and overdoses. Getting rid of drug sniffer dogs would cause the same outcome as the Greens policy to decriminalise ice. Both would lead to more addiction, more harm and a hell of a lot more misery.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:27):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I firstly want to say that I understand that Senator Lambie's comments are made from personal experience, and I want to acknowledge that and acknowledge the harm that comes with the abuse of illicit drugs. It is an area in which I have worked, and my motion here today is informed by evidence. Sadly, we have too many young people dying from overdoses, overdoses that are entirely preventable. That is why we need to have harm reduction framing our response and it is why we need to have some courage in this place to listen to the evidence and to follow the evidence. Sadly, drug sniffer dogs have been shown to encourage more harmful drug use. We have people who take increased quantities of drugs before going to festivals and, when they see a sniffer dog, they often ingest larger, more harmful quantities of drugs in order to escape arrest. That is the consequence of sniffer dogs. We need to be guided by the evidence on this front.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2016-08-31,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:34):  I rise to address the issue of the Prime Minister's failure of leadership on economic policy. It gives me no pleasure to catalogue the various areas in which this Prime Minister has let down our country—particularly in the area of economic policy, which is so critically important for the future of our nation. It is quite clear that a government which is divided upon itself cannot lead the nation. We have an example before us of a government that is warring with itself on a range of policy matters that are extremely significant, and this is holding up the economic development of our country.


The response of the Prime Minister on economic issues and what seems to pose as economic leadership from this Prime Minister is, firstly, to attack the trade union movement. This is the last resort of Liberal governments, and also their first go-to area when seeking to demonstrate that something is happening. Attacking the trade union movement—seeking to demonise the union movement which has done so much for this country—is almost a knee-jerk reaction from this government. We know that the ABCC bill was supposedly one of the most important issues for this government; it was the trigger for the ill-fated double dissolution election we have just been subjected to. So when we are talking about leadership with this government, we are talking about attacking the trade union movement.


The second area where this government pretends to exercise leadership is it is going to look after its mates in the area of big business. The much-discussed $50 billion tax cut for the big business community included, of course, a tax cut for foreign companies and a $7.4 billion bonus for the big banks. These are the things that this government considers to be the priorities for Australia. If you ask the average Australian what the issues are that need to be addressed in our country in terms of addressing the economy and jobs, attacking the trade union movement and giving a tax cut to foreign companies and a bonus for big banks are not going to be the first responses that you will get.


We have recent examples of this government being completely adrift when there is a need today for economic leadership. We have a Prime Minister who assumed the leadership of his party on the premise that he was going to be a superior economic manager, but we have examples of where this government is completely adrift. We have seen that the Treasurer wanted to introduce changes on negative gearing. He had flagged publicly that there were excesses in the system of negative gearing but, when it came to getting that through the cabinet, we have reports today—which I note the government seeks to distance itself from—that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were rolled in cabinet on any changes to the negative gearing system. Really that happened for base political reasons rather than on the basis of a proper consideration of what is necessary for our economy. 


We have also just found today that not only is this a government that cannot provide leadership for the country in economic matters; we find that they cannot even add up. We found that the omnibus bill, for which the government has sought Labor's support, has a $107 million black hole in its costings. In the area of the student start-up scholarships, the government has pretended that there is a $405.6 million saving when in fact the sum total of the savings in the column set out is $298 million. 


This is very embarrassing situation. It is perhaps the final blow to the credibility of not only the Treasurer but to this government. It is an embarrassing shambles that we have had presented to us. We have a government which is not up to the task of budget repair and it is not up to the task of economic leadership.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:39):  Before I begin, let me acknowledge the presence in the gallery of many sound members of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party. I know, like me, they are very much looking forward to the maiden speech of our brand new senator, Senator Hume. 


Economic leadership begins with budget repair. There is nothing more important that we can do to restore confidence in our economy and facilitate further growth than to repair our balance sheet. Last financial year, our budget deficit was $37 billion. This financial year it will be about the same again. Our gross debt now stands at $430 billion. The Treasurer told us recently that on the worst trajectory that number could hit $1 trillion in a decade's time, if we do not take the necessary steps now to repair the budget. 


There are those who say that government debt does not matter. They point out that, by world standards, Australia's debt is relatively low. That is true in a limited sense. Yes, by modern standards of record indebtedness, Australia's debt is lower than many other countries, but that is not a very inspiring yardstick by which to measure ourselves. I would like to think that we can aspire to be more than just a bit better than most others in the world. 


Australia is different for two reasons. Firstly, although our debt levels are relatively low, it is only because we entered the GFC in such a strong fiscal position. Our performance since the GFC is nothing to be proud of: in fact, our increase in debt since the GFC has been amongst the fastest in the developed world. If we continue on this trajectory, we will soon not be as far ahead of our competitors as some complacently like to pretend we are today. Secondly, Australia is more reliant than other nations on foreign borrowings to finance our public debt. This means that we are especially vulnerable to a change in the availability of global credit and it means that retaining our hard-won AAA credit rating is a must. 


The ratings agencies have put Australia on notice. They expect the parliament to demonstrate that it can in fact tackle this serious debt and deficit problem that we face but, if we show that we are unable to, we risk losing our AAA credit rating. That means higher interest payments on our debt. Our monthly interest bill is already more than $1 billion. If we lose our AAA credit rating and if our debt continues to grow, that problem will only be worse. 


This is not an issue which should be partisan. Whether you favour more spending on pet projects as those on the other side do or whether you favour reducing the tax burden on the Australian people as those of us on this side do, our interest payments stand in the way of both of those objectives. Getting debt down and reducing the interest we have to pay means that there is more money for the other side to spend or more money for those of us on this side to return to taxpayers. 


We have not even yet examined the strong moral case for solving this problem. The truth is that this generation is currently living at the expense of future generations. We are not, as some suggest, spending our record annual deficits on investments that will deliver a return for generations in the future. We are borrowing money now to spend it now, largely, on transfer payments. That means we are asking future generations to pay the day-to-day spending that we cannot fund ourselves today. If this generation cannot fix this problem, it is future generations that will bear that load. There is nothing moral about kicking the can down the road and expecting our children to fund our lifestyles today. 


On this key question of economic leadership, I humbly submit that those of us on this side of the chamber can be proud of our Prime Minister and our governance to address this problem. Those opposite have much less to be proud of in this department. A legacy of their time in government is today's $430 billion of gross debt. It is their legacy, because in just six short years they threw away the enviable position of a federal government with net assets. It is their legacy, because it is they who stand in the way of this government's efforts to fix the problem. 


We have seen the extraordinary situation this week that the Labor Party is equivocating about supporting budget savings that they themselves promised to make only a few weeks ago in the federal election. It is not normal to see a new government immediately seek to legislate promises made by their opponents. You would think that the Leader of the Opposition would be sending the Prime Minister a thank-you note but, instead, they are quibbling and vacillating about whether they will support these savings. We are not talking about an extraordinary sum of money; we are talking about a modest set of savings of approximately $6 billion. It is an important step in the right direction but a small one, and the Labor Party are not even sure if they want to take that.


This parliament will need to do much more if we are to make meaningful headway towards fixing this problem. Sadly, it does not appear that we can expect much assistance from the opposition in this task. They took to the election a series of promises which would have worsened our fiscal position by a further $16 billion over the next four years. There is no evidence that they understand the serious situation that we are in today. The only measures that the Leader of the Opposition appears willing to contemplate to address this problem are tax increases, but, as the budget shows, our fiscal problems are not caused by a lack of revenue; they are caused by excessive spending.


This financial year, the government will spend 25.8 per cent of GDP. That is just 0.2 per cent below the record highs seen in the Rudd-Swan era at the height of the global financial crisis, when we were supposedly spending at emergency levels. That was the time of pink batts, unwanted school halls and $700 cheques. Spending today is far above the long-term historical average. By contrast, the budget shows that, over the next few years, revenue will again return to its long-term historical average. It also shows that, even without policy change, most of the heavy lifting on budget repair will be done on the revenue side.


It is amazing that, given even these facts, the opposition still clamours for higher taxes. Higher taxes may or may not deliver extra revenue, but they will also deliver diminished reward for effort, hamper economic activity and depress growth. Higher taxes are not the best path to budget repair; fiscal prudence is. There is only one side of politics in this country which is showing a lack of economic leadership, and it is not the government.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-08-31,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:46):  The word 'leadership' might suggest to many Australians something like reform—economic reform. It may suggest good economic management. But it might also suggest some courage and some vision—some economic vision. Now, Acting Deputy President Back, you and I have both sat through three Governor-General's speeches, where a new Prime Minister outlines their vision for this country, in four years. Interestingly, for the very first one, in 2013—because, for those listening, the House of Representatives has to squeeze into the Senate—I sat next to Mr Kevin Rudd, the recently deposed Prime Minister. Throughout Mr Tony Abbott's Governor-General's speech, he kept muttering to himself: 'This man has no vision. He has no vision.' I am not sure I totally agreed with Kevin Rudd at the time, because, to me, he had a very clear vision, and that was to rip up some of the biggest economic reforms we had seen in this nation in a decade, but I followed it very closely.


I actually snuck out to Mr Malcolm Turnbull's press conference the day he took over the economic leadership, and I listened to his comments as well. Firstly, he strongly implied that there would be no more three-word slogans. I think we can say that that has gone out the door. But he also said that the Abbott government essentially were poor economic managers, and that was what required a change in the prime ministership.


Looking at his Governor-General's speech, I still do not see any vision or any leadership for this country. We get a policy for $50 billion worth of tax cuts for big business. The Greens led on tax cuts for small business in the last parliament. We took that to the 2013 election. We were very proud that we got concessions for hardworking small business in Australia. Now we get $50 billion worth of tax cuts from the forward estimates for big business, many of which do not even pay their fair share of tax—and, believe me, I have sat on those committees and heard the evidence. There is the assumption that somehow trickle-down economics is going to stimulate economic activity.


What I think will stimulate economic activity—and this is a dangerous idea, Senator Paterson—is the government actually going out at record low interest rates, borrowing money and investing it in productive infrastructure in this country.



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  There is another article in the paper today by TD Securities talking about our AAA credit rating, and it is worth reading it word for word, Senator Williams—through you, Acting Deputy President. They make it very clear that our AAA credit rating is at risk because of our level of debt, but they also say it is debt not related to expenditure on productive infrastructure. You see, this is where your government is deceptive and misleading in all your spin and rhetoric about the debt problem in this country.


I agree that housing debt is too high in this country, and it is dangerous. I was the one who asked the previous head of the Treasury about the housing bubble and got a two-week reaction during the Mr Hockey period of Treasury. I am also concerned about personal consumption and high levels of household debt on consumption. But where is the debate on what I think is a massive moral challenge of our time, and that is avoiding underinvestment in future generations of this country?


I have collected this evidence in two long-ranging Senate inquiries, a select committee I chaired and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into regional capitals. We went right around the country and heard evidence of the massive, trillion-dollar infrastructure gap in this country—projects waiting for funding. If we want to stimulate economic demand in this country and get GDP up—which, by the way, would make some of those metrics that Senator Paterson has quoted today not look so bad—if we actually had a policy for stimulating the economy and helping invest in future generations, I could list categories of infrastructure we looked at, from small to big.


The Productivity Commission said, 'Well, bundling lots of small productive infrastructure projects together is a good idea,' as are seeking different ways of financing them: monetising and securitising those infrastructure projects, issuing bonds against projects in regional areas to raise capital and making pools of finance available to local governments, like in Tasmania. We need $900 million to upgrade our water infrastructure in Tasmania. Fifteen communities in my state do not have clean drinking water. They have to boil their water. Why isn't that money available?


Do you know what? The federal government could show leadership on this issue by making capital available for productive and transformative infrastructure projects. It could borrow money at record-low interest rates and make that available to both local governments and state governments. Do you think the Greens are the only people who are calling for government to take an active role in the lives of Australians? Do you think it is the Greens? Well, you would be wrong, Senator Williams—through you, Chair. Dr John Hewson, one of the first people to appear at our inquiry, was the one who put this idea to the select committee. Saul Eslake and the recently departed Mr Glenn Stevens were all up there saying the same thing.


What is wrong with government that it cannot show leadership and invest in the future of this country? It is because of this 'D' word—dirty debt—and it starts here in this chamber with the heightened spin we hear from the conservatives in this parliament. Let's have an honest discussion about debt, about why it can be useful for us and about why it is probably the only alternative we have in the paradigm that we are entering, where monetary policy all around the world has lost its potency. Actually it is fiscal policy that is going to get us through a potential recession. It is fiscal policy that will help give us jobs in our communities all around this country and give us the investment in the infrastructure that we need for future generations. By infrastructure, I tell you, I mean a really broad category of infrastructure. We are not talking about concrete roads; we are talking about public transport, we are talking about telecommunications—




Senator Williams:
  Are you talking about dams?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We are talking about dams actually, Senator Williams. Up in Townsville, I got some excellent proposals for infrastructure investment in dams that were not being financed. And our committee worked out why the private sector was not financing these infrastructure projects, why there is a clear market failure and why there is a role for government in our lives in this country—that is, economic leadership.


It is worth reading the latest Quarterly Essay. In it, George Megalogenis talks about our balancing act, about how we are going to get through what is ultimately going to be the doldrums for our country and our economy in the coming years. The conclusion he arrived at also is that we need infrastructure spending to invest in future generations and to stimulate the economy. But he also said we need a new structure around infrastructure financing, around how projects are selected and around how they are depoliticised. Because they are what the private sector is seeing as risk. They are the risk premiums the investors are building into their expectation on infrastructure financing and that is why they do not want to touch a lot of these infrastructure projects that are sitting there waiting to be funded. Government should bloody well fund them, in my opinion, because what we need in this country is economic leadership, not more spin—'leave it to the private sector, leave it to big business and everything will be fine'.


In terms of vision and leadership, it really does disappoint me that over those three Governor-General's speeches, we have gone from the age of entitlement to suddenly the same ideological attack on poor people in this country—the taxed and the taxed-nots—the same rhetoric. This stuff is not flying; people do not care about that. They actually want to see government step in and show leadership and play an active role in their lives. This kind of IPA Young Liberal party politics does not cut it with the people out on the street. Sorry, Senator Paterson—through you, Acting Deputy President—it just does not cut it. People want to see governments playing an active role in their lives.


It is an historic opportunity for us to nation build right now, to select projects we do want to see capital go into—projects that can be financed over time, projects that can be paid off, projects that can be monetised, projects that can create employment for Australians all around this country, projects that lead to a more prosperous country, projects that make us more sustainable, projects that give us a better quality of living, projects that make us happier. These are the things governments need to do. I am proud to say that if you do not think I have the evidence to support this then go and look at the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications inquiry into Planning, Procurement and Funding for Australia's future Infrastructure that we completed a week before the double-dissolution. It was backed by both the Liberal and Labor parties. There was no dissenting report. Have a read of it. Six months of evidence has gone into that from experts including Standard and Poor's—by the way, Senator Paterson, through you, Acting Deputy President—and it deals with the issue of the triple-A credit rating, why this can be done and why $50 billion is not unreasonable for us to go out and borrow now and invest now. Fifty billion dollars; let's borrow it, let's invest it and let's cut the crap about debt.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. Before I call you, Senator Cameron, I advise that at the conclusion of your contribution we will suspend the matter of public importance for a first speech.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:57):  I am very pleased to participate in this debate about the failure of the leadership of the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. I have to say, forgive me if I do not take seriously the lecture from Senator Paterson based on his very narrow experience in life, never mind economics. He was straight out of university into Senator Fifield's office, did a little bit of work with the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and then where did he go? He went to the IPA. What an absolute joy. And he has got the hide to come here and lecture us about economics. The guy has not lived yet, never mind having to worry about economics. He is full of fury, full of pompous bluster, full of nothing but economic analysis that is clearly wrong. What do we get now?




Senator Brandis:
  Where do you get your economics?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right.




Senator CAMERON:
  I get my economics looking after working people. That is where I get my economics. I get my economics from actually knowing what it is like, unlike Senator Brandis, to actually put food on the table for my family. I get my economics from knowing what it is like to worry about how I pay the mortgage. I get my economics from worrying about can I pay my bills. That is the economics I have got, a working-class economics that you, Senator Brandis, would not have a clue about, that you in your pompous, arrogant demeanour would have a clue about. You would not know what it was about.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cameron, would you resume your seat for one moment please. There will be silence on the right while Senator Cameron is heard and all comments will be through the chair. Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  I can understand, Mr Acting Deputy President, why they are all getting so uptight about hearing the truth about economics. You are not just laughing; what you are doing is laughing at the plight of working-class people in this country, because you do not understand the issues that they face. You do not understand that it is very difficult for many families to pay the bills, pay the mortgage, clothe their kids, get them off to school. All you want to do—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  And that is the theory we get from Senator Paterson—which is simply that microeconomics will fix the problems. 'You don't have to worry one iota about ordinary working people in this country. You don't have to worry about them. The economic theory of the IPA will be there.' Senator Paterson's job was Deputy Executive Director of the IPA—whatever that was. I noticed that the IPA, on the issue that we are debating here—that is, the competence of the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull—says, 'Turnbull's policies aren't Liberal, they're incoherent.' This is the IPA that Senator Paterson used to be the deputy director of. This is what Chris Berg from the IPA says:


It's hard not to conclude that Bill Shorten has the measure of Malcolm Turnbull. Policy after policy the Government is chasing the Opposition, rather than leading it.


This is the IPA. Senator Paterson was a leading light in the IPA. One minute he is criticising the coalition, then he is in here running the party line. What a great job the Prime Minister is doing when the organisation that Senator Paterson has come from is basically saying the Prime Minister is not up to it! 'Malcolm Turnbull ain't up to the job.' That is what your old organisation is saying. No wonder you are smiling—because you agree with that. You are one that would pull Malcolm Turnbull down in a jot. You would pull him down as soon as you could. Chris Berg says that negative gearing is only on the table because Labor announced its negative gearing policy in February. Labor is leading the debate, even according to the IPA.


Reforms to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission were, obviously, only done because Labor called for a royal commission into the banks. Again, the Prime Minister is not up to it. The coalition is not up to it. You are an absolute rabble. Malcolm Turnbull does not have the capacity to lead this country. And it goes on to say the Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, would you resume your seat. On a point of order, Senator Bernardi?




Senator Bernardi:
  It is on a point of order. The speaker has repeatedly referred to the Prime Minister by his incorrect title. It is either 'Mr Turnbull', 'the Prime Minister' or 'the member for Wentworth'. I would ask you to draw the member to order—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. I do; I accept your point of order. I am sure Senator Cameron will continue in that vein, addressing the Prime Minister as 'Mr Turnbull' or 'the Prime Minister'. Senator Cameron, please resume.




Senator CAMERON:
  I apologise, and I accept your position. If that is the best that the leader of the rebel group in the coalition can come up with, it is not much good. Senator Bernardi, the leader of the rebels—'call Mr Turnbull by his name, Mr, or call him by Prime Minister'. I know what you would be calling him, and it is none of those two things! It is certainly none of those two things. We hear you in the halls up here. We know what you think of Mr Turnbull. We know what you think of the Prime Minister and we know that you will bring him down as soon as you get the opportunity.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. Senator Macdonald, on a point of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  The point of order is relevance. I am interested in what Senator Bernardi does, but it is not germane to the debate. The debate is about the economy.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point, Senator Macdonald. Would you resume your seat. Senator Cameron, please resume through the chair, thank you.




Senator CAMERON:
  All the Macdonalds I know in Scotland were pretty tough people. I do not know what happened to them when they came to Australia. I think their gene pool was weakened a lot by Senator Macdonald—no toughness in this guy. What a wimp for a Macdonald! I cannot believe it. Anyway, with this Prime Minister, we know what people think of him: he is not up to the job. He is just not up to the job. We know that he is following every move that Senator Bernardi makes, because he knows that Senator Bernardi is determined to bring him down.


Look at what else is happening in Victoria. There is a guy down there called Michael Kroger. All you guys would know Michael Kroger. Is he up there in the gallery? Maybe he is up there. This is what Michael Kroger said about the Prime Minister: a lack of 'economic leadership in the country' is one of the key reasons the party failed at the polls. He knows that you failed. You lot are in absolute disarray. You get no economic policy, you get no leadership. Michael Kroger and the IPA are telling you: 'What a bunch of hopeless, hopeless politicians you are.' He goes on to say, 'There is period of policy confusion.' That is what you have got amongst the Liberals. Here we are seeing more policy confusion from the Liberals—changes to the GST, the ability of the states to raise their own taxes, negative gearing, capital gains tax and superannuation. That was the policy confusion of the Liberals. They are absolutely hopeless. They are pompous in their arrogance and pompous when they are here. No-one is more pompous than Senator Brandis, but even he, I think, is nodding in agreement with Michael Kroger's position. Michael Kroger went on to say there is 'absolute confusion for business and for voters'. He is talking about Liberal policy. He says:


In that period when we were putting things on and off the table and the electorate formed the opinion, 'well if you fellas, if you people, don't know what [you] are doing, that's a problem.


He did say, 'you fellas', because there are not many women over there in the coalition. But he said there was absolute policy confusion. He said:


The electorate got a view that we didn't have a clear idea of where we wanted to take the country in terms of the economy.


This is not Labor saying these things. This is Michael Kroger, one of the key players in the Liberal Party in Victoria. And the IPA are echoing that view.


So the Victorian Liberal Party, Senator Paterson, are not taking the sycophantic position that you are adopting. They are actually calling the Prime Minister out. They are saying he is incompetent; he is not up to the job. And he ain't going to be Prime Minister for too long if the Victorian Liberal Party get their way. That is the reality, so do not come here and give us your speeches with your economic theory from the IPA. Listen to some of the people that understand politics, listen to working-class people that are doing it tough and stop giving us your nonsense economic theory about: 'Everything will be okay if the markets let rip.'

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,34,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:33):  From the longest serving parliamentarian in this building to the newest senator, Senator Hume: my very heartiest congratulations on a speech which was intelligent, thoughtful, insightful, warm and caring, and was from a senator who clearly has a very, very big future in this place. My best wishes to you, Senator, and all the very best for the endeavours and the goals you have set yourself.


After that uplifting experience, it is my misfortune to have to return to the debate that was interrupted by that wonderful speech and to try and answer the debating points, in the drivel that came from Senator Cameron, that pass as economic theory and debate from the Labor Party. For the Labor Party to have the hide to criticise the coalition on any economic matter just leaves me breathless. As I mentioned, I have been here for a long time. So perhaps, for newer members, I could give a bit of a history of the Labor Party's management of the economy and money. It is encapsulated in a few short words: you cannot trust Labor with money.


Many people will not believe me when I tell them that, in the days of Hawke and Keating, I was paying interest at the rate of 17½ per cent on my concessional housing loan. The normal interest rate under Hawke and Keating was about 21 per cent, and it was not unknown for businesses to be paying 24 per cent, and even 28 per cent—as I recall, from my days practising law—for some people. And younger people simply do not believe me when I tell them that I was paying 17½ per cent under the Labor Party.


Labor continued on. We had double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment and almost-two-dozen-ish interest rates on ordinary loans. That was the legacy you got from Labor's mismanagement of the economy.


But Labor always put across a good story. There will be few who remember the 'L-A-W law' tax cuts, as they were called. This was before the '93 election—the election Mr Keating did not expect to win. The Labor Party actually legislated for tax cuts. It was passed through the parliament—with our support, of course, because we like lower taxes. Labor took that to the election—told the people of Australia, 'Look what we've done: tax cuts!' Do you know the first bit of legislation they did when they were unexpectedly returned at that election? They avoided, they reneged on, they cancelled, they reversed that L-A-W law tax cut and simply ripped the money back off Australian workers.


And so it goes on. We saw the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. Remember—and Senator Hume spoke about this—when we had $60 billion in the bank, put aside for a rainy day, put aside for future generations, put aside so we could give greater benefits, so we could encourage people to work harder and pay less tax? There was $60 billion put aside. It took two short years for Labor not only to spend the $60 billion but to run up in its first or second budget a deficit of $20 billion. That was horrendous, but in retrospect $20 billion from Labor was child's play. Labor then had six years in government where they spent and spent money that they did not have, borrowed from overseas lenders, and it got to a stage where if something had not intervened, like a change of government, the debt that would have been burdening the Australian people would have reached in the order of $700 billion. I will just repeat that for anyone who might be listening. Labor came into power. They had $60 billion in credit, in the kitty, left to them by the Howard government. And in six short years not only did they spend the $60 billion but they ran up a debt that if not arrested would have reached $700 billion. So, for Labor to bring forward a motion criticising anybody, let alone the coalition government, on economic mismanagement is just ridiculous.


Regarding the commitments made before the recent election—and the Governor-General confirmed those commitments in his wonderful speech to parliament yesterday—this government has a real plan for the Australian economy and a plan to draw in unfunded expenditure to continue the essential services of government and to get Australia back on track. I had pages of comments I wanted to make on the wonderful program this government has planned in an area that I am committed to, and that is the north of Australia. I just do not have time even to mention them by single-syllable identifiers, but the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is one. All of the money being spent on roads and rail in the north, all of the money being spent on defence and border protection in the north—these are just a very few projects of the wonderful program that this government has for the next three years for Australia. I look forward to it. It is going to be an exciting time.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2016-08-31,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:41):  I am sure there is an echo in the chamber. I know it is a new parliament, but I hear the same old platitudes that we hear over and over and over again from the Liberal Party and in particular from Senator Macdonald, who continues to repeat the myth that is becoming apparent to the Australian community, that the Liberal Party, for all their constant claiming of being good economic managers, are absolutely misrepresenting the reality of Australia's economic history. There is no greater example of how bad they actually are as economic managers than the man they have now allowed to be their Prime Minister, the man who came in to remove Tony Abbott because he said Tony was not doing a good job with the economy. So, Malcolm came in to fix it. I thought it was Mr Pyne who was going to be the fixer, but Malcolm decided that he would be the fixer, and instead of fixing the NBN he decided to turn his hand to the economy of the nation.


Well, what we have seen on his watch and on the Liberals' watch is the lowest jobs growth and the lowest wage growth in Australia's recorded history. And why does that matter so much? Why does wage growth—not cutting wages and cutting penalty rates—matter so much? Because people need that jobs growth. We need inflation to keep the economy moving, and we need people to have enough money to spend and to keep putting that money into the economy. Sadly, this government only talk about debt as a negative; they do not understand the concept of using money as an investment. They myth of good management that I have just articulated continues, though, to be spun by those opposite.


What we have seen from Malcolm Turnbull is a spectacular misrepresentation of an understanding of what good economic management might look like. I know that since September and his rise to the office of Prime Minister we have had a range of economic plans. You could take your pick. It was like a 'choose your own adventure'—wake up any day and you might find that Malcolm has one view of the economy and the next day it will have completely changed. We had the increase in the GST. I have a theory about the discussions around that, particularly with New South Wales Premier Baird, who was absolutely counting on some sort of private deal that I think he thought he had got with Tony Abbott to get the GST funding and be able to fund the necessary health budget for New South Wales. That deal fell over, and Malcolm came in, and instead we have had the discussion that yes, the GST is on the table. And then it is off the table. Malcolm had multiple positions. Then, when that did not look like it was going to fly, he moved to double taxation of the states. Talk about duplication of responsibilities. Talk about increased costs. Talk about red tape and inefficiencies. But that was one of the genius plans that we saw hatched by Malcolm Turnbull, the great economic leader of the nation—absolutely not a reality.


Then there was his great idea of a percentage floor on GST distributions. In addition to that there have been no fewer than four proposals on lifetime superannuation caps. In the course of the election, standing on the side of the road in the main street of Gosford, Mann Street, I watched voter after voter come up and address the people who were handing out pamphlets for the Liberals. They talked about their absolute anger at the retrospectivity of the superannuation proposals from what they thought was their own government. It reveals how out of touch this manager of the economy, which Malcolm claims to be, is.


I would like to make some remarks inside the beltway in terms of the Liberal Party. Senator Cameron made a few remarks referring to an article I am sure that he saw from Neelima Choahan in The Sydney Morning Herald. After the election Michael Kroger indicated that he completely blamed the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for their failure to show economic leadership in this country. He attributed that failure of economic leadership as the main cause of the failure of this government at the polls. The confusion from the period of September to May that I have just spoken was something that he cited, but let us not forget that we also had the confusion about the tax white paper—revealing another characteristic of this government. People forget that the tax white paper was going to be on and then all of a sudden they pulled it. This confusion, which has been a signature of the Abbott-Turnbull period of Liberal governance, is most prominent if you look at the area of the economy. 


Malcolm Turnbull promised new economic leadership, but we have seen the deficit blow out. It was registered in the budget last year as $11 billion worse and worse in every year of the forward estimates—blowing out the deficit by $36 billion since the 2015 budget. Under their economic management, which Senator Macdonald was lauding in his most recent comments, we have seen the Liberal Party, under the leadership of Tony Abbott and now Malcolm Turnbull, triple the deficit in three budgets, and that debt is absolutely still going up—$100 billion worth of debt.


The government talk a lot about tax. They keep saying how they are a low-taxing government, but the GDP ratio will rise every single year of the forward estimates, hitting 23.5 per cent by 2020. That is the recipe that we are seeing unfold under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull and that is why today's debate is so important. Malcolm Turnbull is absolutely failing to come up with any adequate economic policy for this country. It could not have been put better than the way it was put by Ross Gittens, who actually penned an article as recently as 9 July. His article was titled, 'Man with no plan leaves voters with heap of flimflam.' Ross Gittins pointed out the fact that:


Malcolm Turnbull went to the election offering a 'national plan for jobs and growth' that was supposed to secure our future.


Ross Gittens then clearly pointed out that Malcolm Turnbull will be very unlikely 'to be able to implement' his plan, which was the 'phased reduction over 10 years of the rate of company tax, from 30 per cent to 25 per cent'. In the structure that Malcolm advanced he not only proposed a tax cut that would be given to great big businesses but also actually redefined small businesses from genuine small businesses, which are vital to the local economies of much of regional Australia, and instead put his mates at the big end of town right in the spot to be able to get all of the cuts.


Clearly Labor have opposed the cut, except for the immediate reduction to 27.5 per cent for genuinely small businesses, because we actually understand the economy. We understand that workers need to get adequate and fair pay for a day's work, that they are a vital part of the economy and that it is not just big business that deserves the attention of the government. Ross Gittens went on to point out that the supposed five-point plan for the economy of Australia is actually 'a muddle of things that will be done, things already done and a point saying what the plan will achieve.' He continued:


Point four is the company tax cut and point five is 'a strong new economy with more than 200,000 jobs to be created in 2016-17'. This is just Treasury's budget forecast for growth in employment. Few of those extra jobs would have been 'created' by anything the government did.


The disingenuousness way this government talks about the economy is an insult to Australia's intelligence.


Worse still for me, as a Labor senator, is the impact of the choices that are being revealed by this terrible economic mismanagement of the federal government. In advancing the choices that they advance, they take away from other parts of the economic reality of this nation. We have seen massive cuts to schools, cuts to Medicare cuts to families which increase the cost of living, cuts to higher education and cuts to veterans hospitals. We have seen a GP tax, cuts that are impacting people's access to doctors, and a big tax break for banks and multinationals. The choices that this government have made and—for want of a better word to describe it—the economic mess that they have inflicted under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull deserve the derision of the Australian people.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2016-08-31,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:51):  It gives me great pleasure today to rise once again to set the record straight, as senator after senator from the ALP strides in here with their fictional assessment of what our economic plan as a government is for our nation. Senator O'Neill does it every time. Senator O'Neill came in here and once again put on the record the lies about our education spend. I am sorry, Senator O'Neill—well, actually, I am quite rapt with it—but right now we have, as a federal government, record spending on schools, despite the economic challenges your government left us with. So, please, pick up the budget and read it. I am sure the minister's office would be very happy to help walk you through it with a special briefing on how much we are investing in Australian schools for Australian taxpayers and for our economic future.


I find it very difficult to be lectured—or should I say hectored—by the Labor Party on our government's economic plan. We have to have good economic management. It is essential. We have a very generous social safety net in this country and we need to have a strong economic plan to be able to invest in infrastructure, both physical and social, to build a strong future. I think it is highly ridiculous that the Labor Party chooses to critique us, when we just want to take a walk through, let's say, the past Treasurer's way. Let us have a look at Wayne Swan's commitment to budget surpluses and to dealing with debt, deficit and spending. In his first budget speech he claimed he would deliver 'a surplus built on disciplined spending'. If only it was so. The result of that promise by the Treasurer was a $27 billion deficit. In 2009-10, Swan's budget night address told Australians that the nation was 'on a path to surplus by 2015-16'. Hallelujah! We should be there. The result was a $54.5 billion deficit. In 2010-11, the final budget under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd mark 1, the Treasurer said that the Labor budget's program would see 'the budget return to surplus in three years time'. Fantastic, former Treasurer Swan: if only you had actually approached your Treasury oversight with any sense of an economic plan and policy which would actually help to achieve that. 


I could go on and on and on, but I am short of time and I really want to get the positive story out of today's MPI. Rather than go through the litany of failures under Labor, I want to talk about our strong economic plan and a Prime Minister that is absolutely committed to ensuring that we have at our ready the instruments and the levers to build economic growth, backing hardworking small businesses—that is exactly what we are doing. We know that small business is the engine room of our economy. We are cutting small business tax rates so that they can reinvest in their businesses. Often they are family owned enterprises.


Again, Senator O'Neill, I have to let you know that we are cracking down on tax avoidance. So let us get the little mythology that we are not doing that out of the chamber. We are cracking down on tax avoidance because we want a fair tax system, a tax system where tax is as low as possible and where those who are seeking to avoid paying their fair share are prosecuted and captured. We are investing in social infrastructure—guaranteed funding for hospitals and schools, not promises on a whim. These are things that we can control, where we can say, 'We commit to funding these things going forward so that we can deliver high-quality education and health care to our citizens.' 


We are backing our future. We are backing young Australians. We have new jobs pathways so that young Australians who want to get experience in different industries have a pathway to work. That is backing our future by ensuring that young Australians can get useful experience in terms of an intern program. I think it is a great economic plan, and I just do not see why the Labor Party does not support jobs and growth going forward so that we can build a strong Australia, a strong economy, together.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2016-08-31,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:56):  I have to pick up where Senator McKenzie left off, in the sense that those in the Labor Party do not seem to care about the economic prosperity and welfare of Australia and the responsibility we have to future generations. If they did, they would support a sustainable budget, they would support prudent spending cuts and they would support the redirection of available to dollars to places where they are going to be the most productive. But, no, that is not the method the Labor Party have chosen. Picking up from where Mr Rudd, when he was Prime Minister, took off, they have spent and established programs that have basically robbed, from tomorrow, the generations post us so that we can enjoy some benefits today. That is a serious moral failing. 


Until the Labor Party are prepared to acknowledge the path they have set this country on, the path that they insist will not be deviated from by this government, we are sentencing our nation to a massive economic issue in the years ahead. There are those in the Greens party and on the other side who say, 'If we only borrow more and spend more now, we will be better off in the future.' That is not the way works. As Senator McKenzie and others in this debate have highlighted, we were promised again and again and again that the borrowings were only temporary, that we were going to return to surplus, that we were going to get the economic dividend and that growth was going to come. All of that was nonsense, and they knew it was nonsense as they were peddling it. Mr Swan as Treasurer would get his Treasury figures up and he would pick one that suited his economic forecasts, and off we would go. He was going to deliver surplus after surplus after surplus. 


Since they have lost office, they have stood in the way of budget reform. They have stood in the way of sustainable savings. Instead, they have adopted Orwell's newspeak, where they say that a tax increase is a saving. Well, a tax increase is not a saving. A tax increase is a new impost on the productive, working income generation of our country, because they are not prepared to do what is necessary. Well, if they are not prepared to do what is necessary, I would invite them, on behalf of the Australian people, to get out of the way of those of us who are committed to looking after our children and our children's children. It is incumbent upon us not just to be stewards of the environment, as I am sure Senator Whish-Wilson and others would like us to be, but to be good stewards of our economy. If you think that catastrophic debt levels do not start somewhere, go and have a look at nations all around the world, where politicians were kicking the can down the road and saying, 'It's okay; it's only temporary.' Then, later on, it became, 'It's okay; it's not going to be our problem.' And then, eventually, it becomes someone's problem, and we see the economic disasters that have happened in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland. We are going to see it in the emerging and developing markets as the US dollar rises and interest rates increase in the US. We are going to see a serious economic problem globally. And Australia hitherto was immune to it, effectively, because we ran budget surpluses, we had savings in the bank and we had no debt. That was all demolished by sending cheques to dead people and people overseas under the Rudd government, by the Pink Batts program, by the school hall building programs, which wasted tens of billions of dollars for next to no long-term benefit.


This is a shameful indictment. And, as I said, if the Labor Party, in their intransigence, are not prepared to be part of the solution, then get out of the way. Stop being so stubborn and bloody-minded about protecting the future of our children. That is what this government is seeking to do; it is seeking to restore the balance to the budget to get it back on the right track so that we can fulfil our moral obligations to our children and their children.

In particular, I would like to welcome my new Queensland Labor colleagues, Senator Murray Watt and Senator Anthony Chisholm, who I know will make an outstanding contribution to this place. I would also like to acknowledge our new Queensland members of parliament in the lower house: Susan Lamb, representing Longman; Cathy O'Toole, representing Herbert; and Milton Dick, representing Oxley. I would also like to acknowledge some of the Queensland Labor Candidates in the recent election who were unsuccessful on this occasion, including Jacqui Pedersen in Petrie, Leisa Neaton in Capricornia, Zac Beers in Flynn, Des Hardman in Forde and Pat O'Neil in Brisbane. They were all very, very close to success but not quite there. I know that they will be back better and stronger next time and that they will not give up on their fight against inequality.


On 15 September last year, the Prime Minister took to his Facebook page to announce to the Australian people that there was never a more exciting time to be an Australian. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. The Prime Minister then went on to say that the government would ensure that all Australians understand that their government recognises the opportunities of the future and that he was putting in place the policies and the plans to enable them to take advantage of that. In the same statement, he continued by saying:


We have to recognise that the disruption that we see driven by technology, the volatility and change is our friend, is our friend if we are agile and smart enough to take advantage of it. 


It was a proclamation that the innovation nation had been born.


On Monday this week, the Prime Minister outlined his 25-point battle plan, a battle plan to stifle innovation, a battle plan to hurt low- and middle-income families and a battle plan to take up the same fight as his predecessor, Mr Tony Abbott. This battle plan can only be described as the same old ramrod, cavalier approach to governance that the people of Australia can expect from the Liberal Party, with some of this legislation being on the table since 2014.


Yesterday, the Australian released Newspoll data showing yet another slump in public support for Mr Turnbull and the Liberals. When asked if he was worried about the new data, the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, said: 'No, I'm not. People elect us to get on with the job; that is what we are doing. We've got a raft of legislation coming in this week. There are some 24 bills or thereabouts.' Need I remind the Treasurer that some of these bills are more than three years old. How does that equate to getting on with the job? I would describe that as a job not being done!


This government appears to be a continuation of the Abbott government, which had the lowest rate of passing legislation since the 1960s. So much for change. So much for being nimble and agile. So much for innovation. Under this unruly government, Australia is slipping. Australia is the only advanced economy in the world that is shedding jobs in renewable energy. We have fallen from 30th to 60th in global internet speeds, despite billions of dollars in cost blow-outs. Our schools are slipping in science, maths, reading and writing, yet the government is cutting billions from education. As Mr Shorten said, we cannot have an innovation nation without first having an education nation.


Income inequality in Australia has been rising. We know that inequality is one of the impediments to economic growth. Overall, Australia has had strong policy and institutional settings, which have acted to slow the growth of income inequality. I refer to the recent report by the Chifley Research Centre of August 2016, which noted that our policy and institutional settings include: 


… a strong social safety net, including means-tested welfare, universal healthcare, and universal superannuation; progressive income tax and a low level for a consumption tax; high public investment in education; a solid minimum wage and minimum employment standards; and anti-discrimination protection. 


The report states:


It is worth noting that many of these fundamentals are exactly the features of Australia’s economy that are clearly in the sights of the current Coalition Government. 


This government is hurting Australia and it is hurting Australia right now. Australia has slipped two places on the Global Innovation Index, failing to export and commercialise enough ideas to push into the top tier. Australia is placed 19th on the 2016 index, down from 17th when Mr Abbott was Prime Minister. According to the index, Australia ranks in the top 10 worldwide when it comes to tertiary education participation, infrastructure, information and communication technologies, access to credit and new business activity. But it falls short of global standards when it comes to government spending on secondary education per pupil, the number of science and engineering graduates, the ease of protecting minority investors, and ICT imports.


That is why Labor has policy platforms to foster innovation, to make sure Australia does not get left behind. The 'Your Child. Our Future' plan provided for a range of innovations, such as more one-on-one support and attention for each student; early intervention programs in every school, so that students do not fall behind; remedial literacy and numeracy support in every school; extension classes to challenge students that are excelling in class; and a range of other things. Our plan for computer coding in every school aimed at developing and promoting innovative teaching of coding in our schools; ensuring teachers in every school gain access to practical hands-on training in coding and its integration into the classroom; and a range of other features. Our plans to fund STEM teaching would ensure we have the right people in place to teach our kids the skills and jobs they need for the future.


 Australia has a chronic shortage of women graduating with computer science or coding skills. Since 2001, the rate of women enrolling in an IT degree has actually fallen from about one in four to just one in 10. To counter this, Labor launched our Girls into Code policy—a $4.5 million grants program to support organisations that promote, encourage and inspire girls to learn code. But the current government will have none of this. They would sooner have their supporters and their leader chant 'jobs and growth' in an attempt to mask, shield and hide their own incompetence.


Where is the growth? Where are the jobs? Where is the good news? Truthfully, there is not much. Mr Turnbull and the Liberals do not innovate; they agitate. We saw this only yesterday when coalition backbenchers banded together to reintroduce changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. So much for their innovation agenda; they are literally trying to change things back to the way they used to be. The Liberals are not looking forward; they are looking backwards. 


In years to come, when we look back on this government, what will people say the great achievement of the Turnbull government was? I doubt they will say much. They might say the government achieved a tax cut for the top end of town. They might say the government reached a consensus on a weak superannuation policy. I can tell honourable senators what they have achieved. They have succeeded in ensuring that Australia just recorded its lowest wage growth in 18 years. They have succeeded in trying to pass the same legislation for the past three years. They have succeeded in achieving nothing.
