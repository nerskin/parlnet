"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-25,"—Once again we have the government moving to exempt two bills from the provisions of standing order 111, which is the standing order that was devised by, amongst others, former Greens (WA) senator Christabel Chamarette to ensure that the Senate had proper time to consider bills before debating them, amending them, passing them or rejecting them. The two bills that the government now wants exempt from that process are the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. Let us look at the second one, which is undoubtedly very important. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's own notes on this bill and given to the Senate point out that the origins of this proposal date back to: 
... meetings of a large number of industry leaders, including dairy company CEOs, held in 2000 to discuss possible future industry services, structures and funding mechanisms.
The minister goes on to say:
As a result of these meetings a draft possible structure was outlined at the December 2000 AGM—
annual general meeting—
of the ADIC. The matter was further developed during 2001 and broad agreement on a proposed set of arrangements to put to Government was reached in December 2001. 
It may be that the government is arguing that it has taken 10 months for it to get that bill together. It may be that the minister believes that it was complicated enough for him to spend nine or 10 months before he could get it in here. But suddenly, when it gets into the Senate, it is so urgent that it has to be exempt from the cut-off so that the few weeks that are required by the cut-off for the Senate to consider the matter and for senators to go back to constituents and get their point of view are not to be ensured. I disagree; the Greens disagree.
This is happening more and more. Ministers are being dilatory, lazy and slow and then they come into the Senate, under pressure from constituents, and want the Senate to not have time to properly consider it. That is not good democratic process, Mr President, as I am sure you will agree. We need to be able to go back to our constituent bodies to make sure that the legislation reflects not only our point of view but also the considered point of view of the people affected by it; in this case the dairy industry. In the case of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, which is looking at funding in coming years, we certainly need to be able to adequately consult and get feedback from the people concerned once this legislation comes into the Senate.
The government has to get this right. It is making a habit of proposing exemptions for bills which do not have urgency in the way that they have been prepared and which have involved considerable consultation between the government and the community. In the case of the dairy bill, as you have just heard, two or three years of consultation have occurred. It is brought to the Senate and suddenly the government says, `We do not have time to wait for the Senate to do the same.' One minister says, `We do not have time for the 75 other senators to go out and find out what their constituents think.' I do not agree. It is not that these matters are not important—they are. But it is equally important that, if we are to make the right decisions and come up with amendments, we need to consult. If there are aggrieved people out there or people who can see ways of improving this legislation then it is important that we are able to get that information, draft amendments, and approach the debate fully informed by our constituents. 
I, for one, am not accepting the government's increased tendency to put up bills like these with a cut-off attached to them. There is a requirement in the Senate that you wait until the end of a sitting period if you introduce a bill at the start of it, or you wait until after the next break for the next round of sittings if you introduce the bill in the second half of a group of sittings. That is a sensible move because it gives some weeks for the Senate to be properly informed and to make sure that it makes the right decision. I am going to defend that, so I oppose this motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-09-25,"—I will be brief. Senator Brown makes some very good points that deserve a response. I was here, as you were, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, when our old friend Christabel Chamarette, then Senator Chamarette, moved this motion. In fact, history should record that it was one member of the other place—in the body of the member for O'Connor, Mr Wilson Tuckey, another friend of mine—who came up with this idea and gave it to Christabel. If you had a yarn with Christabel, Senator Brown, she would tell you about it. Christabel would also tell you that we envisaged, and the Senate envisaged, at the time that there would be exemptions from the cut-off. The government in these sittings, just to make sure that the record is clear, has sought exemption and received it for only one bill. 
These bills, as is normal practice for me as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, were advised to senators. We distributed a list of legislation that we hoped to have dealt with during the sittings. I wrote to Senator Brown and other leaders and whips with a list on 8 August, some time before the session started, and indicated not only the bills that we wanted to deal with but also those that would require exemption from the cut-off. I think it is fair to say that, although there are a number that may need the cut-off, a much larger number fall within the requirements of standing order 111: the agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation; the plant breeders rights amendment bill; the plant health Australia funding bill; the Torres Strait fisheries amendment bill; the ASIO legislation; the bankruptcy amendments; the copyright bills; the criminal code legislation; the customs legislation; the family law amendment bills; the family law legislation; the jurisdiction of courts legislation; the marriage amendment bill; the proceeds of crime package; the sex discrimination package; the broadcasting services bill and so on. Most of the bills that we seek to deal with in this session will not need exemption from the cut-off, but there are some.
The ones that we are debating today are the Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. The government—as Senator Brown knows, but I think is important for the public at large to know—distributed detailed reasons for the urgency and I think Senator Brown has referred to those. I think it is unfair to characterise the ministers responsible as dilatory or lazy. The ministers involved are neither dilatory nor lazy, and I do not think that is a fair way of describing those ministers. An enormous number of people are involved in the work of bringing forward legislation to this chamber. There are the public servants who are the draftspeople, and the industry groups and the quasi-government organisations who need to be consulted. There is an enormous amount of work that goes into bringing these sorts of bills before this place and, of course, the government is very keen to ensure that the Senate looks at them closely. Only recently the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee considered these pieces of legislation and no senator sought to have either of those bills referred to committees for further consideration. That sends a signal to me that, generally speaking, no senator wanted to see those bills get further consideration by a legislation committee. Many bills in this place do go to those committees and get extra consideration.
That is not to say that Senator Brown is not right about the extent that senators may wish to use extra time to have a look at some of these bills. You do not necessarily have to send the bill to a legislation committee or a reference committee to have that extra work done. A senator may wish to do that extra work in their own office and talk with people. That is exactly why standing order 111 is there. Also, the Senate recognises that there will be occasions when you need to exempt bills from standing order 111. Christabel Chamarette envisaged these occasions when she moved the motion with the support of the coalition parties and I think the process has worked successfully. I do not run away from a debate about the issue. It is a sound standing order. It is one that we support but we also support our democratic right from time to time to seek an exemption from it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-09-25,"—by leave—I have just a few comments. I think it is important for the chamber to understand that there are now a number of crossbench people and parties. You have the Greens, One Nation and the Independents—
—And two groups of Democrats.
—and of course the Democrats. I think it is very important to realise that we do need time as well. One of the reasons for the cut-off was to ensure that we did have that particular time and that we were not just flooded with legislation. I rise to indicate that I hope that the Manager of Government Business does not intend to so stack the program with legislation as to force extraordinary hours of sittings of this chamber as we get towards Christmas. I really hope that the Manager of Government Business would bear in mind—and I am sure he does—the need for us to get over each piece of legislation and allow the time that is needed for that. 
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-09-25,"—Of the two bills that we are dealing with here this morning, I will start with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 and then move on to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 seeks to foil pattern bargaining by amending the Workplace Relations Act. This bill also aims to bestow on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission new powers to defer a bargaining period for a specified time. During the deferment or cessation of the bargaining period, the commission removes the statutory protection available to persons engaged in industrial action whose sole aim is to achieve a new workplace agreement. I ask: why shouldn't they seek a new workplace agreement? If indeed the business is progressing, then the work force should progress with the business.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill is a modified version of the original bill which was rejected by the Senate, first in 1999 and again in 2000. The current form of this bill still leaves a lot to be desired and is nothing short of being callous. The bill has no intention of assisting the genuine bargaining process. It is simply a tool to give the government a double dissolution trigger. However, the one thing this bill will do is stop bargaining altogether. 
In truth, the only great misdemeanour of pattern bargaining is that it is a logical and effective response to a deregulated wages system. It is commonsense that workers from one industry will have interests in common with other workers from the same industry in another workplace. Consequently, they expect their union to promote their interests. To decline them their rights and to limit their prospects through legislation confined to an individual business is establishing an environment whereby employees will be bargaining at a level where their bargaining power is at its weakest. This legislation is an ideological test that industry and its work force can do without.
Labor has always strongly supported enterprise bargaining. It has always been an integral part of our industrial relations policy, and it is a policy that should be left alone. It is apparent that the Liberal government, rather than taking a progressive attitude to improving enterprise bargaining, has taken an obstructive position. The government's approach is one that promotes industrial action rather than limits or reduces it. The old adage `if it is not broken, don't touch it', takes on new meaning with the Howard government. Their view of industrial relations is, `if it is fair for the workers, make it unfair.'  
To put it clearly, there is a whole sequence of conduct that takes place before anybody considers taking industrial action. This conduct includes: the exchange of correspondence; efforts to arrange meetings and then, consequently, having those meetings; setting out the claims and counter claims, and then due process of consideration of those claims and counter claims. During the progress of negotiations, compromises and proposals are put on the table by both sides in an effort to reach a mutual agreement—`mutual' being the operative word. When a situation arises and negotiations hit a deadlock, the parties can use the conciliation process of the Industrial Relations Commission. A prime example of this was during the recent BHP Western Port dispute. There is a certainty when parties bargain in good faith and that certainty is that agreement is more likely to be reached and in a quicker period of time. 
What the government recurrently disregards are the remarkable improvements that had been made by pattern bargaining. One of the real improvements is that you do not have what I always referred to, when I was practising in the industrial arena, as `leapfrogging': one factory gets an increase and an improvement in conditions and the factory down the road tries to get just that little bit better than the factory up the road. Pattern bargaining does away with that leapfrogging process. There has been improvement in productivity techniques and generally the development of best practice models which, if not implemented with the consent of the trade union movement, have been implemented as a result of the trade union movement. This has been done through enterprise bargaining. It cannot be denied that the entire process has resulted in a great number of businesses evolving from the system where they were only capable of producing for a domestic, patchy and unreliable market. They are now in a position where they are highly developed and have systems that allow them to lift their production to competitively challenge the rest of the world.
The other important thing about pattern bargaining is that it allows industry to plan. It creates an environment where the employees do not have unrealistic expectations and it removes conflict between the employer, the workers and their unions. Perhaps the greatest thing about the introduction of enterprise bargaining was the fact that workers, unions and management actually spoke to each other, not in a confrontationist way, but in a meaningful way where they were looking to progress the business in the interests of all involved. In the current system there is sufficient scope to allow for adjustments for companies that are struggling and for periods when markets are depressed. There is also the opportunity to make adjustments to wages and conditions where technological change has brought about improved work practices and production methods. It keeps the parties in touch with reality. There are no grandiose claims by the employer or the employees. They get down to the real issues and negotiate in good faith. The unions know the reality of what is happening on a global scale, and the organisations used by the employers—known as the employers' unions— have a like knowledge. Pattern bargaining has to be seen as the most effective way of keeping a degree of control on employment within industry groups.
I now turn to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. I will preface this by saying that, in my time with the union movement, I think that I would have been strung up on many occasions had I suggested that there be a secret ballot before people took their action. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Workplace Relations Act to provide for compulsory secret ballots before industrial action is taken. Like the previous bill that I spoke about, the government has twice in the past wanted to introduce compulsory secret ballots: in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999—that is something that we might want to talk about at some time in a realistic light—and in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2000. Senate committees reported on both these bills.
Essentially, the reintroduction of this bill, albeit with some changes to neutralise several criticisms, is another possible double dissolution trigger. That is all that this is about. It is not about improving industrial relations. It is simply about getting the government that trigger for a double dissolution. The veracity of the government's changes to this bill has done little to address these previous concerns or its critics. Currently, the amendments will require the conduct of a secret ballot by union or non-union members, as the case may be, as a prerequisite for gaining authorisation from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take ensuing protected industrial action against the employer during enterprise bargaining negotiations. That would not be such a bad idea, provided that on the way through and at the conclusion there was a secret ballot to see if workers would go back to work or whether they would lift any restrictions that were in place. But the bill does not go that far. 
The argument for this is to make certain that those playing a part in industrial action have decided upon the action themselves and have not been misled by union officials. Let me make it very clear that I never misled anyone before action was taken. All votes, for whatever reason, including industrial action such as stoppages, overtime restrictions or whatever, were always done in an open and democratic way. If people want to be a part of a work force and want to achieve something, then they should be prepared to put their hand up and be seen to be promoting an idea, not hiding behind a secret ballot that will not change anything. I can remember one occasion when we were instructed by the commission to conduct a secret ballot because the company was insistent that the count had been misjudged on the first occasion. We conducted the secret ballot, and on this occasion got a unanimous decision to take action against the employer. It proves nothing. It is words and a frustrating way of doing things. If people are confronted with a system where they have to take a secret ballot, they will not wait around to do it; they will walk at the time. This is where this government has got it so wrong.
The government would like you to believe that union members may be misled by union officials. The real question is: how gullible are the workers? I suggest that they are not gullible. The truth of the matter is that the ballot procedure is so complicated and bureaucratic that, if followed through, it will thwart effective industrial action by employees or encourage wildcat strikes. That will be the outcome. People will not tolerate the frustrating processes that are contained within this bill. The bill also robs the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of its present good judgment to direct a pre-strike ballot where it considers that it would facilitate the settling of a dispute. This particular bill is deliberately intended to strengthen the position of employers in industrial disputes. Strengthening the position of one side against the other can only lead to continuing conflict. It will do nothing to resolve the dispute. You build up frustration, you build up anger and the result is that the workers will react. Any good legislation should look at a fair, just and equitable way of managing it.
Such is the case that, if this bill were passed, employers would not be obliged to hold a secret ballot with their shareholders before locking out employees. Where is the fairness in that? It is all one sided. Nor are employees required to take part in a secret ballot to return to work. If you are going to make something fair and equitable, you have to follow it all the way through, and this government does not think that far ahead. 
It is evident that the Howard government has tried to exploit this issue on a number of occasions. There has been a small minority of trade unionists who may not have always operated in the best interests of their members or for the national interest. It is, however, incredibly unfair for the Howard government to take advantage of a small number of scallywags on this issue and subsequently respond to an industrial relations framework on the basis of the activities of a minority group of people for the purpose of obstructing rather than nurturing a fair and equitable industrial relations system.
There is no provision in this bill to deal with shonky or unscrupulous employers. While I understand that some people get frustrated and excited about industrial relations when they feel that the workers are being disadvantaged, there are also many employers that are less than pure in the light of things when it comes to industrial relations. In fact, it is not unlike some employers to promote poor industrial relations for their own advantage. Both these bills are designed to disadvantage decent workers of Australia for the government's ideological pandering to their big business contributors. I urge the Senate to support the opposition's amendments. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I rise to speak in relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. The second bill relates to what might be referred to, from the government's perspective and, I think, half-heartedly, as secret ballots. Before I deal substantially with the matters that I intend to raise this morning, it seems that there is a body of thought that goes something like this. The government introduced both of these bills some time ago in a number of slightly different forms from this—I think it is by now about the third time but I am open to correction. I am sure someone is keeping the statistics in relation to how many times this government has been pursuing this failed agenda. The earlier incarnations of these two bills were, perhaps from my perspective and not the government's, far harsher and contained, I thought, provisions that were untenable and not likely to work in the real world—certainly not in industrial relations, in any event. It seems that, if you listen to some of the speeches from the government, the bills are now in a much more amenable state—the government has listened and has moved to assist the process and has made some concessions. That seems to be the import of the government's view. You can see that in the two bills themselves: they are not reincarnations of the earlier bills that were being pushed by this government. They are, albeit slightly, different from the earlier versions and, some might say—certainly not I— in a form that can now be seriously considered and progressed.
However, it really begs a question. It is an old tactic. The government are almost saying, `We introduced a very hard version. Here is a very difficult bill; we know the opposition will not be able to support it so they will reject it. We will come back and try again a second time. We will come back a third time with a softer version. By that time we might have demonstrated to them that we have heard their complaints and they should now rise to meet us halfway.' To the opposition they say, `We have come down a little bit and now you should come up a little bit and pass the bills or at least seriously consider them.' But it is an old tactic. It is really one that the government should not consider and should not really bring back seriously. These bills are, and remain, flawed in my view. They are not about what their titles state. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill is not about genuine bargaining at all. It is far from it. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill is not about assisting the parties in industrial relations to enterprise bargain at all. It is not about helping the industrial relations system. It is not about helping employees bargain with employers. It is not about assisting unions to help their employees to bargain—not at all.
The government, in my view, seems hell-bent on introducing anti-employer—I cannot see that this legislation will assist employers either—anti-employee and anti-union legislation. It is still flawed not only from the perspective of employees but also from the perspective of employers. It creates unnecessary regulation and rules, and it creates unnecessary provisions for parties to be able to deal with industrial relations. Enterprise bargaining is the path that was set some time ago. It was introduced by Labor. If I recall correctly, Mr Brereton provided for enterprise bargaining in the industrial relations framework and it has continued. Other countries have dealt with enterprise bargaining over a longer period and, for all those detractors of enterprise bargaining, it is a system that allows parties to bargain and produce outcomes. 
What this legislation does and what this government seems keen on doing is simply continue to complicate the issues, to make enterprise bargaining harder. You wonder whether this government is actually for enterprise bargaining at all or whether there is a subplot going on—whether the government, by continuing to introduce this type of legislation in this place, is really trying to say, `We are actually not for enterprise bargaining. We would rather go back to a different system.' I would be only too happy to hear from the government in its summation of the second reading debate about whether it still believes enterprise bargaining is worth it, whether it thinks that enterprise bargaining is still on the table and whether it is serious about enterprise bargaining being the main game. 
This next matter is interesting and I did note it. I do not know whether it was a matter that the government had seriously thought about when they sat down to consider this bill, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. In the reintroduced bill the government recognised that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has continued with good faith bargaining. The term has reappeared in the amendments to this bill for the first time for some time. As we know, good faith bargaining was introduced by the Labor government, by Mr Brereton, in 1993 in legislation that was passed in 1994. Of course, enterprise bargaining predates that in a form, but I think the final or polished version of enterprise bargaining struck its pinnacle around the 1993-94 period. It was not until 1996 that this government, with its so-called reform agenda, started to pull that apart.
The idea of enterprise bargaining is for the parties to genuinely bargain and, in good faith, reach an agreement. The bill tries to prevent what this government calls `pattern bargaining' and introduces cooling-off periods. This is the government's third attempt to introduce this type of legislation. They tried in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 and again in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 2000, which was a response to the AMWU's Campaign 2000. I think I said at the time that it was a flawed approach, and it continues to be a flawed approach.
The government modified its approach but this bill attempts, at least on the face of it, to be less prescriptive and requires the commission to suspend or terminate a bargaining period if certain conditions occur. This bill does not assist the enterprise bargaining framework, as I have articulated. In fact, the concern is that the continual meddling by this government with the industrial relations framework that was set might encourage those people who abandoned enterprise bargaining to see it in a very negative light, to then say that enterprise bargaining is not a positive and does not produce positive outcomes. Enterprise bargaining in truth is facilitative in the nature. As a framework, I suspect it tries to be unintrusive in the workplace to allow parties the latitude and freedom to enter into agreements. What this government should be doing is reformulating the concept of good faith bargaining to ensure that both sides, employees and employers, can deal with bargaining and include good faith bargaining in a positive framework.
As I said, this was a matter that was introduced in 1993. While this term is no longer in the act, except by way of amendment today—although I do not think the government went as far as perhaps I want it to go—the government has recognised, in part at least, that the term should not be removed entirely from the industrial relations framework. The concept continues to exist, and that is clear from recent decisions of the commission, such as the decision in relation to Joy Manufacturing Company. It also exists in other frameworks: in Queensland, New Zealand and New South Wales. One wonders why this government continues to rail against it. This government, by its continual assault and not having anything positive to say, runs the risk of ruining enterprise bargaining for those people that do benefit, in terms of productivity and wages. There is a duality concerned with enterprise bargaining. It is about promoting productivity improvements and wages outcomes. It is about having a win-win for those in the workplace. Perhaps the government might be able to clarify that in its summation of the second reading debate.
It would be better, in my view, to introduce good faith bargaining rather than pursue these `genuine bargaining' provisions and these provisions dealing with secret ballots. It would be better to look at formulating and complying with bargaining processes. It would be better for the government to introduce legislation—bills or regulations—or a framework, as I have been saying, which talks about how good faith bargaining should be proceeded with for people to be able to attend meetings at reasonable times and places and to consider and respond to proposals by the parties. None of these framework issues are within this legislation, and they are certainly not in the amendments that are being promoted by the government. Clearly, it is commonsense to allow facilitative provisions such as those to be put in. The government is bereft of new ideas, because it keeps coming back with the same matter and keeps pushing the same agenda rather than trying to sit down in a consultative way to look at what the industrial relations framework and enterprise bargaining really require. 
What the government have failed to do is look forward into the system and say, `This is what the system needs to ensure that it will continue to be effective.' The government, in this instance, have failed to understand workplace relations and instead they concentrate on strike action, on the negative aspects, and say, `We need to stamp out these negative aspects.' But, by and large, they are also positive outcomes. They allow pressure to be released from the system. That is the nature of industrial relations. I think the government understand that; they are just ideologically driven on some of these matters.
That is not the main issue, in any event. Rather, the focus has been on looking at activities or outcomes and trying to work a way through that. The government really has missed the point. For example, the commission can deal adequately with industrial relations and it has, over the ensuing period, clearly been able to do that. It has, through Justice Munro, been able to articulate a range of outcomes for the parties to meet, to come to concluded agreements and to have successful enterprise bargaining. If the government were serious, it would be best for it to stop meddling, to look seriously at the program, to ask, `What does the program require?' and to talk to the parties. But the government does not seem to appreciate this; it does not really want to talk to the parties in industrial relations. It decides what it thinks is good and progresses it.
It seems to me that there is a whole range of issues that it can successfully deal with. Mr McClelland recently released a press release about foreign backpackers being paid below minimum wages; it could attempt to deal with that issue. It could attempt to deal with the issue of paid maternity leave, which was the subject of a Senate inquiry report dealing with how that matter might be progressed. The government might also deal with the issues of corporate governance, of whistleblower protection for employees to ensure that corporate misdeeds are exposed and of trusts where employees are involved. The government could also deal with an improved framework for good faith bargaining in industrial relations.
Good faith bargaining means that the parties can be compelled to sit down and discuss the issues. It does not go as far as saying, though—and I think this is one of the issues that sometimes the government really confuses—that the parties can be compelled to agree to things against their wishes, nor does it mean that the parties can assist with what is being sought—that is, what the matters are. If the commission did have the power— the subject of an amendment moved by Labor, and it appears that the Democrats' thinking is in a similar vein—that would allow the parties to structure the process, come to the table and deal with enterprise bargaining in a reasoned and structured sense. This would bring focus. If it had the power, the commission would be able to take the parties, sit them down and work it through— not tell them what the outcomes should be; that is not the commission's role during the enterprise bargaining process. It is designed to prevent unnecessary industrial action. It is designed to allow a safety valve. I recall that, in bargaining for outcomes, many times one of the difficulties was to get the employer to sit constructively at the table. The employer's short answer on many occasions was simply: `There's nothing for me to bargain for. I don't need to bargain. I don't want to sit at the table. I don't see anything constructive in it.' It was a very negative response. Sometimes, if you can get them to water, they will drink. They will find it valuable and they will usually entertain the process. There are certainly better outcomes that can be obtained through a process that deals with good faith bargaining. 
Labor's proposed amendments, which will be dealt with during the committee stage, provide a basis for the parties to negotiate and to bargain in good faith. They make sure that the parties can abide by that duty and they ensure that the commission has the express power to make necessary orders to ensure that bargaining in good faith occurs. I think that they are good fundamental principles that enterprise bargaining should have. It is, as I have said, a matter that is a feature of most systems that use collective bargaining. It is provided for in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and in various states in Australia. It provides a formal, structured way—in a less informal setting sometimes—for parties to deal with the elements of bargaining. In other words, you have to come into a room; you have to have air, light, water and at least a conducive environment in which to sit down to ensure that the parties conduct their negotiations in a reasonable and thoughtful way.
However, as I have said, it should be made plain that good faith bargaining does not mean that the parties can be compelled to agree to things against their wishes. I suspect that is the bogyman that the government might put up. I certainly hope that they will not hide behind that. It is a process designed to ensure efficiency in the system. It is a process designed to allow the parties to negotiate and at least try to prevent the other party from frustrating matters, attempting to cause delays or using tactics intended to ensure that good faith bargaining does not occur. It is also a power that I think the commission would use fairly and openly. Labor's amendments are designed to help the parties in a non-partisan manner, unlike the government's bills, which really are only one side of the equation. They are targeted to the detriment of employees and unions, whereas, clearly, the opposition's position is equally targeted at all parties in industrial relations and provides a constructive and fair process.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I rise to speak in opposition to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. Like many of the other workplace relations bills the government has brought before the Senate this year, this bill has already been rejected on several occasions. Like the others, this bill will fail to achieve any sort of necessary or productive reform. Like the so-called fair dismissals and non-compulsory union fees bills we have already looked at this year, this bill springs from the government's own ideological bent. Its aim is to undermine the bargaining position and strength of workers and the unions that represent them. Where the government has in the past used words like `fairness', `freedom of association' and `job creation' to try to cover and hide this agenda, this bill cloaks its real aims in the rhetoric of `workplace democracy'.
At the outset, it appears that the government is pursuing its stated aim in legislating to require workers to have a democratic ballot to decide whether or not they want to go on strike. But the reality is that the provisions of this bill are by and large unnecessary. The sole aim of this bill—its hidden aim—is to make it almost impossible for workers to take protected action. My concern about this step, about the frustrating role this bill seeks to play, is that it will result in two ultimate outcomes. Contrary to Australia's international obligations, it will seriously inhibit the rights of workers to take protected industrial action during a bargaining period. Consequently, what you will have is more and more workers resorting to wildcat strike action. This will ultimately undermine the high levels of industrial peace that Australia has achieved in recent years.
In the same way the government falsely claimed that the scrapping of unfair dismissal laws would create 50,000 jobs, it has engaged in a great deal of deception when selling this bill. In his second reading speech to the current bill, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said: 
A secret ballot ... will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is not abused by union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned.
In saying this, the minister is once again pushing this tired old rhetoric about the unions across this country, many of which represent the least skilled and vulnerable. He is pushing an image of unions and their elected representatives as chewing at the bit to go on strike, doing anything they can to disrupt industrial peace in this country and, in doing so, acting contrary to the will of the workers they represent.
But nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, this sort of rhetoric really goes to show how chronically out of touch the minister is with what is really going on in workplaces across Australia. Most unions have provisions in their own rules that require some sort of vote from their members to take place prior to the union leading the workers out on a strike. Some unions even conduct their own pre-strike secret ballots. If the minister actually got out there and had a look at what goes on in the factories, mines, yards and shop floors where many Australians go to work, he would see that in most cases it is the workers who direct their unions to lead them into industrial action.
As the years go by, levels of this sort of industrial action have been declining quite markedly. There have been unprecedented levels of industrial peace. In 2001 there were just 50 working days lost per 1,000 employees—a historic low. But even if there is a case where a worker feels as though they have been goaded into strike action against their will, they currently have recourse under the Workplace Relations Act to request a pre-strike secret ballot. They can go and see the Industrial Relations Commission, put their case and the commission may then order a pre-strike secret ballot. In addition to this, the commission itself has rights under the Workplace Relations Act to order a pre-strike ballot on its own initiative. By and large, the provisions of this bill are unneeded and unnecessary.
Pre-strike ballots are also unwanted by the workers this bill is supposed to protect. The fact is that there is no real need or desire on the part of workers for pre-strike secret ballots. The government would have this Senate believe that in workplaces across Australia hundreds of thousands of workers, under the weight of oppression from their union representatives, were being forced to go on strike. Despite the fact that the commission has the power to order pre-strike ballots, it has made only 12 such orders since 1996, either following a request to do so or on its own initiative. In the year 2000-01 it made only one order. There is no real demand coming from the workers for the sorts of pre-strike ballots that this bill will make compulsory.
So what is the real agenda? If the government were aware of the facts I have just outlined, as I am sure they are, then why would they put forward a bill like this? This bill is nothing short of an elaborate scheme to further frustrate the abilities of workers to take protected action when bargaining for better pay and conditions. In the labour market a worker's ability to withdraw his or her labour is the primary means of exerting economic pressure on employers during a bargaining process. Especially in lower paid and lower skilled jobs, industrial action is one of the few means workers have at their disposal to demand better pay and conditions, and the government do not like that at all. People like the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations hate the fact that workers organise themselves into unions and then use their collective muscle to get decent pay and conditions for their members, and they want to do anything they can to undermine that ability.
That is all this bill is about. It is a scheme designed to make it nearly impossible for workers to go on strike and thus succeed in getting better pay and conditions for themselves. And it does this in a number of ways. By requiring a compulsory ballot to take place prior to any application for protected industrial action the bill will dramatically drag out the time it takes to get an action up and running. Some estimates hold that this could take up to six weeks. In addition, the complexity of the requirements for a valid application could make it relatively easy for unscrupulous employers to delay the process. They could argue a number of issues before the commission, such as procedural concerns or allegations that the union is engaging in pattern bargaining, which would then require a referral to a President Member. These time restraints can render any potential action ineffective, as industrial action, to be effective, usually requires some degree of spontaneity. 
The bill's provisions also require any application for a secret ballot to contain precise details of the intended action, including the day or days on which it is to take place and its duration. This, combined with the fact that it is the applicants who must bear the overwhelming costs of running the ballot, will lock employees into a certain form of industrial action at a specified time. This could greatly extend the average time involved before reaching agreement. It also inhibits the flexible nature of bargaining, locking in workers to a scheduled timetable of industrial action.
The bill also requires that 40 per cent of affected workers must vote in a secret ballot to make up a quorum. Many workers do not want to become actively involved in workplace issues. They would rather leave those decisions to someone else—they would rather go along. A voluntary vote will result in a low turnout of voters. This will make it even harder to get strike action approved. Finally, in lower paid and low-skilled industries it may be even harder to succeed in having strike action approved due to higher levels of illiteracy and poor English speaking skills amongst workers.
All in all, the provisions of this bill make it incredibly time consuming, costly and difficult to have protected action approved. They do not act to encourage workplace democracy; rather, they merely deter workers from taking protected industrial action. The government would not want any system of protected action to work, because they do not believe in protected action at all. They do not believe in workers being allowed to take industrial action to better their pay and conditions. This bill will make taking protected action so difficult that it will simply be out of reach for most workers.
Inhibiting the right to strike is a serious breach of international labour law. It has also been argued that the provisions of this bill would put Australia further in breach of ILO convention No. 87. It would breach ILO principles that hold that legal procedures for declaring a strike, such as secret ballots, should be reasonable; should not place substantial limitations on the means of action open to trade unions; should not be so complicated as to make it practically impossible to declare a legal strike; and do not violate the principle of freedom of association so long as they promote democratic principles within trade union organisations.
As I mentioned earlier, in most cases a worker's ability to withdraw his or her labour is the primary means of exerting economic pressure on employers during a bargaining process. Industrial action, and even the threat of industrial action, is in many cases a means of ensuring that workers get decent pay and conditions. In my firm view, it should be taken as a last resort, but the possibility of it occurring ensures, especially in those industries employing low-paid and low-skilled workers, that workers bargain on an equal footing with their employer. It is incredibly naive, however, to think that because protected action is so difficult workers will simply not strike. They will simply take unprotected action. By removing the ability of workers and their representatives to partake in lawful industrial action, the government will be bringing on more wildcat strikes.
In the opinion of Professor Ron McCallum, a widely respected labour law expert and academic—who, I might add, was recently appointed to the position of Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Sydney—such wildcat action would inevitably take place, possibly against the advice of union representatives. Professor McCallum, in giving evidence to the Senate committee which reviewed this legislation, said:
Such a bureaucratic system will drop industrial action down from union executives and union secretaries to wildcat action. I think we will see an increase in short-term wildcat action.
This has definitely been the experience in Western Australia, where the former Court Liberal government introduced similar pre-strike secret ballot requirements. Since the introduction of these laws, not one application has been made for protected industrial action. I repeat: not one. But this does not mean that there has been uninterrupted industrial peace in Western Australia. Of course, there has been industrial action over there. And because of the excessive and in most cases unworkable bureaucratic requirements workers are choosing to take unprotected action. 
I say in conclusion that this is the sort of industrial anarchy to which this government wants Australia to return. It wants to undermine workers' right to strike and take away their primary means of lifting themselves to an equal bargaining position with their employer. This government hates the idea that workers can be put on an equal footing with employers when they work together for better outcomes. Every piece of industrial legislation that we have seen before us in this chamber this year has been aimed at undermining their ability to do so. This bill is no different and it should be rejected accordingly.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-09-25,"—It is important to realise that both the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 will protect and create jobs, because they are important for the future of enterprise bargaining, which is the cornerstone of improvements in workplace relations and the resulting productivity increases. The Workplace Relations Act does need further reform to remove the possibility of misuse of reforms already implemented, particularly in relation to protected industrial action. The genuine bargaining bill will ensure that protected industrial action is only available to a party which is genuinely trying to reach agreement with the other party or parties. It will also help prevent evasion of Australian Industrial Relations Commission orders to suspend or terminate a bargaining period. As well, it will make clear the provision for cooling-off periods.
A number of ALP senators have suggested that the genuine bargaining bill prevents the making of common claims against a range of employers. The genuine bargaining bill does not prevent the making of common claims against a range of employers, so I set that out from the start. But if the party making common claims wants to take protected action, it is an appropriate price for that privilege to require that party to be genuinely trying to reach agreement with each employer rather than holding out for agreement by all the employers in the same terms.
Senators on the other side have also suggested that the bill would prevent multiemployer agreements. Multiemployer agreements will still be able to be certified under the genuine bargaining bill. On the other hand, protected industrial action is not available under the current legislation to support claims for multiemployer agreements. The genuine bargaining bill does not contain any new limitations with regard to multiemployer agreements.
Senators on the other side have also suggested that the commission already has sufficient power to deal with parties not genuinely trying to reach agreement. The decision of Justice Munro in the Campaign 2000 case is a good precedent, but without this bill it is not sufficiently certain and clear to employers and employees what the commission will consider when determining whether to suspend or terminate a bargaining period because a party was not genuinely trying to reach agreement. Some senators simply want to insert a note referring to Justice Munro's decision, but that is not enough. If senators support the decision, they should recognise the value of confirming that it is the correct approach to the commission's exercise of its discretion in this area.
The secret ballots bill provides that industrial action taken by employees will not be protected unless it is approved by a secret ballot. It has been suggested that the procedures for secret ballots are excessively detailed and bureaucratic. In fact, the procedures are lengthy because they provide comprehensive guidance to the commission on its new responsibility of overseeing ballots, not because they dictate all the specific steps that parties wanting to conduct ballots will have to follow. The ballot process need involve only the following steps: step one, notify a bargaining period; step two, decide to propose protected action and decide on the nature of the proposed action and the ballot question; step three, apply to the commission for a ballot order and notify other parties; step four, the commission makes a ballot order; and step five, the ballot is conducted. These steps can be completed so that protected action can commence as soon as a nominal expiry date has passed. 
A number of Labor senators have also claimed that there are inconsistencies in requiring a ballot for employees to commence industrial action but not for an employer to commence a lockout or for employees to cease industrial action. The focus in the bill is on the decision to commence protected action because protected action is a legislative and practical privilege, whereas the act of calling off industrial action does not need or attract any legislative privilege. Again, any employee will be free to stop participating in authorised action at any time. There is no sensible basis for employer ballots, because each employer is a single legal entity. Employers are not democracies. Asking shareholders to vote on a lockout would take decisions on agreement making away from the workplace level and out of the hands of the people directly responsible for agreement negotiation.
Senators also suggested that the bill is not needed because the existing provisions in the act for secret ballots have rarely been used. The existing provisions in the act were not designed to ensure that all relevant employees can participate in a secret ballot as a matter of course, as a precondition to protected industrial action. The commission has generally only used ballots under these provisions to test the views of employees who are already on strike rather than to ensure democratic processes in relation to the original decision to authorise industrial action.
Senator Murray has put forward a proposal for secret ballots to be held in certain circumstances where a member has requested it or where the commission has ordered that a ballot take place. The government welcomes this indication that the Democrats share the government's recognition of the importance of democracy in decision making about industrial action. The government favours the approach in the bill which would enshrine in the act a right for union members to have a say in authorising industrial action.
The ALP have put forward an amendment to the second reading motion for the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. The first limb of this motion refers to unreasonably emasculating the powers of the AIRC to resolve industrial disputes in the interests of the parties. The bill emphasises the commission's role under the existing provisions and gives the commission new powers to make its orders for suspension or termination of a bargaining period effective. 
The second limb of the motion refers to interfering with the AIRC's discretion to deal with industrial disputes in the most appropriate way. As noted by Senator Murray, the government's previous legislation has guided the AIRC's discretion in a very appropriate way, which has been responsible for the productivity growth and reduction in industrial disputation achieved under the government's legislation. 
The third limb refers to failing to put forward constructive proposals to enable the commission to direct parties to bargain in good faith. The government does not support the commission making orders about how the parties should bargain. The act already provides important protections against illegitimate bargaining actions such as coercion or the dismissal of employees. The government trusts in the capacity of the parties to reach agreement, if and when they want to, with protected action available as a persuasive tool for any party so long as it is genuinely trying to reach agreement with the other party or parties. The ALP's amendment to the motion should be rejected and the bill should be supported. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Sherry's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I have just indicated to the chamber that the Australia Democrats' amendments to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 are being circulated. I am not criticising that; we received a copy about an hour ago, Senator Murray. I want to make some comment about the amendments. I will do that now. When we resume the committee stage this afternoon, I am sure we can deal with the amendments in a considered and timely way. In terms of the committee debate we are having, I want to continue with some remarks I was making previously which are relevant to the bill that we are considering.
Concerning the proposed amendments, I was making some comments about clause 170NBCK and the difficulty the commission will have in dealing with this. In that process, the commission would have to compile a roll of eligible voters. The commission is given the power to require the employer and the union to provide a list of names and any other information it is reasonable to require to assist with the compilation of the roll. Employers will no doubt thank the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for this aspect of the bill: they will have to put aside their GST paperwork to complete secret ballot paperwork. I do not think employers will be particularly keen on that approach.
An employee is only an eligible voter if they were employed on the day the ballot order was made and their employment would be subject to the agreement. If the applicant for the ballot is a union, then the employee must also have been a member of that union on the day the ballot order was made. But an employee is not an eligible voter if they are subject to an AWA on the day that the order was made. Once the roll has been drawn up, there is then an opportunity for employees to apply to have their names either added to or removed from the roll.
Clause 170NBDA of the bill heralds the arrival—not before time—of ballot day. Ultimately, when the ballot is cast after this extraordinarily bureaucratic process, employees can vote. For employees who have spent many days compiling the paperwork, appearing in the commission and finalising the electoral roll, their minds have presumably long since turned from reaching an agreement with the employer and their one goal is to cast their votes so that they can go on strike.
But, first, the ballot paper must be prepared and copied and it must be in a prescribed form. Senator Alston made a contribution in the previous debate about prescription. He criticised prescription. I have rarely seen prescription of the type that we are considering in the legislation we are dealing with in committee. Clause 170NBDA states:
The ballot paper must be in the prescribed form and must include the following:
(a)	the name of the applicant or the applicant's agent (as the case requires);
(b)	the types of employees who are to be balloted;
(c)	the name of the ballot agent authorised to conduct the ballot;
(d)	the question or questions to be put to the relevant employees in the ballot, including the nature of the proposed industrial action; and
(e)	a statement that the voter's vote is secret and that the voter is free to choose whether or not to support the proposed industrial action; and
(f)	instructions to the voter on how to complete the ballot paper.
Once the ballot has been held, the votes counted and any disputes about hanging chads are put to rest—I think people are pretty much aware of what a hanging chad is now, although I noticed they could not get it right in Florida for the second time.
—It's not a medical term, is it?
—It is not on the PBS, Senator Murray—the hanging chad! Whilst the paperwork is finalised, including the ballot agent's report and the publication of the ballot results by the industrial registrar, the employees turn their eyes to clause 170NBDD to see if they can take industrial action. One by one, they tick off the requirements: the action was the subject of a protected action ballot; the prescribed percentage of persons on the roll are voters for the ballot voted in the ballot—40 per cent by default; more than 50 per cent of the votes validly cast were votes approving the action; and the action commences within 30 days of the declaration of the results of the ballot.
The Workplace Relations Act already contains provisions which enable the Industrial Relations Commission to order a secret ballot on industrial action or on any other issue in an industrial dispute. In fact, in a ministerial discussion paper entitled `Pre-industrial action secret ballots', published in 1998, it was found the commission had used its existing powers strategically to progress dispute resolution, particularly when the parties had reached a stand-off.

"Senator MASON,",LP,2002-09-25,"—Just over a week ago the world remembered the 26th anniversary of the death of Mao Tse Tung, the man who founded, and for 27 years stood at the helm of, the People's Republic of China—
—How long was Franco in power?
—presiding in that time over the worst genocide in human history. This anniversary, I believe, provides a valuable opportunity for all of us, including Senator Forshaw, to recall and reflect upon the failure of our moral imagination in facing the greatest challenge of the last century— the challenge of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism was without doubt liberalism's greatest enemy, though as George Orwell reminds us, for much of the Left:
Such things as purges, secret police, summary executions, imprisonment without trial ... are too remote to be terrifying. They can swallow totalitarianism because they have no experience of anything other than liberalism.
This reflection is particularly relevant now as the Liberal Party is being constantly lectured by its opponents about human rights and morality in international politics.
When I reflect on the last 50 years, it saddens me to realise how weak and inadequate the reaction of our liberal democracy was to the genocide taking place in our own part of the world. It saddens me to realise that not indignation, not disgust, not a vocal outcry, but silence was the most common response to the tragedy that kept unfolding in China for decades. It saddens me to say that too few in my own party stood up to condemn tyranny and to speak in defence of its victims. But it saddens me even more to say that hardly anyone on the other side politics ever even raised their voice. If my own party's sins here were ones of omission, those of the Labor Party were of wilful blindness.
This wilful blindness was prevalent not of course because my colleagues on the other side of the chamber were communist sympathisers. It was prevalent not because my Labor colleagues championed and supported genocide overseas. No, I would never suggest that. I am sure that all my Labor Party colleagues would be utterly shocked and disgusted by the loss of life and the human tragedy and misery that invariably accompanied socialist experiments throughout the last century. No, my colleagues in the Labor Party did not support genocide in China. But they did nothing even when they knew or suspected it was happening. They turned a blind eye to the horrific reality because they did not want to believe it, because they chose not to believe, because it was too difficult— 
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. Under the provisions of standing order No. 193(3), I believe that Senator Mason is now making assertions of improper motives and reflections upon members of parliament.
—There is no point of order.
—They chose not to believe because it was too difficult and too inconvenient to believe the breadth and scale of the horror. What is even worse, many in the Labor Party—and more broadly speaking, on the Left—not only chose not to believe that genocide was going on in China but they also chose to ridicule and deride those who did. They might not have been communists—they were not—but they were anti anti-communists—and you would relate to this, Senator Bartlett. They thought the anti-communist case somewhat vulgar and unfashionable, not sophisticated enough; a bit too simplistic. They thought that to condemn communist tyrants overseas would give too much satisfaction to their political opponents in Australia. Their reflexive anti-Americanism—and we can see that happening at the moment—made them give the benefit of the doubt to all those who also hated the United States. Their alienation from their own Western society made them reluctant to find fault in anyone who might have been pursuing a different, socialist path to the future.
And now the silence of the Left continues. The Left has never come to terms with its moral failure last century. There was never any reflection, any acknowledgment, that by averting their eyes, they gave succour to murderers and failed to recognise the suffering of millions of victims. There are many estimates of the number of those who perished during Mao's reign. The most recent and most reliable estimate puts the number of dead at around 65 million people. Consolidation of power, the Great Leap Forward, collectivisation, the Cultural Revolution—all took their deadly toll. As we look at these figures it becomes apparent that Mao was the worst mass murderer of the 20th century and, indeed, of human history. In his genocidal mania he dwarfs Hitler and surpasses even Stalin. And of course in addition to those who died, there are countless millions of others who were persecuted, imprisoned or exiled. China's economy and social fabric were stretched and torn and are only now recovering from the ravages of Marxism. 
Let me repeat: between 1 October 1949, when Mao and his troops entered Beijing, and 9 September 1976, when Mao died peacefully in his bed, the lives of 65 million Chinese people were sacrificed in pursuit of this communist utopia. Only a few weeks ago this chamber rang with passionate and heartfelt words as senators from both sides of the chamber remembered the horrific attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001. That appalling crime claimed the lives of about 6,000 innocent people. We condemned the perpetrators, as they deserve to be condemned. But think of this: over 6,000 men, women and children were either starved or murdered every day of every week of every month of every year for 27 years under Mao's reign, and there was barely a whimper. 
Perhaps Stalin was right about one insight: the death of a thousand people is a tragedy; the death of a million is a statistic. There was no outcry from the Left, no condemnation of the appalling loss of life and not the slightest indication of moral disquiet. In fact, quite the contrary. When Mao died, Mr Whitlam, the then leader of the Labor opposition, stood up in this parliament and eulogised the man whom communist propaganda called `the Great Helmsman'. Mr Whitlam said that Mao's:  
... courage, his sagacity, his gifts as a writer and interpreter of Chinese philosophy and civilisation, and his extraordinary stature as national leader have ensured that his influence will outlast his death ... No one who visited his country could be in any doubt of the veneration in which he was held by his people.
Remember that Mr Whitlam was singing the praises of a man who was responsible for more deaths than Hitler or Stalin. Mr Whitlam went on to say:
It says much for the changing attitudes of Australian politicians as it does for the greatness of Mao himself that we are paying tribute in this place to a man and thus to a nation and a people who until a short time ago were the object of widespread hostility and suspicion in this country ... This progression from hostility to recognition, from recognition to respect, and from respect to admiration has been slow, belated and welcome. I am gratified that my colleagues and my Party have been in the forefront of this movement.
Indeed, Mr Whitlam, but I wonder: are you still proud of those comments? How can you face the shadow of Mao's 65 million victims and say that you admire him?
It is no wonder many in the Labor Party and the Left generally hate it when we remind them of their record on this issue. It is no wonder all we ever hear now are feeble excuses as the Left embarks on their own long march of denial. Some of them may say, `But we didn't know!' I say back to them, `Because you chose to become the three monkeys of totalitarianism.' The Left of the ALP chose to be wilfully blind to the horror and tragedy because they genuinely believed that communist tyrants like Mao were building a better future and demonstrating in practice the superiority of Karl Marx over Adam Smith. `No enemies on the Left,' was their slogan. Oh, how I remember it. The Right of the ALP and, unfortunately, even some in my own party, chose to ignore what was going on because it was too inconvenient to rock the boat. It seems there were always other, more important things to do. But the evidence was there for all to see. Books by Barnett, White, Vogel, Portisch, Hamm, Labin and others were published in the West throughout the 1950s and 1960s and they provided the public with the true picture of life in Red China.
Mao's China was supposed to have been the next utopia; but it was not. Mao succeeded in creating not a utopia but a nightmare—a truly totalitarian state, where society turned upon itself and devoured its young. As Jung Chang wrote in her best-selling memoirs Wild Swans:
The greatest horror of the Cultural Revolution— the crushing repression which had driven hundreds of thousands of people to mental breakdown, suicide and death—was carried out by the population collectively. Almost everyone, including young children, had participated in brutal denunciation meetings. Many had lent a hand in beating the victims.
The line between state executioner and public spectator became blurred. There will always be those on the Left who will try to exculpate themselves by playing the moral equivalency card. They will say, `Yes, we are guilty, but your side was just as bad. After all, you supported dictators like Pinochet, Franco and Marcos.' I will say, `Yes, some on the Right did, but they thought people like Pinochet to be the lesser evil. And my side of politics certainly did not romanticise them while they were alive and certainly did not beatify them after they were dead.'
The Cold War was a long struggle. Democracy, human rights, the rule of law and free markets are only now making their slow but sure progress around the world. With the socialist alternative now clearly proven to be a monumental failure, the Left has moved on to other causes: deconstructing Western civilisation and the Enlightenment and creating a culture of complaint, victimhood and entitlement. They are always moving onto the next crusade, seeking salvation somewhere else. The Left, to recall the words once used to describe Sir Samuel Hoare:
... passes from experience to experience, like Boccaccio's virgin, without discernible effect upon [their] condition.
It is important to remember the past and, as we remember, to draw some lessons. The Labor Party and, more broadly, the Left always saw, and still see, themselves as the champions of human rights. Yet where were they when the worst abuses of human rights in the history of mankind were taking place in China? The Left and the Labor Party always try to occupy and monopolise the moral high ground, accusing my side of politics of unprincipled opportunism. Yet where were they, and what did they do, while 65 million Chinese men, women and children were murdered or starved to death? What have they done since then to acknowledge their silence and inaction? 
These are the lessons that all of us in this parliament and in public life should always bear in mind. Let us hope that no challenge like that of Mao's China will arise to test our moral temper in the future. But let us also hope that, should it arise, we will at least know how to face it with courage, honesty and integrity. We must never again forget that it is our duty above all else to recognise the lives and deaths of those who are not always visible from afar, whose cause is not necessarily fashionable from where we stand and whose voices are often drowned out by excuses and rationalisation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>China: Mao Tse Tung</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-09-25,"— My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson. Can the minister confirm the report in the Courier-Mail last week that cabinet has decided to allow veterans with the gold card to take out private health insurance with no penalty for being over 30 years of age, thereby exempting veterans from the Lifetime Health Cover rules? Is this unannounced cabinet decision an admission that the gold card no longer guarantees free private health care and choice of doctor, and an acknowledgment that veterans may need to take out personal private health cover?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-09-25,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question arising from the minister's answer. Is the minister aware of the government's admission through questions on notice that at least 75 specialists have formally resigned from the gold card scheme, and that in the last three months veterans have been reimbursed for doctors' consultations on 477 occasions, in large part because their doctors have refused the gold card? What are the implications for the health care of veterans, and when will the Howard government advise veterans that they should be making alternative arrangements in line with the cabinet's unannounced decision? To assist the minister, I seek leave to table a circular from the Department of Health and Ageing addressing the issue I raised in the first part of my question. 
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-09-25,"—I thank the honourable Senator for his question. There were questions about the veterans gold card a couple of weeks ago in the chamber and I answered them by saying that the overwhelming majority of doctors are continuing to accept the repatriation gold card for veteran patients. The Labor Party have been undermining the gold card. I do not know whether they have a policy of withdrawing the gold card. I do not know what their policy is on private health insurance. Mr Smith will not make a categorical statement about whether the private health insurance rebate will remain. They refuse to make that statement.
We have brought in a range of measures to address the issue of lifetime cover. I would need to double-check what the honourable senator has said. I know that we have extended it to migrants who come to Australia. They have a 12-month period. I just cannot remember—there is an enormous amount in the portfolio to remember—the issues surrounding veterans and the veterans gold card. I will get back to him at the end of question time to confirm if that is the case. I just cannot remember. I know we extended it to migrants who arrive in Australia and are over 30. We thought it was inappropriate to penalise them because they did not have the opportunity beforehand, so they have a 12-month period from when they arrive to take out private health insurance.
Labor ran this scare campaign about the gold card and veterans. June Healy, the National President of the War Widows Guild of Australia, said she had written to Minister Danna Vale saying that Mark Bishop's media release on the extent of specialists refusing to treat veterans with gold cards `tends to inflame the situation'. There is what one of the stakeholders is saying—that what Labor are doing is inflaming the situation.
John Ryan, the National President of TPI Federation and a fearless advocate for veterans' rights, was reported in the West Australian as saying, `The problem was not serious.' Labor run around scaring people saying that the situation is worse than it really is. As I said, I cannot remember, and I defy anybody on the other side to remember, every aspect of the portfolio. I know that we extended it to migrants. I will check and get back to the honourable senator as soon as question time finishes.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-09-25,"—Here we go again: Labor are inflaming the situation, which is what the stakeholders say is happening. We are aware that some medical specialists are unhappy with the level of fees for services to the veteran community and Veterans' Affairs is currently discussing the matter with the AMA. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further. However, Labor should be supporting the veterans. They did not extend it and they did not give a rebate for private health insurance to anybody, including the million pensioners who now get the rebate and are able to afford private health insurance. They left private health insurance running at a level which was totally unsustainable. I said this in answer to an earlier question on the veterans gold card: if a veteran is unable to get a service and is having difficulty, the Department of Veterans' Affairs will locate a treating specialist and DVA will arrange an alternate specialist—somebody who will actually look after them at a rate that does not include a gap. DVA is aware that some specialists are not doing it. They will look after veterans and ensure that they get the service.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-09-25,"—I would like to add to a question which Senator Bishop asked me earlier. Senator Bishop, obviously the Labor Party beat up an issue. In the changes to the lifetime cover, people who have been issued with a gold card by the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be recognised as having hospital cover for the purposes of lifetime cover. This means that, should a person lose their gold card, they will be deemed to be aged 30 for the purposes of lifetime health cover for a period of one year. If they apply for private health insurance after this period, they will be treated according to their actual age. The imputation was that this was put in place to in fact augment the gold card. That is not the case. Apparently it is for a handful of veterans who, for personal reasons and for particular circumstances, are given a gold card and if they then lose that gold card because their circumstances change—and I have been advised it is less than a handful a year—they will then be subjected to the lifetime cover penalty.
—It only changes when they die.
—Senator Bishop screams out, `It only changes when they die.' I am indicating there is a handful of people who, in particular circumstances, are given a gold card and then their circumstances change—and apparently it is a handful. Here is a government who cares about individuals. We want to make sure that they are not then penalised by having to take out private health insurance at a higher level. But I am advised by the office of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that it is a handful a year.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Evans today relating to the Government's decision not to renew the employment contract of the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Dr Allan Hawke.
The Minister in his response clearly did not wish to engage in too much debate on this issue and seemed to be suggesting that it was all the work of the Prime Minister. I thought that was an interesting observation. I raise this matter today because it reinforces concern in the community regarding this government's politicisation of the Department of Defence and the instability that they have brought about to the leadership of the defence department and the military in this country. With respect to the treatment of Dr Hawke, we have seen that, in February this year, he had offered his resignation from his position as Secretary of the Department of Defence to the minister, Senator Hill. When asked what the minister's response was he indicated that he was not sure. The minister had not accepted his resignation, but equally the minister had not endorsed his leadership. Since that time we have effectively had a Secretary of the Department of Defence swinging in the breeze, with the minister refusing to endorse him in his role as the Secretary of the Department of Defence. 
The end result of this is that Dr Hawke's contract was not renewed and so we will be having the fourth Secretary of the Department of Defence appointed since 1997. There is serious concern about the instability and changes in leadership in the Department of Defence, particularly, as the Deputy Prime Minister indicated yesterday, at a time of very high operational activity. Our Defence Forces are as committed now as at any time since the Vietnam War. We are dealing with not only the increased threat of terrorism but also a range of other issues confronting the Department of Defence, including the much heralded Howard government reform program which has lurched from one crisis to another, the strategic review, and of course the problems with defence procurement.
Under the Howard government we have the administration of the Department of Defence in this country characterised by political interference, the changing of directions and the removal of senior leadership at very critical times. The history of the Howard government's management of the Department of Defence sees them with a record of four ministers. In six years we have had four Ministers of Defence, three whom have gone on to retire from politics. I do not know whether there is a message there for Senator Hill but clearly it has become a bit of a retirement lounge. There have been four ministers in a very short time. We now see the appointment of Ric Smith, the fourth Secretary of the Department of Defence since 1997, so in a very short period of time we have had four secretaries.
I gathered information today that shows that, of the 15 top jobs in the Department of Defence, including the Minister for Defence, the Chief of Defence Force and the senior non-military positions, only three of the occupants have been in those positions for more than the year or since at least September last year. Of the 15 top jobs in the Department of Defence, only three have been occupied by a person who has held that job continuously for more than a year. It is a sign of the turmoil in the Howard government's administration of the Department of Defence and it is a sign of the instability that is beginning to impact on the effectiveness of the department and the role they play in supporting Australia's fighting forces. 
It is a very serious concern. It is leading to instability and a lack of continuity and it results in a lack of follow-through in what is allegedly the Howard government's reform agenda. It sees a constant shuffling of people through very important jobs that does not allow for follow-through, does not allow for delivery and results in the terrible circumstances that we have seen with outcomes in our procurement program. It has got to the stage now where people in the Department of Defence do not bother having their names put on the door because they are not going to be there long enough to make it worth while. The minister may well fit into that category. Certainly, there have been four ministers and four secretaries in a very short period of time and increasing concern among defence personnel about the politicisation of the Department of Defence, which of course was brought to head with the quite despicable activities regarding the `children overboard' affair. We have seen the politicisation of the Department of Defence by the Howard government— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Dr Allan Hawke</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2002-09-25,"—It is very hard to see the point of this motion to take note. Certainly, the arguments were not set out by Senator Evans. We face some of the biggest challenges in defence in our postwar history and certainly since the Vietnam War. I might say that in my role as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee I found Dr Hawke to be a very competent and capable public servant. But he has been in the job for three years, and over those three years he continued to face probably one of the biggest jobs in Australia. Defence is one the biggest land-holders in the nation and it is one of the biggest purchasers in the nation. It is one of biggest businesses in the country. I think that Dr Hawke did the job well. But three years is a long time and contracts are contracts, and he chose, for the reasons that the minister has explained, not to continue. 
Defence needs all the support that it can get because it faces enormous challenges. It faces the challenges of the white paper, the capability plan and the annual review by the CDF. It is also challenged by a very substantial procurement program. In its commitment in its operational capacity at this time we have the considerable challenges of the war against terror. We have vessels in the Persian Gulf in the food for oil program, we have a company of the SAS in Afghanistan and we have aircraft in Kyrgyzstan. That is all in addition to the commitment that we have in what might still be regarded as our arc of instability in the Pacific and East Timor. At this time we still have 1,200 troops in East Timor doing the very important job that the UN has set us in that particular and ongoing responsibility. We also have peacekeeping operations around the world with a number of troops involved—small in number perhaps but still important—and we still have our commitment in Bougainville.
The Department of Defence is an enormous organisation. It takes a considerable amount of energy and expertise. We have good people involved and we need to have the very best advice that government can get. I commend Dr Hawke on the role that he played, but it is now time to move on.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Dr Allan Hawke</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I just want to pick up from where Senator Sandy Macdonald finished, because he made some very valid points that need to be emphasised again. There is huge pressure on the Defence department given the commitments of our troops overseas and the unstable international situation. At the same time, Defence is going through a refurbishment program that is huge and there are other responsibilities in reorganising the department. As he says, Dr Allan Hawke, the now sacked chief of the Defence department, has done a fantastic job. He has done a terrific job and that is acknowledged on both sides of this parliament. What he has not explained, with the greatest respect to Senator Sandy Macdonald, is the attitude of the government here: `Thank you, Dr Hawke, you're sacked. You have done a terrific job, but you're out. Your contract comes up after three years; you're gone.' 
You do not have to take a partisan view about this. Let us do a survey of today's headlines in reporting this. The Herald Sun reports, `Defence reformer shown the door'. The Australian Financial Review reports in the headline of their article, `Defence head loses his post'. The Canberra Times says, `Defence chief axed', and in a feature by their Public Service reporter, Verona Burgess, there is the headline `Rumours had foreshadowed knife'. Of course the Pryor cartoon does encapsulate it all. It has a drawing of Senator Hill throwing the secretary of the department, Allan Hawke, overboard—Defence chief overboard. There is that `overboard' again that keeps haunting the government. The Sydney Morning Herald says, `Hawke axed after defence blow-out'. The Daily Telegraph says, `Plain speaking defence chief loses his job' and the Australian has, `Defence gets fourth boss in five years'—all of which points to the instability and to the surprise and shock. All of which shows the damage to the morale of the Defence forces, the instability at the top continues and that a minister, who appears to be very difficult to get on with, has exercised a private whim on this occasion in order to get rid of someone who is a plain speaker, forthright and truthful, and accountable when it comes to dealing with his responsibilities. 
What we can take from all of the newspaper reports—this is not the opposition; this is the media in Australia—are the following points: Dr Hawke is a highly regarded bureaucrat. He is regarded as a plain speaker with an excellent record of public service reform. His sacking was brutal. The Canberra Times says: 
It was a pathetically short term to appoint anyone to such a senior job, and the brevity contrasts with the five comfortable years given to the Government's favourite secretaries.
It was a brutal performance in sacking Dr Hawke. The press also agrees that Senator Hill, in terms of the press's perception, was unhappy in having as his head someone who was so forthright and so accountable. Let me again quote from the Canberra Times which says:
Senator Hill had been obviously furious at the Senate Estimates early this year after it was revealed senior military officers had tried to tell the Government before the election that the photos being touted as showing refugees throwing children overboard did no such thing.
Dr Hawke had offered his resignation as head of the department. What we also see in all of the reports today is that Dr Hawke had a strong sense of duty and responsibility and, under the best traditions of the Westminster system, offered his head—to resign—although he directly was not responsible for the circumstances of the children overboard affair.
Now in short order, when Defence is under more pressure than at any time since the Vietnam War, we have had four ministers and four secretaries. We have discontinuity. We have instability. We have short-term decision making and a lack of consistency in top leadership, all of which is damaging to Defence morale. Why? Because this government has set out deliberately to politicise the Public Service, and this is an example of it. The three-year term for Dr Hawke is an example that, if you are not a loyal Liberal and a Public Service chief, out the door you go.
Secondly, the Defence portfolio has been a parking lot for failed ministers—John Moore, failed minister; Peter Reith, failed minister; Robert Hill, failed environment minister and applicant for the Nairobi post for the UN Environment Commission. Now he is being recycled as Minister for Defence at a time when Australia needs a more responsible, more capable, more visionary, more able minister than this pathetic example of a Minister for Defence.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2002-09-25,"—I find it rather sad that there is no bipartisanship on this particularly important issue of defence. Generally speaking, those decent people on the Labor side have agreed—quietly perhaps but have agreed— that this is the one issue in the federal parliament on which we should have bipartisan agreement that we do not criticise Defence to the degree that the previous speakers on the other side have done. I do not think that this does any credit for the Labor Party. The Labor Party seem to want to instil in the people of Australia some insecurity, whereas the coalition parties have gone out of their way to demonstrate clearly and manifestly that they care about defence. Under the coalition, in terms of a percentage of GDP, spending has not fallen like it did under the Labor Party. You will recall under Mr Hawke—not the Hawke in question, but the former Prime Minister—and Mr Keating defence occupied a secondary role in their tenure in this place. 
This government, through its very effective ministers that Senator Cook, unfortunately, denigrated a moment ago, has done an excellent job. For instance, it produced, with the Defence 2000 white paper, the biggest spending in the history of this nation. It is a shame that the ALP do not recognise that a job is well done. I am not going to criticise former Labor governments on the spending on submarines and other issues that I think were a mistake and which I hope are never, ever emulated again. Such spending on defence equipment like that should only ever happen once, and it is a pity that it happened at all. But let me get back to the thrust of the take note debate. Dr Hawke, as I understand it, was not sacked. In fact, Senator Cook admitted that. He said that his three-year contract was up and he chose to do something else. The government recognised the contribution that Dr Hawke has made. In fact, after a short time off, Dr Hawke is going to resume his public service in a key diplomatic role overseas. So he was not sacked. Yet you find such terms as, `Hawke axed', `knifed' and `brutal performance'.
—I think they mean Bob Hawke! 
—I think there were certainly some brutal performances by the former Prime Minister and perhaps that is where some confusion lay. But, as the Labor Party has already publicly acknowledged, Dr Hawke's replacement with Mr Ric Smith is a step in the right direction. Mr Smith is a fine man. I have met him on many occasions. He comes from a very senior diplomatic position—one of the most important that we hold in the world—in Jakarta. Mr Ric Smith understands and speaks Bahasa, the language there. I am simply saying that when a man knows that his time is up, no matter how important he may seem to be to this nation, no-one is irreplaceable. We have Mr Ric Smith coming in, and there is not going to be a blip on the horizon. You will not see a blip on the diplomatic or secretarial horizon with respect to the changeover.
That is the way that this government operates. Look at what the government has done in East Timor. Look at the government's white paper. Remember the old maxim: those deserve peace who are prepared to defend it. This is no way to defend peace in Australia or to let Australia contribute to those important roles that it plays overseas. Australia is a country with 20 million people, far outweighed by the contribution that it makes to world peace. No doubt we will continue to contribute in Afghanistan. No doubt we will contribute in Iraq when, and if, that case arises. And no doubt we will continue to hold a high profile throughout the world, no matter that we are only a small country in terms of our population. On the issue of defence, it is a good lesson here this afternoon that this should be a bipartisan issue. What the government has done with respect to defence in the years that it has been here and in this third election period is little short of outstanding. Criticism from the other side rings hollow. We should face this together. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Dr Allan Hawke</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I do not know what Senator Lightfoot is on, but it obviously gives him a very positive and cheery view of the world. Maybe he should pass it around. Unfortunately for this debate, he is wrong. My understanding is that Dr Hawke was not happy to have been removed from the position and would have liked to have stayed on. That is something that the government has to contend with. 
A number of important issues arise out of the removal of Dr Hawke. It is an ill-timed and unfair decision. In terms of timing, this is a government that is, one way or another, preparing for war. What does it do? It removes the Secretary of Defence from a very important position—a position requiring continuity. The decision was appalling, dangerous and ill-timed. No matter how good Ric Smith may be, it takes months, if not years, for an incoming secretary to get on top of the portfolio. Ric Smith has to embark upon a very quick, steep learning curve. He has not run a department before. The challenges of the Defence department, at a time when war is being prepared for, are going to be virtually insurmountable.
It is not good policy to change the head of the Defence department when we are in the situation that we are in now. It is appalling management. Not only is this government preparing for a war situation, but the department is also in the middle of a reform agenda—one that was steaming along, if one was to believe the information from the government and the bureaucracy. Instability is being instilled by this decision, and it is a decision that is, in many ways, probably reckless to the national interest. What this government and this country needs at the moment is stability at the top during the preparation over the next few months for the tussle with Iraq. As we embark upon this mission, it is becoming more and more apparent that this government's planning is not adequate. It is inadequate and has been exposed as such in Australia. There needs to be planning. We can see from the US perspective that they have been spending months at it. What about here? The fact that there is no cohesive statement of this government's position is evidence that the planning has not been adequate. There are many signs of this government being all over the place. The public does not have confidence in the government's preparation for the Iraq challenge, and this decision will increase community fears as to how stable and prepared this government is. 
Internationally, the public is not prepared to go all the way with G.W. At home, there is no confidence in the meanderings of Foreign Minister Downer and there is concern at the fact that the Prime Minister has been absent from the public debate, particularly in parliament. They are all signs of the government being all over the shop, and this decision of removing the head of the department is one that will further undermine public confidence. Why make Dr Hawke a scapegoat? What for? It is being claimed by the government that finances are out of control, but no-one fixes a department like Defence, particularly in a short period of three years. There has been recognition of the good work that Allan Hawke has done and was continuing to do. His administration should have been given a real chance to fix some of those problems. If they were concerned about finances being out of control, they should have remembered that finances are not just the responsibility of one department. For a start, they are the responsibility of the ministers and cabinet. They are also the responsibility of departments like Finance and Treasury, which have a critical role in the preparation of budgets. I do not think that you can make Allan Hawke the scapegoat for this without you, Minister, and this government taking the blame for it.
Let us look at the record of instability— four secretaries in six years and four ministers in six years. That is not a recipe for stable administration. As Senator Evans said just a little earlier, only three out of 15 top administrators have been there for more than one year. The reality here is that this department has been used for political purposes by this government—the kids overboard affair and some of the problems they are facing in Senate estimates committees. It is also on the public record that this department, the Department of Defence, has been driven to distraction by the continual interference of this minister, a practice that he showed continually in his previous portfolio of Environment and Heritage. Basically, this minister has taken a dummy spit and sacked a secretary who should have stayed in the job in terms of both his competence and the national security requirements of this country at this particular sensitive time in our history.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-09-25,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The worldwide campaign by the United States of America to persuade states to enter into impunity agreements which seek to prevent US nationals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes from being surrendered to the International Criminal Court and the apparent willingness of the Australian Government to enter into such an agreement.
I move this urgency motion today to draw to the attention of the Senate and to the Australian people the apparent willingness of the Australian government to enter into an impunity agreement to prevent United States nationals—that is, citizens accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes—from being surrendered to the International Criminal Court, the ICC. We believe this is an outrageous proposal that undermines the very ideal of the ICC, which is to bring to an end impunity for those who commit these atrocities. It is a step backward in the struggle for global justice. The 20th century has seen some of the most horrific atrocities in human history. There is a growing recognition that the international community cannot ignore these crimes where they occur and that where the perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity can escape punishment humanity itself is diminished. 
The purpose of the International Criminal Court, over which we have had lengthy debate, is to ensure that future gross violations of international law, such as crimes against humanity and genocide, do not go unpunished. The ICC will provide a politically neutral forum in which such violations can be tried when normal legal avenues have been exhausted. History teaches us that individuals responsible for serious crimes against humanity are, sadly, rarely brought to justice. We have a unique opportunity to change that from this point forward.
After considerable internal turmoil within the government, it finally ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court earlier this year. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General had initially been strong advocates of ratification. However, the government faced some revolt over the issue. At the time, Mr Andrew Thompson, the then Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, said of the Rome statute:
Politely speaking, this thing is toxic waste and it ought to be dealt with as such ... This is a road to hell paved with good intentions.
After finally overcoming hostility to the ICC within its own ranks, the government now appears set to undermine the ICC at the request of the US government. The US has been promoting section 98 agreements, which would give US nationals who have committed genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity immunity from prosecution before the ICC. This absolutely undermines the ICC, the fundamental principle of which is that no-one should be immune from prosecution for these deplorable acts. The US has been threatening a number of countries with the withholding of military aid if they do not sign these agreements. Laws recently passed by the US Congress will actually allow the US military to invade the Netherlands to free any US service personnel brought before the International Criminal Court at The Hague.
The Australian government has expressed agreement in principle with the idea of making and entering into an article 98 agreement with the US. In response to a question without notice from me last month, the government confirmed that it had received a request from the US to conclude such an agreement. The Attorney-General recently said on the Sunday program:
What the United States has requested Australia to do is to enter into an agreement, of a sort, that it actually contemplated by article 98(2) of the statute. That's presently under consideration. In principle, the Australian government has no objection, but we are still working out the details with the United States to ensure that any agreement we make with them is consistent with our international obligations and consistent with our extradition policies and regime.
The statement that the government has no objection in principle to such an arrangement is extraordinary. The principle is completely wrong. It is about placing one country above international law and human rights standards. It undermines the rule of law and will threaten the credibility and effectiveness of the ICC. Furthermore, the idea that these article 98 agreements were somehow anticipated and approved by the Rome statute has been strongly rebutted. Amnesty International have released a considered paper on this issue, and it states:
... any claim that the US impunity agreements were consistent with Article 98 (2) of the Rome Statute would not meet the requirements of an interpretation in good faith. Such an interpretation would be completely at odds with what the states at Rome intended and, thus, contrary to the overriding principle of treaty interpretation under international law. 
It further pointed out:
... the drafting history confirms that Article 98 (2) was not intended to include agreements such as the US impunity agreements. Indeed, any interpretation that Article 98 (2) did cover such agreements would lead to the manifestly absurd and unreasonable result that a non-state party could subvert the fundamental principle in the Rome Statute that anyone, regardless of nationality, committing genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes on the territory of a state party is subject to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court when states are unable or unwilling genuinely to investigate and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, to prosecute.
In conclusion, this proposal to conclude an impunity agreement with the United States is outrageous. It is inconsistent with our international obligations. It will undermine the International Criminal Court and the struggle for global justice. I urge the government to reject the article 98 agreement proposed by the US. It is wrong as a matter of law and as a matter of principle. We participated in a constructive way at an international level in the development of the ICC. We should continue to be a good international citizen and not go back in our good work at the request of the United States. Australians have made it very clear in recent days that there is increasing anxiety about Australia acting quickly and with haste on requests from the United States, and I fear that this is another such situation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: International Criminal Court</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-09-25,"—It seems that in recent times the Democrats—and, on some occasions, the Labor Party—want to discuss or debate issues which have not yet been decided. You use phrases such as `the government's apparent willingness'. I am not quite sure where you get your information from, Senator Greig, but there are a few facts that I think ought to be put on the table in relation to the International Criminal Court and a lot of other matters.
The United States of America is the largest and most powerful country in the world. Not only that; thankfully, it has a democratically elected government. All the horrific crimes you talk about and all the things that you would seek to criticise have mostly been done by or caused by leaders of governments which are not democracies and in many cases are complete dictatorships. So the people at large—or those who would, in a democracy, get a chance to vote—have no opportunity to vote out of office those dictators and the perpetrators of crimes.
You say that serious offenders have not been brought to justice throughout history. In fact, many serious offenders have been brought to justice—for instance, at the Nuremberg war trials. Many serious offenders and the perpetrators of horrendous war crimes were brought to justice at the war trials in Nuremberg. And right now we have the situation where one of the most recent perpetrators of horrific crimes—Milosevic— is being tried in The Hague. So I do not think that it is true that people have rarely been brought to justice. It is true that there are some that have got away, and nearly every case involved crimes that had been perpetrated by a dictator. 
When you are talking about the United States, you need to remember that it is the most powerful nation in the world, whether you like it or not. It is the most powerful, both economically and in relation to its armed forces. Because it is such a powerful nation, it is vital that the United States, which currently makes such a central contribution to global peacekeeping, continue to play an active and productive role. The United States has expressed its longstanding concerns about the International Criminal Court. To those like Senator Greig and others who would say we blindly follow the United States in the decision making, I say that we as a government in fact decided to support the introduction of the International Criminal Court. The United States did not. We do not follow blindly what the United States does.
We have a mind of our own but we do acknowledge that the United States has had longstanding concerns about the ICC. Those concerns include the legitimacy of the ICC exercising jurisdiction over nationals of non-parties and the potential for politically motivated prosecutions. You must know yourself, Senator Greig, that there is potential for politically motivated prosecutions. History would suggest that that is a possibility, as well as all of the other things that you said history has done. Australia is sympathetic towards the United States' concerns to protect its own citizens—particularly its peacekeepers, who number more than the peacekeepers of all the other countries in the world—from politically motivated prosecutions. It is in Australia's interests to ensure that the United States continues to make that central contribution to global peacekeeping. 
There is no evidence to suggest that, in the absence of the International Criminal Court, the United States itself is not going to bring any perpetrators of violence or crimes to justice. I will only cite one instance: that of Lieutenant William Calley in the Vietnam War, who was prosecuted, tried and convicted by the United States for a war crime. I do not think there is any need to cite any more examples. The United States has been very careful about making sure that its troops involved in peacekeeping or wartime operations are not breaking the law or committing crimes against humanity.
It has come to pass that the United States has approached Australia to discuss a bilateral arrangement which would potentially operate pursuant to article 98(2) of the statute and meet the concerns which the US has expressed. The United States, naturally enough, has made a lot of approaches to a number of other countries around the world in which it has diplomatic missions. Despite its concerns, we regard it as a positive move that the United States is seeking an accommodation with the ICC through the article 98(2) agreements. It is in Australia's interests to ensure that the United States continues to make this central contribution to global peacekeeping and to international security. There is no other country the world strong enough to make the contribution to international security that the United States does.
If you look through history—while it may not have been perfect in every action that it has taken over the past 50 years—without the United States since the Second World War, we would not see the degree of peace that we currently see in the world today. You only need to look at Europe and the mess it would have been in from the end of the Second World War to the present day. Had it not been for the strength of the United States in maintaining peace and bringing those countries together, there is no way that we would have the peace in Europe that we have today. Neighbouring countries can now go to bed at night without wondering whether or not they are going to be attacked the next day by a neighbour or by a nearby country. There is peace in Europe. The United States has displayed a considerable part in making sure that that peace in Europe is what it is today.
It is only natural that, while Australia recognises that the United States has concerns about the ICC, we believe that the protections in place through our domestic legislation will ensure that Australia's peacekeepers will be dealt with in the Australian domestic system. We are quite sure that, because we signed on to the International Criminal Court, Australian peacekeepers will always be protected by domestic legislation. But the United States does not necessarily share our views in that regard.
The US are world peacekeepers and find themselves spread around so many different countries, usually mopping up the mess that has been caused by some tyrant who has committed horrendous crimes within their own national borders. The United Nations in most cases has been powerless to intervene because national sovereignty has always been considered to be the dominant force in all of these arrangements. Too often, American peacekeepers, along with others, are called in to clean up the mess after the horrific event has happened. We do not want that to happen. In an inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which reported only at the end of last year, we tried to look at ways and means through which the United Nations could perform a useful function and intervene before the tragedy occurs—not go in to mop up the mess and keep the peace after the tragedy has occurred.
I do not necessarily agree with it, but I can understand the United States' position in being the most powerful country in the world economically and the most powerful country the world as far as its armed forces and security are concerned. Because of the very fact that it finds itself in so many countries around the world—often in hostile environments in many of the peacekeeping areas that it is working in—I can understand its concern that, when it comes to politically motivated prosecutions, it wants some protection. I do not believe that, as Australians, we need it—we never have. Our armed forces do not believe it and that is why they encouraged us to become signatories of the International Criminal Court. I for one am very pleased that we did. 
You selectively quoted some members of my party who were opposed to us joining the ICC. We have a very healthy party. We have very healthy debates on these issues and we have a variety of views within our own party. But, at the end of the day, the right decision was made by the government and the right decision was made by our party. Please do not selectively quote some members who simply have a different view. We may never know but, even in the Democrats, there may be some people with differing views—it seems to have come to the surface somewhat in recent times. The sign of a healthy decision is when you have had that healthy debate within the party and made the right decision at the end. The right decision of the Australian government was to be a part of the International Criminal Court. But we do acknowledge the concerns that the United States have. As the US is the most powerful nation on earth, we must seek to accommodate them.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I call the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator the Hon. John Faulkner.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: International Criminal Court</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-25,"—Thank you for that most generous call, Mr Acting Deputy President; I do appreciate it. Can I say at the outset of my speech that the opposition will be supporting the urgency motion that is before the Senate. Put simply, the opposition supports the International Criminal Court. We have also made it very clear that we oppose anything that will weaken its effectiveness. We believe that the so-called impunity or article 98 agreements will undoubtedly weaken its effectiveness. So we view with deep concern the Australian government's apparent willingness to sign such an agreement with the United States of America.
Our support for the International Criminal Court is well known. It is an important part of the multilateral system based on the United Nations—a system to which we in the Labor Party are deeply committed; a system which Labor over the years has worked hard to develop and strengthen; in fact, a system which owes its existence in some part to a former leader of our party, Doc Evatt.
—Come on! You're delving a bit deep.
—I am sure my colleagues would agree that a history lesson is obviously in order.
—I think it is required.
—In 1946—
—I was three at the time.
—Well, now is your chance to learn something, Senator Ferguson, and I hope you do. In 1946 Evatt described the United Nations, which he had laboured to help create, as—and let me quote him:
... the best presently available instrument, both for avoiding the supreme and ultimate catastrophe of a third world war, waged with all-destroying weapons, and also for establishing an international order which can and should assure to mankind security against poverty, unemployment, ignorance, famine and disease.
—Sounds like a bit of Evatt's pie in the sky.
—Let me go on:
The United Nations ... existed to help realise the twin objectives of freedom from fear of aggression, and freedom from want. We shall continue steadfastly and courageously to play our part in this organisation, on which must rest most of the hopes of men of goodwill throughout the world.
It is true that Australia chaired the first-ever session of the United Nations Security Council; and, of course, it is true that, through Evatt himself, Australia was the third President of the United Nations General Assembly. Australia, largely through Evatt, was also the prime mover in the creation of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. 
At this time in our history, with the world confronting—and this has been a matter of considerable debate over the past week in the Australian parliament—the possibility of another armed conflict, it is pertinent to recall Evatt's words to this self-same parliament 53 years ago, reflecting on the multilateral system. He said:
It is not difficult to find some flaws in the Charter itself. Neither would it be difficult to prove that the machinery of the United Nations is not being used as effectively as it might. The important thing, however, is that a Charter does now exist, and that a world organization has been set up under which the habit of international conciliation and consultation can and must be developed. It is the duty of all of us to encourage the habit of reference to the United Nations ...
As I have said, the International Criminal Court is a vital part of this multilateral system. It is designed to create a permanent international court focused explicitly on three heinous crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The reason for this is that these three sets of crimes have been responsible for more civilian and military deaths since the conclusion of the Second World War than any other military factor. One estimate is that there have been 170 million casualties arising from more than 250 conflicts over that period around the world. I note that until recently the issue of support for the ICC has been a bipartisan one. Foreign Minister Downer, at the very beginning of his ministry in 1996, said:
I believe an International Criminal Court would be an important step forward for the international community in dealing with the most serious crimes of international concern such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
That is why I want to make this one of the Government's prime multilateral and human rights objectives ...
Those are Mr Downer's words—the same Mr Downer who also indicated that Australia would introduce legislation ratifying the ICC by the end of the year 2000. In September 2000, the Deputy Prime Minister praised Australia for `demonstrating leadership in the negotiations that concluded the statute of the ICC'. But, of course, the government's enthusiastic support quickly became at best lukewarm earlier this year when the rabid Right of the coalition parties and the uglies in the joint party room, well led by Senator Minchin—who joins us in the chamber today—started beating the old anti-UN drum. Deep divisions opened up within the government's ranks over the issue of ratification of the ICC statute.
Mr Howard began to pay more attention to the increasing hostility of the United States to the ICC proposal and less attention to Australia's national interest. That national interest has always resided in a strong and effective multilateral system. Mr Howard even sought a specific briefing from the office of the US national security adviser on this issue, one that lies exclusively within Australian sovereignty and has no direct relevance to the ANZUS alliance. Ultimately, the government decided very reluctantly to ratify the Rome statute, and of course we welcome that decision. But now it appears the government is preparing to sign an agreement with the United States that would potentially completely undermine the effectiveness of the court. This agreement is what is known as an impunity agreement or an article 98 agreement.
Article 98 of the Rome statute permits ICC member states, such as Australia, to negotiate bilateral agreements with nonmember states, such as the United States of America. We understand the United States is seeking to negotiate with ICC parties a bilateral agreement which would prevent US nationals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes from being surrendered to the ICC. These impunity agreements do not require the USA or the other state concerned to investigate and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, to prosecute the US national accused by the ICC of such crimes.
The opposition shares the deep concern expressed by many that these agreements violate the obligations of states parties, under article 86 of the Rome statute, to arrest and surrender persons accused of such crimes to the ICC, and they will effectively neuter the court. The object and purpose of the Rome statute is to end impunity for the worst possible crimes in the world in accordance with the principle of complementarity, which places the primary responsibility of investigating and prosecuting these crimes on states, but ensures that the International Criminal Court will be able to exercise jurisdiction when states fail to fulfil these responsibilities. A fundamental principle underlying the Rome statute is that no-one is above the law and no-one is immune from prosecution from genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. Accordingly, the opposition views with very deep concern a proposal from the US to the Australian government to negotiate an agreement under article 98 of the Rome statute on the ICC, which would effectively make all US personnel immune from prosecution by the ICC. 
The United States has apparently made this request of many countries around the world, with a number having acceded, including, as I understand it, Romania, Israel, East Timor, Colombia and Tajikistan. I note that Senator Ellison, in answering a question without notice on 27 August, stated:
The Government is aware that the US has approached a number of countries to propose that they conclude bilateral agreements, consistent with Article 98(2) of the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), to ensure neither country would surrender or transfer the other's nationals to the ICC without consent.
It continues:
Australia has been approached by the US to conclude an Article 98(2) Agreement. The Government is carefully considering the US proposal.
On 28 August, Foreign Minister Downer, on the PM program on the ABC, said that the government was sympathetic to what the Americans say. He added:
It is consistent with the statute of the International Criminal Court.
In the opposition's view, these impunity agreements raise the fundamental question of the overall integrity of the International Criminal Court. The ultimate effect of the US proposal, if acceded to, could be a series of bilateral agreements right around the world, seeking to exempt not just US personnel from the ICC but also the personnel of the other contracting government. Furthermore, if the United States seeks to withdraw more fundamentally from the ICC system, given that the US has already withdrawn its signature from the Rome statute, there is a grave danger that this would erode the impetus for the remaining states that are yet to ratify the ICC treaty to proceed with ratification.
Labor's view is that, if we are to have an international criminal court, it must be truly international and it must be truly effective. These impunity agreements will ensure it is neither international nor effective. Accordingly, I say to the Senate that we concur with the terms of the motion before the chamber. We agree that this is a matter of urgency and we will be voting in support of the motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: International Criminal Court</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2002-09-25,"—It is most regrettable and disappointing that even among allies and friends of the United States the United States must contend with snipers from behind the shield of capitulation and pacifism. I am pleased to say that, save for New Zealand, Australia has a unique and close relationship with the United States. Indeed, she is probably our closest and friendliest ally. The relationship is just that for good reason. These are things that Senator Greig in his urgency motion fails to understand. Australia and the United States have a common and moral view on the question of civil rights. They have a common and moral view on the question of the rule of law and the right to a fair trial and the right to be judged by an impartial judiciary. Very many other cultural and historical similarities draw our two nations together. It is a tragedy that Senator Greig would seek to try and drive a wedge in that relationship with his naive motion. It is a very sad and sorry situation when Senator Greig and a number of other senators were here last week being so much more vociferous, agitated and energetic when talking about China than they have been when talking about the atrocities and the ongoing breaches of human rights in Iraq. The reason for that is that they are anti-American. It is a very sad and sorry situation to see that the Labor Party has been sucked in by exactly that type of sentiment. 
It is obvious to anybody with any understanding of international history that America is on the front line of protecting human rights right around the world. It is a difficult and complex frontier. In Somalia, Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Kuwait and more recently, of course, in Afghanistan, America is putting its troops on the front line to protect the civil rights of the people in those countries. 
—Who put the Taliban in Afghanistan? Read your history.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator George Campbell, you should desist.
—Some senators sit here in utter and complete ignorance. I remind them to have a look at the plight of women in Afghanistan. Senators will sit here and say that America has gone into the war against terror for its strategic benefit. It is an absolute tragedy that some people in this parliament do not even know why and how they have the freedoms to sit here and express the views that they do. 
It is vital to Australia's national interest that the United States continue to maintain its peacekeeping forces right around the world. It is to our benefit that they commit those forces. What we have seen here is a living, breathing, walking example of why the United States should not participate in the International Criminal Court. We have seen here anti-American sentiment, anti-American prejudice, anti-American bias and then they complain why the Americans will not be judged. All they will get is that level of justice and that is what they are worried about. So Senator Greig in his motion explains why the Americans will not have a bar of it.
—He doesn't even want the Taliban rooted out!
—You supported them!
—Senator McGauran and Senator George Campbell, please desist from your cross-chamber interjections and your dialogue with each other!
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The reasons why the United States would not entertain submitting its citizens to this jurisdiction are exemplified, sadly, by the bias here in this parliament. They are exemplified by descriptions and quotes in the Iraq debate last week. When talking about why America was looking towards arresting this dire situation in Iraq, Senator Nettle said:
Some of this engagement has been constructive, but the current rhetoric is totally unproductive and clearly focused on extending US influence in the region, particularly relating to resources. `Regime change' is marketing jargon for putting in place a new US-friendly government. Regime change does not mean democracy, improved human rights for Iraqi civilians or stability in the Middle East; it simply means putting in place someone the United States can do business with.
That is the type of anti-American sentiment, anti-American naivety, that the Americans are absolutely frightened of. But there is a saving grace: article 98, which Senator Greig conveniently failed to address in his urgency motion. Article 98 is clear in its terms. It states that such bilateral agreements are intended to operate under article 98(2) of the ICC statute which provides:
The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender—
and that means of a citizen—
which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  
The US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes, Pierre-Richard Prosper, is reported to have said on 20 September, while meeting with the UK government, that 16 countries had signed, or were about to sign, bilateral article 98(2) agreements. He is also reported to have said:
What we are asking is that if there is a crime then that person not go to the ICC. But we believe in the rule of the law and we will ensure that the person is investigated and properly prosecuted.
He was thereby indicating that the US recognises that impunity is unacceptable and that persons credibly accused of ICC crimes should be investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted.
The fact is that, while His Excellency the Ambassador for the United States, Ambassador Schieffer, was in this parliament both this morning and last night, providing advice as to the current circumstances in Iraq and elsewhere in the world, none of Senator Greig's colleagues—none of the people behind this motion—were there to hear him. They are talking in utter and complete ignorance about the current state of world affairs. The fact is that their deep-seated, deep-rooted prejudice against the United States is the absolutely classic reason why the United States should not, could not and would not submit its citizens to the type of bias that these people would deliver to them in judgment. ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: International Criminal Court</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I listened closely to Senator Johnston's speech, although I do not give him the status of an international jurist in interpreting article 98. I think that, quite rightly, the jury is still out on that. Clearly, though, it is of grave concern to the Labor Party that the Australian government appears so willing to accede to the request by the United States for an article 98 agreement on the International Criminal Court. For the first time, the world has a permanent institution capable of bringing to justice persons who have committed genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court was established to achieve justice for the victims of these appalling crimes, to end the impunity hitherto enjoyed by many perpetrators of such crimes, to promote peace by breaking the cycle of violence and retribution that accompanies such crimes and to deter the commission of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the future. It is a principle at the foundations of the International Criminal Court that the court exists to act when national criminal justice institutions are unwilling or unable to do so. That is why the Labor Party supports this urgency motion by Senator Greig. 
After the United Nations first recognised the need to establish an international criminal court in 1948, it took some 50 years of diplomatic effort to achieve agreement on the Rome statute establishing the court. From the start, Australia was at the forefront of these efforts. It took another four years for the Liberal and National parties to settle their internal division over the court before the Australian government finally ratified the statute in July 2002. It is no exaggeration to say that, if the United States is successful in persuading countries such as Australia to sign article 98 agreements, much of the 54 years of hard work will gradually be undone. So far it would appear that only a handful of countries have signed the agreement. They range from Romania, East Timor, the Marshall Islands, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic and Honduras to Afghanistan. If Australia were to do likewise, it would inevitably provide convenient cover for many other countries to follow.
The effectiveness of the International Criminal Court can only be eroded by a growing network of bilateral agreements removing citizens—not only those of the United States but potentially those of many other countries—from the reach of this court. It is revealing that, despite the government's willingness to enter an article 98 agreement, neither the Attorney-General nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have bothered to make a public case for such an agreement. They argue, as Senator Johnston poorly attempted to do, that article 98 permits such agreements. Article 98 might, on one reading, permit them but it certainly does not require them. I should also note that there is controversy among legal experts about whether it even permits the kind of agreement that the United States has apparently sought.
The foreign minister points to the fact that the United States have threatened to withdraw from peacekeeping. They say such a withdrawal is not in Australia's interest. Nor is it in Australia's interest—particularly our long-term interest—to accede to that. Germany, Switzerland and Canada have not done so; we should not do so either. If what I have just outlined, with Senator Johnston's comments, is the sum total of the Australian government's case for entering an article 98 agreement then it is wholly unconvincing. In fairness, I should acknowledge that the Attorney-General did say on the Sunday program on 8 September: 
... we are still working out the details with the United States to ensure that any agreement we make with them is consistent with our international obligations ...
The words `international obligations' cross the Howard government's lips so rarely these days that it is reassuring to hear that they still figure in at least the Attorney-General's thinking. But, in seeking to make an agreement that is consistent with our international obligations, I fear that he has set himself an impossible task. 
By ratifying the International Criminal Court, the Australian government recognised a number of things. It recognised that genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity threaten the peace, security and wellbeing of the world. Unpunished crimes have almost invariably led to the continuation of wider conflict and violence. The government signalled its determination to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and to contribute to their prevention. The government recognised that the effective prosecution of these crimes must be ensured not only by national measures but, where these measures are unavailable, by international cooperation. It affirmed that it is the duty of every state to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes but also resolved that there could be no lasting respect for international justice without the establishment of a truly international criminal court with complementary jurisdiction over the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.
Having argued for the International Criminal Court and made these solemn declarations, it is difficult for the government then to suggest that Australia has no obligation to promote cooperation with the court by the community of nations as a whole. Yet, by cooperating with the United States' campaign for a wholesale exclusion from the International Criminal Court by the use of the article 98 bilateral agreement, the Australian government would be suggesting just that. Who knows how many countries—and perhaps Senator Mason can suggest who else—would use a similar mechanism to shield war crimes from justice using the precedent such an inclusion would set?
Labor has been supportive of the establishment of the International Criminal Court and has been solidly behind the ratification of the Rome statute by this government. Labor supported the enactment of the necessary legislation to give effect to the Rome statute, which established the International Criminal Court. Labor cooperated with the government to secure the timely ratification of the statute. The government's legislation also incorporated a number of amendments, which were considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I am sure Senator Mason will also comment on the treaties committee's good work in ensuring that the International Criminal Court proposal was given proper scrutiny and was one that was deserving of ratification by this government.
But it was important that during the passage of these bills in July the government— which had, prior to July, allowed the ratification by July—did three things. Firstly, it incorporated some technical amendments and a declaration. The declaration stands with article 98 as one of two backflips by this government where they sign, ratify and then baulk. It is disheartening to see this government, in the international community's eyes, take a backward step in relation to the International Criminal Court by considering the article 98 bilateral agreement. That is why we support the urgency motion. I am sure Senator Mason, when he gets to his feet, will similarly agree that we should not take backward steps in relation to the International Criminal Court.
—Just wait, Joe.
—It is an important court, and Senator Mason knows that. Senator Mason participated in the treaties committee and agreed with the underlying basis that the court had to have international jurisdiction and it had to ensure that it had a community of nations— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: International Criminal Court</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2002-09-25,"—I want to touch on the law before I touch on the politics of the International Criminal Court issue. This arrangement, so decried by Senator Greig and others, is specifically provided for under the ICC statute. Article 98 recognises that states have arrangements regarding extradition and it respects such an arrangements by circumscribing the powers of the court in those circumstances. So Australia would not be doing anything unlawful under international law should it enter into an impunity arrangement with the United States. There is nothing illegal or unusual about it—it is catered for under the ICC statute. 
As in Australia, there has been much debate in the United States about ratification of this treaty. Nearly every former US Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State opposed it. Senator Ludwig is right; I thought it was in Australia's national interest to ratify. The Americans disagreed. They are entitled to their own definition of their self-interest. 
The United States has two principal concerns with the ICC. First—and this is very unusual—the ICC seeks to exercise jurisdiction over the nationals of non-parties to the convention, such as citizens of the United States. That is unusual because this treaty seeks to exercise jurisdiction over every citizen on earth, irrespective of whether the governments of those nations sign up to the treaty. That is very unusual; whether it is good or bad is a different question. Senator Ludwig may support it; I think it is in Australia's national interest. But the United States takes a different view of its self-interest, and it is entitled to—not only because it can take any view it wants of it, but for this reason: this is a very unusual treaty, seeking to exercise jurisdiction over all nationals in the world irrespective of whether their government signs up to the treaty or not. There is concern about that and it is fair concern.
The second thing that concerns the United States is the spectre of politically motivated prosecutions. They are concerned that this court will be used for political purposes, and I understand why. During the Cold War, the United States fortunately developed a habit of activism on a global scale; it spent much on the defence of liberty and democracy. Having won the Cold War—we actually won it, I inform the Labor Party—
—You won it, did you? Congratulations.
—No thanks to you lot. The United States wants to reinforce that victory. That means not only promoting good but also crushing evil and, if necessary, doing it by force. This activism brings with it the renewed capacity to make enemies and create animosity and fear. This is particularly so in the context of September 11, 2001. The United States has committed itself to destroying the monster of terrorism. Terrorism is an elusive, amorphous and shadowy enemy. There is no doubt that the United States pursuit of those terrorists could cause all sorts of difficulties with their relations with states, and it again opens the United States to politically motivated prosecutions when other states do not support the United States in their activities. That is a problem.
There is another point too, and I mentioned it in a speech I made earlier today. Latent among the political left and potentially even an issue on the right is the resurgence of anti-Americanism. It is back! In a recently published lecture, Professor Owen Harries spoke of the resurgence of anti-Americanism. He cited the recent observation of Rosemary Righter, chief editorial writer of the Times of London, that `America-bashing is in fashion as it has not been since Vietnam.' She is not talking of Asia and the Middle East, but of those European sophisticates in London, Paris and Berlin.
American nationals, specifically soldiers, are not above the law; they remain subject to American law. American law is among the most sophisticated of all legal systems. Its due process protections are probably the most stringent in the world. To argue that that is less than is given by the ICC is ridiculous. The Americans are concerned about politically motivated prosecutions. The truth of the matter is that there is a great concern that countries like the US, rather than the real gross human rights violators, will become the target of the ICC. There are enough governments, NGOs and activists around the world that are hostile to the US specifically, and to Western liberal democratic ideals more broadly, to ensure that the mechanisms of the court might be used as a perverse weapon against the world's only remaining superpower. 
Some will say that this risk is overstated. The United States argues that it is not in their national interest to take that risk. It is not hard to understand why. The US currently maintains 200,000 soldiers and sailors outside its border and has base rights in more than 40 countries. The US armed forces have been the backbone of most major United Nations operations, both in wars such as Korea and Kuwait and in peacekeeping in areas such as Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo. They provide the troops to keep the world at peace as well. Now the US is bearing the brunt of the war against terrorism. By virtue of its position and resources, the US is involved around the world and gets called to be involved around the world whenever anything of any importance happens. All this means that the US, more than any other country on Earth, is potentially exposed to actions under the ICC.
—You missed out the principle of complementarity.
—We in the West, we in Australia—and Senator Ludwig as well, no doubt—so often want the United States to be active in international affairs and global peacekeeping, but we want it on our terms. We want the US to be involved on our terms. I am afraid that we are not always going to get it that way—that is the bottom line. 
—So you should stop trying.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Ludwig, I wish you would stop trying.
—The conclusion of an article 98(2) agreement might just be the price Australia has to pay for continued United States involvement in the war against terrorism and global peacekeeping. If that is the price we have to pay, you might just have to pay it.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-09-25,"—Volume and animation is no substitute for substance. I welcome the support from the opposition and thank all senators for their contributions, regardless of how they feel about the issue. I will say a few things in conclusion. I find it intriguing that anybody who speaks up against current international circumstances, speaks up in support of the United Nations or speaks up in support of the International Criminal Court is somehow accused of being anti-American. We Australian Democrats are not anti-American, but we are antithuggery and anti-imperialist. We believe in the international rule of law and international global support.
Senator Ferguson argued repeatedly that America was a very powerful nation, politically and economically. I have no argument with that. But for that reason it must be a team player. For that reason the peoples of the world are concerned that the most powerful nation in the world is not above the law. That is why it is in the United States' interests and in global interests for it to be a cooperative team player in the way the International Criminal Court is constituted and operates.
Senator Ferguson said that the Americans were concerned about the possibility of politically motivated prosecutions—that is an understandable concern for any country that signs on to this—yet he was silent on the question of politically motivated non-prosecutions and the possibility for countries to remove themselves and their citizens from prosecution for their own political reasons, which is why the ICC can best operate if it is one-in, all-in. Senator Ferguson argued also that domestic remedies were the best option for dealing with this. We have seen, Senator Mason, in long discussions we have had on antigenocide in relation to Australia, for example, that domestic remedies are often inadequate and they have clearly failed within an Australian jurisdiction, which is why our signing on to the ICC is welcome.
Senator Johnston argued that America was a great human rights advocate and talked about the appalling way that women were treated in Afghanistan. He failed to point out that the US funded and resourced the Taliban—the most appalling administrators of the laws in that country—for some time. He failed to point out that the US was absent during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. He failed to point out the funding and support for military regimes in South America. He failed to point out that the US bombing of Iraq has killed 400,000 children in the last decade and that when Madeleine Albright was asked about this she said it was `a price worth paying'. 
We believe the ICC should be supported without qualification. We believe that the Senate has a duty and a right to express its opinion on this. As Senator Ferguson said, the government has not signed off on this, but let us get in early and make our case. (Time expired)

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002 and related issues, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The Senate Community Affairs References Committee was asked to inquire into the adequacy, effectiveness and fairness of the proposed participation requirements for parents and mature age unemployed Australians as contained in the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and Other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002. The committee was also asked to consider the report of the Independent Review of Breaches and Penalties in the Social Security System, also known as the Pearce review. I would like to thank the members of the committee and the staff for their diligence and commitment to the process.
The Pearce review presents a balanced and sensible approach to the issues of participation requirements and breaching. In our view, the Pearce approach represents a way forward both in terms of this legislation and the reform of the penalties regime more broadly. Currently, the legislation does not accurately reflect the reciprocal nature of the principles of mutual obligation. The phrase `mutual obligation' implies that there are two groups who are obliged to take action. In the relationship between government and the individual, the government is the stronger, more experienced and more powerful partner. As such, it has a greater responsibility than the individual concerned.
The so-called Australians Working Together package and the McClure report on which it was based spent a great deal of time discussing the concept of community involvement in the process of engaging people in work. But the proof is in the pudding. While the government vaunted the importance of the community, individuals and government working together, its package failed to deliver. In the $1.7 billion package, many hundreds of millions of which simply extend existing programs, a measly $22 million is to be spent on community engagement. Of that $22 million, the vast majority is to be spent on the Prime Minister's Community Business Partnership, which has scope of myopic proportions. For a government that has mutual obligation at the heart of its agenda for the welfare system, that is a pretty poor commitment. Members of the government such as Minister Abbott would love to shift the burden of welfare to charities and the community. But that will just not happen. If it is a workable proposition, a major cultural change will need to occur. At the moment, the government is not willing to commit to what is necessary for that change to happen. Instead, it has proposed changes to the social security system which punish the most vulnerable members of our society. 
The government has clearly not thought through the costs of being subject to a participation agreement. The government's payment of $20.80 per fortnight, which would offset the additional costs incurred as a result of complying with a participation agreement, is grossly inadequate. Conservative estimates provided to the committee by witnesses suggested that this figure should be doubled if it were to adequately reflect the type of expenses that people incur. The breaching system is punitive by its very nature and there would be few senators in this chamber who disagree with the principle that one should participate in the job market if one is a recipient of a Centrelink payment such as Newstart or Youth Allowance. They are, after all, payments which are paid in return for job seeking, training or education.
The Senate Community Affairs References Committee, however, was entrusted with an inquiry into the effect that participation requirements and breaching would have on single parents and older unemployed people. Single parents are a group in society that is often targeted by conservative commentators as undeserving of the supposed privileges it is given by the Australian social security system. During the inquiry the committee heard evidence from a number of groups that showed how difficult life is for single parents. They told us of the commitment that single parents have to their children and the high priority they give to caring for them. The Sole Parents Union made particular reference to the importance of a balance between work and family. Single parents are not unemployed; they are engaged in caring for their children. Nor are they welfare bludgers—they are, in fact, the group of welfare recipients most likely to be engaged in work.
Most of us here are parents and we understand the demands that our children place on our time. Those demands are not unpleasant, but they exist. I doubt that there is anything more important than the caring and responsible upbringing of our children. Separated and divorced parents may well be to blame for their own actions, but the imposition of unreasonable participation requirements on single parents punishes children as much as it does their parents. The family is the most basic element of our society. Where it fails, we are obliged to ensure that it does not also fail the next generation.
With respect to the provisions within the bill for the mature age unemployed, simply not enough is done. If there is a group which has suffered at the hands of the government, it is the older unemployed. While enforcing compulsory participation agreements on single parents, the bill that the committee reviewed allows older unemployed people greater flexibility. While there is flexibility, the sense one gets is that these are people that the government has given up on. These are the people who most need to be retrained and taught new skills. Yet the government's package provides them with no new opportunities and no hope. They are parked and essentially left to wait for the old age pension to kick in.
Mutual obligation, if it were used effectively, could be part of a targeted reduction in welfare dependency. The point is that participation agreements should have an aim, and that aim should be to get people jobs. Almost everyone who receives a Centrelink benefit would jump at any opportunity they were given. But, instead of being a tool of training and a means of increasing the employability of our work force, the government uses participation agreements as a way of deceiving the electorate and cutting costs to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.
Under the proposed model of breaches, single parents would stand to lose $987 for missing one interview. By the third breach, a parent and their children would suffer a $3,990 decrease in their standard of living over a period of 14 months. The aim of participation requirements should be to assist individuals in taking part in the work force. Penalties of this order would appear to be counterproductive. The government should not ignore the impact of such pay cuts on the lives and opportunities of a single parent's children. The government may not sympathise with the children of single parents, but the public does. In a survey conducted by the Brotherhood of St Laurence, members of the public suggested that a fair breaching program would be $20 for the first breach, $50 for the second and $75 for the third. The government's proposal is some 27 times greater than what the public considers to be punishment enough. 
The parenting payment is not something that benefits the parent only, it also benefits their children. Submissions to the committee made it very clear that parents would consider their responsibility for the welfare of their children more important than the fulfilment of obligations under a participation agreement. When a system makes a parent choose between his or her children and financial benefits, there is something very seriously wrong. I would certainly not call myself a bleeding heart. In fact, there are a few members of this chamber whom I have accused of being bleeding hearts in a very derogatory sense. But I do believe in the principle of a fair go. I do believe that if the government is going to make life hard for people, there has to be a good reason. I also believe that the government's proposed changes to the social security system are mutton dressed up as lamb.
Our current system of breaching is arbitrary in its punishment of individuals for failing to comply with participation agreements, it is out of step with the public's perception of how people should be treated, it is counterproductive in terms of slowing welfare dependency and the government has opted out of its side of the bargain. The overwhelming decision of the committee was to endorse a sensible and effective program of participation requirements to ensure that Australians are given a chance rather than being arbitrarily punished.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report of Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2002-09-25,"—The proposed changes to the participation requirements and penalties in the social security system have been introduced by the government as part of its Australians Working Together package, which is designed to assist Australians looking for work. A most disturbing aspect of our committee's activities is the clear division among the very Australians who are supposed to be working together. During the public hearings and submissions to the inquiry there was significant evidence provided by key welfare groups and people who are actually receiving some form of welfare assistance which highlights the problems in the system and cries out for further involvement in any process to improve the system.
There is no doubt about the need for the system to change. There is no doubt that there is a need to develop methods to reduce the high proportion of working age population reliant on income support. There is no doubt that there need to be more participation requirements and indeed in some cases some form of penalty. However, the doubts relate to the methods and the processes used by the government to implement policies. Unfortunately, during our committee process there seemed to be some conflict and some competition about who was actually right and the motives behind statements being made about the system were questioned. Any question seemed to be seen as criticism and was not welcome.
Instead of a genuine atmosphere of cooperation stimulated by the real agreement about the need to effectively support Australians into appropriate work and training, a system which was promoted by the government with its appointment of a reference group on welfare reform in September 1999, too often in the submissions from key welfare agencies there was evidence that they were unsure of the ability of officers of the government and particular departments to involve the community in consultation and in particular to understand or respond to any criticism of the system.
The committee recommended that the Department of Family and Community Services implement in full the recommendations of the Independent Review of Breaches and Penalties in the Social Security System. The independent review was chaired by Professor Pearce and was established in August 2001 by leading charities and community organisations including ACOSS, Welfare Rights, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and indeed the Community and Public Sector Union. The purpose of this independent review was to look specifically at penalties, their effects, how they were enforced and to recommend any improvements needed. It was set up because people and organisations directly involved in service delivery and in the confronting and often heart-rending work with people in need were concerned about the way the system was working. Rather than just making simplistic media grabbing statements or allegations, this review explored the available data on the process, interviewed welfare dependent people and produced a report with 36 recommendations relating to the nature and the specific processes used by the department to work with their clients. 
This report was presented in good faith to the Department of Family and Community Services which then stated that it `provided a valuable perspective on very detailed aspects of breaching policy and practice'. The department, coincidentally, had conducted an internal review at exactly the same time and many of the issues had been identified and addressed. In discussion with our committee, Professor Pearce expressed some disappointment about the response from the department and indeed the respect with which the recommendations were received and understood. He said:
All I say is that when looking at those responses, one needs to be very clear that they tend to put a gloss on or generalise the position without really getting to the nitty-gritty of what we have recommended. There have been some occasions when we think that the way in which the response represents the intention of the recommendation is not entirely accurate.
Professor Disney, another member of the independent review, highlighted a particular concern with the lack of accurate information. He said:
... it is very hard to find out with accuracy what is really happening and to find out whether changes that are promised have actually been introduced, whether if introduced they have been kept because quite often they are pilots which are then discontinued, and if introduced to find out the detail.
Indeed, this exchange of information issue, a critical aspect of any real relationship, was highlighted by the inability of ACOSS, Welfare Rights or this house to obtain current accurate data on breaching numbers. Unnecessary argument as well as some direct questioning of motivation were caused because of confusion over the way stats were kept and how they were exchanged. One real result of our whole review must be that in some way accurate data can be exchanged so that if any differences are identified we are able to work on the same figures, so that we do not waste time in unnecessary argument. Part of Australians Working Together must be the people who actually supply the service in the departments. One of the crucial factors, as acknowledged by the department during the review, was the role of the people working in Centrelink:
In large part, the successful administration of the provisions and the participation support framework they underpin will come down to the capacity of Centrelink to administer the flexibility and individualisation of service delivery expected. Two factors, in particular, will be critical:
—the capacity for policy guidelines and administrative procedures to be interpreted appropriately and equitably while maintaining the flexibility to allow an individually tailored approach ...
This is a critical aspect of the whole process: to have individuals who are particularly in danger identified clearly and to have systems to work with them, not against them. The second point put by the department is:
—the training and management of those staff charged with providing the participation planning, support and monitoring at the heart of those measures—the new Personal Adviser role.
The role of the staff must be understood in any discussion about any change of government policy. Welfare Rights, in their submission, particularly said:
It is a complex system. There are many provisions to look at. Centrelink at their best cannot make sure that everything is going to happen correctly all the time. Indeed, we have seen, with the penalties regime applying to unemployed people, how it breaks down in hundreds of thousands of cases on hundreds of thousands of occasions.
Whilst allowing for some exaggeration to make a point, the real issue here is that any system relies on the availability of and the competence of people to work. We must ensure that any system must be effectively resourced, training provided and once again trust engendered between those people who need the system and those people who implement the system so that genuinely in Australians Working Together people will have a hope of working together. 
The review by our committee has recommended that we take up the recommendations of the Pearce report and a range of other issues. Whilst there are concerns about the way the penalty system works, the real issue must be that people understand the system and are not isolated or further disadvantaged by the same system which has been set up to help them. While we believe that the recommendations should be taken up, we also believe that this system must be continually reviewed. In fact, the department have agreed that any system must be reviewed on an ongoing basis—and in fact they do it.
We state that the reviews must continue but that the reviews must genuinely include all those Australians who wish to work together and all those who have something to offer to go into the review. People should not be excluded; they should not be pushed away. Most clearly, they must be respected for their right to continue to exist in our society and for their right to be helped and not punished. The concept of the penalty regime must be to encourage people to be involved, rather than to punish. As long as there is a system focused on punishment, there will not be people willing to take part in this system. I commend the recommendations of our committee. I believe that there has been goodwill in our process and I believe that there is real activity that can be gained by an ongoing, actively involved Australians Working Together process. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-09-25,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, I cosponsored a motion with Senator Faulkner on 21 August and this is a response from the Prime Minister to that motion. The motion, which we had passed in the Senate on that day, called upon the government:
... to define the circumstances under which Australia would consider diplomatic or military support for a United States led attack on Iraq ...
In particular, that motion called for the outlining of:
... the evidence linking Iraq to international terrorism or evidence of a significant expansion in the threat from Iraq's nuclear, chemical or biological weapons programs.
The motion was founded on a fundamental recognition that, if Australia is to commit to military action against Iraq, it must first be very clear about the objectives, the merit and of course the legality of any such action. I am disappointed with this response because the Prime Minister has failed to respond in detail to this resolution of the Senate. Once again I believe the Prime Minister has missed an opportunity to outline his and of course his government's independent assessment of evidence against Iraq. I welcome the Prime Minister's indication that he believes that Australian policy on a US-led attack on Iraq should be the subject of a thorough discussion by the Australian community and a full parliamentary debate— something that the Australian Democrats have called for continually in this debate. However, as one would acknowledge—and certainly as you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, as our party's defence spokesperson, have said many times and indeed in the Senate today and in a series of questions this week—any such debate must be informed. The ability of this parliament to make decisions in the best interests of the Australian community on this issue will be compromised if the Prime Minister fails to equip us with the relevant information. Yet again, the Australian people and their representatives in this place are left to consider these issues only on information provided by other political leaders.
The justification put forward by the US and the UK for war against Iraq has not been consistent. While much attention has been given to Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction, the US, as you have noticed, has focused on different issues in recent months. In fact, I believe it has changed its focus towards the need for a regime change in Iraq. Moreover, there have been indirect attempts, although no clear evidence has been presented, to link Iraq with the terrorist attacks of 11 September. On the issue of weapons of mass destruction, there is evidence that Iraq continues to produce chemical and biological weapons, that it is working towards building nuclear weapons and that it has extended the range of its ballistic missiles. 
The Australian Democrats strongly oppose the development and possession of weapons of mass destruction. We are concerned by the evidence regarding Iraq's capability in this respect—of course we are concerned. However, we do not believe that unilateral military action is an appropriate way to address these concerns. Any strategy involving unilateral military action is fraught with danger. Legal opinion demonstrates that such action would be in contravention of well-established principles of international law. There is also much evidence to suggest that it would result in further destabilisation in the Middle East, particularly given the potential for Israel to become involved in such action.
Perhaps most significantly, pre-emptive military action has the potential to seriously undermine the authority of the United Nations and thus lead to global instability. This issue of Iraq's possession and development of weapons of mass destruction must be addressed through well-established multilateral frameworks in accordance with international law. The Democrats have welcomed, and we state again for the record that we welcome, Iraq's agreement to readmit UN weapons inspectors and we believe that this course must be pursued as the first step towards disarmament. We welcome the Prime Minister's indication that `Australia looks to the UN to take action now' to address Iraq's defiance of its international obligations. Significantly, however, President Bush has made it clear that regime change—not simply the destruction of weapons of mass destruction—will be the objective of any US-led attack or military action against Iraq.
The current regime in Iraq, as I think we would all acknowledge, is undemocratic, violent and has consistently displayed a disregard for basic human rights. This regime, under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, contributes to ongoing instability in the Middle East and poses a threat to international security. However, there is a long list of political regimes around the world that could be the subject of the same criticisms. The Democrats believe such regimes must be challenged, but again, for the reasons I have outlined, unilateral military action is not the appropriate avenue. If democratic nations around the world work together as a collective community, there is much we can do to challenge and hopefully ultimately transform such regressive regimes.
The United Nations was founded on the basis of collective security and we believe very strongly, and I hope all in this place believe, that it is worthy of our ongoing support. There is certainly scope to improve its operations but it is the best model we have at present for collective diplomatic action and the promotion and hopefully protection of international peace. Despite the absence of any evidence linking Iraq to the tragic and appalling events of 11 September, there have been clear attempts to justify pre-emptive military action as a means of preventing further terrorist attacks. President Bush has said:
In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action ...
While the world may have changed since the events of 11 September last year, we must not let our assessment of the situation in Iraq be clouded by any incorrect associations with the terrorist attacks of that day. Unless, and until, there is evidence to suggest a link between the two, we must be careful to give independent and thorough consideration to the situation in Iraq and the best way that we can address those current concerns.
As pre September 11 media reports demonstrate, President Bush's intentions concerning Iraq extend back before 11 September. Given the absence of any evidence to link Iraq to the terrorist attacks, it is misleading to argue that the case for pre-emptive action against Iraq has become more compelling since the events of 11 September. I take this opportunity to record once again the Australian Democrats' serious concerns regarding the National Security Strategy of the United States. Clearly, it is the intention of the President of the United States, President Bush, for any US-led military action against Iraq to be conducted in accordance with this strategy. This must be a key consideration in any decision by this country to participate in such action. 
The strategy emphasises the unprecedented position of power and influence enjoyed by the US. It expressly states that the United States will act to ensure that other nations do not acquire a military build-up in the hope of surpassing or equalling the power of the United States. This document depicts the US as the foremost guardian of international freedom and democracy, yet it expressly states that US military endeavours will not be hampered by investigations or prosecutions conducted under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. We have just conducted a debate about this in this chamber today, led by Senator Brian Greig.
President Bush's strategy is not about upholding the rule of law; it is about upholding the rule of America. Australia should be very wary of participating in any military action initiated pursuant to such a strategy. The Australian Democrats believe that pre-emptive military action against Iraq is neither justified nor legal. We certainly do not believe it is in the best interests of the Australian people to participate in such military action.
We believe very strongly that, in such life and death matters, such passionate issues should be debated in this chamber. These issues are not just passionate and emotive; there are legal, political and resource concerns and a range of other concerns that have to be taken into account. We believe that Australian politicians—the members of this and the other place—should be entitled to a conscience vote on such matters. I think that is a fundamental debate that we need to see take place in this chamber.
Similarly, we want to see this debate led by our Prime Minister. We want to see him in Australia leading the debate. That is what we expect. We do not want it deferred to the foreign affairs minister. We want to see the nation's leader providing progressive, open, accountable, passionate leadership on this issue. I think most Australians are wondering not `Where's Wally?' but `Where's Johnny?' With all due respect to the Prime Minister, where is the Prime Minister in this debate? I think it is about time we had that leadership—hence my concern today with that very specific motion passed in the chamber, which I moved in my then capacity as Leader of the Australian Democrats, along with Senator Faulkner, the leader of the opposition in this place. I am sorry we did not get a more detailed and comprehensive response to an issue that should be at the forefront of politicians' minds right now, as it is indeed at the forefront of many Australians' minds.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN AFFAIRS: IRAQ</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-25,"—I take note of the Prime Minister's letter and its failure to inform the Senate of the reasons Australia should be floating on the coat-tails of the White House towards the invasion of Iraq. Let none of us be beguiled by what is going on and by the statements of ministers, including the Prime Minister, of recent days that they can divulge no game plan for the attack on Iraq because there has been no request from the United States. How silly do they think the Australian people are? 
We see nightly on television the process of American armaments going to Qatar and other places in the Middle East—armed service personnel, aircraft, rockets; the full works. We also see Australian senior Defence personnel being presented with the minister on television for discussions about what are called `contingencies'. What is happening here is the readiness process for an invasion of Iraq whether or not the United Nations gives its approval—and it will be approval under great pressure from the United States if that occurs. We are going to war because John Howard does not have the nous to be an independent Prime Minister. He does not lead an independent government; he does not see Australia as an independent nation. It is about time he woke up to himself. It is certainly about time he woke up to the rapidly growing public opinion in this country, which is very much against the direction in which he is taking the country. 
How could we be in a situation where it is now being decided by the White House that we go to war? The answer to that is that it is the result of the attack on the twin towers and then the loss of contact with Osama bin Laden and his leadership of Al-Qaeda. Maybe he was vaporised in one of those bomb attacks on the caves in Afghanistan, or maybe he was not, but in the absence of Osama bin Laden and in the face of the American President's determination to find a target of evil, the focus was then turned on Saddam Hussein as a substitute for Osama bin Laden although even our Prime Minister said there is no hard evidence to link Saddam Hussein with the twin towers attack. And it was notable that Tony Blair offered no such new evidence last night either.
Why is President Bush in this frame of mind? If you look at his record, you get a clue. It is a record of tunnel vision and immaturity from the American President. He told a group of people in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, before the attack on the twin towers:
When I was coming up it was a dangerous world and we knew exactly who the they were. It was us versus them and it was clear who them was. Today, we're not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.
That was quoted in the Guardian Weekly in January last year. This is an extraordinary reference to the fact that, when he was growing up, the communist Soviet Union was there and they were seen as the nidus of evil. After that, he was not so sure but he knew somebody was out there.
After the attack on the twin towers, that evil was given face in the form of Osama bin Laden. But, as I said, he then went off the agenda. In that circumstance—and I will refer to 60 Minutes two weeks ago—when asked by the American interviewer:
But you have won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or alive?
President Bush said:
If he were dead there's somebody else to replace him and we would find that person.
We have here a very narrow-minded fundamentalist in the President of the United States who has this immature view that `we are good and they are bad'. In some way or other, to enhance the view that the United States, as he sees it, is good and somebody else is bad, you have to chase that bad to vindicate that very narrow, and ultimately dangerous, point of view—that we are good and they are bad.
What amazes me is that John Howard— and Tony Blair, extraordinarily enough— have not got the wit or wisdom to see that this is a president who has an obsession with the evil as a counterpoint to the good he sees in the United States. There are psychological interpretations to be made about that. But there is one thing I would say to President Bush: all of us have in us the great capacity for good and the great capacity for evil, and we should know that. Not to understand that is dangerous, particularly when you have power. 
We now have dangerous adventurism by President Bush. If Saddam Hussein were to somehow pack up his bags and fly to another Arab country and leave Iraq and its oil to the intentions of the American multinationals to get a slice of the oil fields of Iraq, another face of evil would then have to be invented for this president—and it would indeed be invented. There is no obvious end point to the very narrow and simplistic viewpoint that President Bush has. It needs other statespeople, people with more worldly wisdom, to contain it, to put a hand on its shoulder, and that is what John Howard is failing to do. He does not have the wisdom to be able to say, `Here is a President I can influence for the better. Here is a President who needs some restraint.' Instead of that, he is reduced to being one of what President Bush calls the `sum of the friends' he will invade Iraq with regardless of what the United Nations does.
From the feedback that I am getting from Australians, including not a few long-term Liberal voters, I can tell you that there is a very strong feeling against Australia being involved in such an invasion of Iraq. The revelations by Tony Blair last night totally failed the build-up, the hype and the expectation that here was going to be a dossier which revealed that Saddam Hussein is ready to attack with the armaments and arsenal at his disposal. It did nothing of the sort. I agree with John Howard on one point: much of what was in Tony Blair's dossier was recycled information, and the rest of it was based on supposition, or at least unidentified sources. We are in a very dangerous situation here. As somebody said to me just yesterday: have they not thought it through? If we attack Iraq and inflame the rest of the Arabic or Muslim world, there are going to be decades of repercussions. Mr Galloway, the Labor MP in Britain, has pointed out that it will lead to a tenfold increase in the amount of terrorism around the world. That is what the Prime Minister is unnecessarily exposing this country to. 
Certainly, we have to put a cap on Saddam Hussein, but nothing that has been revealed by Mr Blair or Mr Howard—or Mr Bush, for that matter—in the last few weeks changes the profile that Saddam Hussein had pre September 11 last year. There was no action then. There should be action now, but it certainly should not be a US unilaterally decided invasion of Iraq with Australia following suit, putting the lives of Australians on the line, along with potentially thousands of Iraqi lives. This is the wrong way to go. The Greens are absolutely opposed to war at the behest of John Howard and President Bush. We stand firmly on that point. We will continue to advocate that and to support the growing numbers of people in the Australian community who feel the same and who feel that they are being let down by Prime Minister Howard and his government on this mightily important issue, which is going to draw Australia into an unnecessary war.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-09-25,"—I rise to speak to the motion to take note of the Prime Minister's letter. As we heard from my colleague, Greens Senator Bob Brown, the Greens have a range of concerns on this issue and in regard to the Prime Minister's response to the Senate regarding our concerns in here and in an international context. 
I draw the Senate's attention to the letter from the Prime Minister in which he says that he would like to have a full parliamentary debate on this issue. However, people may note that it is conditional in that the Prime Minister's letter says that he would like to have the debate `at an appropriate time'. The Australian Greens question when John Howard is going to decide that it is an appropriate time to have this discussion. Certainly, the question has been asked in many forums previously whether the Prime Minister would like to see discussion on this issue after the executive—the Prime Minister and his friends—have made a commitment to send Australian troops to Iraq. That is, after they have made a commitment to send the sons and daughters of so many Australians to Iraq, where they will be exposed to Gulf War syndrome, when they will not have the support of the Australian people for being there and where they will potentially be involved in unilateral action led by the United States and George Bush, with all his warmongering talk that we have heard in the last few months.
I would also like to draw the Senate's attention to the next paragraph from our Prime Minister, where he continues to articulate what we have heard him and his ministers articulate in the public arena for some time now. They like to be able to fall back on it. It is their safety blanket to say, `But we haven't received a request from the United States for us to go to war.' Perhaps the Prime Minister or his representatives in this chamber could elaborate on what we heard the foreign minister, Alexander Downer, saying on the weekend. He said that the Australian government has been consulted about contingency plans by the United States with regard to an invasion of Iraq. Perhaps the government would like to expand for us on what these contingency plans entail. Perhaps the government would like to explain whether `contingency' is another word for the fall-back plan—the unilateral plan. If George Bush, John Howard and Tony Blair are not able to bully the United Nations Security Council into giving them the resolution that they want, perhaps their fall-back option is these contingency plans that have been discussed with our government by the President of the United States. 
As we heard Bob saying, Tony Blair presented a dossier of evidence to the parliament in the United Kingdom last night, and we saw nothing new in that. We saw a similar thing to what was presented here by Alexander Downer, the foreign minister—
—Order! Senators should address members of the other house by their proper title, such as Mr Downer or Mr Howard.
—When Mr Blair in the United Kingdom presented the dossier of evidence on why we should immediately jump on our horses and head towards Iraq and the imminent invasion there, we saw no new evidence in that dossier. Rather, we saw what Mr Downer presented in this chamber and in the other place, which was a conglomeration of things in which Saddam Hussein had been involved for the last 11 years. Everyone in this chamber knows, and the Australian people know, that Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator. There is most certainly a strength of evidence supporting the way in which he has treated his own people and the way in which he has ignored the calls by the international community and, indeed, kicked out the UN weapons inspectors in 1998.
None of this gives us any clear evidence that there is an imminent threat that Saddam Hussein will use weapons of mass destruction, be they biological, chemical or nuclear, if they have that capacity, in the near future. Certainly, the evidence produced by Mr Blair in the United Kingdom does not add any strength to those arguments put forward by our own Prime Minister or by the President of the United States. Rather, this dossier put forward in the United Kingdom is being used by those world leaders as part of their campaign to bully the United Nations. Each of them has said on several occasions now that if the United Nations does not come up with the goods, does not come up with the resolutions that they would like to see, clearly the United Nations is deficient. We have seen them continuing to bash the United Nations and the role that they play in the international community by saying, `If they do not do what we want them to do, clearly they are not doing their job.'
We would like the opportunity to put forward positive and constructive changes in respect of how the United Nations may be changed. Indeed, joint committees here have looked at evidence and, I understand, have come up with bipartisan proposals for how the United Nations Security Council could be democratised and organised to ensure that all nations had a say and that all voices were heard in that peak decision making body of the United Nations. Now is the opportunity for us to have that debate, to put forward those views, rather than continuing to harp on, as we have heard these world leaders do, saying that the United Nations are clearly deficient and that clearly we cannot listen to them on a range of international treaties— Kyoto of course being one example and the International Criminal Court, which was referred to earlier in this chamber, being another. If they do not comply with what the powerful nations want, clearly they are deficient.
We also see in the letter from our Prime Minister, John Howard, that he wants us to focus on Iraq's refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions. This is something that the international community has needed to do, and some elements of the international community have now been doing it for some time. Their push to have Iraq comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions has been hindered in recent months because of the warmongering talk we have heard from George Bush, Mr Downer, Mr Howard and, of course, Tony Blair in England. Whilst ever those nations continue to articulate a view that they would like to invade Iraq, whether or not it is UN supported, whether or not UN weapons inspectors are admitted into Iraq, it becomes less and less likely that we will have the opportunity for those UN weapons inspectors to be admitted into Iraq and for the international community to determine once and for all whether indeed there is evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
We also saw on the weekend the release of a 33-page document from George Bush—his National Security Strategy. I can say that I am certainly not feeling any safer having this doctrine out there on the international stage to be discussed. On a range of issues, it reads to me like a blueprint for global domination by the United States. Indeed, it goes through the way in which they would like to ensure that no other nation around the globe is able to develop the capacity to compete with them, let alone get even on weapons of mass destruction or the military arsenal which the United States commands. It then goes further than that to talk about the way in which the United States agenda of trade liberalisation and the free trade agenda are going to lift millions of people around the globe out of poverty. It goes further in talking about the ways in which it is winning freedoms for the people of the world by pushing on with the ideological agenda shared by this government about free trade and trade liberalisation.  
The Greens are extremely concerned to have this response from our Prime Minister with regard to what is such a serious issue. Indeed, during the last few weeks when we have had limited opportunities for debate about Australia's potential involvement in an invasion of Iraq, it has been disappointing to see that we have not had more robust debate, we have not had more comments and more people coming forward articulating their concerns and the concerns of the Australian people with regard to any future invasion of Iraq. We understand that a range of political parties in this place have been equivocating and looking at what will be their decision with regard to any future invasion. We welcome calls from backbenchers for them to be allowed a conscience vote. Clearly the Australian Greens do not need a conscience vote on this issue—our conscience is quite clear—and we have been unequivocal and continue to be unequivocal in our opposition to Australian involvement in Iraq. We would like people here to have the opportunity to listen to the electorate and to listen to the people who are contacting them and saying, `We do not want Australian troops involved in any invasion of Iraq.' The Greens will continue in this place and in the community to articulate our opposition to a war on Iraq. Quite clearly this is not about Saddam Hussein, UN resolutions or September 11; it is about the United States— (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-09-25,"—Earlier today, I made a few brief remarks in the committee stage and I will only be a minute or two before we get to the specifics of the Democrat amendments. The three brief points I was making when I was speaking earlier were that the Workplace Relations Act already contains provisions which enable the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order a secret ballot on industrial action or on any other issue in an industrial dispute. In fact, a ministerial discussion paper entitled Preindustrial action secret ballots, published in 1998, found that the commission had used its existing powers strategically to progress dispute resolution, particularly when the parties had reached a stand-off.
Secondly, and I think this is important in the context of this debate, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the other place, Mr Abbott, had sought to argue that the Beattie Labor government in Queensland has in some way lent its support to these provisions. This is utterly untrue. It is just nonsense. Earlier this year, in heated negotiations between Queensland nurses and the Queensland state government over an enterprise agreement, the Premier, Mr Beattie, publicly stated that his government was considering seeking a ballot on its offer, not whether industrial action should continue. This is a very important distinction that has not been made by the current minister and that is fairly typical of Mr Abbott. 
Thirdly, the minister, Mr Abbott, had sought to draw a false analogy between the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 and industrial laws in the United Kingdom. The UK legislation, while being unnecessarily complex and a source of extensive litigation—again, the lawyers make a feast of this type of legislation, and we know there are plenty of them on the government side—is a model of simplicity compared to this bill that the government is advocating here. The closest analogy with this bill is the Liberal Court government's laws in Western Australia, which were a complete failure.
Labor does not believe the bill has anything to do with democracy; it has everything to do with bureaucracy. It is taking up the government's line about intervention, bureaucracy and straitjackets. If ever there is a bill that represents those sorts of themes it is this particular legislation, drowning employees, unions and employers in paperwork. For those reasons, we are very sceptical and will not be supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1,speech

The Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 has at its heart the requirement for the conduct of a secret ballot among employees as a prerequisite for taking legal protected action during enterprise bargaining. Similar provisions were included in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 and again in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2000. The provisions in the bill are additional to those that already exist in the Workplace Relations Act.
One of the assumptions that lie behind this approach is that there is intimidation present and that secret ballots would prevent intimidation. I say that it is one of the assumptions—not necessarily held by those who are close to this issue—because yesterday Senator Macdonald, as duty minister on behalf of the coalition, made some remarks and interjections which indicated that he had that view. At the hearings into the bill, which was one of five bills considered by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee in May 2002, clearly some witnesses believed that coercion of at least some employees occurs, or that some employees perceive that they are under pressure to vote in a certain way in the event of an attendance vote on industrial action. Frankly, that is possible. If, in this chamber, everybody were allowed a secret vote on every single bill, you would probably find the outcomes a little different from what they are as a result of party discipline and pressure. But that is not the same as intimidation; that is what might be referred to as peer pressure. There is no indication, no evidence, that intimidation is usual or common in industrial matters. Obviously, if at all possible such coercion should be prevented where it exists, but the department advised the committee that this was not the prime purpose of the bill, and that is the important thing. In his evidence, Mr Smythe said:
I do not think the legislation is predicated on the premise that there is intimidation and therefore there must be secret ballots. As you have acknowledged, it is not impossible that there may be intimidation, but I think the simple proposition is, as Mr Anderson said—
Mr Anderson being another member of the department—
that the principle of democracy can be most readily guaranteed by a secret ballot process.
That is something that we all except. I do not know anybody who does not accept that proposition: a secret ballot can indeed most readily guarantee the principle of democracy. The bill is directed at secret ballots prior to protected action being taken, with consequent disputation occurring. As outlined earlier in my remarks on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002, disputation may well be more common as a result of unprotected action. It is not something that is commonly recognised in the broader business community or indeed in the community at large. It is unprotected action which often results in damaging strikes and industrial action, not protected action. This bill attends to protected action. 
In evidence to the committee, the department indicated that it had no data to separate days lost in protected action disputation from days lost in unprotected action disputation, although it was negotiating with the ABS to ascertain such data in the future. If the purpose of the bill is to encourage employees to take their time and be far more considered when calling strikes and taking other actions, the bill will be ineffectual if it is unprotected action strikes that occur.
At present, prestrike ballots are available to employees under section 136 of the act, and the commission can order secret ballots at its discretion under section 135. The mechanisms for such ballots are deliberately not prescribed in the act in detail except that they must be conducted in accordance with directions given by the commission. This discretion may be useful to retain. Certainly the provisions of sections 135 and 136 have been seldom used, perhaps suggesting that there may be little real demand from employers or employees for further access to secret ballots or perhaps because a strike or industrial action is more often taken in unprotected circumstances, so the employees would not be approaching the Industrial Relations Commission anyway. In relation to the provisions under sections 135 and 136, my statistics indicate that, of 30,000-plus applications for a bargaining period that have been made since 1997, only 12 orders for a secret ballot have been made, so there really is not a great demand.
There does not appear to be any criticism of the current methods that the Industrial Relations Commission uses to implement the conduct of a ballot in accordance with directions given by the commission. Their approach gives the Industrial Relations Commission powers to flexibly determine the mechanisms for the conduct of a ballot, rather than prescribe them step by step. The bill, in contrast, seeks to impose a fairly fixed approach in all examples of protected action, creating new administrative complexity, cost and, no doubt, legal argument. While exaggerated by some, potential for delays in the implementation exists. Unions have argued that the bill's real intent is to frustrate the timely exercise of employee democracy and to work to reduce, through the burden of administrative complexity, the level of industrial action taken around enterprise agreements. To that, the coalition argues that there are secret ballot provisions in the United Kingdom and other OECD countries that work perfectly well, and that is a fair point to make.
If we recognise that longstanding coalition policy is to require secret ballots for industrial action, particularly for strike action, and if we accept that that is an ideological approach as well as what they regard as a practical approach, we then have to look at the efficacy of the bill. The technical requirements are overly complex, prescriptive and onerous. The Democrats would oppose this bill in the event of our amendments not being successful.
So what do our amendments try to do? One of the things that I like about hearings is that you discover things you did not know. The first thing I discovered that I did not know was that the department itself did not know how many days had been lost in unprotected action. You cannot distinguish between days lost in protected industrial action and days lost in unprotected industrial action, which I hope you will remedy shortly. The second thing I discovered—and I really think I should have known better, having had this exacting job for over 6½ years—is that most unions, it turns out, do not have secret ballot provisions in their rules—quite an amazing outcome. So we have a situation currently where an employee or an employer can go to the commission and say, `I want a secret ballot,' and where the commission can order secret ballots; but we do not have a situation where a union member can say to their union, `I want a secret ballot.' I pursued this issue at the hearing, and I established that the union members concerned have absolutely no objection to the provision of secret ballot rules. I then pursued that further with the ACTU, and they too have no objection to it. 
So what have I sought to introduce here? I have sought to introduce two simple propositions. The first is that unions must have rules for secret ballots. If they do not have rules for secret ballots, the commission will develop model rules and provide them. The second proposition I have sought to put forward is that the commission may have circumstances in which it can pursue a ballot order. I will come to that, but let me deal with the union rules first. 
First, it is not my intention, through this legislation to dictate at all what those rules should be. Secondly, secret ballots for a union would be initiated on an entirely voluntary basis. In other words, a union member would be able to put up their hand and say, `I would like a secret ballot conducted in this circumstance.' The union would look at their rules and say, `We need 10 members to agree with you; where are the other nine?' The other nine would say, `We are here.' A ballot would occur according to the union rules. It is entirely voluntary; it is entirely at their request. I think that is a democratic provision which should be available to union members, and it is not. This law would simply say, `You have to have rules of that sort; develop them on your basis and in the way that suits your union.' That is one side of things. If people want me to explore the detail within the amendments, I can.
On page 4, proposed section 170NBBE states:
The Commission may grant an application for a ballot order, but must not grant the application unless it is satisfied that:
(a) any court, judicial inquiry or Royal Commission findings justify such an order; or
(b) any other particular and significant circumstances exist that mean such an order is appropriate.
What happens now is that the commission can be approached for a specific circumstance. What the government wants is to apply secret ballots across every circumstance, in every industry and on every occasion. That does not make sense; you should target it. If you have a situation where a particular union or a particular employer is bloody-minded and causing harm and problems which might mean that members involved in industrial action would be best served by the protection a secret ballot would provide, they should have that available. Firstly, this proposed section is a general, voluntary and open provision; and, secondly, it gives the commission further grounds on which they could order a so-called secret ballot. That is basically the framework.
In closing this debate—we are looking at amendments (1), (4), (6) and (8) together—I want to apologise to participants. The amendments were difficult to get together and I could not circulate them as early as I had wished, but I had signalled my intentions both in my second reading amendment and in my discussions with a number of people.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-09-25,"—The contribution by Senator Murray has been very constructive, as was his contribution to the debate on the previous bill that we considered this morning. The Australian Democrats and Senator Murray have made a strong attempt to bring a balance to the legislation that we are considering—in this case on industrial action. Industrial action is a serious matter. It causes dislocation to industry and to the public. Importantly for workers, industrial action leaves a hole in their pay packet. From experience and the knowledge that I have gained from conversations with individual workers and their representatives throughout the trade union movement, I know that industrial action is not undertaken lightly. We have a former Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, Senator Brian Harradine, in this place. He and I have talked about these issues over many years. From Senator Harradine's contribution as a former Secretary of the Trades and Labor Council in Tasmania, I know that industrial action is not entered into lightly by any group of workers, even when the action is lawfully protected action. 
A decision to go on strike is a serious decision; it is not a step that should be or is taken lightly. It is right that there are discussions, debate and a vote before workers take that step because the consequences of a strike are severe. Again, from my knowledge of and contact with workers and union officials, I know that that occurs. There is always a considerable debate—as robust a debate as would occur in parliament—when these actions are being considered. I do not have the statistics with me but if we look at the incidence of industrial disputation and strikes in this country over the last 20 years we will see that there has been a steady, significant decline in industrial action. However, in this parliament we have repeatedly heard the government tell all who will listen that they believe workers should be free to make their own decisions, free from outside interference or intrusion, bureaucracies, outside interventions and straitjackets. 
However, in this bill—and it has been debated extensively—there is the strong implication that workers are incapable of independent thought about whether they should participate in industrial action. There is the assumption by those opposite in the Liberal-National Party that the so-called union bosses—we hear this term all the time—say, `Strike,' and the members just follow blindly and walk out. That is simply not the case. In reality it does not happen. Workers can and do vote with their feet. The decision to participate in industrial action rests either with the workers or, in the case of a lockout, with the manager of the business and the manager alone. The so-called union bosses know that. The universal practice is for unions to call a meeting prior to workers deciding whether industrial action will occur. The meeting decides whether industrial action takes place.
As I said earlier, I know of no union official who would be powerful enough and, frankly, stupid enough to simply get up and say to workers, `Walk out,' without any debate, and tell them that they should strike because the union supposedly knows best. It simply does not happen. Labor says that it is appropriate to leave it to workers and their associations—unions—to determine how they make a decision to take a strike.
There are checks against coercion. Firstly, union membership is voluntary; workers need not be in a union in the first place. That is always a decision that workers in a union have to weigh up when they contemplate industrial action. Secondly, union members can—again, from my experience and knowledge—ignore a so-called union directive to go on strike if one is given. Thirdly, union members need not follow what a meeting decides—there is no compulsion to strike. Fourthly, a secret ballot can be ordered by the commission on the application of a small proportion of affected members under section 136 of the Workplace Relations Act.
Prior to coming to the chamber to take part in the debate I checked whether there has been any case before the commission where the commission has had to determine whether alleged coercion has taken place by union or non-union members in respect of industrial action. Apparently, there has not been any.
In these circumstances Labor will vote against the bill and against the Australian Democrats' amendments. We have given the matter a lot of thought. As I said earlier, we believe the Democrats—and Senator Murray in particular—have made a constructive and positive attempt to deal with the very difficult issues that are faced as a consequence of this Liberal government's legislation. The amendments do take the rigidity out of the bill, as well as the absurd requirement that there be a preindustrial action secret ballot even if no-one wants one. This Liberal-National Party government is foisting draconian interference—and that is all it can be described as—on workers and indirectly but quite clearly is slowing down the efficient enterprise bargaining process.
The Democrats' amendments are a positive step. A very significant amount of work has gone into them, and I acknowledge the contribution that Senator Murray has made to the debate on these amendments. Labor's position is that the amendments create a system that is unnecessary given the checks I referred to earlier. For that reason we will vote against them.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-09-25,"—I found that an extraordinary exercise in casuistry on the part of Senator Sherry because, whilst he made at least four attempts to say how statesmanlike Senator Murray's contribution had been, I kept waiting for his objection. Eventually we heard it: they did not want to create an unnecessary system, whatever that means. In other words, he is really conceding that Labor will not have a bar of anything that smacks of a secret ballot. 
—That is not right.
—It certainly is right. You trot out those lines about `incapable of independent thought'; you might as well say that about voting at general elections. This is the party that invented `show and tell'. And why did they do that? Because they do not trust people to vote in the right way. In fact, you get expelled from caucus, don't you, if you vote against something in the parliament that is contrary to the party line?
—What do you do?
—We don't. I don't know anything about it; sorry.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Order! Senator Carr, if you wish to interject, return to your place.
—It is worth pointing out the monumental hypocrisy of all these honeyed words that somehow have the veneer of reasonableness but disguise the very ugly fact that the unions are terrified of secret ballots, that they do not trust workers and that they are not prepared to allow them to have a view on a very important issue without telling the rest of the world about it. As we know, in the real world you can lean on people, you can send them to Coventry— you can do all sorts of things if you regard someone as a troublemaker. That is what the whole game is about; otherwise you would have no objection in principle to secret ballots. It just seems extraordinary to me.
Senator Sherry floated the complete red herring that no union official would ever insist on a ballot without a debate. Who is precluding prestrike debates? This bill does not do so. You can have endless debates about it; you can kick it around as much as you like. You can speak; you don't have to speak; you can listen to the arguments. All we are talking about here is the vote. And all we say is: what have you got to hide? Why are you so afraid of secret ballots? It is the antithesis of democracy.
—How do you select your front bench?
—On merit. I think sometimes you do, too; otherwise Senator Carr would have been there, through sheer brute force of numbers, some years ago.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-09-25,"—In rising to speak to the Democrats' amendments to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002, I would like briefly to address a couple of issues that I raised during my contribution to the second reading debate. As the bill presently stands, industrial action—that is, the right to strike—is available under the Workplace Relations Act to employers, unions and employees, but only where the parties are negotiating an enterprise bargaining agreement, referred to as a certified agreement under the act. The bill as it stands proposes to reduce the rights of workers to take genuine industrial action. Industrial action would only be protected if at least 40 per cent of the eligible voters participated in a ballot and if more than 50 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the proposed industrial action. This procedure would result in only a small number of employees in a secret ballot determining whether to take industrial action.
The bill is all about unions. It does nothing to address employer secret ballots of shareholders, nor does it address lockouts, where an employer refuses to allow its employees on the premises and does not allow them to work. Under the Workplace Relations Act, employees have a limited right to take industrial action and there is a right to lock out employees. This can lawfully occur only when bargaining for a certified agreement or when a workplace agreement is being negotiated. If the government is serious about this proposed amendment, then it should, in order to maintain a balanced position, require that employers be also subject to the same secret ballot provisions as workers. As the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association pointed out in its submission to the Senate committee considering the legislation:
It would appear that the Government believes that Chief Executive Officers of major corporations which may have large shareholders can effectively be a law unto themselves and be the decision maker for and on behalf of their constituents. 
That is, the shareholders. It also said:
It would appear that the Government takes the view that shareholders of corporations have no right to have a say in relation to such serious issues as the taking of protected industrial action by a corporation against its workers.
That is one of the areas where, if it is good enough to impose a condition on workers, then it is good enough to impose exactly the same condition on employers. That is one issue that this piece of legislation does not take into account.
I would also like to point out that the secret pre-strike ballots are already available under section 136 of the Workplace Relations Act when requested by employees. It is also possible under section 135 for the commission to order that a secret ballot be conducted if it considers that this would be helpful to resolve a dispute where industrial action is pending or to ascertain whether an agreement has been genuinely made. Another problem with the bill relates to the cost of the secret ballots. Section 170NBF would provide that the applicant for a ballot order is liable for the cost of holding the ballot. Under new subsection 170NBFA(1) the Industrial Registrar is required to determine the reasonable ballot costs. New section 170NBFA(2) provides that the Commonwealth will be liable to pay to the authorised ballot agent 80 per cent of the reasonable ballot costs. Through this bill, the government are attempting to prescribe secret ballots, and I believe that, if they are going to do that, it is their responsibility or the responsibility of any subsequent government to bear the cost of it.
If we look at a submission by the Australian Education Union—which was put to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee comments on over six or seven bills, but I will address the issues only relating to the secret ballots—they say:
The provisions of the Secret Ballots for Protected Action Bill, as they relate to the compilation of a Voting Roll, would delay the holding of a ballot by 6-8 weeks at large education employers ...
The rights given to employers to contest the holding of a ballot for industrial action will ensure that employers will easily be able to delay ballots ...
The Secret Ballots for Protected Action Bill will in some cases lead to more serious industrial action and will make industrial action harder to lift ...
The Australian Education Union goes on to say:
In summary, we urge the Committee to recommend the rejection of all the Amendment Bills in their entirety. They would further disadvantage workers, add confusion instead of clarity to tribunal and court proceedings, impact hardest on the least organised and most vulnerable sections of the workforce, and place cumbersome and expensive barriers in the path of workers and their organisations participating as equals in genuine enterprise bargaining.
I believe the unions represent something like 155,000 employees. There are teachers and teachers' aides and, in lots of private enterprises, there is a far greater range of members. So, when a union that represents such a substantive number of employees puts very clearly and succinctly the problems relating to this particular bill and urges the committee to recommend that all the bills in their entirety be opposed, it is very difficult to accept the position that the government is putting forward. The Democrats amendments are an attempt to rectify in some way the problems with this bill, but I believe the fact that the bill is so structurally flawed and one-sided leaves the senators in this place no option other than to also vote against the Democrats amendments; albeit they are an attempt to rectify some of the problems. I indicate that One Nation will not be supporting Senator Murray's amendments to the bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-09-25,"—With regard to what is proposed by Senator Murray's amendments, whilst I respect the effort that he has made, I am not able to support them. I think that the existing rules are more than adequate in respect of secret ballots. Just because the government says that something is wrong with current legislation it does not mean that there is anything wrong with it. Rather, in respect of trade union matters, it is likely that there is nothing wrong with it and it is all working perfectly well. But it is just that the government, because it is bent on disliking the trade union movement, seeks to change these things.  
As has been pointed out by a number of other senators in this chamber, workers do not take lightly any decision to involve themselves in industrial action. Those who have been involved in the trade union movement and who have represented workers know full well that it is certainly not an option that you take to workers in the first instance. Any recommendation made on the part of a trade union to take a course of industrial action is always done because there is no other course of action available. For those reasons, I put on the record that, whilst I respect Senator Murray's efforts and with regard to the other amendments that he has also moved that have been supported, I am not able to support what he is proposing here. I likewise am opposed to the bill per se. I will vote with the opposition when it is put to the vote.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-25,"—I have listened to the contributions made by the senators and, just in case it is unclear, the effect of my package of 10 amendments is to gut the bill so that the government's proposition would be rejected and to replace it with the one area in which secret ballots are deficient—namely, that unions presently do not have rules of their own which provide for secret ballots and which members can access. There are unions that do have those rules, but a substantial number do not. These amendments are simply an attempt to make sure that all unions have rules which members can access on a voluntary basis when they so choose.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I am pleased to speak on behalf of the opposition in relation to the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002. As long ago as 1991 the committee to review Commonwealth criminal law, headed by Sir Harry Gibbs, recommended that the Commonwealth's espionage offences, originally drafted on the eve of the First World War, be rewritten in a simpler form using modern language. Following the 1999 Wispelaere espionage case, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Bill Blick, was commissioned by the government to undertake a comprehensive review of security procedures. Mr Blick's report confirmed the need to update our espionage laws and impose tougher penalties on those who choose to break these laws.  
This is important legislation that deals with a fundamental aspect of our national security. The bill is designed to strengthen Australia's espionage laws and impose tougher penalties on those who break these laws. A somewhat different version of this bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 27 September last year. The bill was not debated, and lapsed when the parliament was dissolved for the November 2001 federal election. In addition to the espionage provisions, which I will mention in a moment, last year's version of the bill also transferred the official secrets provisions of part VII of the Crimes Act 1914 to chapter 5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. This aspect of the bill was heavily criticised for containing jail terms for secondary disclosure or whistleblowing in relation to non-national security matters, even when the information was disclosed or published on public interest grounds. Given the heavy criticism, the government dropped those provisions from the bill like a hot potato. The official secrets provisions applied well beyond situations involving national security. They would have made it illegal to leak or publish the information that led to the infamous telecard affair involving the equally infamous Mr Reith or even the information about travel rorts— the bread and butter of accountability in political debate. In the end, the government was forced to remove those elements of the bill.
The opposition believes Australia's response to the new security environment must be strong, effective and consistent with our democratic values and freedoms. In assessing the government's other security legislation, Labor has been guided by the desire to protect citizens from terrorist attacks and to protect our rights from the attacks of the Howard government. That is why we insisted on strong and principled amendments to the five antiterrorism bills, and it is why we do not support the draconian and unprecedented powers proposed in the ASIO bill. The opposition believes the bill before us will modernise and strengthen Australia's espionage laws. Now that the sweeping official secrets provisions have been removed and other minor amendments have been proposed, it can be said that the bill strikes the right balance. The bill transfers the offence of espionage from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code. The antiquated offences of harbouring spies, illegal use of uniforms and official permits and impersonation will disappear from the statute books.
A number of features of the bill are of note. First, by referring to conduct that may prejudice Australia's `security and defence', rather than its `safety and defence', and explicitly defining this term, the bill will give protection to material not protected under current laws. In particular, the term will include the operations, capabilities and technologies of, and methods and sources used by, the intelligence and security agencies. The type of activity that may constitute espionage will also be clarified. A person may be guilty of an espionage offence if they disclose information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence and do so intending to prejudice the Commonwealth's security or defence. They may also be guilty of an offence if they disclose information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence, without authorisation, to advantage the security or defence of another country. 
These provisions will capture the Wispelaere type situation where the information that is compromised does not necessarily prejudice Australia's security or defence. Maximum penalties range from seven years to 25 years imprisonment for the most serious espionage offences. Penalties in comparable countries for equivalent offences range from the death penalty in the United States to 14 years imprisonment in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. The bill also covers a range of other matters—including initiation of prosecutions, holding hearings in camera and forfeiture of articles—which were originally enacted in the Crimes Act.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee have considered the bill and their unanimous report was tabled on 10 May 2002. With the more controversial elements of the 2001 version of the bill having been excised by the government, the Senate committee raised four remaining issues of concern. The committee advised that, subject to their recommendations on these areas, the bill should proceed. The first area of concern identified by the committee is an element of the proposed offences relating to espionage involving communicating or making known information that `is or has been in the possession of the Commonwealth'. Essentially, questions were raised as to whether information both within the possession of the Commonwealth and in the broader public domain would still technically fall within the offence provisions. The Attorney-General's Department advised that the bill is not intended to inhibit the free flow of information in the public domain. However, given that this intention is not made clear either in the bill or in the explanatory memorandum, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to ensure that espionage provisions do not apply to the communication of information already in the public domain. 
The Senate committee also expressed concern as to whether the proposed offences would inadvertently cover government disclosure of protected information through lawful and official channels, such as under intelligence sharing agreements that Australia has with other countries—for example, with New Zealand or the United States of America. The Attorney-General's Department agreed that this was an unintended consequence of the bill's provisions. The committee accordingly recommended that the bill be amended to address the uncertainty arising from the term `disclose to another country or foreign organisation'. The Senate committee shared the concerns of the International Commission of Jurists that offences may be committed by a person who communicates information to another country not knowing that the information is in the possession of the Commonwealth. The committee recommended that the bill be amended so that an element of each offence is that a person knows that the information is or has been in the possession or control of the Commonwealth.
The other concern relates to the offence of illegal soundings. The Crimes Act contains an offence of communicating to any person outside of the Commonwealth hydrographic soundings of the sea surrounding Australia, and the bill proposed to translate that offence across into the Criminal Code. The 1991 Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law recommended that, because of the questionable need for the provision in light of technical and technological developments, the soundings offence should be repealed. The Senate committee took evidence about the unintended application of such an offence—for example, by foreign owned fishing vessels sending soundings information back to their country of origin and thereby committing an offence. The committee also raised concerns that, where the taking and recording of soundings is required under law, ships' masters were inadvertently potentially committing an offence. It is currently a requirement, for the safety of crews and ships that lie within Australian waters, to maintain an ongoing record of the sounding of the ships at all times. The committee therefore proposed that the current provisions relating to soundings be repealed and that the bill be amended to delete proposed division 92. The government introduced amendments to the bill that substantially give effect to recommendations of the Senate committee. The House of Representatives unanimously agreed to those amendments. The government has also agreed not to proceed with the soundings provisions contained in the bill. The government is not prepared to repeal the existing soundings provisions without further consideration of the commercial, navigational safety and security implications. In fact, the opposition does not demur from the government's approach.
As I indicated at the commencement of my remarks, this bill relates to fundamental aspects of our national security. The capacity of the Commonwealth to deter and thwart espionage is vital to our nation's defence. It is vital to our foreign relations. Indeed I think it is vital to our national wellbeing. We must have both a strong legislative framework and appropriate administrative measures to safeguard sensitive national security information held by government and, in some cases, by private firms such as defence contractors. At the same time we must also ensure that the pursuit of tighter security does not trample over the civil liberties and the privacy of citizens. In this regard, I note that on 25 June this year the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and the American Ambassador, Mr Schieffer, signed a new legally binding agreement governing the exchange of classified information between Australia and the United States. The General Security of Information Agreement replaces a 1962 pact between Australia and the United States and takes into account advances in information technology. In his press release of 25 June announcing the new security arrangement, the foreign minister, Mr Downer, indicated that it covers the appropriate protection and handling of classified information and includes: 
... a requirement that personnel accessing such information be security-cleared to an appropriate level.
The parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will presumably examine this new security agreement before it is allowed to enter into force. Effective parliamentary scrutiny will be especially important if the introduction of any new security clearance procedures is contemplated as a consequence of this agreement. In this regard, I note that in September last year the Attorney-General announced that, following the Blick security review, ASIO had agreed to undertake an internal and voluntary trial of polygraph tests to evaluate the potential of such technology as a personal security tool. I have always thought Mr Reith would be a very good person to start the polygraph tests with—he would probably blow the thing off the scale.
Polygraph tests have of course been employed for many years by United States intelligence agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. Such tests are indeed mandatory for US personnel having access to certain types of highly classified information. Some of this information is shared by the United States with Australia, and the new security agreement requires Australia to afford such information a degree of protection equivalent to that of the United States.
My colleague the shadow minister for justice and customs raised the issue of polygraph tests in the debate on this bill in the House of Representatives, but there has been no response from the government. It would be highly desirable for the Attorney-General to inform the parliament in general terms of the result of the ASIO polygraph trial and whether the government intends to proceed with mandatory polygraph tests in ASIO or elsewhere in our security and intelligence agencies.
The introduction of polygraph tests as a general security tool would be a significant development in our country's security arrangements. It is something that should not be pursued without very careful, indeed exhaustive, consideration of the administrative and legal implications. The opposition are pleased the government was forced by political and media pressure to remove the controversial official secrets provisions, and we are pleased that the government introduced amendments which give effect to the recommendations of the Senate committee.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-09-25,"—I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002. The Australian Democrats believe we have a consistent approach to issues of national security. We are strongly supportive of attempts to enhance Australia's security and the safety of Australian citizens. However, we firmly believe that civil liberties must not be unduly compromised in the name of national security. We are supportive of this legislation, as it will strengthen Australia's espionage laws.
This bill differs in some important respects from the bill that was originally introduced in the House of Representatives last year. That bill provoked significant and understandable concern in the community arising out of provisions that would have permitted the jailing of public interest whistleblowers. The government responded that the proposed laws did not change the substance of the existing official secrets provisions but simply modernised the language.
We Democrats are strong supporters of public interest whistleblowers. Those who speak out against corruption and impropriety deserve protection. Whistleblowing is often the only way that impropriety can be exposed. However, this can come at a significant personal and career cost to the whistleblower. The often justified fear of reprisal can stop potential whistleblowers from coming forward. As a result, corruption or improper conduct can continue unchecked. 
As it happens, we currently have a private senator's bill before a Senate committee that proposes comprehensive whistleblower protection. The existing level of protection for whistleblowers is absolutely inadequate. The Australian Democrats believe that the government has failed to address the issue of whistleblower protection. The report of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2001 [2002] is to be tabled this Thursday. It is my hope that the government will look at that report very closely, with a view to determining whether it is time to finally take action with regard to this issue.
Turning to the bill itself, I should start by saying that the existing espionage provisions in the Crimes Act are quite dated and it is appropriate that they be modernised. We support the increase in the maximum penalty for espionage from seven years to 25 years. The government advises that penalties in comparable jurisdictions for equivalent offences range from the death penalty in the US to 14 years imprisonment in the UK, Canada and New Zealand.
Espionage is an extremely serious offence and it should be treated as such. The damage that can be caused by espionage is sufficient to warrant a very severe maximum penalty. In the current security environment, it is vital that countries that share information with us can be confident that we will afford it appropriate protection. For that reason, we support the proposed protection of foreign-sourced information belonging to Australia.
A number of outdated provisions will be repealed by this legislation. These include provisions relating to harbouring spies, illegal use of uniforms, special powers of arrest without warrant and so on. The modernisation project is a welcome one and has the support of the Australian Democrats. This bill has changed in a number of respects since it was initially introduced in the House of Representatives. In the face of significant public concern, a number of provisions were removed from the bill. The bill was then referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. The committee identified a number of problems with the bill, to which the government responded with amendments. I think it is appropriate that the government has taken on board reasonable objections and made changes accordingly. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, stated:
The government is committed to protecting Australia's national security and punishing those who threaten Australia's interests. That is the purpose of the bill. It is not aimed at hampering or preventing public discussion.
...	...	...
The espionage provisions send a clear message to those who choose to betray Australia's security that this government regards espionage very seriously. 
That is a sentiment supported by the Australian Democrats and, consequently, we will be supporting this legislation.
It has been mentioned in part that part of the reason for bringing about these changes and this legislation related to what has been called the `Wispelaere case' in relation to Mr Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, and I would like to make a few comments about him and his case. According to a press release of 18 May 1999, the Attorney-General said that Mr Wispelaere was arrested at Dulles Airport, Washington, on 15 May 1999 and charged with attempted espionage. His arrest followed a joint investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. When he appeared in court a couple of days later, he is alleged to have made unauthorised disclosure of US intelligence material.
Mr Wispelaere, a Canadian-born Australian citizen, had worked for the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation between 13 July 1988 and 12 January 1999, reportedly as an analyst of American spy satellite photographs. After leaving the DIO, he went to Bangkok where he attempted to sell hundreds of top secret documents to an unidentified foreign embassy. The US was informed by the embassy involved and an FBI sting operation lured him to the US where he was arrested. 
Following Mr Wispelaere's arrest, the Attorney-General requested an inquiry into the circumstances of the case and advice on additional measures which might be necessary to strengthen the protection of classified material. The report by Mr Bill Blick, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, recommended more stringent vetting of staff and strengthened security procedures. The 2001-02 budget included an extra $12 million over four years to enable ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department to undertake security improvements in line with the Blick report.
Mr Wispelaere was judged not fit to stand trial in January 2001, after treatment for mental illness. He has blamed Australian intelligence services for not questioning his behaviour and he asked to be extradited back here to Australia to face charges. This request was rejected by the Australian government. Mr Wispelaere pleaded guilty in March 2001 and was sentenced to 15 years jail in June 2001. He has agreed to cooperate with the US and Australian intelligence agencies. In June 2001, his father was reported to be considering suing the Australian government for negligently giving his son a security clearance without recognising his schizophrenia and addiction to steroids. US prosecutors have agreed to allow Mr Wispelaere to serve the last five years of his 15-year sentence in Australia if a prisoner transfer treaty is in effect by that time. When we get to the committee stage of the bill, I would like to explore some of those issues further with the minister. But the bill in general has our support.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-09-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to take note of the report of 2001-02 on the operation of the Aged Care Act 1997. As most members would be aware, this act forms the basis of the structural reform package introduced by this government in 1996-97. The report outlines that there are over 172,000 operational places and in 2001-02 there were over 7,000 new residential places. Given that the report outlines these facts, one would expect that this rosy picture painted by the report means that aged care in Australia is excellent. All these extra places and new schemes, like the community aged care packages, should have resulted in a golden age descending on the retirements of older Australians. If that is the government view, I would like to be able to share their rose coloured view of the situation. 
However, in my view the report fails to make mention of the way in which these places are allocated across the country. It fails to mention the disruption to the lives of older Australians when the facility they are resident in closes. It fails to talk about the loss of experienced and skilled aged care workers when a facility closes. This report in particular provides cold comfort to the residents and staff of the Geraldton RSL War Veterans' Home in Western Australia that closed in August of this year. The report does not mention that the 15 staff that worked at that facility are now working outside the aged care industry, and this is an industry that has massive shortages of skilled staff. It does not talk about the disruption to residents; it merely mentions that they can now access a community aged care package instead. I trust the report is at least accurate about the provision of those new services.
Although the report talks at length about the extra support for people in rural and regional Australia, we see that a facility in Geraldton has now closed. Geraldton is a large regional centre in Western Australia and it is not that isolated. It is only some five to six hours drive from Perth, and it has lost an aged care facility. Instead, from this report, we are told that there is a new Internet web site. I am sure that we all know in this place that the Internet, although it is a very useful communication tool for most of us, is not that widely used by older Australians. Instead of extra nursing home beds and secure accommodation facilities for some of the older residents of Geraldton, they now have an Internet site that can help them. Is there anything more ludicrous than the minister and his department coming up with a solution to provide information to a target group than to use a medium not widely used by that target group? 
But do not worry, because the report goes on to inform us that there are 90 access points around rural and regional Australia that have free phones. What happens if an older Australian does not have access to the Internet or has difficulty in reaching one of these access points? On that matter, the report and, indeed, the entire government are silent. Older Australians need to be aware that this government is adopting, slowly but surely, a new strategy when it comes to dealing with our aging population. With the increase in the age of our population and a falling birthrate that has been a matter of much debate, it would seem that the Minister for Employment Services has let slip the government's new policy. Instead of providing income security for our older Australians and secure accommodation for those who are in need and do not have family support, he thinks that the strategy should be to raise the retirement age. Apparently that is the government's new answer. It seems that ultimately this government wants to solve any future problems with aged care by making all of us work until the day we die. They hope that at that point aged care will become a non-issue.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-09-25,"—I rise to speak on the issues of obesity, diabetes and fast food in Australia and to say that Australians are getting fatter. Fifty-five per cent of Australians are overweight or obese, and childhood obesity has nearly trebled in the last 10 years. Obesity leads to diabetes, heart disease, cancer and the vicious circle of a sedentary lifestyle. We have seriously unhealthy habits and refuse to change. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently released a paper noting that 7.5 million Australians over the age of 25 years are overweight or obese and that there has been a significant increase in the proportions of overweight or obese Australians over the last 20 years. Recent analysis of data from the 1995 survey showed that 19 to 23 per cent of Australian children aged two to eight years are overweight or obese, depending on age. The number of overweight and obese children aged 7 to 15 years almost doubled between 1985 and 1995. In 1985, 10.7 per cent of boys and 11.8 of girls were overweight or obese while, in 1995, 20 per cent of boys and 21.5 per cent of girls were overweight or obese.
In May this year, the Hon. Larry Anthony MP, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, released the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report, Australia's children: their health and wellbeing 2002. He advised:
The report shows:
24 per cent of children aged 12-14 years had consumed alcohol in the week prior to the survey;
29 per cent of boys and 23 per cent of girls aged 12-15 years have taken an illicit drug at least once;
15 per cent of boys and 14.4 per cent of girls aged 4-12 years have a number of emotional and/or behavioural problems; and,
Death rates for indigenous infants were three times higher than for other Australian children.
He said:
Childhood obesity is getting worse. While most children aged 2-14 are of an acceptable weight, 18 per cent of boys and 22 per cent of girls are overweight or obese.
This is totally unacceptable and parents have a responsibility to ensure their children have a well balanced diet and regular exercise. Not only will overweight and obese children have serious health concerns later in life, they may not be able to fully participate economically and socially.
I congratulate the Hon. Larry Anthony on his comments, on the release of that report and on his efforts to highlight these concerns and problems for all Australians; not just Australian children, but Australian families. 
Tomorrow or the day after, a study will be released with regard to the cost of diabetes in Australia. I predict that it will be a very significant cost in terms of this particular epidemic. Diabetes affects one million Australians. Five hundred thousand people are actually diagnosed with diabetes, and a further 500,000 are undiagnosed with type 2 diabetes. About 100,000 of the million Australians with diabetes have type 1, or insulin dependent, diabetes. If those who are undiagnosed are not found, they are likely to have very serious complications affecting their health at a much earlier age than is necessary. These complications include kidney problems, eyesight problems, amputation problems and a whole range of health problems that are very serious indeed. This particular study will highlight the cost. It is the first major study in this area that has been undertaken. I hope that it really jerks Australians into gear in terms of highlighting the importance and adverse effects of this disease on the Australian community and the need to identify the one in two Australians who have diabetes but do not know it. It is a problem, and we need to do something about it.
In regard to the health problems caused by fast food and obesity, I attended a conference in the USA in June and I also attended the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, which is the largest research institution for diabetes in the world, and I learnt a number of things. Like our American cousins, nearly half of all Australian deaths are preventable or can be postponed by effective public health practices. That is a staggering figure and I was quite shocked when I learnt it at the conference put on by the Harvard School of Public Health. What are we doing about it in Australia? Not much. What can we do? In terms of fast food companies, I believe they could become the tobacco companies of tomorrow. They need health warnings on junk food packaging which highlight the medical and lifestyle risks of excessive consumption otherwise advertising and marketing that encourages poor lifestyle habits will eventually be at risk of litigation. I am suggesting to these corporate giants that pre-emptive action is the best way to avoid future litigation and poor health outcomes.
We all enjoy the food that we eat. Even so, corporate interests should not be encouraging people, and particularly children, to be enslaved by their biological instincts. As an intelligent species, we can use knowledge obtained by scientists and nutritionists to enhance our lives and lengthen our life expectancy. We have been sucked into this vortex in the 21st century where we have videos, computers and the Internet and are getting sucked into a sedentary lifestyle. When I was in primary school, there was a regular exercise regime. Unfortunately many schools in Australia today do not have such a regime. We are focused on an academic outcome at the expense of a good healthy lifestyle. That is a cause for concern. We are not nurturing the education of our children, who are forced daily to choose from a smorgasbord in many cases of junk food and tuck shop treats regardless of the interests of their immediate nutrition or even their long-term health. Rather than receiving any encouragement to eat a healthy balance of foods, it appears that our children's growing social ability to purchase foods for themselves and to influence parents' purchases are instead being exploited by corporate food interests using aggressive advertising strategies.
Lessons have been learnt and are being learnt from overseas. I draw the Senate's attention to two lessons in particular. In France, McDonald's is advertising the message: `Don't eat too much of our food.' In the US, the fast food companies have joined together in supporting a multimillion education campaign saying: `Eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly.' I congratulate them on such a public education campaign. It makes sense. It is a good message for our children and for us. Fast food companies should embark on a public education campaign like that in Australia. Primarily it should highlight the benefits of a balanced diet and regular exercise as well as highlighting the dangers of excessive consumption of their product. After all, such a lifestyle is the single most effective preventative health measure that a person can take. The campaign should also actively inform the public of both the nutritional value of the food as well as the long-term health risks of eating such food on a day-by-day basis. 
Is there any risk in eating fast food? You had better believe it. Ralph Nader, the US consumer advocate, called the McDonald's double cheeseburger a `weapon of mass destruction'. If this seems a bit over the top, perhaps we should look at the nutritional information on these types of products. A Harvard University study has demonstrated a link between diet, exercise and cancer. A minimal amount of walking and eating 25 grams of fibre a day can significantly reduce a cancer risk. We ignore that advice at our own peril. Nearly one in four children aged 10 to 14 are either overweight or obese already, as I have mentioned earlier. The future health of these children looks grim. Not only should Australians recognise that children's bodies are still developing but also that lifelong habits are formed in early years.
The intake of salt, excessive sugar, fat and additives such as caffeine and MSG are all directly responsible for many chronic and untreatable diseases. Nutritionists and doctors know it; fast food chains and processors know it. And lawyers know it. Those whose advertising and marketing encourages poor lifestyle habits are at risk of litigation. Future litigants will attempt to demonstrate negligence on the part of the food producer or retailer in knowingly selling a product that carries health risks, especially where those products were marketed as a day-to-day lifestyle food. The whole of our society, including children, have the right to know both the contents of our food purchases and the likely effect that consumption will have on the body. Society demands no less transparency and accountability from its professionals, politicians and public servants.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-09-25,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice:
(a) and (b) CASA has received two Confidential Aviation Incident Reports (CAIR) forwarded from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The reports, dated 28 September 2000 and 4 December 2001, were received by CASA on 29 September 2000 and 7 December 2001 respectively.
(c) CASA responded to the report dated 28 September 2000 and advised that the issue has been raised with the Company's Chief Pilot during a scheduled audit. However, the evidence obtained was inconclusive regarding the matters raised in the CAIR report and it could not be positively established that a true breach of Civil Aviation Order 48 had occurred.
CASA further advised that the Chief pilot was counselled by a CASA Flying Operations Inspector on the issue raised and that future CASA audits would examine compliance in this area. 
CASA responded to the report dated 4 December 2001 and advised that the matter would be considered as part of a scheduled audit of the company planned for February 2002.
Following the conduct of this audit, no significant safety concerns were identified associated with the operator's fatigue management arrangements. ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: BAe 146 Aircraft</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,28,1,answer
