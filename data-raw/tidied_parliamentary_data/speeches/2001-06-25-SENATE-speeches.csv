"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-06-25,"—The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 demonstrates just how this federal government has mismanaged the deregulation of Australia's dairy industry. This bill is an admission of failure by the federal government. I take the Senate back to the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the deregulation of the Australian dairy industry, which was tabled in the Senate in October 1999. That report was a detailed analysis of the impending deregulation of the dairy industry and the serious issues that confronted the dairy industry at that time. It was a unanimous report. In almost 200 pages, the report detailed the various problems confronting the dairy industry at that time and the consequences for the dairy industry in particular regions and particular states if deregulation were not managed in a coordinated and timely manner.
The report particularly highlighted the likely devastating impact that deregulation would have on dairy farmers and their communities and regions in New South Wales and Queensland. In the preparation of that report, the committee had the opportunity to examine the package that was then being structured and negotiated by the dairy industry with the Commonwealth government in order to prepare the industry for deregulation in July 2000. Because the committee had the opportunity to look at that package, it was able to highlight some of the inadequacies of the package at that time. For instance, it pointed to the problems that would occur in cooperatives. It highlighted the fact that, whilst the package, as it was then being developed, would provide assistance to dairy farmers or those receiving income from milk production, there was nothing in the package to deal with structural adjustment issues and the particular consequences for communities and regions in which the dairy industry was curtailed or, indeed, disappeared.
The report highlighted the particular need for the federal government to take the lead in a coordinated approach involving the states and the industry. That report put the government on notice that deregulation of the dairy industry could and would have devastating effects if not handled properly. Unfortunately, the government did not listen. The government sat back and washed its hands of the problem. It said that this was not an issue for the federal government but an issue for the states because the states issued milk quotas or regulated the industry.
The federal government's attitude was that it had nothing to do with deregulation. The federal government's only proposal was to threaten the states and the industry by saying that, if the industry and the government ultimately developed and agreed upon a package, that package would not apply unless every single state signed up to it. So the states and the industry effectively had a gun at their heads: they could have deregulation with no package or deregulation with an assistance package but only if every single state signed up. There was no attempt to bring all the parties together to work through the problem. Rather, it was a stand-and-deliver situation. That detailed report, tabled in October 1999, was not responded to until 12 or 15 months later.
—It got three paragraphs.
—As Senator Woodley states—and I was going to point this out, as I have on a number of occasions—the government's response to a 200-page unanimous detailed report was two large paragraphs and one three-line paragraph—that is, it was three paragraphs. That was an insult to the committee, the Senate and the industry. All that government response said was that we have implemented a package; we have passed legislation to impose a levy on consumers to fund a package. Therefore, they did not think they had to do anything else.
That brings me to the legislation that was passed last year: the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000. That legislation implemented the amended package that had been initially developed by the industry. I say `amended' because the significant amendment to the package that was made during the negotiations between the industry and the federal government was that it went from $1.25 billion worth of assistance to $1.85 billion worth of assistance, in round figures. The extra $500 million or so was not extra assistance to the industry; it was actually tax revenue that went back to the government. So the government said, `We will have a package for the industry, but only if it is taxed when it is received by the farmers.' That meant consumers, who were to pay an 11c levy on the retail price of milk in order to fund the package, had to pay that levy for a longer period of time—now up to eight years—in order for the government to claw back $500 million in tax. They are the big winner out of this package, which is funded by a new tax introduced by a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who said they would never ever introduce new taxes and that they would never increase taxes. They introduced this levy to assist dairy farmers but in the process will pick up $500 million for themselves.
The committee had the opportunity to look at the legislation. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee issued a report into the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill. In our supplementary comments, Senator O'Brien and I drew attention to some of the concerns we had. Firstly, we drew attention to the fact that the legislation at that time had been hurriedly introduced in order to meet the deadline date of 1 July 2000. We stated in that report:
1.6	It is the view of the Opposition that the committee has not been able to properly consider the effectiveness of the scheme in achieving its stated objective.
1.7	However, the Opposition has agreed to the Government's timetable only because to extend the time for consideration of the Bills may well put a significant financial burden on the majority of industry participants at a time when the industry will already be under financial pressure from further deregulation.
We went on and said:
1.8	The Opposition considers that the fairness and effectiveness of the scheme may well be compromised by the haste with which the Parliament is being asked to progress the legislation.
1.9	The Government has already been forced to move a number of amendments to deal with unforseen problems with the Bills and the Opposition believes further amendments may be required.
1.10	While there is broad industry acceptance of the restructuring package, and the industry should be commended for advancing the process to this point with little Government support, a number of issues of concern have been raised during the committee inquiry.
We went on to point to some of those issues of concern, such as the problem with respect to lessors, who may not be dealt with in an equitable manner under the proposed package. We put it on the record fairly and squarely at that time that the government—having dropped the ball or not even bothered to pick up the ball—had sat on its hands and done nothing for a number of months, other than say to the industry, `We will support your package, providing: (1) it's taxable and (2) all the states are prepared to sign up.' It then proceeded to introduce at the eleventh hour legislation to impose the levy in order to fund that package. It was done in haste, and it was clear that problems were going to eventuate.
That assistance package was predicated on a prediction that the farm gate price for milk would fall by somewhere between 8c and 15c per litre. Yet the government had been warned in evidence from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics that prices could fall by as much as 25c a litre—somewhere between two and three times the fall the government predicted. The government's own think tank research organisation, ABARE, said it could fall by up to 25c a litre. The government ignored that. What happened? ABARE was right. Milk prices for farmers fell in particular parts of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, by as much as 25c a litre. Even with the assistance package that had been implemented, which the consumers were paying for through a levy, it was not enough to cover the gap between the farmers' incomes before deregulation and after deregulation.
That is why we have this assistance package before the parliament today: the government got it wrong. They got it wrong because they ignored the advice of ABARE. At the time, they said, `No, we've got to get this legislation through the parliament in order to ensure that payments will start to flow to dairy farmers.' We cooperated and the Democrats cooperated in getting the legislation through, but we put the government on notice that problems could eventuate because they had not thought it through and they had done it all in haste.
What else happened? There were substantial delays in payments. Even though payments were supposed to flow around August or September, some farmers still had not received a first payment till the end of last year. They were coping with substantially reduced incomes, but they were not receiving the assistance that the package was supposed to deliver. Communities and regions were hard hit, as we know. Then, unfortunately, some regions in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland actually copped floods on top of everything else. It really was a terrible Christmas and New Year for many of those dairy farmers.
What was the government's response to this? They sat and said, `Look, the package is in place; we do not have to do any more. Look at the great thing we have done: we have delivered the greatest assistance package ever in the history of this country—$1.9 billion.' That is what Minister Truss said he was delivering to the industry. He delivered nothing to the industry. It was simply a new tax to raise funds to pay assistance to farmers and it was developed primarily by the industry in the first place. That is why, when the government and minister continue to say that the federal government have done their bit and the states should pick up their share, they are actually engaging in a false argument.
All the government have done is implement a levy to raise funds from the consumers in New South Wales, Queensland and every other state to pay this assistance package. Not one cent has come out of the budget for dairy farmers, yet the government have the hide to turn to the states and say, `We are providing funds; you should do it as well.' It is the taxpayers in those states that are paying for the funds for the assistance package in the first place. We have reached a situation where the government engaged ABARE earlier this year to look at how serious the problems were. ABARE told them in their report that the industry was facing serious problems, notwithstanding the assistance package having been implemented. That report was released in January.
The government has now been forced to act again. It brings in this new bill, the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001. This bill has three key components. Firstly, there is $100 million for additional adjustment payments to producers who earned more than 35 per cent of their income from market milk before deregulation; secondly, there is $20 million for discretionary payments; and, thirdly, there is an extra $20 million to go into the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program. I want to comment about that. It was at the eleventh hour, when the first legislation was passed last year, that the government finally accepted the calls from the opposition for the granting of funds to regions in particular to assist with the problems, and it instituted the program called Dairy RAP.
Where did some of those payments go? They were supposed to go to assist the dairy industry and the communities suffering from the effects on the dairy industry. But in one case $220,000 went to a polocrosse field and equestrian centre in Beaudesert in Queensland, while in another case $55,000 of dairy regional assistance package funds went to a wine appreciation course at Ipswich Grammar School. This is an absolute joke. Not so long ago, $1.5 million was announced by the Prime Minister—not by the minister for agriculture—for a meatworks in the electorate of the minister for agriculture. Talk about pork-barrelling—except in this case it might be called milk-barrelling. The scheme has been mismanaged and has clearly been used but not to assist dairy farmers.
There is a lot more that I can say. I am sure we are going to get time during the committee stage to debate this bill further. I just want to make a couple of comments in conclusion. Firstly, the committee has had the opportunity, though briefly, to look at this legislation. It seems that we are spending a lot of time looking at the government's attempts to fix up its own mistakes in the dairy industry. As we highlighted in our supplementary comments from the opposition in the report, we have firstly noted that once again we are faced with legislation being introduced into this parliament in haste, where we have had very little time to properly examine it.
The government has known about this problem and issue for months and months, yet the committee was given the legislation only about two weeks ago. We only had a couple of days in which to have a public hearing and then try and report back to this parliament. We did our level best to meet that timetable. We brought down a report, after an extensive public hearing, within a matter of a week. We are here today to deal with this legislation because, if the further supplementary assistance is to be paid to farmers, it has to be dealt with this week. We will cooperate with that. But we believe there still are some major deficiencies in the legislation. They are again brought about by the slack attitude of this minister and this government when it comes to dealing with these issues.
One of the particular issues that we want to focus on is the fact that many dairy farmers who relied on market milk for a significant proportion of their income will not have access to the supplementary market milk payment. Therefore, the 35 per cent threshold should be reviewed. We have proposed an amendment, which has been circulated, which will extend the payment under that additional assistance payment to more farmers that have been affected seriously by deregulation and by this government's unfortunate mismanagement of the entire exercise. There will be much more to say when it comes to the committee stage. We will ultimately be supporting the legislation, but on the basis that there will need to be some improvements to it to recognise the harsh realities and problems that dairy farmers face as a result of this government's mismanagement.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-06-25,"—I want to agree with most of what the previous speaker has said. However, I want to begin the debate a little further back in time because the problems that the dairy industry is facing, and has faced, did not begin with this legislation. They began with the coalition and the Labor Party giving in to the commercial forces in Victoria which they said made deregulation inevitable. The Democrats have never accepted that deregulation was inevitable. We have said on many occasions that it was only inevitable because there was not the political will to ensure that those commercial forces could be resisted. 
Let us be sure in describing those political forces, because very often generalisation is used rather than specifics when we refer to the dairy industry in Victoria as driving deregulation. In fact, a few large producers drove deregulation. Many producers were absolutely confused by the whole process and some producers were absolutely opposed, as were the Democrats, to deregulation. However, the main driving force for deregulation came not from farmers but from processors, particularly from Bonlac and Murray Goulburn. The Senate report in 1999 made it very clear that processors were driving deregulation and that those same processors, through deregulation, would destroy the very industry on which they depended. I want to begin the debate at that point to make sure that the chamber and anyone listening to this debate are quite clear that we are here not simply because the original legislation was flawed—and it was—but because we proceeded to deregulate an industry which did not need deregulation and which has suffered incredibly because deregulation went ahead. 
When we debated the original legislation, I predicted that we would be back in the Senate within 12 months because the legislation was flawed. It was quite clear that it was not going to meet the needs of everybody and that a significant number of people would be disadvantaged rather than advantaged by the legislation. My prediction was slightly out. It is a little over 12 months since we debated the legislation on the last occasion, but it is near enough to 12 months. We have had to come back. The original legislation was flawed and it was rushed through, and we are now having to fix it up. When we debated the  original legislation in committee, I said:
I just do not think it is good enough that, if we discover problems along the road, the government might look at this issue. I want some commitment from the government that there is a process that will enable that to happen. 
I then went on to talk about the people who I was sure, at that point in time, would be disadvantaged. Unfortunately, the government did not put in place a process which was at all useful, and we have had to come back and amend the bill through the debate and the legislation before us today.
Even more importantly than that, the problem is not that we have had to move amendments but that we could have put in place a proper appeals mechanism. That would have enabled us to deal, outside this chamber and through the Dairy Adjustment Authority, with the problems that people encountered. However, the legislation, and later the guidelines in particular, were so restrictive that the anomalies which have been encountered could not be dealt with through the Dairy Adjustment Authority and we have had to bring back these amendments.
When we have further guidelines, which will be available to extend the legislation, I appeal to the government to ensure that those guidelines will not again be so restrictive that we will not be able to pick up the people who the government is saying it wants to help. It is very important that we do that. Again, when we last debated this legislation in committee, I said:
The second point is that, if we use the processes of appeal, tribunals or whatever to solve this problem, what we are really saying to these people is, `The only recourse you are going to have will be a long, expensive and legal one.' I do not think that is good enough. It has been shown very clearly—at least to the rural and regional affairs committee when it met—that there is a significant problem. I believe that we ought to be getting from the government a proper process for resolving that problem. 
One of the problems, of course, was the situation of lessees and lessors. That has developed into a very vexed question. It was clear to the committee that it would be a problem, and yet the government did not put in place an appeals mechanism which would have allowed the Dairy Adjustment Authority to deal with that particular problem. So let us very clearly say that, having passed these amendments—as we will this week—let us not have again the situation where, because of restrictive appeals guidelines, we discover that we are still not able to assist those people for whom the anomalies have been thrown up, although there is no doubt that they have a just claim and a just cause, but, because of the restrictive guidelines, that cause cannot be finalised to their benefit.
Let me say in support of the government that the amendments certainly are needed and they will be beneficial. The outstanding question is whether they will be sufficiently flexible to achieve what the government says it wants to achieve. Several amendments will enable the government to achieve its objective, and I hope that the government will see the logic of those amendments and will support them. That will enable it to deliver what the rhetoric has said should be delivered.
—Are you going to mention the state governments?
—I certainly am—that comes very shortly, Senator McGauran. Thank you for reminding me of that.
—I gave you the lead.
—That is good. This amendment bill picks up a number of dairy farmers who were severely disadvantaged under the entitlements accessed by other dairy farmers through the original Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. Now I come to Senator McGauran's point: this includes those farmers in the quota states of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia who have not received any compensation for the loss of quotas, even though those quotas were real property that had been bought and sold prior to legislation. Certainly in Western Australia, and perhaps in other quota states, the sale of quotas attracted stamp duty. State governments actually recognised that they were real property, and that stamp duty was a gain for those state governments. But, apart from Western Australia, which has done something, other states, particularly New South Wales and Queensland, have refused to recognise their responsibility to compensate people whose real property was destroyed. Those states have received millions of dollars through the National Competition Council payments, and part of those payments was for dairy deregulation. There is a clear obligation on the states of Queensland and New South Wales, and a part obligation still on the state of Western Australia, to come good on those payments and to direct a portion of those payments to dairy farmers who have lost quota. I am very clear about that: this bill does not remove the obligation on those states to come up with compensation for those farmers.
Another problem is that some farmers who were lessors received very little under the DSAP payments while the lessees received the bulk of the entitlement. Many lessees walked off the farms, broke their contracts, and left the owners in great difficulty and unable to find new lessees for their properties. In evidence at the hearing on this legislation—it was subsequently supported by written documentation—we were told that that represents about 70 per cent of farmers who had contracts between lessor and lessee. Nobody really expected that lessees would break contracts to that extent, but it has happened. We could not say that the government should have expected that—I do not think that anyone expected it. We expected lessees to support the contracts by which they were obligated, but they did not. Lessors in Victoria, in particular, have found great difficulty in getting new lessees to take up leases on their properties. They have been disadvantaged to a significant degree, and this package must address their problem. I believe that the legislation is again too restrictive. I have an amendment that I hope will be accepted, as it will certainly make it easier for lessors to get some justice under the legislation.
Another group of farmers who were disadvantaged under the DSAP were Capel dairy farmers in Western Australia and farmers in the south-east of South Australia whose entitlements were unfairly reduced because of the way in which their entitlements were calculated under the DSAP. To put it in simple language and to short cut the rather complicated explanation, they were deemed to have produced a certain amount of market milk because of the payment of the DSM. Because of that, they were deemed to have produced a certain percentage of market milk, but in fact they produced a higher percentage than that which was deemed to them. We need to address their problems, too.
It was very difficult to come up with an amendment that would deal with their situation, because of the problem with the Constitution and the need to treat everybody equally. I am still puzzling about that, but I hope that the government, in their response, will indicate that the needs of those farmers will also be covered. It depends on the anomalous circumstances and how widely they are defined, and on the discretion that the minister and the Dairy Adjustment Authority will have. It depends also on whether that discretion will be flexible enough to take on board their situation, and it is important that we do that.
Those are some of the problems that still remain with this legislation. Let us give the government credit for attempting to bring in amendments that will be beneficial for a number of dairy farmers. The government certainly are trying, but they have not quite got there. I hope that they will be sensible enough to understand that they can get there if they accept the amendments to be moved by the opposition and the Democrats. If so, they will be able to deliver what the rhetoric says they want to deliver, but if they refuse to accept those amendments, or refuse to give us a commitment that they will deal with the problems in one way or another, they will not be able to deliver what the rhetoric says they want to deliver.
These are the issues that are to be dealt with under this legislation. I commend to the Senate the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. I also commend the staff of the committee who responded to the one-day hearing that we had on the legislation and wrote a very good report in very quick time. I did not have a chance to say this when the report was presented: I want to put on the record the tremendous expertise that the staff of our committee bring and the very good work that they did on this occasion to produce the report on the provisions of this legislation. I commend to the Senate the legislation and also the amendments which will be moved in the committee stage. I trust that the government will see that these amendments are not meant to destroy the legislation but rather to enable the government to really deliver what the rhetoric of the press release and the minister's statement says they want to deliver.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-06-25,"—I rise to support my colleague Senator Forshaw in this debate. There is a degree of anger out there that people on all sides of politics will be aware of in respect of the dairy deregulation. I took part in the Labor dairy task force which visited a number of centres in Queensland, where this anger very much came to the surface and people had an opportunity to vent their spleen on the actions that had taken place under this government. We visited in particular Monto, Maleny and Woodford. I am going to recount today for the sake of the record some of the feelings that came out of that meeting and, in particular, I am going to quote one person at our hearing in Maleny who summed up many of the responses that we got right across the board in Monto, Maleny and Woodford.
Clearly the result of deregulation in my state has seen substantial losses of income. One of the persons who appeared before us in Monto said that two years ago they were getting 46c a litre for their milk; their last payment was 30c a litre. There had been an average loss of $70,000 per farm, and the restructure was only worth $22,000 to them. They said that a lot of people have been forced to take the money up front and the only people who have benefited from the restructure money have been the banks. Another person at the same meeting recounted to us that they had lost a third of their income, and this had restricted their normal spending on repairs and maintenance, new equipment, seed and fertiliser. If they are not maintaining their farms, even if the prices correct themselves, they are still going to be a long way behind the eight ball.
At that meeting in Monto we sat in the shire hall and above us was the crest of the shire of Monto. At the head of the crest was a dairy cow, because the shire of Monto obviously is heavily dependent upon the dairy industry. It was rather ironic that underneath the crest the words of the motto read: `In abundance prepare for scarcity'. I do not think that the dairy farmers who are the lifeblood and the source of wealth, employment and livelihood in that area ever thought that that would apply to them—that in their previous period they should have been preparing for the scarcity that has now been thrust upon them.
When we moved to Maleny we had similar sorts of statements placed before us. In the case of one farmer, their income had been cut from an average of 45c per litre to 25c per litre. There was someone who had found themselves $12,000 in the red each month, $1 million in debt, with a 13-year-old son and no future. There was an element of despair, dismay and no way forward. The response was probably best characterised by a Mrs Nolene Stark, who has taken the time to put together a number of emails which have been sent to all senators. Nolene Stark's comments in her emails encapsulate the despair that has been felt by many people who have been in the dairy industry over a long period of time. I am going to take a few minutes to look at the comments that she has forwarded to all senators. Her first email was on Sunday, 4 March. She said:
I have just watched Channel 7's Sunday Sunrise Program which contained a story about a family being forced off their farm because of the deregulation of the dairy industry. Every man woman and child in Australia should be forced to see a program like that. Maybe then it would bring home to the powers that be what an inhuman thing they have forced on ordinary hard working men and women.
I am in tears. The sadness of it all just makes me cry—and then I get angry.
Mrs Stark obviously—and I have met Mrs Stark—is a person of great passion indeed and was moved by what she had seen not simply because she was a bystander but because of her knowledge of the industry over a long period of time. She goes on to outline the length of her association with the industry:
I am almost 70 years of age. I have owned my farm for 50 years and my son wishes to carry on after I am gone, and then I have a grandson who wishes to carry on as well. We are faced with the same outcome as those poor people on your program. I was in tears as the old couple watched their cattle being driven away. In my eyes we were watching my herd being driven away.
—So you're against deregulation.
—Mrs Stark went on to explain how she came out of retirement to come back to the farm to help her son out of the current difficulties that she and her son were experiencing. She is a fairly prolific emailer, Senator McGauran. You might like to pick up some of her emails. She went on to say in her email of 30 March:
I cannot believe the ignorance and arrogance of the Prime Minister in his press conference at Parliament House on the 18th March. He said, “This country is irrevocably on the path toward change and reform because we need to do so in order to create jobs for our children and to maintain our living standards.” He goes on to say, that he does understand that people can be hurt in the process and he has to do better at ensuring that those people are protected.
Then she said:
(What about the dairy farmers who are suffering? 200 have gone out in Queensland alone and now we have a shortage of milk. So much so that we have to import milk powder from New Zealand.)
Mrs Stark said further:
The Prime Minister also said, “Wherever a policy is being implemented that involves change and reform, we have to be absolutely certain that we identify people who might be adversely affected by it, and that where possible to provide them with help to adjust to change. The dairy industry is a classic example. The dairy industry itself asked to be reformed. We didn't force it on them. And many dairy farmers are much better off now as a result of reform. You go to Tasmania or Victoria and ask the dairy farmers there what they think about dairy deregulation. They think it's marvellous.”
That is the Prime Minister speaking of the deregulation. Then Mrs Stark went on to pick up the points that should have been picked up. She said:
I take exception to two things the Prime Minister said in that quote. Firstly, the dairy industry leaders asked for reform—Grassroots dairy farmers did not want a bar of it. We trusted our dairy leaders who let us down so badly that we do not want anything to do with them now.
Secondly, it is typical that the Prime Minister quoted the Tasmanian and Victorian farmers as thinking deregulation was marvellous—Deregulation has got nothing to do with why they are so happy now. It is all to do with the low dollar value. I wonder how the Victorian farmers will feel when the dollar value climbs back up to 60 cents. I believe for every cent the dollar falls, it is worth 5 cents per litre to the export market. Let the Prime Minister, come to any of the other states, Qld, WA or NSW, and really get out in the country and ask the true farmers what they think of deregulation.
So there is an element of despair expressed by Mrs Stark in her email. As I said, it was not something that was isolated to Mrs Stark alone.
—You led her on.
—Mrs Stark was not led on, Senator McGauran, because this was sent prior to any contact we have ever had with Mrs Stark. These are Mrs Stark's own words of desperation trying to reach the Australian people, trying to reach the government of the day to say, `We are desperate. We are in need of help.' Whilst we have an amended package before the Senate this week and we have amendments being put forward by the Democrats and the opposition, that of itself will only go part of the way to resolving the difficulties faced by Mrs Stark and her colleagues in the dairy industry in Queensland. She went on to say on 20 May:
At the moment we are at the bottom of the bargaining chain. Cows do have to be milked twice a day, every day. Our milk vat will only hold a certain amount of milk for so long before it has to be dumped. Our hands are completely tied. Whatever processor we supply, we have no choice but to accept the price they are offering for our product. The supermarkets on the other hand are the big winners as they can sell our milk for whatever price they please. Therefore, the margin farmers were getting before deregulation has now been transferred to the supermarkets.
Then at the end of her email of that day she said:
P.S. The Dairy Structural Adjustment Program for farmers was not in the best interests of farmers. Most farmers have taken it up front to minimise debt. However, we do still have to pay tax. If the price for our milk does not improve, every farmer is going to be much worse off in the long run. Some farmers have been refused assistance from Centrelink for family assistance, parenting allowance etc, because they have received their package. Many farmers who have applied for the Dairy Regional Assistance Program to help them finance some project for diversification have been refused because they have received their package. So much money—So little real help for the dairy farmer.
—Did you—
—No-one can walk away, Senator McGauran, from the frustration that is out there. No-one can walk away, Senator McGauran, from the difficulties that are being confronted by Mrs Stark and the like. 
—Did you set her straight? You know half of that is wrong.
—Senator McGauran, it is very good of you to interject in this particular debate, and I invite you to get up later and say a few words. Obviously, you do not come from a state where the farmers have been adversely affected, where people's lifestyles have been decimated as a result of the deregulation. Otherwise, Senator McGauran, these people would not come forward and would not raise the difficulties that they have. But, as I said, Mrs Stark is one of the people who I believe has eloquently and rightly put her case to the members of this Senate and the members of the House of Representatives with her various emails. For a person who is 70 years of age and who has a longstanding association with the industry—as she said, over 50 years in the industry—she cannot believe what she is seeing happening to the industry that she hoped would be the provider of a lifestyle not only for her son but for her son's son as well. Of course, she now sees that slipping away from her.
But it is not as though Mrs Stark is the only person who has made comments about the difficulties being faced. There were others also, and perhaps it is worth while to spend a few moments looking at some of the comments that came from people in the Woodford area. One dairy producer in that area claimed that those who had made the most effort and had increased their herd size were now in more trouble than those who have stayed the same size. That particular dairy farmer went on to say, `The most efficient are those who are now in the most trouble; no-one is doing all right.' These dairy farmers went on to explain the degree of difficulty that is confronting them in their area. At the same meeting, another dairy farmer was critical of the short-term lead-in time for the restructure. He said that most major industries could not undertake such a restructure in such a short period of time. In that sense, many see their life and their lifestyle slipping away from them, without there being any real prospect of going back to anything even reminiscent of their previous way of living.
These people were concerned that they had no bargaining power. They saw the pre-eminence of the banks, in their coming out to suck up whatever benefits these people might have got out of the packages that had been delivered to them. They were frustrated with government. They were frustrated and critical of the processes. They were looking to vent their spleen and their criticisms and, indeed, to see that some of the injustice that, in their eyes, has taken place is redressed. As both my colleagues Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley have said, the package goes down the path of further addressing the concerns and the needs of these particular people. However, I think the Labor amendment is important.
—What is it?
—I am glad you ask that. As I understand the amendment, it seeks to extend the package—but not to those who have 35 per cent of their market milk. As part of the amendment, we seek to reduce that to 25 per cent. That, in itself, is quite a commendable path to be going down. This amendment is being undertaken because we believe it is important to see that those who are in the greatest need in the community do get the real benefits of this legislation. I commend the amendment and the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-25,"—I rise sadly today to speak to the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001. I say `sadly' because of the necessity to be doing this. Two issues are encompassed by that: firstly, that we are here in an attempt to assist the dairy industry in its demise; and, secondly, that the government could have got the situation so wrong in its initial legislation to assist the dairy industry. It may sound glib and smug to say to the government, `I told you so,' but so many senators raised so many issues in relation to the deregulation of the dairy industry that that is the case. I do not expect the implementation of this bill, in its present form or amended form, to achieve any benefit for those who are seriously lacking justice. I realise that the department's reply will be sloppily placatory and totally bureaucratic. However, this will not deter me from doing my duty in attempting to achieve justice for all unfortunate enough to be caught up in this deregulation.
This whole sorry saga can be placed wholly at the feet of the national competition policy, in collusion with the highly controversial and damaging GATT agreements and our obligations under those agreements. As representatives of the Australian people, I believe that the government's obligation should be to the benefit of the Australian people and Australian business. To date, sadly, that has not been the case. It is obvious that the government and Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party do not operate under the same criteria. While I am entrusted with my present duties, my sole desire is to direct my total efforts to working entirely and tirelessly for the benefits of this nation and its wonderful citizens.
The object of this bill is to introduce additional financial assistance—that is, $1.78 million—to those who have been more adversely affected than others by the implementation of the dairy industry adjustment package. Those found to be in particular need come from Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. That is not to the exclusion of all the producers in Victoria and Tasmania, but the officers who are assisting with the implementation of this extra supplementary assistance tabled documents at the Senate hearing very clearly setting out that no-one from Victoria or Tasmania would benefit from this supplementary assistance.
In particular, the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia have been greatly affected. There is an assessment of farm gate price reductions of up to 30 per cent for their milk, consequently flowing on to a 50 per cent decrease in farm income. Queensland farmers have gone from an average income level of $80,350 down to $47,517, while Western Australia has suffered even more devastatingly. Its average has gone from $127,185 down to $55,823. The question I ask is: have the departmental heads who largely advised the government on the implementation of this program suffered an equal degree of financial loss to the one that has been inflicted on what is now a very suspicious, manipulated dairy industry? It is estimated that 3,100 dairy farm enterprises have been involved in the payment scheme related to this bill. I can, however, find no mention of another less obvious partner in the dairy farm process, and that is the lessors, who are as necessary a part of the industry as the cows. Without the land and its infrastructure, there is no dairy enterprise. We have all heard the many pleas of the lessors, but this bill totally fails to recognise their rights and acknowledge the invaluable part they play in this industry.
These additional payments are to be directed to farmers with a market milk portion of 35 per cent and above, and the payments will be capped at $60,000. There have been many pleas and requests for the floor level of these payments to be adjusted down the scale to approximately 20 per cent. The department has received many requests for these figures, but as yet these have not been made available to enable the chamber to fully assess the details and thus accurately evaluate just what we should do for the benefit of these farmers and their local communities. This is an extremely important point. We are being asked to make decisions in relation to this additional supplementary assistance, but at this point in time the department will not even disclose to this chamber the additional number of producers which would fall into this process if the 35 per cent market milk portion were reduced to 20 per cent. I believe the Democrats will be moving amendments to reduce that to 18 per cent. There seems to be strong opposition by both the government and the department to any additional payments to producers who fall below the present 35 per cent, and I believe this is purely based on incurring additional costs.
In its manifesto, the ACCC fails to acknowledge the necessary participation of the farmers in producing the product that the almighty consumer requires. The ACCC also miserably fails to acknowledge the blatant fact that these farmers require a profit in order to exist and in order for their enterprises to remain viable and continue to operate. The national competition policy is a blatantly biased piece of propaganda, the evidence of which is arising with great and potent force throughout this country. I find it quite distressing that, in the lead-up to and during the implementation of the dairy deregulation, the Australian Dairy Industry Council played such a devastating part in the destruction of so many dairy farmers and the dairy industry within Australia. No doubt those remaining in the industry will exert just retribution on the present industry leaders.
The ACCC has made claims that the questionable benefits to the consumer outweigh the costs that the farmers have to adjust to—that is, the loss of income in conjunction with the gross devaluation of their farms, if not the unsaleability of their enterprises. We must as a community weigh up the ideology that the ACCC espouses and evaluate whether one sector of the community is to benefit at the cost of another sector of the community. There are further claims by the ACCC that the scheme is in the interests of Australian consumers and that this exonerates the imposition of this piece of legislation—that is, the national competition policy—upon these farmers.
The ACCC states that by maintaining the current strength and competitiveness of the dairy industry it can be expected that the cost savings to the consumer following deregulation, estimated at about $118 million per year, can be sustained. What the ACCC is clearly saying is that, because there is a benefit of $118 million per annum to the economy, they can impose on the dairy farmers of Australia this legislation and morally walk away justified. I ask the question: can it be justified? I believe the answer is no.
There was an open letter that I believe was sent to all senators. I would like to read the content of that open letter because it raises a substantial number of the issues that present dairy farmers have. The letter reads:
The $45,000 Dairy Exit Payment Grant which Mr Howard stood up on TV and came over news broadcasts throughout Australia, gave the impression to the normal listener we were going to be looked after. This DEP is impossible to get due to the fact assets and the sale of the family farm. If the farm is now judged unviable due to deregulation, farmers should then be able to access the Grant whether the farm is sold or not. The Dairy Structural Adjustment Package should not be deemed an asset for the 8 years as this stops farmers from getting the normal welfare assistance available to others. There are cases where banks have grabbed the DSAP and the farm. Now these people cannot draw unemployment benefits because of an asset they really don't have. Dairy farmers of pension age cannot get the aged pension for the same reason. Retraining programs put in place are unavailable unless the farm is sold. It is hard to believe our great Agricultural, Fisheries and Forestry Department put these stupid conditions in place so Centrelink can have great fun enforcing them. The Grants now being handed out to districts affected by dairy deregulation are a joke! Grants going to the likes of Sprout Farms, Abattoirs, Chicken Farms, Building Industries and other non Dairy related business while we are left with no help for a lifetime business and work which we now have lost. I used to wonder why in this great country we had homeless people living on the streets, but now I can see how it can all come about. My family is headed for the same bleak future.
We received a considerable amount of information from lessors at the Senate committee hearing. In one case—and this was the case of the actual person before the committee—a lessor stated that she had had a lessee on her property for 55 days prior to the starting date for the deregulation and that person had subsequently broken that lease agreement, having received $150,000 in restructured payment. We were also told of lessees who were in actuality in default of their lease agreement—some of them having been in default for up to three months—and yet they were still paid out under the dairy adjustment package.
I moved amendments to the original legislation in an attempt to tie the dairy adjustment package to the property. Those amendments were voted down by both the government and the opposition. Had they not been voted down, this sector of the dairy industry—the lessors—would be in a far better position today both financially and also in their ability to stay within the dairy industry. The government continually tells us that this entire adjustment package is to assist those staying within the industry, and yet a disproportional number of the people who were supposed to have been assisted to stay in the industry are opting out.
We also have an anomaly with this legislation, as a result of the legal term of an agreement, under which people can be disadvantaged. The difference lies in the definition of a share farmer agreement, which is a legal document that is signed by the property owner and the person operating the dairy on that property. In the case of a share farmer, the owner of that property receives up to 50 per cent of the adjustment package and the operator obviously receives the benefit of the balance. But where there is a lessor/lessee agreement—no more legally binding and which, in actuality, in many cases has been transposed word for word from being a share farmer agreement—there is the anomaly that the lessee can in some cases receive up to 98 per cent of the adjustment package. Evidence has been given that in some cases property owners have reverted from lessor/lessee agreements to share farming, and I conjecture that that was purely based upon knowledge of what the outcome was going to be.
In summing up, I would like to refer briefly to some other information from some farmers in Tasmania. They raised the issue where a particular farmer as a result of suffering from a brain tumour was required to lease his property and where the lessee got $100,000 from the package while the lessor received $4,000. At the age of approximately 70 years the farmer with the brain tumour now finds himself having to lease a new herd and go back to operating his property. This is but one example of the injustices of the deregulation of the dairy industry. I now formally move my second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate is of the view that the bill should be amended to provide for the following:
	(a)	that, if a dairy farm became unviable after deregulation, the farmer be permitted to receive the $45,000 Dairy Exit Payment irrespective of whether the farmer continues to own the farm;
	(b)	that dairy farmers who ran viable enterprises before deregulation but whose enterprises became unviable after deregulation be granted access, free of charge, to retraining programs, irrespective of whether the farmers continues to own their farms;
	(c)	that dairy farmers who are of pensionable age and who ran viable enterprises before deregulation but whose enterprises became unviable after deregulation be given full access to the age pension and that their farms be excluded from the assets test, with a period of up to three years allowed for those farmers to dispose of their farms;
	(d)	that dairy farmers whose farms have been resumed by the banks following mortgage foreclosures be given normal access to welfare payments; and
	(e)	that, in relation to lessors:
	(i)	all income received by lessors, other than what is applicable to the lease arrangement on the dairy farm, be excluded from the criteria for lessors; and
	(ii)	that hardship be removed as a criterion for lessors”.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2001-06-25,"—Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, you may notice that I am not listed on the speakers list for the second reading debate of the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 but I have been prompted to put myself on the speakers list at this last moment because I have rarely seen such chest beating on this issue as I have today with the list of speakers—all Labor senators bar the One Nation speaker that we have just heard—and I feel that it must be countered. Their comments must not go unchecked. They are in absolute free-fall. The pomposity of the previous speaker is unmatched by the Labor speakers but we still have some more to come on, and I am sure they will do their best. 
They reached their zenith when they started reading out constituents' emails on this particular matter. Senator Hogg read out an email from Mrs Stark and Senator Harris from the One Nation Party also contributed with a constituent's complaint. Within those complaints were misrepresented points that could have easily been fixed up. In particular, Senator Hogg had an obligation to Mrs Stark to right the wrongs of some of her perceptions. Even if he does not agree with this government's involvement in deregulation, he had an obligation to set Mrs Stark straight on some of her wrong perceptions. For example, he should have told that constituent who it was that set deregulation in train some time ago, because it was his party—the Labor Party—when they were in government. It was the then minister, Mr Kerin, who set down the well-named Kerin plan, which was followed up by Mr Crean, who was also, heaven forbid, the primary industries minister for some time. It was during those years that the deregulation of the dairy industry was set on its inevitable path to conclusion on 30 June 2000, some 12 months ago. That was not said. 
After listening to the contributions made by the previous speakers from the Labor Party, you would believe that they were against deregulation—but it is quite the opposite. They are pro deregulation. If Senator Harris suggests that this has anything to do with national competition policy, then I say to him in the nicest terms that he is wrong. But Senator Harris often gets his ACCCs and NCCs mixed up and confused. We always make allowances for the One Nation Party not being across issues. But we know only too well that across the chamber the opposition are avoiding the real fact—I say this to Senator Buckland who is to get up and speak next—that it was Labor that set in train deregulation. I say to those opposite: do not come in here wringing your hands, shedding crocodile tears and quoting constituents who believed that Labor have had a hands-off involvement on this issue when the truth is that you set it in train and we never heard a word about it. 
You never told your constituency the truth. What alternative did the national dairy industry have—under the Bracks government and, I admit, the previous Liberal Kennett government and their dairy representatives in the UDV, the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria—when the powerful Victorian dairy industry decided that they were going to deregulate? That is, they were no longer going to be bound within their own state; they were going to send milk across the border into New South Wales and into the lucrative Sydney supermarkets. What alternative did the Queensland and New South Wales dairy industry have when Victoria as a whole—the Bracks government, the previous Kennett government and the representative dairy industry body—set on that particular mission, on that path. Many times before the Victorian dairy industry had been kept at home, so to speak, by previous governments—the Fraser government, the Whitlam government and I dare say the Menzies government. But times had changed and Victoria's market was just bursting at the seams. They saw that they could obtain premiums with their market milk if they could break into the Sydney market and they were just going to ride right over the top of the New South Wales dairy industry no matter what. That has nothing to do with this federal government. That was not said by Senator Hogg to Mrs Stark, his constituent—it was a total misrepresentation.
Senator Hogg and, by implication, everyone else on the opposition side have not represented the facts of this case to their constituencies correctly. Not once have we heard the Labor Party address this issue in regard to the states. The cruellest fact of the deregulation of the dairy industry visited upon New South Wales and Queensland dairy farmers, in particular, is that their state governments will not compensate them for loss of quota, for loss of property. Why is that? Why have we not heard from the opposition on this matter? I will tell you why: they are two Labor governments—the Queensland Labor government and the New South Wales Labor government. What has hit those dairy farmers hardest is the loss of value in the quotas they once held, which they paid stamp duty for. You have not even the courage to stand up here and criticise those state governments. 
In Western Australia, the former Liberal Party government and the Labor opposition at the time were unanimous in their support to compensate dairy farmers for their state quotas—but not New South Wales and not Queensland. Senator Hogg ought to go back to Mrs Stark, who is so upset about those people who have had to walk off their properties, and tell her that the real reason is that the Labor state governments never compensated. It is a cruel fact. She has a right to be upset when she hears of, or sees on the news, dairy farmers going to the wall. The reason for that has nothing to do with national competition policy, it has nothing to do with this federal government, but it has everything to do with the New South Wales and Queensland state governments. That was conveniently left out by the previous speaker. I hope Senator Buckland, who is to follow me in this debate, has the courage to at least mention in passing the state quotas, as Senator Woodley from the Democrats had the courage to do.
There is no question that this is the largest deregulation of any primary industry undertaken yet. Heaven knows that primary industries over the last decade or so have taken their medicine in regard to deregulation, because the early years are an adjustment factor, and it is difficult. The largest deregulation undertaken yet has been in the dairy industry. But there have been some others. When the opposition were in government, it was the wool industry. There was not one cent of compensation for the wool farmers when Mr Kerin was the primary industries minister. Wool farmers have suffered for a decade. It is only now that wool prices have finally started to climb, and the stockpile is quickly diminishing. When that industry, which has suffered, went to the wall, was there one cent of compensation? We talk about farmers hitting the wall and having to walk off the farm. The Western District of Victoria is devastated, and that all goes back to the deregulation—and I use that word in its broadest sense—of the wool industry when Labor were in government. What of the citrus industry? Where was your compensation package for the citrus industry when you opened that industry up to the winds of international competition? There was not a cent. 
We acknowledge that the dairy industry is the largest deregulation undertaken in the primary industry sector. We are responding to that by supporting the largest adjustment package to dairy farmers, right down to the farm gate. It is not being taken by the middleman; it is not being taken by the supermarkets or by the processors. This compensation goes directly to the farm gate. The package is over $1.7 billion in the first tranche, and we are now in parliament to add more to the measure. There seems to be a problem with the fact that we are adding more to the package. The fact that we are revisiting the package is no error at all. It is quite the opposite: the adjustment is a credit to us. It is a credit to the fact that the minister is responding to a report which he commissioned and which showed that there were certain pockets within Queensland and New South Wales that needed further compensation. So we quickly adjusted to that. We are managing the process. We are making sure that the support packages are there. It would not have hurt the opposition to have managed these large deregulations when they were in government. I cannot understand and nor do I accept the criticism of us revisiting the issue of compensation. It just shows that we are managing the issue, and it ought to be seen as a credit to us. 
Senator Harris, we have responded to the concerns of the lessors, and rightly so because they did have an issue. A Senate inquiry heard their concerns and the government has responded to those concerns. It seems absolutely incredible—and the lessors backed up their claims with facts—that so many lessees, once they received the package, walked off the property and broke their leases. It is wrong, and I hope that the lessors, perhaps in a class action, are able to bring those lessees to account. The lessors did have a story to tell and I would like to think that the government responded. We are flexible, and you have seen over the last six months how this government listens and responds. 
I utterly reject the previous speakers' comments in regard to the government's dairy deregulation. It is pure political opportunism. If you are against deregulation, then you ought to come into this chamber and say so. We know of one person who would withdraw the whole package. He is quite a prominent person within Labor's ranks: Mr Mark Latham. He probably represents all the city members of the Labor Party who believe that the dairy farmers are simply getting too much. Thank goodness for the National Party. When you are a city oriented party like the Labor Party, the likes of Mark Latham have an enormous influence, and he would withdraw the package.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-06-25,"—My question is to Minister Ellison, representing the Attorney-General. Is the minister aware of the media comments today from the Chief Justice of the High Court, Murray Gleeson, that he believes he must now take on the job of publicly defending the judges and the court from attack, a job left vacant by Attorney-General Williams? Is the minister also aware that the Chief Justice was critical of those who criticise High Court decisions without being well informed about the issue or even having read the decision and that he has in the past referred directly to the Howard government's criticism of the Wik judgment? Does the minister agree with the Chief Justice's comments on this matter, including the need for him to fill the traditional Attorney's role of defending the court? Have his comments been misreported?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>High Court of Australia: Decisions</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-06-25,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Given Chief Justice Gleeson's view that the court must now publicly defend itself and its decisions, can the minister confirm that the High Court has bid in recent years for budget funding for a public relations officer for the court? In light of the court's clear intention to fill the vacancy left by the Attorney-General, does the government intend to redress this issue of funding as revealed by the High Court in the letters pages of the Australian Financial Review?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>High Court of Australia: Decisions</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-25,"—It is not the role of the Attorney-General to routinely defend the judiciary, and the judiciary has accepted this. In the article that Senator Ludwig refers to, the Chief Justice said that he himself would make comment where necessary. He did not criticise the Attorney-General for any action, inaction or anything else. He said that he, the Chief Justice, would defend decisions or make comment where appropriate. He also said that there was room for judicial accountability, and that was when judgment was handed down. If I recall the article correctly, the Chief Justice said that a judge has a chance to make an explanation as to a decision, and that chance comes only once, and that is in the reasons for decision—quite appropriately so.
Let us get it right at the outset. The Chief Justice was not attacking the Attorney-General in any way. The Attorney-General himself has said that he has been pleased to see it reported that Chief Justice Gleeson has signalled that he will defend judges and court decisions from attack where he considers that necessary. The Attorney-General considers that a most welcome development. As I have said previously, there is adequate opportunity for a judge to explain his or her decision. That was touched on by the Chief Justice in this article. We have an excellent Attorney-General, who has presided over great reforms in his portfolio, and the Attorney-General is not about to engage in any political interference with the judiciary.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>High Court of Australia: Decisions</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer

On several occasions over the last couple of years, the High Court has sought additional funding for a number of purposes, including the establishment of a public information officer position. The government has decided that additional funding is not needed for this position and has provided, in other areas, more than adequate funding for the High Court's appropriations—I cite the increases I have just mentioned.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2001-06-25,"—Last Thursday Senator Schacht asked me a question about the outsourcing of the management of veterans' records. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an answer to his question.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Question
Can the Minister confirm that the Howard government is planning to outsource the management of veterans' records Is it true that, if this outsourcing goes ahead, up to 80 departmental jobs will be axed? How does the government propose to guarantee the privacy and security of veterans' medical records when they are placed in the hands of a private company?
Supplementary question—Could he also find out what is the proposed timetable for the outsourcing of the management of Veterans' records? What is the government's estimate of the savings which can be achieved? And I ask again, to emphasise this point which is of great concern in the Veterans' community by what means will the government guarantee the privacy and security of veterans' records?
Answer
No, the Department of Veterans' Affairs is not outsourcing the management of veterans' records. The Department is currently market testing its mail and file management services. This involves a potential contractor managing the storage and retrieval of files and inward and outward mail flow. The use of the records and management of all departmental claims, etc will still be undertaken by departmental staff. A request for tenders is expected to be issued in early July 2001. Tenders are expected to close in late August and a decision likely by the end of September 2001.
Up to 80 positions may be involved and the Department is working with staff in the area to ensure that, as far as possible, their preferences for redeployment or voluntary redundancy are met.
Market testing of mail and file services is part of a wider departmental strategy to ensure that its work processes are as efficient as possible. As you will appreciate at this stage of the tender process it would not be appropriate nor commercially prudent to advise an estimated level of savings.
Should market testing be successful, the Department envisages a strong partnership with any successful contractor, with continuing major departmental involvement in records management activities. The contract will include strong privacy provisions which will be strictly controlled and monitored.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Veterans' Records: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech

Although most projects have been announced, the details of cash flow and commitment are not fully disclosed.
I am advised, Senator O'Brien, that the department have prepared a response. It is not quite finalised, but it does show expected state expenditure and this does give, as I understand it, the most detail that we are able to provide.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-06-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanations.
My staff wrote to the Minister for Health and Aged Care on my behalf on 19 June seeking answers to questions Nos 3136 and 3137, which have remained unanswered for 237 days. This is yet another example of the contempt that this minister shows towards this parliament and his obligations—eight months, or near enough to eight months, to provide answers to what are, I would have thought, fairly straightforward questions. This minister does not appear to accept that he has any responsibility at all to comply with Senate standing orders.
I understand that Senator Vanstone will probably do what she can to get him to comply. The fact of the matter is that Minister Wooldridge continues to behave in a rather spoilt manner and is rather precious with regard to the divulging of information to this chamber and, I believe, to the other. I accept Senator Vanstone has given an undertaking to the Senate in good faith today, and I am extremely hopeful that she will be able convince Minister Wooldridge to enable her to honour her undertaking, and I look forward to that information tomorrow.
In relation to the answer to question No. 3531 by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, I asked the department for that answer, as the minister outlined, during the estimates hearings on 31 May and I was advised that answer had not been completed but the plan was to process that question the following week. My officers then wrote to the office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 15 June in relation to the same question, and his office contacted my office and advised that an answer was being prepared. We were further advised that an answer should have been available by the end of last week or the beginning of this week.
It is now 25 June. I still do not have the answer. I hear what Senator Ian Macdonald says in relation to the matter, and he in some way seeks to excuse the minister for not answering the question. But I would have thought the information I am seeking would have been compiled by the department in preparation for the budget—a budget which, I remind the Senate, was brought down on 22 May.
This is yet another example of the failure of the minister, Mr Anderson, to manage his portfolio. Despite the embarrassment of the mess Mr Anderson made of the Land Transport Development Fund that saw him sack two personal staff to save his own neck, it seems that nothing has changed. A full review of administrative procedures by Minister Anderson's department—again to cover for his own mismanagement—appears to have made little difference.
We have still not seen the land development fund reports for the years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. The last reports, I remind the Senate, were all tabled on 30 November 1999, covering the period 1995 to 1998. This is in spite of the legislative requirement that the minister report to the parliament on the progress of the fund annually. Section 41 of the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 states, in part:
The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, cause a report to be laid before each House of the Parliament setting out details of the operation of the Land Transport Fund ...
The 1998-99 report was due before the end of 1999 and the report for the period 1999-2000 was due before the end of 2000. We are all but in the second half of 2001 and the minister has again chosen to ignore the provisions of his own legislation. When Mr Anderson forced his senior adviser to fall on his own sword—a staffer who had worked for him for nearly a decade—Mr Oxley said in a statement:
He—
that is, Mr Anderson—
was not advised at any time by the department that the Australian Land Transport Development (ALTD) Act required him to report annually to Parliament on the details of the ALTD account ...
On this occasion, Mr Anderson cannot use that excuse.
I am aware that there has been a review—in fact two reviews—of the whole land transport area and a report went to the minister in the week starting 21 May on the outcome of those reviews. I am advised that the report contained 47 recommendations. I would not only like answers to the overdue questions from the Minister for Health and Aged Care and an answer to the question on notice from the Deputy Prime Minister, but at some stage, perhaps through Senator Ian Macdonald or perhaps in the other place, the Deputy Prime Minister should also explain why he has continued to ignore the provisions of the Australian Land Transport Development Act.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3136, 3137 and 3531</title>",Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-06-25,"—I would like to commend Senator Ian Macdonald for trying to put down an explanation as to why the question had not been answered. I appreciate the fact that he went to some length in trying to explain it. It is true that some questions are more complex than others and do take time to get the answer together. If there is any concern in government that these questions are too complex or too intrusive, I believe they should cost the answer and put that in the answer, because that does have an effect on opposition members not wanting to ask questions that are going to massively involve public expense that will be sheeted back home to them.
However, the main reason I rose was to point out that we have all had the same problem as Senator O'Brien with the same minister and the same department. It is a difficult process in this chamber, because we are asking ministers not about their own portfolio responsibilities but about those whom they represent, and therefore the degree to which they can intervene and obtain these answers is far more limited than if it were in their own portfolio area. But over the years Dr Wooldridge has proved to be recidivist in this area. One gets the impression that it is not a question of the complexity of the question; it is the nature of the question that is not answered. 
I had this ruckus with them quite some months ago when I put a series of questions on notice involving entertainment expenses. I only pursued the matter in this chamber as to why the question had not been answered after I was told they had no intention of answering it because it was a waste of resources when we had had seven other ministers answer identical questions. Therefore, the matter was pursued, and maybe Dr Wooldridge would have been happy to answer it. But it seems to be a deliberate policy. I do not think it can be attributed to his department; I think it is directions from the minister. When you go behind the scenes and ask these departments when they provided a draft answer—we all know these are ministers' answers but it is the department that provides the draft—they were provided well within time to answer the question. So the draft gets to the minster's office, they do not like the answer, so they decide not to produce it at all. 
I think the 30-day rule is a difficult rule. I did not support the rule when it was imposed on us in government. I always thought a 60-day rule would be a fairer one to give the department a reasonable chance to respond. I never rise in this chamber to pursue a question on notice until at least 60 days have elapsed. But Dr Wooldridge and some of his colleagues do hold the record, because a question I asked two years and eight months ago of Dr Wooldridge remains unanswered. In fact, every question that I have asked, other than the ones we have forced out, remains unanswered. That is the difficulty in the process. 
We argue at times about not asking complex and convoluted questions at question time, so we put them in writing. We put questions on notice, which should take pressure off the estimates committee process. However, we do expect the ministers to genuinely attempt to answer them. Every now and then there will be a question—and I have seen them—put on notice that I think a minister is entitled to refuse to answer, because it either involves the creation of a document or such an enormous workload that a minister is entitled, now and then, to say that it does not justify the resources of government being applied to it. They can then be argued out on a case-by-case basis. We should not exclude that possibility. Senator O'Brien has not raised this matter after 30 days; he has raised it after several months. If you look at the pattern of where the real problem is, it is spotty but always it leads you to the department of health and to Dr Wooldridge. I think it is Dr Wooldridge's office—I have to say Dr Wooldridge would have to endorse this—that refuse to answer questions, not on the basis of their cost or complexity but because they simply do not want the answer on the public record.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3136, 3137 and 3531</title>",Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-25,"—I thank Senator Ray for his helpful suggestions and I take them in the spirit in which they are given. His suggestion that, for very complex questions that require an enormous amount of Public Service time, we should indicate to the questioner the cost involved is a practice which I have in fact followed through the estimates process. It is a practice which Senator O'Brien, who is a regular at our estimates, does agree with. Senator O'Brien has been very reasonable at times in saying, `If that is the cost, then perhaps we could get to the same result in a different way.' I acknowledge Senator Ray's suggestion and I acknowledge that Senator O'Brien does pursue that himself, as I do. I have to say in passing though that some of Senator O'Brien's regular colleagues at our estimates committees do not quite have the same approach to that and insist on putting long, stupid—if I might add—and completely unreasonable questions on notice and demand answers. But perhaps that is an aside. So thank you, Senator Ray, that is something we do do.
I might add, Senator Ray, on the issue of indicating costs of questions in order to cut down on those questions which really do not seem to go anywhere and which delve back several years, which in my view are unsustainable at an estimates committee in any case, that I asked my department to do the exercise of just what it cost to answer questions at estimates committees. Do you realise that the cost of answering questions taken on notice by my department—admittedly, it is an estimate but they very carefully tried to estimate what it would cost—in just one estimates committee hearing alone was $84,000? That was to answer the questions put on notice at my estimates committee. We do that exercise not only to raise the issue but also to suggest to some senators that sometimes the placing on notice of these questions, which from my point of view seem to be completely irrelevant—
—What about the expenditure for an extra three days at your estimates because of your behaviour. What are you talking about?
—Senator Carr, what are you talking about. You are out of order and do not have the call.
—Thank you, Madam President. Senator Carr of course has not been to my estimates—fortunately, I might say. If he had been at the last one—and he should ask Senator O'Brien—he would know that my part in the last estimates was very minimal.
—You never answered the questions. That is why.
—I was not asked too many questions, Senator. If any of you want to know, ask Senator O'Brien or Senator Forshaw or Senator Woodley who were there. They are senators who understand that, except for the—
—Ask Senator Mackay.
—I do not want to mention Senator Mackay. We are being friendly here today, and I do not want to indicate that she is the senator who causes most trouble with questions which are just irrelevant. Can I tell you one of Senator Mackay's questions, as you have raised the issue? I would not have done this, of course. Senator Mackay always sees some conspiracy in everything. She was questioning us about our flood recovery program and about the funds that we had paid out for flood recovery. She said, `Hmm, you have given all of this out, and that is in Mr Anderson's seat.' We said, `Yes, Senator, that is right.' She said, `And you have given all this money out, and that is in Mr St Clair's seat.' We said, `Yes, that is right, Senator.' She said, `And you have given all this money out, and that is in Mr Lawler's seat.' We said, `Yes, you are right, Senator.' She said, `Well, they are all National Party members. This has to be some rort. Why have you given out that money in those three National Party seats?' to which the public servant very embarrassedly said, `Senator, that is where the flood was.' They are the sorts of stupid questions that we have to put up with from the senator you named, whom I was not going to bother to name because she is not here today. But you mentioned her. I have to say that, if she were to adopt the same approach to questions as Senator O'Brien does, then we would not have to spend some $84,000 answering questions. If they were questions that were going to bring down the government, then that would be fine. 
—You would not answer them.
—Perhaps we would not answer them, Senator, but at least I could understand why she was asking them. Although I would probably hate it, I would at least give her credit in a professional way and say, `She is right on the ball, she is just about to bring the government down, and good luck to her. Whilst I will be a victim of the government falling, at least I can professionally accept that they are good questions.' But none of the questions get to that—none of them. Those of you who have had the misfortune to have to sit by and watch and listen will easily empathise with what I say. 
Senator O'Brien mentioned the Land Transport Development Fund. You can score a point or two should you want to on that. But remember that anything that the department now does is a continuation of what it did under Labor transport ministers. In fact, this new approach of dealing with the Land Development Transport Fund was initiated during the time of Labor ministers. You knew that, Senator O'Brien. That is why, very appropriately, the Labor Party did not follow that through. Mr Ferguson quite rightly said publicly, on behalf of the opposition, that they understood why the practice had continued, that they understood that governments of all persuasions—your own, but certainly ours—had spent far more than the reserve set up under those procedures. You are also aware, Senator, or your opposition spokesman is aware, that legislation is coming to deal with that, and it will be available shortly. Senator, for whatever faults you may find in the coalition government in relation to the Land Transport Development Fund, remember that it all started under your government, under Labor ministers, some of whom are still in this parliament. If we have committed an error, then it is in following the practice that the Labor government and the Labor ministers commenced.
—What about Wool-dridge—two years?
—I thought you were interjecting on the issue about the Land Transport Development Fund, Senator Schacht. If you want to interject or debate that, let me take you up on that. I cannot, unfortunately, debate Dr Wooldridge, because it is completely outside my portfolio area, except to say what a fantastic minister for health Dr Wooldridge is and how much he has done, particularly for health in rural and regional Australia, and at last we are turning the corner.
—Oh, come on!
—Even Senator West reluctantly had to concede that this year's budget of $117 million extra for the help with nurses in rural and regional Australia was a good initiative—one her government never bothered with in the 13 years it was in power. Dr Wooldridge has done an exceptionally good job as health minister in providing health services, particularly for those of us who live in rural and regional Australia.
Finally, in relation to the motion moved by Senator O'Brien, I want to come back to Mr Anderson, a man who has quite clearly indicated by his work what an able and dedicated transport minister he is. It has been a time of rapid movement in transport. The aviation area has not been easy. A lot of issues have arisen that have required able, dedicated and skilful attention. I have to say that Mr Anderson has shown himself to be one of the best transport ministers this country has ever had. He is responsible for a great number of initiatives in the land transport area, including rail transport. Whilst there is a response to the question that you raised, in the process, Mr Anderson—as I do and as I think most ministers do—likes to have a look at it. Mr Anderson does not sit there waiting for questions to come up. He has to deal with a lot of major issues, and I know he will deal with your question at the earliest possible opportunity. I do not want to put a time limit on it, but you could expect an answer by the end of this week.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3136, 3137 and 3531</title>",Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-06-25,"—I rise to speak on the same matter. Senator Macdonald commented today on his concern about responding to appropriate scrutiny and about being accountable to the parliament. I welcome his newfound initiative in those matters. I am particularly concerned, though, about his remarks about Senator Mackay. The last round of Senate estimates committees had the usual array of problems that accompany the different personalities when they govern. It is important to draw to the Senate's attention that, on this particular occasion, the committee with which we had the most difficulties was Senator Macdonald's. Senator Macdonald's committee was obliged to come back on three occasions to examine the Senate estimates.
—What did that cost?
—There would have been considerable cost involved. This was a result of both the government senators and the opposition senators coming together and agreeing that Senator Macdonald's behaviour was totally unacceptable, that his attitude towards the committee was contemptuous and that his attitude towards the public servants was contemptuous.
—Is that why he went quiet the next time?
—That is what occurred. He chose to walk into the committee and announce that he would be leaving at a certain time and that all the public servants would be leaving with him.
—What did this cost?
—It must have cost an absolute fortune to bring back the committee. He then determined that that was the end of the questioning. He had had enough. He was going to choose which questions he was going to answer and which he was not going to answer, and the time line according to which that would occur.
—Tricky.
—Mean.
—It troubles me that not only was Senator Mackay concerned about the due process of the committee but the government senators agreed that Senator Macdonald's behaviour was in fact tricky, mean and unreasonable in the circumstances. As a result, the committee had to come back and examine the estimates for an additional time by resolution of this chamber—a recommendation that was, if I recall rightly, supported by the government senators as well.
In a previous round of estimates, in which I participated, this same senator told us that he accepted the word of the administrator of Greenwich University—the so-called university on Norfolk Island—that this Internet university would function only on one island. This is the level of intelligence that is applied to the task before this minister when it comes to his ministerial responsibilities. He refused to answer questions that I put to him on these matters; he said that these were matters for the education department and for everybody except him. When it came down to the facts of the matter, he accepted the notion that he as minister could accept the guarantee or assurance that an Internet university would operate on only one island, which is a remarkable discovery.
Every single allegation that I have made about Greenwich University and the incompetence of this minister in allowing these matters to proceed has been demonstrated to be correct. So when Senator Macdonald talks to us about the opposition asking too many questions and being concerned with too much detail about the operations of this department, we have to look at the record. We have to look at whether or not the position that we have been arguing is confined to just this side of the chamber. I think the evidence is pretty clear. He has demonstrated his incompetence time and time again. While Senator Ray was particularly generous to him today—
—Incredibly generous.
—yes, incredibly generous—the situation that has arisen may not necessarily be measured against the facts of how this minister has treated this parliament and the Senate estimates committee.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-06-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked today relating to taxation.
Several questions were put to Senator Kemp today at question time.
—As Senator Sherry said, questions were put but answers were not given. These were questions about the government's policy towards small business, in particular, and about the small business sector being now in decline. Senator Kemp accused the opposition of selectively quoting from the Australian business expectation quarterly report that came out recently. We refute that completely. I want to read the short-term trend comment on the facing page of this document, which is freely available:
TrendSelling prices continue to trend downwards with businesses expecting that Selling prices will decrease by 0.2% in the September quarter 2001. In trend terms, businesses expect that Operating income will fall by 1.2%. Businesses are also expecting decreases in Profit and full-time equivalent Employment. Tax reform and the exchange rate are the most frequently cited reasons for the poor outlook.
In the time I have, I will not go on reading from that extract, but it is all there.
—Prices are down, is that right?
—It is all there in that report. This is what this minister could not answer, because it is too embarrassing for this government, which has always claimed that it looks after small business, to admit what it has done to small business since the introduction of the so-called tax reform. Another report that came out in May this year is the Yellow Pages business index, which has sometimes given good reports to the government, and they have been happy to quote them in this chamber. The index in May recorded the lowest level of support for the Howard government's policy since it was elected in 1996. The results reflect small business' dissatisfaction with the coalition, their negative perception of the coalition's economic management credentials, and deep-seated concern about the GST environment.
Small business confidence levels are at one of the lowest levels since the establishment of the index early in the 1990s, adding to the three previous quarters' negative results. According to the survey results, small business is most concerned about lack of work, sales, the GST and cashflow. In addition, employment recorded the first negative outcome since mid-1998, with small business experiencing a two per cent decrease in the number of people they employ. The Yellow Pages report in May confirms and backs up the most recent report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics about business expectations for the September quarter 2001 leading on to the June quarter 2002. This government does not recognise that it is now the biggest taxing, biggest spending government as a percentage of GDP in the history of Australia other than at the time of war.
—That's a lie.
—No, it is absolutely right. And who am I quoting? I say to Senator Campbell—
—Senator Ian Campbell.
—Yes, Senator Ian Campbell.
—to Senator Ian Campbell, I should say—I am not quoting from some left-wing institute. I am quoting from an organisation which Senator Kemp's father founded: the Institute of Public Affairs. Senator Kemp's father was the founding director of the right-wing think tank. And who wrote a story that appeared in last Saturday's Daily Telegraph? Michael Duffy, who is not noted for being a left-wing commentator or sympathiser in any sense of the word. He said:
Earlier this year the right-wing Institute of Public Affairs produced data showing the Howard government was the biggest taxing and spending in Australia's history, when tax was measured as a proportion of GDP ...
It is simple and unequivocal. I do not see a letter from the Treasurer or from Senator Kemp saying he has it wrong.
—You do not read very well, do you?
—I look forward to the response proving this bloke is wrong and that the IPA is wrong. It also says:
The IPA, as we know, goes further. It is a situation the Government might be regarding with some disquiet: the IPA competing with the ALP to see who can be the most critical of the Coalition.
He goes on to quote Mr Crean:
Mr Crean says that while Peter Costello “boasts of giving taxpayers $12 billion in personal income cuts”, this is “just half the $23 billion [that] personal income tax rose between the election of the Howard Government and the introduction of the GST.”
So there we have it: this government is the highest taxing, highest revenue, highest spending, and it is doing small business in. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2001-06-25,"—I want to take up some of the statements made by Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht said, inter alia, that the Howard government was the biggest spending and the biggest taxing government in Australian history. He related that back to the GDP. Just assume it is true—which I repudiate. This is a government that has built up the GDP. This is a government that has had, earned and brought about the biggest GDP in this nation's history. Of course there is going to be a bigger tax area on that. But if you break it down and say, `Is this a bigger tax on companies?' of course it is not. In 2000-01, company tax dropped from 36 per cent to 34 per cent. Next fiscal year, 2001-02, it is going to drop from 34 per cent back to 30 per cent. Is that a high taxing government? When there are $12 billion worth of personal tax cuts that are flowing back through the community that are benefiting small and medium businesses, is that a high taxing government?
To make a statement like that is not just utter and total ignorance but is disturbing because, whatever you like to think about the Labor Party, they are the only alternative government to the people on this side, who wish incidentally to retain the treasury bench. They are the only alternative government, but you cannot make sense of what they say. Let me tell you about what Labor propose to do with respect to taxation: we know that they are going to keep the GST. This is a Howard-Beazley GST at the moment. At the same time they said they are going to roll it back, they have said they are going to increase spending on defence, roads, research and development and local government. 
It is very interesting that Senator Mackay is not here today, because Senator Mackay said in 1999 at a meeting of local government people here in Canberra that her government, God forbid, would give 6½ per cent of the GST take to local government. Not only is Mr Beazley—a bloke who has not done much in his life, who has never done particularly anything, except that he has been off to get educated, and that is laudable, but he has no life experience—going to roll back the GST but he is also giving 6½ per cent of the GST to local government. On top of that, they are going to spend on education, defence, roads and R&D.
Where is the spending coming from if the Labor Party are going to roll back the GST? One assumes that the rate is going to drop. What is the rate going to drop to? When is the policy coming out that will tell the people of Australia the rate to which the GST is going to drop when the Labor Party assume the treasury bench? I will tell you what is going to happen. It is going to be something like this: there are going to be 10 of Labor's numerous tax options, or all of these options. There is going to be an increase in the GST rate, not a decrease. If you are going to give 6½ per cent of it to local government, how can you possibly roll back the GST as well? There will be increases in the GST rate, increases in personal income tax. All that work that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister did to make sure that decent, hardworking people of Australia pay a lower tax regime is going to be undone. Company tax is going to go back up from 30 per cent to 36 per cent again. Superannuation rates are going to go up from nine per cent to 15 per cent. Capital gains tax is going to go back up from the 25 per cent or thereabouts that it is today to 50 per cent again. Look at company tax: it is going to be the ruination of this country. If Labor get in, they are going to be high taxing; they are going to be high spending.
We know that the so-called Knowledge Nation is a regurgitated mantra from the Whitlam era. That is going to be, in itself, a high cost introduction. It does not matter about work. At least Senator George Campbell knows something about work—he is straight from the union. If your blokes did not work, Senator Campbell, they did not get paid. But not Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley says he is going to roll back the GST and he is going to leave taxation where it is; he is going to spend up big and he is not going to increase taxation. What a laugh! When are we going to see some policies? Show some decency and tell us your policies.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-25,"—In case anyone in the Senate does not know it, we are taking note of the four questions put to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about the impact of the GST on small business. After that contribution from Senator Lightfoot, I would not be surprised if anyone in the chamber wondered what on earth Senator Lightfoot was talking about. He has one trait consistent with the Assistant Treasurer: he will not answer a question. There were four questions put to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about the impact of the GST, detailed with case studies and research—not from the Labor Party but from independent community organisations—about the profit slumps, the profit downgrades, the decrease in employment, the blow-out in payment times, the cash flow squeeze and the increase in compliance and bankruptcies, which are just part of the impact on Australia's small businesses as a result of the GST.
Of course, the GST is a massive new tax that is unlike the old wholesale sales tax, which it replaced. The old wholesale sales tax had 60,000 businesses that collected it; the GST has imposed tax collection obligations on two million businesses—mainly small businesses—in this country. In addition, we have the massive compliance obligations, the massive paperwork, the time and effort, and the struggle of most small businesses to collect the GST via the now infamous business activity statement, commonly known as the BAS. Ask Senator Kemp about the virtues of the BAS and the GST for small business. The only time he approached relevance in the four opportunities he had today was to claim that the GST means that `small business experience a cash flow advantage'. That is a quote straight from the mouth of Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. There is a `cash flow advantage' for small business. You go and tell small business that, Senator Lightfoot, and ask them what they think.
Some weeks ago, Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, talked about the GST being good for small business because it imposed discipline on small business, as if it is the task of government to impose discipline on small business. How far out of touch—and how tricky—has this Liberal government got when it claims that it has to impose discipline on small business? Of course, the Labor Party has been warning, time and time again, for many months, up to and since the introduction of the GST, of the impact on small business. Sadly, and unfortunately, many of the criticisms we made about the impact of the GST have come true. I refer here to a number of recent criticisms and I will start with one that comes not from the Labor Party but from the Reserve Bank. The quarterly statement on monetary policy in May from the bank stated:
... the recent fall in sales and business confidence has been more pronounced for the small business sector than for medium and large businesses ... this may reflect the small business sector's disproportionately large share in construction, manufacturing and retail trade sectors.
The RBA also said that the bedding down of the GST led to a compression of profit margins in small business, a compression which saw small business profits rise by only one per cent for the year 2000 compared to a seven per cent rise for big business. Big business love the GST: they can take advantage of the cash flow and they can put it on the short-term money market. But small business cannot take advantage of that.
We had the BAS changes. The Financial Review of 8 May pointed out that the tax office has granted an extension to the deadline not just once but twice for small business to complete BAS paperwork. We have had Mr Macfarlane's comments of 11 May when he said the GST was bound to cause more work and inconvenience for people. This is a strong indictment of the government's claims that the GST would make the tax system simpler. Senator Kemp said today that there are more amendments coming into the Senate. We are going to be faced with hundreds of additional amendments on top of the 1,650 we have had so far since 1 July to further amend the GST. How messy it is; how complicated it is. It is no wonder that every small business I talk to in Tasmania is drowning under the amendments and the paperwork.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2001-06-25,"—Labor, in taking note of these questions this afternoon, throws out a challenge for us to debate the economy. That is a challenge that I think anybody on this side of the house can take. With the GST, small business and the effect of the GST on small business, we have a good record and we can stick to our guns on it. We will keep on doing so until the election.
Australia has experienced strong growth in the March quarter and the economy grew by 1.1 per cent while Labor were talking the economy down in an attempt to grab a cheap headline. The Senate needs to be reminded of the atmospherics of the opposition frontbench on the day that the 1.1 per cent March figure came down. They were completely deflated by that good economic news that was good for Australia. Australia was the only country in our region that had that growth. The March quarters for Thailand, the Philippines and Japan were all negative. The figures for America are not yet out. So that was a very good result for us and we should be reminding the Labor Party of it.
Labor is very confused about the economy. In August last year, the Senate will recall that the opposition leader said that the GST was to blame for interest rate rises, but in February this year he said that the GST is to blame for interest rate cuts. Also in February this year, Mr Beazley said that the new tax system would overheat the economy, but a month later he said that the new tax system had mugged the economy and delivered a king hit, slowing it down.
—Who's the mug?
—Exactly. This lot will do or say anything for a vote. They are confused. They have no policy initiative and no policy backbone. The truth is that the March quarter accounts showed that virtually every sector of the economy grew. Our trade surplus also continued to grow and is running at a surplus of $200 million a month. The most recent ABS data show that the largest increase in consumer confidence in 25 years was recorded in June. That is far from Labor's claim that the GST has mugged the economy. Interest rates are, of course, at their lowest in 30 years, compared to the staggering 17 per cent housing rates under Labor. They were even higher for primary producers, some of whom paid 24 per cent. 
I want to comment on housing rates as they are quite topical in relation to the Aston by-election. In Aston, 82.5 per cent of residents have a mortgage or are buying their own house. That is one of the highest proportions of people paying off their homes of any electorate in the country. Interest rates for the electors of Aston are vitally important. There can be no more important issue for those 82.5 per cent of people buying their own houses in Aston. Under Labor they were paying between 10 per cent and 12 per cent for their mortgages. They are now paying less than seven per cent to eight per cent. That is at least $300 per month more money in their pockets in their after tax income in respect of a mortgage of about $100,000. 
With regard to the comments about roll-back and the changes that Mr Beazley proposes with roll-back, of course we do not know what they are. There was a wonderful report in the Herald Sun last week which stated:
The Federal Labor Party has promised to create 43 new bureaucracies and new government offices if it wins the next election.
A study of Labor policies released so far shows the Opposition is likely to embark on a massive expansion of Commonwealth bureaucracy, hiring thousands of public servants.
The 43 new bodies including advisory councils, taskforces, committees, agencies, bureaus, auditors, commissions and ombudsmen.
In my experience, when you cannot decide things, when you have no idea of a policy framework and when you are involved in a policy paralysis, what do you do? You create another committee. And what committees there will be! There is one here called the office of population, but there is a much more interesting one. Number one is the national workforce forecasting council. They probably do need some advice as to what the unemployment rate will be. There will be a big role for that council to play under a Labor government. The rate will go up to 11 per cent as it did under Mr Beazley when he was employment minister. I also notice that there is a committee to advise on GST roll-back. I am pleased to see that the Labor Party has a committee on GST roll-back because they talk a lot about roll-back, but they give absolutely no indication of where it might be or how it might take place.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-06-25,"—It is remarkable how this government, its ministers and its backbenchers simply ignore the mass of evidence that is available which clearly demonstrates how the GST has mugged this economy and, more importantly, how it has wreaked havoc on the small business community. There is a multitude of evidence out there on how the GST has impacted on the small business community.
We heard a lot of the evidence, albeit before the event, when we travelled around the country with the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System. Even then, before the GST had been introduced, small business were aware of the potential impact the new tax system was going to have on them. We heard additional evidence when Labor held its inquiry around the country into the rise in the petrol excise. There were hearings the length and breadth of the country in which we talked to small business people about the impact of the tax system on them. We heard evidence from independent truck owners, banana growers, petrol station owners, fishermen and community organisations about the impact of the paperwork on the small business community in terms of increased work for small businesses in trying to comply with the new tax system. We heard about the number of hours that small business people were having to put in, over and above what they used to have to put in, to meet those compliance requirements. More importantly, we heard of the additional costs that small business had to pay for their accountants to assist them to get through the mass of paperwork involved.
We also heard from small business about the impact of the new tax system on their cash flow. That was something they had not expected, but it was something that had become very apparent when the tax system started to operate. They have really been slugged by this new tax system. I find remarkable—and it is quite an insight—the sorts of responses you get from small business, and this is not just anecdotal. I read an article by Allesandra Fabro in the Financial Review of 12 June, which states:
The Australian Taxation Office has recognised the need for better internal coordination in its treatment of small business in an effort to reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers. The Deputy Commissioner for Small Business, Mr Neil Mann, said tax reform had forced the change in approach. Mr Mann went on to say, `I guess we've long known the time cost to businesses of compliance record keeping, but we probably need to go to the next step. The next step includes working with software developers to embed tax record keeping operations in the commercially available software. It also involves acknowledging that very small businesses are often unable to keep the records the tax office has expected in the past. The area we'd like to explore—
this is Mr Mann speaking—
is understanding better how they run their business and aligning our requirements to that rather than expecting them to operate as a small to medium enterprise or a larger business.'
That is 12 months after the tax has been introduced. Twelve months after the tax has been introduced, here is the tax office—here is the Deputy Commissioner for Small Business—saying, `We'd like to understand better how they run their business.' That demonstrates that they did not understand what the impact of the GST would be on small business. They never took it into account when they introduced the GST. The GST has had a major impact on the small business community. It has imposed on them a cost burden that is driving many of those businesses to the wall. We are consistently hearing from small business operators and independent operators how they are on the verge of bankruptcy and how they are on the verge of winding up their businesses. Under this government, through its new tax system and the requirements imposed on those small businesses by the Australian Taxation Office, they do not have the capacity to meet those administrative burdens that have been placed upon them, and any resources that they generate in terms of profits are going out the window to try to meet that compliance.

—I move:
That the Senate endorse the finding contained at page 12 of the 96th report of the Committee of Privileges.
On 28 February 2001, the Senate referred the following matter to the Committee of Privileges, on the motion of Senator Collins:
In relation to the evidence provided to the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee in the in the course of its estimates hearings:
(a) whether false or misleading evidence was given in relation to the proposed provision of copies of Australian workplace agreements by the Employment Advocate; and
(b) whether there was improper interference with witnesses, namely the Employment Advocate and the Acting Employment Advocate, in respect of their evidence.
On 3 May 2000 Mr Jonathan Hamberger, Employment Advocate, gave evidence to the employment committee. In response to a request that certain individual Australian workplace agreements be made available to the committee, Mr Hamberger undertook to do so. On 9 May Mr Hamberger wrote to the employment committee advising that he was now of the view that it would not be appropriate for him to provide the committee with copies of the AWAs. Mr Hamberger's change of view was followed up at a hearing on 30 May, which he was unable to attend. What appeared to be different reasons for refusal, based on new but undisclosed legal advice, were given by the Acting Employment Advocate. Further evidence on the matter was given at two subsequent hearings, on 14 August and 7 December 2000. As a result of evaluating the answers given throughout the series of hearings, and also written answers to certain questions taken on notice, Senator Collins raised the two questions which became the subject of the inquiry undertaken by the Committee of Privileges.
Having considered the complex material before it, and in particular detailed responses to its invitation to make submissions, the Committee of Privileges has been able to conclude that no false or misleading evidence was given before the employment committee and that there is no evidence to suggest that improper interference with witnesses in respect of their evidence has occurred. The Committee of Privileges has therefore made a finding that there is no evidence to support any conclusion that a contempt of the Senate has occurred in respect of the matter referred to it.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2001-06-25,"—The purpose of the bill before us is to amend the Dairy Produce Act 1986 with the aim of establishing a supplementary dairy assistance scheme. The bill was introduced in May of this year and referred immediately to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry.
Prior to July 2000, the Australian dairy industry consisted of two sectors. These entailed the fluid milk or market milk sector and the manufacturing milk sector. They were both supported by governments at state or Commonwealth level. The government's milk marketing arrangements introduced from 1 July 2000 resulted in there no longer being any formal quantitative controls on the supply or price of milk sold for drinking. Fluid milk prices, supplies and products are now determined by market forces, although it seems that the market is still in a period of transition.
The Commonwealth government once provided support at the farm gate on a cents per litre basis to assist dairy farmers under the scheme of payments for manufactured milk as well as the levy on domestic dairy product sales, which ceased in June 2000. The Commonwealth government's response to deregulation of the dairy industry was the new dairy legislation that commenced on 1 July 2000. The new dairy industry adjustment package comprised three components: the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, the Dairy Exit Program, and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. I will come back to the Dairy Regional Assistance Program in a moment. It is becoming increasingly worrying to me and to others on this side that we continually hear about industries being offered exit programs and funding to exit. Many of those who exit the dairy industry will exit not only the industry but also generations of family farming. That is something that we need to take more closely into consideration when we come to the rationalisation of industry, be it rural or manufacturing.
Since the implementation of these policies, the evident outcomes have been major falls in farm gate milk prices in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia, with minor falls noticed in Victoria and Tasmania. It is also evident that business profits per farm are expected to decline in all states except Tasmania, which is in line with the reduction in farm gate milk prices. I refer the Senate to the October 1999 report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee entitled Deregulation of the Australian Dairy Industry. In its introduction to the chapter on the social and regional impacts deregulation, the report states:
The social impact and that on regional economies was an issue of major concern in submissions and evidence. Many of the dairy farming communities are closely linked to the economic performance of their dairy industry—the industry underpins the economic sustainability of many regional communities.
The transfer of wealth from rural products to the cities was seen as an undesirable effect of deregulation. Profits going to family farms stay in the community ...
That needs to be highlighted because, as with all things with rationalisation, modernisation or regulations of this nature, there is an impact, and that impact, in large part, is human in nature. Not only small communities but also larger communities can suffer these effects. The committee report went on to state:
Dairy Farmers used the example of their plant at Bomaderry, NSW. The plant produces packaged milk and condensed milk for export, principally to Japan. The company advised:
Deregulation of market milk will probably mean that the milk packaging plant will become unviable as processors like ourselves are forced to rationalise to compete. The condensed milk plant will be in jeopardy because of the loss of the DMS scheme and also due to the fact that it would be difficult to support either of the two sections of the plant on their own. The closure of the Bomaderry plant would mean the loss of many jobs, which would compound the loss to the community due to the decrease in milk payments occasioned by farm-gate deregulation.
The real winners out of what is proposed and what is occurring will be the government. It is attempting to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars in tax from dairy farmer payout packages. The government is yet to demonstrate a coherent plan for the long term future of the dairy industry. If the bill passes through parliament, we will see $1.9 billion being committed by milk consumers to support dairy farmers as a consequence of deregulation of the industry. The government is seeking to get back the money that it is offering. The critical element of the package is the extra $20 million for the DRAP. That, again, is an admission by the government that it has grossly underestimated the impacts of deregulation on regional communities. Deregulation has devastated dairy farmers' incomes, devalued their farms and made it difficult for farmers and their families to obtain credit from financial institutions.
The Howard government has not provided a cent to support the industry and has as a result managed to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars in tax from the farmer package payouts. Dairy farmers are currently struggling with low prices, reduced farm values and, as I said earlier, the very unsympathetic banks who do not see them as a worthy investment any longer. The Howard government has failed to deliver a long-term plan. It has shown no leadership in this at all. Until we have a plan that properly directs the industry to the future, we have a very hard road to go down as far as the industry itself is concerned. 
The government has failed in what it has been attempting to do in a number of areas. It has failed to deliver a long-term plan to the industry. We need a government to show leadership when an industry that is so vital to so many small communities is under siege as it is now. We need the leadership from government, and this government has failed to provide it. We need the government to show some leadership and prepare the industry to meet the substantial environmental challenges it faces in many communities. That again is not happening. The government does not seem to understand the vital role it has to play in helping regional communities. It suggests that it is giving money to assist but in fact it is doing it over such a time frame that it is really bringing the money back into the coffers. It is a gift at a price.
The committee that looked into this made a number of conclusions. It was firmly of the view that if deregulation is effected on 1 July 2000 there must be an adequate and effective restructure package in place. To date that has not been the case. That package needs to be in place in order to ameliorate the immediate effects on farmers' incomes and the long-term regional impacts. The package must comprise three elements. There needs to be compensation for loss of income. That is a reasonable thing: if the industry is to be restructured, there must be a package there that is properly structured to give compensation to those who will not be surviving the newly framed industry. There needs to be appropriate compensation for the loss of asset values, particularly where a quota is concerned, and there needs to be a regional adjustment component appropriately developed in conjunction with the states. Unless those things are in place, it would appear to me that we have an industry that is just going to drop out of the system and leave Australia short in what has been for many years very important for all.
The government has done nothing to stimulate further research and development in the dairy industry. As one who has been through many restructures with industry, I believe that a large component of the research and development must rest with the industry, but there must be suitable financial incentives and packages for that industry to investigate new methods, better systems, new products and better marketing plans. The government has fallen short in that area as well.
We need the government to do something about ensuring that its latest package is fair and equitable. On my reading, I believe there are a number of discrepancies that leave the package as somewhat unfair and inequitable to a number of communities and a number of dairy farmers and their supporting industries. The concerns I raise are not just those that I have found myself. They are not just from emails, as Senator McGauran suggested about comments made by my colleague Senator Hogg this morning. All things have to be weighed up, as I am sure my colleague would have weighed up those emails. The comments of the farmers to the inquiries must be listened to and acted upon. I would be the last to suggest that I would be an expert of any sort in this place on the dairy industry. My knowledge does not go very much further than the supermarket and the cold storage section. But I do know enough about relying on experts—in this case those people who have been working in the industry and have had the family business passed down through generations. 
The farmers feel, and have expressed, great uncertainty in their lives as a result of the government's poor handling and the incompetence it has shown in this area of deregulating the industry. It comes out very strongly in the comments from the farmers that they feel very let down by the degree of incompetence. The farmers are concerned, too, about the ageing of the dairy industry, and the exodus of young families and young people away from the farm and away from the smaller communities to seek opportunities in larger cities and larger regional centres. This is something that is expressed not only in the dairy industry but in the rural farming industry more generally. We hear ministers, such as Minister Minchin today, get up and tell us how proud they are of the creation of jobs. But for each job that has been created they need to tell us how many jobs have disappeared because of changes that have been brought about by this government. We need both sides of the story. I do not think there is any joy in telling us that.
Supermarkets' margins on products have widened, but they are not being passed on to the farm gate or the farmer, the one who is producing, and that is creating a lot of difficulties. Hence we go back to the difficulties that dairy farmers have in taking hold of opportunities that in years gone by may have been available to them through the banks; they no longer have the ability to borrow money to diversify or, in fact, go elsewhere. The national competition policy is an area that the farmers themselves are very concerned about; it has caused very grave concern to all those who are involved. Likewise, they have concerns with the ACCC, which prevents them from collectively bargaining on the price they receive for their produce.
Farmers really are suffering as a result of what this government is doing to the industry, and the amendments that have been put forward by Senator Forshaw go some way to addressing that suffering. The other amendments put before me I have not had a good look at yet in order to cast a fair comment on them. But certainly those amendments put forward by Senator Forshaw, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I believe merit the support of this chamber.
The personal impact on the families of dairy producers, I have been through. However, one family losing out in the industry reflects on the whole community, going through to their buying products from the local grocery store and their buying goods and services from the local stock trading post; rather, they go to the larger areas where they can get better prices, and so those support industries suffer also. It flows through to the closing of banks and the difficulties that this creates for farmers in dealing with their banks. These farmers have had massive reductions in prices at the gate, which have resulted in great slumps in local land prices.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-06-25,"—I have to begin by saying that the Howard government's response to the difficulties currently facing the Australian dairy industry provides a clear insight into how this government operates. The government's approach to dealing with these problems also highlights how it sees its role in advancing the interests of people living in regional communities. The government's dairy adjustment strategy also exposes its lack of vision—not only for dairy farmers and dairy dependent regions, but for regional Australia generally. Since it came to power in 1996, the government's approach to this key industry also provides a sharp contrast with that of the former Labor government—and, I would expect, a future Labor government.
The Australian dairy industry suffered a severe downturn in the early 1970s, when it lost its traditional market in the United Kingdom. The government's response at that time proved to be one of the low points in public administration in this country. I am sure that senators—or at least some—would recall the scandal surrounding the Australian Dairy Council and Asia Dairy Industries around this time. Allegations about these organisations related to bungles, scandals, criminal behaviour and ministerial breaches of international trading arrangements—and ministerial heads should have rolled at that time, but they did not.
—Who was that—Bob Collins?
—If you do not know who was in power in the early 1970s, Senator Macdonald, then you had better get back to your parliamentary digest. A number of matters surrounding this scandal were the subject of not one but two Federal Police investigations, and they were also the subject of a Senate inquiry. In the early 1980s dairy farmers again suffered an external shock—this time as a result of access restrictions and market corrupting export subsidies put in place by Northern Hemisphere producers.
In contrast to its conservative predecessors, the Labor government, in cooperation with dairy farmers, developed a plan to take the industry forward. The government accepted that it had an important role to play in taking this industry forward, and it accepted that role. As a result, the Kerin plan was introduced. This was a plan to manage adjustment, support domestic market sales and promote exports. It was a plan that also promoted increased efficiency by linking company returns to world prices. It was a plan that gave the Australian dairy industry confidence that it had a bright future and that it had a plan to get there. It was a plan that was not simply a financial prop but provided for a phased reduction in domestic support so as to promote industry rationalisation. That scheme was funded by a national levy of 2c per litre on all milk produced by Australian dairy farms. These funds were used to provide an export support payment for all dairy product exports. That support was wound back from 44.2 per cent above world parity to 22 per cent over the period 1986 to 1992.
The Crean plan came into effect on 1 July 1992. That plan continued to facilitate adjustment, while phasing down the level of support for the industry. It was replaced by the Collins plan, which was also known as the Domestic Market Support Scheme, and that came into effect on 1 July 1995. That scheme supported manufactured products, and it had the effect of raising the cost of products consumed domestically. Under that scheme, annual payments were made to dairy farmers, based on their production of manufacturing milk. Funds for payments from the scheme were generated through a levy on milk used to produce manufactured dairy products sold on the domestic market and a separate levy on milk used in the market milk sector. That plan was also designed by government and industry to progress adjustment in a managed and orderly fashion. That plan—as was known when it commenced on 1 July 1995—ceased to have effect as at 30 June last year.
It is interesting to note that, in the period 1991 through to this year, the projections on the rate of growth of production of milk in the industry have grown from somewhere in the vicinity of 6½ billion litres of milk to 11½ billion litres of milk in that time. So, whilst there was an intent that there be rationalisation in the industry and that the industry drive towards exports, there was also exponential growth in production.
These plans, developed by both the former Labor government and the industry, have seen the total milk production almost double. The dairy industry is now a highly efficient export oriented industry. Less than 18 per cent of milk is used for drinking products and the remainder is used to produce manufactured dairy goods. Australia exports around 50 per cent of its milk production. The excellent performance of Labor governments in supporting this industry has to be beyond question. This is an outcome that was not envisaged in the 1970s, when the industry was in a parlous condition.
The change in government in March 1996 meant a change in approach. Unlike the previous Labor governments, which planned well ahead in managing change, the Howard government did nothing. It had years to work with the industry to develop a plan to manage the pressures flowing from the end of the Domestic Market Support Scheme and state based regulation, but the Howard government did nothing. The parliament and the dairy farmers were then confronted with a ridiculous time frame in which to develop—and, in the case of the parliament, to consider—a plan to manage the industry post deregulation. These new arrangements—the dairy industry adjustment package—comprised three programs: the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, the Dairy Exit Program and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. The bills to implement the government's plan were not introduced into the House of Representatives until 8 March last year—in the year the DMS was to end.
That legislation was referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee on that day. The Senate asked the committee to examine those bills to determine whether they met their stated aim of providing financial assistance to dairy farmers to enable them to manage further deregulation with minimal financial disruption. However, the committee was not provided with any detail as to how the scheme was to operate until just prior to the second day of public hearings, on 14 March. That was the day before the committee was required to report to the Senate. The result was that the manner in which the scheme was to operate was not properly considered. While it was clearly the opposition's view that the scheme was not given proper consideration, we were concerned that any significant delay in putting something in place could have a significant financial implication and place a significant financial burden on a large number of dairy farmers. 
This change—the change that occurred post 1 July 2000—was very significant. Before 1 July 2000, the industry's two sectors—the liquid milk, or market milk sector, and the manufacturing milk sector—both enjoyed support by governments, either state or Commonwealth. The opposition felt that we had no choice but to pass the legislation, even though it was concerned that many farmers would suffer significant disadvantage. But those problems were all of the government's making. The government gave itself little time—and the parliament, frankly, no time at all—to ensure that what it proposed would do the job. For example, at the time, the opposition were concerned that Minister Truss's scheme might disadvantage lessors. I recall making contributions in this chamber about that, as I am sure do other senators. We were right. 
The opposition were also concerned that the time frame set to process applications for assistance under the scheme was too tight. That has also proven to be the case. We were concerned that many farmers who had a legitimate right to assistance because of deregulation might find that under the Truss scheme they had no legal right. Again we were right. The dairy industry and the many regional communities that relied on it were faced with a hastily developed and implemented plan, and many of those farmers and communities are now paying the price. We are now dealing with a second package of assistance measures only because of the mess created by the government with its first attempt.
I want to make some comments on two aspects of the first Truss plan, as I will call it. The Dairy Exit Program provides a lump sum payment of up to $45,000 tax free to those dairy farmers wishing to leave agriculture. The dairy exit package is part of the Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme, originally set up as the Farm Family Restart Scheme in 1997. This government put in place funding of $30 million, not paid out of consolidated revenue but paid out of the levy imposed on liquid milk purchases. To date only 32 farmers have successfully accessed this program.
The Dairy Regional Assistance Program had a budget of $45 million over three years—which I understood was to be expended at the rate of $15 million a year—to assist dairy dependent communities affected by deregulation. The Dairy Regional Assistance Program is intended to help eligible communities by supporting business investment and community infrastructure development and providing community access to training and counselling services. There have been three rounds of funding allocations under the Dairy Regional Assistance Program to date, which include, amongst other things, funding for a polocrosse field and funding for a private school wine appreciation group to promote the wine industry.
To say that this adjustment program has been a shambles is an understatement. One would have thought the government might have learnt something from the shambles of the first attempt to put in place appropriate support for dairy farmers, but apparently it did not. As with the first package, the Senate committee was asked to consider a revised plan without access to any detail as to how this second plan would operate. The committee did not receive the details of the plan until after it had concluded its public hearings. There was therefore no proper chance for the committee to ask the industry what it thought of the plan. Again, committee members were being asked to take the government on trust.
Apart from the administrative problems that inevitably flow when governments try to put programs into place in a rush, there is a fundamental flaw in the Howard government's approach to the dairy industry. That flaw is that there is no vision. The government has not developed a plan based on taking this industry forward; it has put in place a plan to deal with a short-term shock resulting from the end of deregulation. Here we are again being pressured to pass this bill because the government tells us it is urgent. It is the same argument as last time. It carries the same risks and, unfortunately, I fear we will see the same outcome.
It is interesting to note that in this debate we have seen comments from some other senators about the fact that we ended up with a deregulated industry. I am a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, which inquired into the deregulation of the Australian dairy industry, and there are some interesting findings that I would like to take the committee back to, bearing in mind that these were the unanimous findings of the committee. There was no dissent from these findings from the government members of the committee, from the members of the committee representing the minor parties and certainly not from the opposition. At point 8.2 on page 169, the committee said:
It seems certain that farmers and regional economies will suffer under deregulation and, at best, the position of the consumer will not be improved. The winners from deregulation in the short term are the two major co-operatives, other processor and manufacturing companies, if they can maintain supply and perhaps some Victorian farmers, depending on their individual circumstances. Long term beneficiaries may be the Australian dairy industry as a whole, but that will depend to a large extent on reforms at international level which will provide Australian farmers and manufacturers with a more level playing field.
Senators may well recall the response that this committee received from the government. It was 14 or 15 lines basically saying, `We've passed the dairy industry adjustment bill and that has solved the problem.' I do not think you could say anything except that the unanimous finding of the committee was spot-on. That finding, on page 169, really depicts how the industry finds itself today. 
What did the committee say about deregulation? Again, I stress that this was the unanimous, all party finding of this committee. At page 170, the committee said:
The Committee concludes that sooner rather than later the market will force deregulation and that a managed outcome with a soft landing is preferable to a commercially driven crash. The Committee also concludes that the proposed adjustment package will need significant refinement - there are questions in relation to its adequacy, targeting and the extent to which it fails to address the regional implications of the deregulation of the dairy industry which require determination.
Here we are back in this chamber tinkering with the package which, when it was brought before this chamber, was described as that which the industry wanted, that which the government supported and that which was going to fix the problem. Every problem that opposition senators or minor party senators raised about the package was rejected by the government, and I have outlined some of those areas—for example, the lessor situation. The government was adamant that there was no other solution but that which was contained in the package at that time. It thought that we would be irresponsible if we delayed the passage of the bill and that it was important that it be passed, notwithstanding the fact that we had concerns. The opposition and, I am sure, the minor parties thought that it was appropriate, as we had found, to have some sort of managed approach to ensure that there was a soft landing after deregulation rather than a deregulation forced by the market, which had already commenced in at least part of the liquid milk sector of the market.
Here we are today fixing the bungle created at that time and trying to put a few more bandaids on the problems, when the government should have known when they proposed the legislation that the areas that would have the greatest difficulty and face the greatest problems were particularly the states of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. And where are the problems? The problems are substantially in those three states, and they were the states that relied substantially on a guaranteed price for market milk, which subsidised the production of milk for what we call manufacturing milk products. They were the areas that the problems would always have occurred in, but the government did not want to take responsibility for that. They wanted to say, `The industry can put up a package and we'll fiddle with it.' In fact, the government reduced what the industry wanted at the start. They said, `We'll fiddle with it, and then we want to take credit for it.' The credit has now come back to bite the government, because there is not much credit for the government. They are casting about trying to blame everyone else but themselves for the problem that they are substantially responsible for.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-25,"—The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 is urgent and it is very important that the Senate pass the bill—it has already been dealt with by the House of Representatives this week—so that we can implement the provisions of the bill in time to help farmers and communities before the winter break of parliament. For those who may be following the debate, I have to clarify some of the issues that have been raised by Labor Party speakers, most of whom sought to score political points by misrepresenting both the history and the nature of this bill and its predecessor and also, in Senator O'Brien's case, by rewriting history so far as milk and the dairy industry is concerned.
I will just make it very clear that regulation of the dairy industry was a matter for the state governments. Regrettably, all of them, with one exception now and with two exceptions at the time the first bill went through, are Labor states. If anyone has any complaints about deregulation of the dairying industry, they should put those complaints to the Labor Party state governments. That is outside the purview of this particular chamber, but the absolute hypocrisy of Labor Party politicians by continuing to blame the federal government for deregulation knows no bounds when they know as well as anybody else that deregulation of the dairying industry was at the hands of the state governments, most of which were Labor. I do not say that they were easy times for the state governments to deal with, but they were the ones that could have dealt with it had they chosen to do so.
Senator O'Brien did at least give a partially correct history about the Commonwealth's involvement, the last of which was the Domestic Market Support Scheme. As Senator O'Brien rightly said—but he tried to hide the political impact of it—the support under that scheme concluded on 30 June 2000 because of an arrangement that was introduced by the federal Labor government. I do not recall but I suspect the coalition parties probably supported that when the federal Labor government introduced the scheme, but the reason why the federal government support finished on 30 June 2000 was that that was the detail of the scheme put in by the then government, which happened to be Labor. Those sort of points do not help the dairy farmers or dairy communities, but they do put into perspective the hypocrisy of Labor senators in attributing blame to this government for deregulation and stoppage of support which were the playthings of state Labor governments and a federal Labor government.
As everybody knows who seriously follows this debate, the federal government looked at it this way: there was deregulation at state level, the states were not doing anything about it, and there was going to be an enormous problem with dairy farmers and the dairying industry; so the federal government became involved, not in deregulation but in introducing a levy scheme that would help the farmers and communities through the worst aspects of deregulation. The federal government did that because the leaders of the dairying industry approached us and asked us to do it. That is what we have done to try and pick up the pieces that are there because of the inaction of the state governments.
I want to briefly sum up by highlighting the aspects of this amendment bill, but in passing I indicate to Senator Woodley—and Senator Woodley talked about deregulation—that we are trying to fix deregulation. That is what we are interested in; we are not interested in attributing blame. It is wrong of you and the Democrats, and anyone else, to accuse this federal government of being the cause of deregulation, rather than the states where it actually applies.
Senator Hogg made a contribution which did not pretend to be interested in the actual legislation. Senator Hogg was there simply to try and score a few political points and to try and continue the campaign of misinformation that has caused people like Mrs Stark, whom he quoted quite substantially, a lot of distress. Mrs Stark's tale is a sad tale but, again, Senator Hogg should have been saying to Mrs Stark, `I am sorry; it is the fault of the Queensland state Labor government that puts you in the position you are in.' He should have also said, `It is the fault of the previous Labor federal government that puts you in this position,' rather than encouraging Mrs Stark to not understand properly the reasons for the difficulty that the industry is in. We are not interested in attributing blame or scoring political points; we are interested in trying to fix the problem, and that is all we are interested in.
Senator Hogg talked about industry adjustment and seemed to blame the coalition government not only for this problem but also for any other problem. That is the sort of line that I recall Senator Hogg taking when we had the courage to address the pork industry, which was in diabolical trouble. You will remember, Senator McGauran, how Mr Howard went to a town in the South Burnett before the last election and was almost run out of town because of the misinformation that had been spread by the Labor Party about our proposals to help the pork industry. Mr Howard went back to the same town a couple of weeks ago, and they hailed him as a hero. It is the biggest thing since sliced ham.
—A little overstated but—
—Perhaps they did not hail him as a hero, but they were very happy to see him and very happy with the way he had handled the adjustment of their industry. 
—That is true. 
—Thank you for acknowledging that, Senator Woodley, as any fair and honest person would acknowledge. I re-emphasise to Senator Hogg—although I know he knows this, in spite of the fact that he says something different—that the work we did in this bill was done at the behest of, and in cooperation with, dairy industry leaders. He says that Mrs Stark says that the dairy industry leaders let her down. I do not imagine that is correct but, from a government point of view, we have to work with the industry. The industry can only work with governments through their industry organisations and the leaders that the industry themselves elect.
Senator Harris made a contribution that I found unusual and could not quite follow, but we will perhaps get on to that a bit further during the committee stage of the debate. Senator Buckland came in, and perhaps the most significant thing he said was that he really knew very little about the dairying industry. I agree with him there, and he certainly was accurate in that aspect. But he seemed to be blaming the government for helping people exit the industry. There are any number of cases through the history of government and across all government programs where, at appropriate times, governments have done the right thing to try to help people make a soft landing, to exit with dignity. If Senator Buckland wants to go through the history lessons, we can tell him the exit support that the previous Labor government gave in many industries—I do not blame them for that. One I recall off the top of my head was the timber industry, when the Labor government stopped logging in various areas. The Labor government, although they did it atrociously and incompetently, did at least attempt to ensure that those involved could exit the industry.
Senator Buckland was saying that people are left without any future. That is what this legislation is all about: to give them some future, to help them adjust and to help them move into perhaps beef cattle, which are doing pretty well at the moment. He talked about the regional impact of deregulation—again, we have done something about it. I say to you, Senator Forshaw, and if you would tell Senator Buckland: why didn't the states do something about the regional impact of deregulation rather than turning their backs and walking away from it, leaving it to the federal government to do? 
Senator Buckland did not seem to understand that the Dairy RAP program, the regional adjustment package for dairying, is all about regional development. It is trying to help people. You criticised us for a polo field. I do not know the details of that, but we have attempted to provide money for community groups to help them through this difficulty. If you accuse those who applied for funding for a polo field of doing something wrong, I will make sure that they know of your accusations and they will no doubt want to respond to you. But I am sure that all of those who have received money under the Dairy RAP package will be grateful for it and will realise that at least this government is interested in doing something to support regional communities.
I might also say for Senator Buckland's benefit that, if he wants to do something for regional communities, can he stop his party in this chamber and in the other chamber opposing every single program that this government has put in place to assist regional communities? He complained about banks closing. The Labor Party did nothing about that when they were in government. We have at least tried with the Rural Transaction Centres Program. What do we get from the Labor Party? We hear their spokesman continually carp about that program with never a positive suggestion, never any help. The shadow minister never turns up to any of these rural transaction centres when they are opened; we just hear carping all the time—criticism, negativity. The same with the telephone system—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I know the minister is trying to drag this out to get to 6.30 so that he can have his dinner, but we are actually debating the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001, not Telstra, not rural transaction centres. Could you ask the minister to get back to the topic, please? 
 (Senator Watson)—He has probably been distracted by your continual interjections, Senator Forshaw, which have not helped either.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, a further point of order: I accept your ruling, but the minister was actually addressing his remarks to a senator who is not even present in the chamber.
—There is no point of order.
—Senator, I was addressing them to you actually and I think you are in the chamber. I was talking about another senator who is not in the chamber but I was addressing my remarks to you. I think you are in the chamber. 
—Order! Senator Ian Macdonald, address your comments through the chair, please.
—I am simply going through the speeches of other senators who have made contributions and pointing out the absolute hypocrisy, in most instances, of the contributions they have made. For example, Senator Buckland blamed the dairy deregulation on the national competition policy. I do not agree with him but, if he is right, why didn't he tell the Labor government about it when they introduced the national competition policy? It is his own party's program that he is then criticising; again, we supported it at the time. Senator Buckland cannot have it all ways: his government introduced it but now he finds it politically expedient at this time to criticise it.
There are a lot of other issues I could debate with previous speakers in the second reading debate, but I am very keen to get this bill through. It is essential that we get it finished before the winter break, so it is important that we continue with it. I will briefly summarise by repeating that this amending legislation, this supplementary assistance bill, provides an additional $140 million on top of the $1.78 billion package that the previous bill provided to the dairy industry through this government. Senators will be aware that last year in the lead-up to the decision by all states to deregulate their fresh milk arrangements and as a result of a united request by the industry, the federal government put in place this very generous adjustment package to assist with the transition of the dairy industry to a deregulated environment. 
The falls, however, in the market milk prices have been greater and faster than anticipated by the industry. These falls have been most pronounced in the ex quota states—that is, Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales. Consequently, although the government anticipated the varied impact of deregulation and thus provided higher payments for market milk at 46.23c per litre, compared with manufacturing milk at 8.96c per litre, it became evident that we as a government, acting in the best interests of not only the industry and regional communities but also the nation, had to do more. The changes to the market milk regulations came about, regrettably, because of the decisions made in state parliaments that state governments would provide no compensation for removing the state based price support mechanism. That is why we have had to come back. One would have thought that, when the states removed their price support mechanisms, they would have at least put in place some program to help the industry through. Except for the coalition government in Western Australia, which stood out on its own here, none of the other states have provided any sort of compensation for the removal of their state based price support mechanisms. We have come to the party again, and we have provided this supplementary assistance. 
Most of the senators have indicated what this package is about: $100 million in the additional milk market payments to farmers who were most heavily dependent on the market milk production; $20 million for eligible people who, because of extraordinary circumstances, were excluded or their entitlements were significantly lower than normal under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program; and an additional $20 million for the Dairy Regional Assistance Program, Dairy RAP, which is doing so much in regional communities and which is being criticised so heavily by Labor senators. It is inevitable that, in any assistance measures of this nature, there will be producers who are concerned about their eligibility. We have heard examples of some of these during this debate. However, I make the point that the underlying principle of supplementary dairy assistance measures is to provide targeted assistance to those people and communities directly affected by the fall in market milk prices. This assistance is not about providing compensation or income support; it is about helping with the adjustment by those farmers who are most in need, thereby easing their transition to a deregulated market and providing wider public benefits to regional communities. 
In addition, the government accepts that a relatively small number of people have been denied or have received a lower adjustment package payment entitlement than they would normally have expected. A discretionary payment right is to be made available to address the interests of these people. The discretionary payment right will be available to dairy farm lessors in certain circumstances where there is evidence that the lessor would normally have been an owner-operator or where significant reliance and fall in lease income can be demonstrated. The government is responding to requests from the industry for additional assistance. 
The findings of the ABARE report were quite dramatic. They demonstrated in detail to the government that there was a need for additional assistance. The government is acting as quickly as it can to address the concerns of vulnerable dairy farmers and their communities. These new measures will deliver targeted and timely assistance to those dairy farmers and dairy communities most in need. I commend this legislation to the Senate. 
I repeat that this is an urgent bill. In spite of whatever objections the Labor Party or the Democrats or Senator Harris might have to some of the finer details of the bill, they will accept that it is very important that this legislation goes through before we rise on Thursday for the winter recess. The money is needed now. It needs to be put in place at this time. As well as commending the bill, I urge senators to deal with it expeditiously so that we can get it passed and so that the benefits can start to flow immediately.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2001-06-25,"—Last week in this chamber, the Labor Party continued its unprovoked and unsubstantiated attack on one of the Liberal Party's most dedicated and appreciated local members, the Hon. Jackie Kelly MP, the member for Lindsay. We all know that the Labor Party has a lot of time on its hands. If you do not have any policies or plans and are spiralling towards a federal election on a wing and a prayer, what else do you have to do except create a few diversions by criticising members of the other house? Given the nature of politics and the fierce competition surrounding the electorate of Lindsay, that is hardly surprising. What is surprising is that Senator Hutchins has been prepared to lend himself to this task and indulge in a spot of rhetoric to drum up some attention for his erstwhile staffer, the endorsed Labor candidate for Lindsay, Mr David Bradbury. He plans a little road trip during off sitting weeks, starting in Lindsay, dropping by Lyne and then heading north along the coastal track to Robertson—and then in this place disparaging the efforts of local members Miss Jackie Kelly, Mr Jim Lloyd and Minister Mark Vaile.
If Senator Hutchins were not spending his time driving along the coast, he would have been able to gain a better appreciation of Minister Kelly's very local and significant achievements in her electorate. Much as it galls the Labor Party, Miss Kelly has been endorsed by the people of Lindsay at no less than two federal elections and a by-election, winning and then retaining what was formerly a cast-iron Labor seat. Understandably, that is the pebble rolling back and forth in Senator Hutchins's loafer. But five years should be sufficient enough time to come to grips with Miss Kelly's successful incumbency. Five years has seen Miss Jackie Kelly put Penrith firmly on the electoral map; it has seen her develop a vision for the area formulated by listening and heeding the calls of her constituents; and it has seen the constituents of Lindsay being listened to in the Howard government policy debate, after being taken for granted and ignored by Labor for 13 years.
What the opposition lacks, besides policies, is any vision. It is all fine and good to complain, to criticise and to condemn, but what about an alternative? What about a solution? The short answer is that the Labor Party has none for Lindsay. Clearly, Mr Beazley, Senator Hutchins and the Labor candidate for Lindsay have no answers for the people of Western Sydney. But Miss Kelly and the Howard government do. Miss Kelly works tirelessly for the people of Lindsay and she has produced results. She has secured roads funding, education funding and employment funding and has secured a future for many Penrith residents by directing Commonwealth support towards providing a vision for Lindsay. The Labor Party has provided nothing except empty rhetoric and criticism to disguise the fact that, if elected, they would undo all that Miss Kelly and the people of Lindsay have accomplished.
Senator Hutchins devoted his time last week in the adjournment debate to the issue of the Defence land in the Lindsay electorate, the Australian Defence Industries—ADI—site. However, it is interesting to note that Senator Hutchins failed to mention the Labor Party's history on the ADI issue. The simple fact is that Labor conceived, developed and indeed gave planning approval to a mass housing estate on the ADI site. When you consider it was during the tenure of the former Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, that the agreement between Lend Lease and the federal government was signed, it would appear that it was the urban development Lindsay had to have. If you go back a bit further it was the then Labor Minister for Aviation, Mr Peter Morris, who stated:
Now at last the state government—
that is, Mr Neville Wran's government—
can get on with its plan for urban development on the Cumberland plain.
But wait, there is more. The member for Chifley, Mr Roger Price, has welcomed the approval of the residential and business development of the former ADI site at St Marys, according to his press release dated 19 January this year. The release echoes Mr Price's comments in 1997 in the House of Representatives where he urged the New South Wales Labor government to give the proposal the green light. Both Senator Hutchins and Mr Bradbury also failed to mention that it was the state Labor government that signed off on the 8,000 homes for the ADI site. To quote Senator Hutchins from June last year:
One lucky thing that came out of western Sydney is the fact that we have a sympathetic and caring state government.
How unfortunate then that the state government seems to have a very different take on the ADI site. The one lucky thing for the environment in Western Sydney is Miss Kelly, who insisted that the environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, visit the ADI site in 1998. 
Since being elected, Miss Kelly has been taking the concerns of the people she represents directly to those who can influence critical decisions—federal ministers and, indeed, the Prime Minister. It must be a great relief to the people of Lindsay that at last they have someone amongst them to champion their interests, a real local who understands their needs and who is prepared to stand up for her constituents, even if that means taking on really tough decisions such as insisting on a halt to building Badgerys Creek airport. Interestingly, Mr Bradbury has identified the key issues for Lindsay as including Badgerys Creek airport, employment, education and the GST. Tonight I will give the people of Lindsay a hand by explaining how Labor intends to address those issues deemed to be in the hearts and minds of the people of Lindsay.
Firstly, on Badgerys Creek: when talking to his local newspaper at the launch of his campaign in March, Mr Bradbury said the federal ALP needed to make clearer its position in opposition to a second airport in the Sydney Basin. He said that the only real option for a second airport is outside the Sydney basin. I think it is only fair to point out to Mr Bradbury that the ALP will build Badgerys Creek—full stop. Not only is it on the record; it is Labor Party policy. You just have to ask the member for Werriwa, Mr Mark Latham, or the member for Lowe, Mr John Murphy, or the member for Grayndler, Mr Anthony Albanese. Mr Latham spoke at length last year about the indisputable need for a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. Mr Murphy brought up the issue again in parliament last week. Mr Albanese made a sweeping exit earlier this year from the Sydney Airport Community Forum—of which, incidentally, I am chair—leaving his constituents unrepresented on the forum and stating to the media throng who accompanied him that building Badgerys would be a priority for the Labor government should they win the next election. You begin to see the inconsistencies.
But perhaps the most telling quote comes from the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, as to what he would do for Lindsay if he ever gets elected, and it is a quote from his biography. The quote is:
I think I've actually got a solution to it, in Badgerys Creek, but, you know, we didn't do it fast enough. There wasn't enough time to get through what we wanted to do before the election came on.
Mr Bradbury really should come clean and admit that his hands are tied on the issue of Badgerys Creek and that he wields no influence in the federal ALP over an issue as contentious as a second Sydney airport, particularly when the Labor Party is clearly committed to it.
As for employment, where has the federal Labor Party been on this issue? After 13 years of Labor, the Australian public was left with the legacy of high unemployment, peaking at 11.2 per cent in December 1992, when none other than Mr Beazley was employment minister, and with teenage unemployment hitting a scandalous 34.8 per cent. I can tell you where Miss Kelly has been on the issue of employment. She has been part of a coalition government that has, in contrast to Labor, done a great deal to get jobs up in Australia whereby in April 2000 Australia broke the nine million jobs mark.
Locally, Jackie Kelly has been at the announcement of more than $320,000 for the local GROW employment service to generate employment in Lindsay. This grant will create up to 100 jobs in the information technology arena, channel more than $75,000 into helping people with mental illness find a pathway back into employment, and assist with increasing new job opportunities through the development of an export culture amongst local businesses in the Penrith area. It is time for the Labor Party to come clean also on the issue of education. Thanks to Jackie Kelly, since 1996 this government has spent more than $28 million on capital works for local schools in Lindsay. 
Speeches in parliament are primarily reserved for meaningful matters which need to be brought to the attention of senators in the chamber and to the attention of our constituents. We can certainly have a constructive debate about Labor's lack of policy and about its trying to slide into government without facing up to the detail the electorate wants to see. But the people of Lindsay have been well warned that Labor is hopelessly divided on the ADI site and whether to build Badgerys Creek airport and terminally confused on tax policy. Come election time, the people of Lindsay should be selfish and put their own needs first. They need go no further than to re-elect Minister Kelly to listen, act and deliver on their behalf.
