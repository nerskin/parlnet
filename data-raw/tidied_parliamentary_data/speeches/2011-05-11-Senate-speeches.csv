Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  I rise to speak today on the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. The coalition will not be opposing this bill. The amendments to the Copyright Act have arisen due to some instances where pharmaceutical companies have launched claims of infringement of copyright in their product information documents. The use of copyright infringement has the potential to provide pharmaceutical companies with an extended period of market exclusivity once the patent over that medicine has ended. This has an effect on generic medicines, because the generic medicines industry in Australia provides important competition for medicines once they come off patent. We recognise the important role that generic medicines and their timely introduction into the marketplace play in the healthcare system. We understand the purpose of these amendments, which is basically to ensure that we still have timely introduction of generics into the market and, in turn, increased affordability and access to pharma­ceuticals in Australia.


This bill introduces two specific exemptions to copyright infringement under Australian law. The first exemption is that the use or lodgement of existing product information documents is not a copyright infringement when used to apply to register a medicine under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. This means that, for example, when a pharmaceutical company applies to the TGA for registration of a generic version of a medicine, they will not be infringing copy­right if they submit a draft product informa­tion document that contains text that is similar to the product information already approved for the originator medicine. The second exemption removes copyright infringement to the supply, reproduction, publication, communication or adaptation of the TGA approved product information sheets, provided that the use is for a purpose related to the safe and effective use of the medicine.


There has been some consultation with stakeholders, and there have been concerns raised about some potential unintended consequences. One could be the effect on product information publishers—for example, the publication of the reference handbooks that are widely used by practitioners. The issue is what impact the exemption of copyright will have on these reference books. There is also the potential for unintentional infringements to result in the reduction of intellectual property protections.


We believe that the amendments do not go any further than is necessary to ensure that the TGA continues to have the ability to approve product information sheets that are in similar forms for both the originator and generic brands of the same registered medicine. We will, however, continue to monitor the situation. As I said, there are some concerns, but we believe the bill does provide important exceptions to copyright to protect the timely introduction of generic medicines into the Australian pharmaceutical market. The opposition will not be opposing the bill.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (09:37):  Firstly, I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Copyright Act to allow the longstanding practice of the Therapeutic Goods Administ­ration to approve similar product information of prescription medicines regardless of the brand of medicine. The amendments go no further than is absolutely necessary to ensure that this practice can continue, and the government believes that they will restore the appropriate balance between ensuring safe and timely access to medicines and encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical industry through appropriate protections of intellectual property.

Senator McGAURAN,LP,2011-05-11,"



Senator McGAURAN
 (Victoria) (12:45):   I wish to raise in the Senate the tragic event of 29 January 2009 when high on the West Gate Bridge in peak-hour traffic a man named Arthur Freeman threw his four-year-old daughter off the bridge to her death. It was morning and Darcy was on her way to attend her first day of school. Arthur Freeman did so in a revenge act towards his former wife. This particular high-profile public act of horror weighs heavily on the minds and hearts of Victorians. It was an act that has wrought unspeakable misery. Its mere contemplation creates an unshakeable dread for so many. I will refer to just some of the victim impact statements made in the court. Kristine Gough, an ambulance officer, was among the first on the scene. She said:




I asked Darcy to fight to live, but she could not. I begged her verbally not to give up, but her body had.




Also called to the job was police officer Colleen Spiteri, who said:




I remember feeling so overwhelmed by what I was seeing and I turned back towards the footbridge and almost fell to the ground.



Spiteri went on to talk about what she said to the mother at the hospital:




I spoke to the girl's mother. I told her that her daughter was strong and fought hard. I told her that in the short time I was with her I loved her so that she had love around her.



I will not refer to the heart-wrenching family statements, though they were widely reported.


Arthur Freeman was convicted by the jury of consciously, voluntarily and intentionally tossing Darcy to her death. However, it took the jury five days to deliberate. The case came exceedingly close to a mistrial, if not for the supreme effort and guidance of the ruling judge. He was strong in his advice that the jury continue to deliberate even when the jury had indicated more than once that it had exhausted all avenues by which to reach a verdict. A reading of the court transcripts shows the judge's thorough attention to every detail in the case. He admirably upheld his oath of office and moreover would not let the truth be buried under any legal or court jargon, any strict procedure or court atmospherics, even human exhaustion and emotion, let alone misleading and false witness.


It is this latter point I wish to take up in the Senate and I do so fully aware I speak under privilege of the parliament. First, as all would be aware of and in full agreement with, it is the foundation stone of our justice system that every person is entitled to a defence. However, they are not entitled to a concocted defence. This, I believe, is what occurred in the Freeman case. I refer to crucial evidence given by Professor Graham Burrows in favour of Arthur Freeman. Professor Burrows was the only one of six psychiatrists who spoke for the accused. Professor Burrows's time in the witness box on 17 March was dutifully and meticulously used to explain away Freeman's deliberate actions. Professor Burrows absurdly claimed Freeman as being 'in a state of serene disassociation' or a 'hypnotic state like sleepwalking'. Burrows actually said: 'Freeman didn't know what he was doing.'


Every other expert who had the same access to Freeman as Burrows disagreed in the extreme with his analysis. For them, Arthur Freeman knew exactly what he was doing. I add that any common and reasonable person's analysis of the facts of that fateful day would lead them to the same conclusion: that Arthur Freeman knew exactly what he was doing. There was crystal clear fact after crystal clear fact. So it is not good enough for Professor Burrows to hide behind what he would say is his superior knowledge or assessment to that of his peers or say that while his opinion differs his is still an opinion. An opinion is not just an opinion in a murder case. It is held up to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Yet Professor Burrows's time in the witness box came chillingly close to convincing some in the jury and thus dangerously close to getting Freeman off his subsequent murder conviction.


Perhaps it was because certain members of the jury were in bewilderment of such cruelty coming from a father. Enter Professor Burrows who used his eminent position with an intellectual concoction to give an excuse for such a merciless act. Darcy deserved better than that. Professor Burrows is a gun for hire. He has been described as a psychiatrist of last resort and one who will sing whatever song the defence wants. He has been a star witness for the defence before this particular case. I refer to the Robert Baxter wife killing case, a mirror image defence and performance by Professor Burrows. From the moment Professor Burrows entered the stand in the Freeman case, as the court transcripts will attest, it seems the judge had a rightful suspicion, if not contempt, for this so-called expert. As the judge said, he had crossed paths with Burrows before. While the defence counsel sought to impress the jury with the seemingly eminent credentials of witness Burrows, the judge persistently interrupted the flow of the defence counsel and questioned its relevance. Such was the back and forth of the defence lawyer and the judge on this point, that the court was adjourned on the matter. I refer to but one exchange. The defence counsel, speaking on Burrows' credentials said:


All right. Just while I am on my feet, the five pages of degrees, professional activities and memberships and chairmanships and not setting it out—


His Honour quips and interrupts—


Professors Burrows is eminently qualified. You only have to ask him.



The Defence Counsel: Yes, well the five—


His Honour again quips:


You might appreciate that our paths have crossed in the past.



The Defence Counsel: I was sort of guessing that. 


What was it that motivated Professor Burrows to take the stand and argue against the plain truth? Or is it for Professor Burrows a case of 'what is truth'? The position Professor Burrows holds at Melbourne university is quoted in the court transcripts and used to display his eminence before the jury. Professor Burrows is a professorial fellow of the Department of Psychiatry, so I say that the university ought to remove him from that position for the evidence he gave in the Freeman case. The university's reputation must surely be sullied if Professor Burrows remains in that position. I call upon the vice-chancellor to take a stand for common decency and reject the professor's actions. I call upon the vice-chancellor to consider all the facts, to deliberate beyond the excuses like academic freedom or acting outside the university's jurisdiction, and consider the case, its effect on family and society and the university's reputation. I would think that a Melbourne university student of psychiatry would be in peril of misdirection under such a faculty contributor, however occasional. 


I do not rise on this issue and make such claims lightly. Indeed, I am only too aware of how people's lives have been changed, ruined, hurt and affected by this case. It would be easier to let it drift into the mist. However I believe I am compelled to use my position on such an occasion for such a purpose so Professor Burrows may be prevented from being used as a star or eminent witness again.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Minister, why is the government claiming the $1.7 billion-plus flood tax and $4.5 billion in other new taxes, tax increases and revenue measures as if they were spending cuts? Isn't it true that, without those tax increases, the government's net spending actually increases over the forward estimates rather than decreases?

 (Western Australia) (14:03):  Mr President, the minister clearly has no explanation as to why a tax increase is said to be a spending cut. I have a supplementary question. This was supposed to be a tough budget. Why then has the government failed to offset new spending in both 2010-11 and 2011-12 with savings, increasing the deficit by more than $7 billion? Is the minister aware of comments by respected economic commentator Alan Kohler that 'any decent chief financial officer would be embarrassed by this budget'?

 (Western Australia) (14:05):  Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Now that the minister has started talking about tight fiscal discipline and limiting spending growth, does she accept that the government's commitment to keep spending growth below two per cent in real terms is a very easy target to achieve given that government spending is coming off a highly inflated base with spending growth of more than 17 per cent over the last two years in real terms, the highest since Whitlam?

Senator WONG:
  A levy which was the subject of an enormous amount of chest-beating on that side and went through this chamber very quietly with the opposition opposing, but not too loudly. What an extraordinary thing! This is a budget which is about bringing the budget back into the black, a budget that is about jobs, jobs, jobs—creating jobs, training people for jobs and getting more people into jobs—and the best they can come with is: 'We don't like a levy to help rebuild Queensland. 'That is the best they can come up with! It is amazing, isn't it? This is an opposition which in government was happy to have a levy to help the sugar industry and happy to have a levy to buy back guns, but they are still fighting an argument on a levy to help rebuild Queensland and other areas of Australia that were hit by a natural disaster. But the most interesting thing is this—

I need to listen to the answer. I call the minister.




Senator WONG:
  The most interesting aspect of the question is that Senator Cormann does not know how many additional levies and taxes were in his own supposed $50 billion worth of cuts. Remember that the opposition went to the election with a levy to fund their paid parental leave scheme.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:04):  First, we have identified $22 billion worth of savings in this budget. Second, the net save/spend position in this budget is a net save in excess of $5 billion. And I should say that, in terms of restraint on expenditure, the average real growth in expenditure in the years of this budget is about one per cent per year. Under Peter Costello, in his last five budgets it was around three per cent a year—I am talking about real growth. The last time a government showed this sort of expenditure restraint was in the 1980s. This is a budget that brings the budget back to surplus and puts more Australians into jobs, trains more Australians and increases participation.

Senator WONG:
  I can understand why they want to interrupt. Their shadow Treasurer has given the most embarrassing performance that an opposition has given in a very long time. This is a shadow Treasurer who says he wants to bring the budget back to surplus earlier, who says there are not enough tough savings and now has opposed at least two or three of the saves. How is it possible that you can come back to surplus and oppose savings measures? Perhaps the opposition should have a think about that.

 relating to the 2011-12 budget

What an appalling first day for the government after the budget was given. They have no idea and there is no plan and no process. And not one question was actually answered today—but that should be of no surprise at all.




Senator Sherry:
  Why didn't you ask a question, Ronno?




Senator RONALDSON:
  Senator Sherry, of course, is interjecting—and he is one of the greatest recalcitrants on the other side. He cannot answer a question. He is not across his portfolio and all he does is either snooze or interject during question time—and normally in that order.


I now want to talk about what this budget does not include, which means that it is not set in stone but rather it is a budget built on sand. This budget will not stop the boats. This budget will not pay off debt, but rather will increase it. This budget will not put the budget into surplus. No-one believes this government can ever, ever deliver a budget surplus. It will take very, very minimal movement in the economy of China—upon which this surplus is built—for the surplus to dissipate in front of our very eyes. This budget will not stop the government's waste and mismanagement. It will not ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, but rather will add to them. It will not assist private health insurance and it will not do anything about the government's dishonest dealings with the Australian community.


But what this budget will do is impose a carbon tax and a mining tax and destroy private health insurance. It will increase net debt. It will require the borrowings of approximately $135 million per day this financial year and, over the next four years, $20 million a day in borrowings—$4,200 for every Australian over the next four years. This is a government that inherited a strong economy. This is a government that inherited a budget surplus. This is a government that inherited no debt. And in the short space of three years they have driven the net debt into the second highest in this country's history. It was a despicable act last night. It was not a budget; it was an excuse for inactivity. It was an excuse for a government that simply has not got any control of itself. It has no control of our borders and it has no control of the economy, and families are ultimately the ones who have suffered.


I will repeat the comments that Senator Eggleston made when he said: 'Why should families be responsible for this government's refusal or inability to do anything about properly protecting our borders?' This so-called Malaysian deal, which will cost close to $300 million, is a complete and utter farce. There is not one person in the Australian community who believes that it is going to resolve the situation. The solution is there, as Senator Eggleston said, with Nauru. It is quite simple. The Prime Minister knows that, the Labor Party backbench knows that, but the Prime Minister will not swallow her pride, admit she has made a mistake and get on and do something about it. Why should the Australian community pay for her refusal to acknowledge the mistakes that she has made? Why should they pay for her ego? Why should they continue to pay for her refusal to protect Australian families and to ease these increasing cost-of-living pressures?


This government had an opportunity to do something significant for this country in last night's budget. But, instead, they have put every single egg of every single Australian family in the basket of the Chinese economy. This is a Chinese economy driven budget—and if there is a sneeze in the Chinese economy we will get a very, very serious does of the flu. Not one economic or political commentator thinks for one minute that there will not be a sneeze in the Chinese community. It beggars belief that in the next three years there will not be a shiver in the Chinese economy. No-one for one minute thinks that the Chinese economy is at risk, but no-one believes that there will not be some— (Time expired)

Senator FORSHAW,ALP,2011-05-11,"



Senator FORSHAW
 (New South Wales) (15:06):  This is the 17th budget that I have witnessed as a member of this parliament. I arrived here at the time of the budget in 1994. So I have seen a lot of budgets—both Labor ones and coalition ones. And let me tell you something: the history of this country shows that when the country gets into some trouble you have to go to a Labor government to get us out of it. It happened in World War II—you fell apart and John Curtin had to take over to save the country. It was Chifley, of course, who started to rebuild the Australian economy after World War II and it was the Hawke and Keating governments that transformed this economy and opened it up to the world—and today we see the great benefits of those visionary decisions. hat have we had in the last couple of years? We have had the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. What do we have in Australia? We have an economy that is the envy of the Western world. We have the only economy in all of those great nations that did not go into recession. We have an economy that has low unemployment, that has a low inflation rate and that has one of the lowest government-debt-to-GDP ratios of the world. We are a country with an economy that did not have all of the crises that we continue to see in Europe, in countries like Spain, Greece, Ireland and so on. Why was that? It was because of the great economic management of the Rudd and Gillard governments, through, as I said, the worst economic crisis this world has seen since the 1930s.


But it is as if the opposition thinks that it did not occur—because we fixed it, or because we made sure that our economy did not suffer in the way those other nations did. Senator Ronaldson talks about how when China sneezes we get a cold. A couple of years ago the world had one of the worst cases of economic flu in the history of the world in this century and the last century, but we did not catch a cold. We did not even sneeze, and that was because of the decisions taken by the Labor government at the time, decisions which those on the other side opposed. You opposed the economic stimulus package which ensured that our people stayed in work and that our economy continued to grow. 


Now we hear the latest pronouncement on this budget. Senator Ronaldson just rattled off his problems as if he thinks this is the worst budget in history—as somebody over there said. It is not. This is a budget for the times. This is a budget that delivers some real increases in important services and important programs to this country, to areas, like mental health, that people have been screaming about for years. I served on a Senate select committee where we made recommendations for increased funding to mental health. I acknowledge that the Howard government did belatedly do something about it, but we have now put another $2.2 billion into that area. That is one of the most vital areas and it has been crying out for government support. Other changes we have made clearly will benefit many Australian families, particularly in terms of getting more people into the workforce.  


The budget has also had to have some savings cuts in it, because we are still going to meet that target to get this budget back into surplus by the next financial year, 2012-13. Those cuts are important. But what do we get from the opposition? On the one hand, as Minister Wong said, the opposition says that it will just happen. They say they will just take us back into surplus if they were in government. But, as Senator Wong also pointed out, Mr Hockey is saying he will not support any of these savings cuts. What are you going to cut? Tell us the areas you are going to cut. You have an opportunity tomorrow night to tell the Australian parliament and the Australian people in what areas you will find the savings in government spending? 


When you were in government, govern­ment spending grew by an average of three per cent. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments it has been growing at one per cent, so do not lecture us about wasteful government spending and all the rest of it. This is a terrific budget for the times and for the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-05-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:11):  Before I correct Senator Forshaw's attempt to rewrite history, I want to congratulate Senator Wong, who, together with the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, has been responsible for putting Australia in a position where we now borrow $135 million each and every day. We pay something like $18 million to $20 million every day in interest on those monies that Labor keeps borrowing. In the time we have had question time today, Labor has borrowed another $5.6 million—ticking it up on the credit card. That is something like $92,000 a minute. While I am speaking today, Labor will have borrowed something like $500,000—in the five minutes I have today. 


Senator Forshaw reminded us of the Keating days. What he forgot to tell us is that, when we took government in 1996, we found a $10 billion deficit that had been hidden by the Keating government out of that year's budget alone. When we looked at the books, we found that there was a $96 billion deficit run up by Labor's prolific spending, Labor's incapacity to run a country without taxing, spending and borrowing. It took the Howard government something like seven or eight years to pay off Labor's $96 billion debt. We did that through a lot of hard work and here we are a couple of years later with another Labor debt of in excess of $100 billion.


No wonder they moved Senator Wong from climate change; they should move her from this as well, because she is completely incapable. She talks about what a great economy Australia has. Australia used to have a great economy. Why? Because John Howard and Peter Costello paid off Labor's $96 billion debt and then put us into a $50 billion to $60 billion surplus, which in two short years Labor has blown and run us into additional debt of over $100 billion. Sure, we had a great economy. It was recorded by I think it was the OECD as the miracle economy of the world when it was under the control of Peter Costello and John Howard. Now we are rapidly moving down to the bottom. As one of my colleagues interjected on the GDP, Labor would have us try and emulate those countries who are in debt to the extent of 90 per cent of GDP. It is not, can I say to Senator Wong, a race to the bottom. As I look through this budget I see very little for rural, remote and regional Australia and I see absolutely nothing for agriculture. The minister sits in the chamber—he should hang his head in shame. There is no new money whatsoever for agriculture. We have a cutback in the Defence budget of some $4.3 billion over four years. At least the Defence budget puts a bit of money into rural and regional Australia, but that is being slashed by this government. Dealing with asylum seekers, as one of my colleagues has mentioned, has eaten up $2.5 billion over five years out of this budget, due to Labor's incapacity and inability to manage it properly.


I note with some amusement the money allocated for the NBN rollout. I wonder where the 'private investment'—which was so lauded by Senator Conroy prior to the NBN starting—is. I see in the budget papers some reference to 'infrastructure bonds', but you ask them about it, you say, 'What are these about?' and nobody wants to talk about it.



This is a budget from a weak, indecisive government who simply cannot be trusted to manage Australia's economy. (Time expired)

Senator WORTLEY,ALP,2011-05-11,"



Senator WORTLEY
 (South Australia) (15:16):  As the minister pointed out, last night the Treasurer delivered a budget that aims to put the opportunities that flow from a strong economy within reach of more Australians. It is a budget that aims to get more people into work and to train them for more rewarding jobs. We know Australia emerged strongly from the global recession, with hundreds of thousands of jobs created, while around the world we saw record unemployment and the enormous social consequences it triggered. As the Treasurer pointed out last night, our public debt is a tiny fraction of that carried by comparable economies and our fiscal position is the envy of the developed world.


Today we have sat in this chamber and heard those opposite—and I was listening earlier to Senator Nash and, just now, to Senator Macdonald—talk about regional Australia. I would like to point out a few facts. The 2011-12 budget will invest a record $3.7 billion over the next 12 months in renewing and extending road, rail and aviation infrastructure across regional Australia—a sum far greater than anything ever provided before. Compared to what was spent in the last full year of the Howard government, we will be providing more than twice as much regional infrastructure funding.


The latest budget figures should make the National Party feel particularly uncom­fortable about their record in government because they again confirm that, when it comes to regional infrastructure, Labor governments deliver more than coalition governments. The choice for regional Australia is clear: a record infrastructure budget under federal Labor or cuts and the shelving of nation-building projects such as the NBN with Mr Abbott and his mates in the Nationals.


Other areas of interest include the mental health package. There was a fantastic contribution there. The mental health reform package, of $2.2 billion over five years, will improve the lives of thousands of Australians with mental illness and their families, providing more intensive support services and better coordinating those services for people with severe and persistent mental illness who have complex care needs. It targets support to areas and communities that need it most, such as Indigenous commun­ities and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas that are underserviced by the system as it is today. It will help to detect potential mental health problems in the early years and support young people who struggle with mental illness. Given the impact of mental illness on individuals, their families and the community, the Gillard government believes mental health reform should be a priority. That belief is reflected in the funding provided in what is a very responsible budget.


The budget also builds on the government's strong record of lifting educational standards. Over three years, $200 million will be invested to support students with disabilities in their classrooms and to improve their learning outcomes. This package applies to students with a disability in our government, Catholic and independent schools and includes new services such as speech and occupational therapy delivered at schools, additional hours of in-class support and access to specialist equipment.


From 2012, students from years 9 to 12 will be offered a new national trade cadetship as an option under the Australian Curriculum. This cadetship will be delivered through local trades training centres and other eligible venues. Up to 50,000 additional structured work experience places will also be provided to students.


All Australians, regardless of their background or where they live, should have the opportunity to gain a university education. Labor is investing a further $1.4 billion to meet the growth in university enrolments. We will see 480,000 under­graduate places funded this year. A fund will be created to upgrade infrastructure at regional tertiary institutions and to assist universities to support, attract and retain students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.


Jobs are another important issue. Training a bigger workforce is vital for the strength of the economy and the living standards of our community. The 2011-12 budget invests in education, apprenticeships, jobs and training. This government is delivering the skilled workers our economy needs while ensuring more Australians benefit from our growing prosperity. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-05-11,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:21): Well, I have heard everything! If nothing is the responsibility of this government then for some reason they will claim credit for everything. The conceit on the part of this government—claiming credit, as we have heard from previous speakers, for the resilience of the Australian economy over the last three or four years! The conceit to say that all the small business people who worked harder and all the people that took reduced hours contributed nothing! The conceit of this government to think that it controls the economy and that the success of the economy belongs solely to it is unbounded. e know this from the last 70 years of economics. While I am a big fan of the writer that wrote about the 'fatal conceit', the point is that this government only claims credit for those things it wishes to. It seeks to avoid responsibility and makes excuses for those issues it wants to avoid. It says we should compare Australia's debt to that of other nations. I have never heard a successful defence when a bank comes to repossess a house or business being based on, 'My neighbour owes more.'


It is ridiculous to compare the success of the Australian economy and the massive run-up in debt that we have experienced over the last three years with what is happening in other parts of the world because, quite frankly, they are profoundly mismanaged. Unlike those governments in other parts of the world, this government did not inherit a mismanaged economy. It inherited the most sound finances of any government in the Western world.


What the government does not want to tell you is that, while the average debt in Australia is lower than some of our competitors, if we look at other countries we have had the third fastest run-up of public debt in the OECD over the last five years. You have got the bronze medal there. I suppose you are going for gold very soon if we keep up this record of 20 per cent explosions over six months in budget deficits. In one year this government has run up half the debt that was repaid by 10 years of the previous government. That is $50 billion of debt in one year—up by $10 billion in six months. The children of Australia are never going to see a debt-free Commonwealth if this government stays in office. I fear for the work that will have to be undertaken, the difficult decisions and the sacrifices that will have to be made, if this government stays in office much longer. It has run up $50 billion—half of the previous debt of the Commonwealth that was repaid in a decade. 


At its core is a profound misunderstanding of the Australian economy. Yes, the Australian Commonwealth does not have as much debt as some other nations. If we look at net public sector debt around Australia and the behaviour of our state governments, we have a fairly significant debt level in Australia. All this, due to the terms of the Loan Council provisions in the Constitution, is effectively guaranteed by Australian taxpayers. Let us not just look at the Commonwealth balance sheet; let us look at what is happening in the states to see what Australian taxpayers are really up for. 


While we have had historically low public debt in Australia since the coalition paid it back, we have incredibly high private debt. Our private banks are dependent upon levels of funding on a regular basis from overseas that, quite frankly, their competitors in the private sector banking systems of other countries are not dependent on. You do not need to be an economist to know that the only reason our four big banks could continue to access the funds they needed for functioning during the credit-squeeze phase of the global financial crisis was that, even though their debt position was safe, the Australian financial system was regarded as strong—that there was indeed a strong net financial position for the Commonwealth of Australia. You cannot have a situation where both of your private banks are dependent on massive borrowings from overseas. You cannot have a situation where you are a capital-importing country having regular levels of foreign investment from overseas and at the same time are continuing to run up Commonwealth debt.


This budget is going to sink without trace. This government looks at the next three years and says it is not increasing spending. It is like an alcoholic saying 'I am not having a drink today' after a three-day binge, because in the last few years spending has increased by more than 15 per cent, in real terms. This government will stand condemned for its mismanagement and run-up of debt in Australia.

Senator LUDWIG:
  It is one of those matters which is a longstanding foreign affairs issue. The government has a longstanding practice of not dealing with complex foreign policy matters through Senate motions. The government does not support boycotts that impede legitimate trade between states and has expressed its strong opposition to the Marrickville council's earlier proposed boycotts, disinvestment and sanctions campaign against Israel.


The motion moved by the Senator Abetz does appear to be more concerned with politics than expressing support for Israel. I ask Senator Abetz if he would care to explain to the Senate why at the last federal election the Liberal Party directed preferences to Greens candidates in New South Wales, in particular why the Liberal Party directed preferences to Sam Byrne, the Greens candidate for Grayndler, which covers Marrickville council. But without turning this into the politics that Senator Abetz has expressed, the longstanding practice really highlights the issue that I have indicated—that is, they are complex foreign policy matters and on that basis it has been long practice that we do not support this motion.

That is not correct in the sense that the blockade is confined, if you want to use that word, to Gaza.

  Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order for your consideration in relation to the amendment that Senator Xenophon has moved. This is a motion relating solely to the BDS situation—that is, the boycotts, divestment and sanctions policy against Israel. Senator Xenophon is now trying to introduce other extraneous matters not directly relevant to the motion and, interestingly enough, on a technical point, it is interesting that Senator Xenophon sees the need to note the detrimental effect of the Israeli blockade on the people of Gaza, but allegedly the Egyptian blockade on the people of Gaza can be completely ignored and that is the evil of the BDS policy because what it seeks to do—

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:52):   The Labor Party come into this place with a lame excuse that this is somehow a complex issue. On 23 March this year it was not a complex issue. What has made it complex for the Australian Labor Party is that they are unable to justify why so many of their affiliated unions, and indeed the state division of the Labor Party, of which their foreign minister, Mr Rudd, is a member, have passed motions in support of this objectionable policy.




Senator Bob Brown:
  I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy President. I understand that in granting leave the usual two-minute time limit will apply.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I apologise, Senator Brown. That was my mistake. I should have said leave was granted for two minutes because in fact the clerks cannot set the clocks unless I announce it from the chair. Leave was granted for two minutes.




Senator ABETZ:
  In relation to Senator Xenophon's amendment, I do find it quite objectionable—and I say that to my good friend—that all he is concerned about is the Israeli blockade of the Gazan people and there is no concern about Egypt. That is why the BDS policy that the Greens have been promoting is so wrong: it only seeks to condemn Israel and not Egypt. Why don't we have a BDS policy on Egypt courtesy of the Greens, especially from New South Wales? Why doesn't that concern Senator Xenophon?


The amendment he has moved has unfortunately shown what is actually behind this. Is it that Australia is a good friend of the Palestinian territories and its people? I have no objection to that. But that is not part and parcel of what we are dealing with. We are dealing with the evil of the BDS policy which Senator Bob Brown himself has finally come to reject in the wake of the New South Wales state election where one of the Green candidates clearly did not win a seat against Labor because of that policy. I say to the people of New South Wales, 'Well done!' 


In relation to the allocation of preferences that Senator Ludwig raised, I say to Senator Ludwig: in the New South Wales election for that seat, the Liberal Party did not allocate preferences. The Labor Party did and put Fiona Byrne at No. 2 on the how-to-vote card in the state election, so please do not come in here and try to lecture and hector us. I know it is embarrassing for certain elements in this place that the anti-Israel stance being taken by some political parties and groups, such as trade unions, does need to be opposed.

  As all senators know, I am a person who has many times spoken in this parliament as a strong supporter of the state of Israel and I do so again. But I want to point out that if you read this motion carefully you will have no doubt that this is simply a political stunt, because all it seeks to do is condemn trade unions and certain members of the Labor Party because of a particular stance that they have taken on the BDS.


I am totally opposed to the BDS. I have been on the record on that and my position is absolutely clear. Let me point out there are people in the coalition—I know them—including former ministers from former Liberal Party governments who are also hostile towards the Israeli government. I will name one: Tim Fischer. Tim is a very honourable man but a person who is on the record as being, and whom I have heard on certain occasions being, very hostile towards the Israeli government. ll I am doing is pointing out to you that you are trying to single out for a political purpose the fact that there may be people in our party or in the trade union movement who have a particular view on the Middle East issue. That is a fact right across the country—they exist in your political party—and this is simply hypocrisy of the highest order.

  I draw the Senate back to the terrific circumstances which have led to this debate both in Marrickville in the New South Wales elections and now in this great parliament—that is, the unhealed sore of the disputes, the violence, the continuing death toll and the harrowing circumstances of people living in Palestine and in Israel and, indeed, in other parts of the Middle East.


It is our job to think about it and to debate it. We should not merely find ourselves fighting over it. We should also find some way of actually helping more than the world has helped in the past to ensure the security of the people of Israel and their right to live in peace into the future as well as the right of the people of Palestine to have their own country with equal security to chart their own future in the same way as the rest of the world does. It is incredibly important that we try to limit in the future the violence that we have seen in the past from both sides and to give a peace dividend to the whole region by having those two peoples living in peace with each other. Maybe we should set aside a full and open debate at some stage in this chamber to talk about just that. They deserve it, and we deserve to do it in a constructive way that would end in a peace which would in turn make all of us on this planet a bit more secure and happy.

Senator Siewert:
  Proposition.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Or his proposition; I think it was an invitation as well as a proposition, Senator Siewert. The position is this: there is no doubt, on the basis of the discussions I have had with members of the Palestinian community and the friends of Palestine here in Australia, that both the Egyptian and the Israeli blockades have had an enormous impact on Palestinians who are completely innocent of any involvement with Hamas. The effect on children and on the supply of medicines is quite profound. I note that the Israeli government says that they have instituted the blockade in response to the role of Hamas; but things such as pasta, pencils and stationery have been blockaded. So I think that the blockade goes well beyond issues of security.


I feel comfortable about supporting this motion if this amendment is passed, but I do not support the blockade of Israel that has been proposed by, I think, the New South Wales Greens and by some in the Labor Party. I think that is completely unacceptable, and I want that to be on the record; but in the context of this motion I believe it to be appropriate that we acknowledge the impact of the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian people. That in itself should not be seen as an endorsement in any way whatsoever of a terrorist organisation such as Hamas; instead it is about the impact of the blockade on innocent Palestinians and the very deep detrimental effects on those Palestinians.

I think we ought to get this amendment down in writing and before everyone in the Senate prior to a vote being taken.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Boswell, you have foreshadowed what I intended to do: I am now going to put the amendment, but before I do so I will ask the Clerk to read the amendment as moved by Senator Xenophon.



The Clerk:  The amendment to general business notice No. 226 is as follows:


After paragraph (e), insert:


(ea)   notes:


      (i)   the detrimental effect of the Israeli blockade in Gaza on the Palestinian people living in Gaza, and


      (ii)   that Australia is a good friend of the Palestinian territories and its people; and



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question therefore is that Senator Xenophon's amendment to Senator Abetz's motion be agreed to.


Question agreed to.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  The question now is that Senator Abetz's amended motion be agreed to. Those of that opinion say 'Aye' and to the contrary 'No'. I think the ayes have it.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Deputy President, I ask that it be recorded that the Greens supported Senator Xenophon's amendment but not the motion.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Brown, I need to be quite clear here, having called it. When I asked for support for the amended motion of Senator Abetz, you said 'Aye'. That means you called it for the ayes, and I called it for the ayes on that basis.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Then I ask for the call to be had again to clarify the matter.


Question put:




That the motion (
Senator Abetz's
), as amended, be agreed to.

SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS


TABLING STATEMENT


Alert Digest No. 4 and Fourth Report of 2011


11 May 2011


In tabling the Committee's Alert Digest No. 4 I particularly draw the Senate’s attention to the Committee's comments on the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill. This bill seeks to provide a legislative basis for an electronic registry system used to account for emissions units under the Kyoto Protocol.


The Committee has raised a number of concerns about the bill arising under Standing Order 24. These include that: 


a significant amount of detail required for the operation of the bill is being left to delegated legislation, including the creation of civil penalty provisions that carry significant penalties; 


merits review is not being made available for one type of decision to be made by the Administrator to refuse to transfer units (although it is available in other similar circumstances); and


 information is being incorporated into the bill by reference to other documents, which removes the Parliament's ability to review any changes to the incorporated material. 


The Committee will seek further advice from the Minister about these issues.


The Committee also draws the Senate's attention to some other matters in the bill of relevance to Standing Order 24:


it contains significant penalties that exceed the usual standards, but the justification provided is that a large financial penalty is warranted because of the potential gains arising from a breach of the scheme requirements;


it includes a very broad regulation power 'to make further provision in relation to non-Kyoto international emissions units' which is justified on the basis that this is a 'framework' bill and regulations will need to deal with issues such as determining conditions that may apply to the transfer of units; and


penalty provisions are treated as strict liability offences to encourage relevant parties to 'take steps to guard against any inadvertent contravention'.


In Alert Digest No. 4 the Committee explains its possible concerns with these provisions, notes the justification for them provided in the explanatory memorandum and leaves it to the Senate as a whole to determine whether or the proposed provisions are appropriate.


Several other bills also contain issues of potential concern under Standing Order 24. These include the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill; the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1); the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill; and others. I draw the Senate’s attention to all of the Committee’s comments in Alert Digest No.4.


In relation to scrutiny concerns raised in previous Digests the Committee has received replies to the issues it raised in relation to the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Abolition of Alpine Grazing) Bill, the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill and the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill. 


The Committee particularly thanks the Minister for Health and Ageing who has provided detailed responses to issues raised by the Committee and who has agreed to make public any instruments specifying additional functions to be performed by the National Health Performance Authority. 


The Committee also notes that the explanatory memorandum to the Alpine Grazing Bill that was inadvertently omitted from circulation is reproduced in its Fourth Report.  


I commend Alert Digest No. 4 of 2011 and the Fourth Report of 2011 to the Senate.

Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (17:37):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Bhutan and Mongolia that took place from 9 to 21 July 2010. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.


Leave granted. 




Senator HURLEY:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The key aim of the delegation was to visit two countries that are relatively new democracies. In particular, the delegation aimed to gain an understanding of political, economic and social issues in both countries and to obtain an insight into Australia's development assistance activities. 


Bhutan is a small landlocked country in the eastern Himalayas in South Asia, bordered by India to the south, east and west and by China to the north. Bhutan has recently developed from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. Australia enjoys a modest yet warm relationship with Bhutan, extending back to the early 1960s, with formal diplomatic relations with Bhutan being established in 2002. The initial relationship was based around the provision of aid to Bhutan. The focus of Australia's aid program is now primarily on human resources development. The Australian government will provide approximately $5.3 million in development assistance to Bhutan in 2010-11. Education, through a scholarships program, is the focus of Australia's bilateral assistance to Bhutan. Since 1998, nearly 600 Bhutanese students have studied in Australia through various scholarship schemes. As a result of these scholarship programs there is now a core of Bhutanese senior to mid-level public servants who have been educated in Australia. 


The first members of the parliament of Bhutan took their seats in 2008. His Majesty the King of Bhutan has stated that the country's first democratic government has the responsibility of setting the right examples, laying strong foundations and promoting the best practices of democracy. The parliament of Australia is able to assist the parliament of Bhutan in dealing with the steep learning curve it faces in all aspects of operating a parliament. The parliament of Bhutan is seeking guidance and advice, particularly in the areas of legislative drafting, development of procedures for both houses and the development of secretariat support for members of parliament, both houses and parliamentary committees.


The report recommends that the Australian government provide legislative drafting assistance to the parliament of Bhutan. The delegation understands that providing training in drafting is a very resource intensive activity for our agencies; however, that drafting expertise is of vital importance, especially to parliaments that are newly established and still coming to terms with new procedures, practices, roles and responsibilities. The report recognises the value of the Australian parliament's inter­parlia­mentary study program; however, the report recommends that the Australian parliament investigate the provision of more exclusive access to our parliament for senior parliamentary officials from Bhutan. Short-term residencies for several officials, perhaps over a sitting fortnight, may provide unique opportunities for those officials to learn, through shadowing roles, about our parliamentary departmental functions.


Mongolia is a landlocked country in East and Central Asia. Mongolia became a democracy in 1990 after 70 years of Soviet style, single party rule. Australia established diplomatic relations with Mongolia in 1972, with bilateral relations developing further following democratic and free market reforms in Mongolia in the early 1990s. Australia has been a longstanding development partner for Mongolia. Since 1995 Australia has provided more than $50 million in aid to Mongolia. In 2010-11 Australia will provide approximately $7.4 million in aid.


Since 1993 the provision of scholarships to Mongolia has been Australia's primary mode of development assistance. In recent years the number of scholarships has almost doubled. The Mongolia Australian Scholar­ships Program provides 28 Australian Development Scholarships to Mongolians from both the public and private sectors each year. The scholarships program is highly regarded by the Mongolian government, with graduates including current and former ministers, parliamentarians and senior public service officials.


The delegation met with representatives from Australian businesses with a presence in Mongolia. Companies such as Leighton and Rio Tinto now have significant invest­ment in Mongolian mining and resources, particularly through coalmines at Tavan Tolgoi and the substantial copper and gold mine at Oyu Tolgoi in the Gobi Desert. Australian businesses have benefited from the presence of an Austrade official on a trial basis in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. Australian businesses empha­sised the importance of Australian govern­ment representation in Mongolia and called for, at best, representation through an embassy in Ulaanbaatar and, at a minimum, permanent Austrade representation. The delegation notes that Mongolia established an embassy in Canberra in 2008.


The delegation observed that the most pressing need for larger firms is the presence of high-level advocacy to the Mongolian government. This is particularly important for the protection of current investments and for the support of new ventures. The delegation considers that Australian government representation through an embassy in Ulaanbaatar is necessary for the continued development of a strong relationship between the two countries.


The delegation was very warmly received. I would like to thank the host nations for their friendly hospitality and willingness to share their experiences with us. I would like to thank the many individuals and organi­sations in the host countries who were generous with their hospitality, insight and knowledge. I would also like to thank the other members of the delegation: the Hon. David Hawker MP, the Hon. Bob Debus MP and Mrs Kay Hull MP, all of whom retired at the end of the 42nd Parliament after many years of dedicated parliamentary service. I also particularly want to thank Mr Anthony Overs, secretary to the delegation, for his assistance. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:53):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I want to make some remarks in relation to this report, although I will probably make my substantive comments on the next document. With respect to this document, the report for 2008-09, I simply want to raise with the Senate that we are now into the year 2011, almost starting the financial year 2011-12, and this report from effectively three financial years ago is only coming before the parliament at this stage. I make the comment also that the report, perhaps for reasons I do not understand, is limited. I hasten to add that the next report that I want to speak about, which is the same report for the next financial year, is a bit more effusive, but with the 2008-09 report, unless you knew what was happening you would not really have any idea of what the Royal Australian Air Force Welfare Recreational Company actually did or does.


This is a government that wanted to be open and accountable. It wanted to make sure that anything that is government funded is able to be viewed by the public. Tabling this report some three years after the event is not good enough. I say with all due respect to you, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, but with no respect to the current government: this sort of poor accountability cannot be accepted. It is even more difficult to accept given that the current Prime Minister was elected on a mantra of openness and accountability. The words are easy to say; the actions are much harder. I think that this report, coming out some three years after the event, is typical of this government's lack of accountability and lack of openness in spite of the rhetoric.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (19:10):  I rise tonight to honour the memory of a friend and colleague, Ian Harrington. Ian leaves behind his wife of 42 years, Fran, his five children, Tricia, Cheryl, Linda, Michelle and Greg, and 14 grandchildren whom he adored and who adored him.


Ian lived for his family. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. He was a modest man but a man of incredible strength and capacity. In his younger days he was a champion high-board diver, winning many state and national competitions. Such was his modesty that not many of his friends or colleagues knew of his skills and talent in this sporting field.


Ian died recently of mesothelioma, contracted during his working life as a fitter. Mesothelioma is a horrible disease contracted by exposure to airborne asbestos fibres. It is a tragedy that Ian Harrington, who campaigned against the use of asbestos while he was a rank and file delegate and an elected official of the AMWU, became another working-class victim of asbestos related disease. Mesothelioma is a horrible, destructive disease that inevitably results in an agonising and debilitating death.


The incidence of death from meso­thelioma is increasing. It afflicts Australians who have worked with asbestos in many industries, including manufacturing, engineering, our wharfs and the building industry. We should never forget that companies like James Hardy and CSR made huge profits from asbestos and from the suffering and devastation that this product brings to working-class Australians and their families.


We must continue to be vigilant and ensure that employers who expose workers to asbestos related disease are held to account through appropriate legislative and legal processes. Through the hard work of the trade union movement, all forms of asbestos have been banned since the end of 2003. Unfortunately, despite the ban asbestos is still common in many older houses. Ian would have wanted me to issue a general warning to all householders to be extremely careful if they come across asbestos in a domestic situation and to ensure its removal by properly trained personnel.


Ian served his apprenticeship as a fitter and travelled the world as an engineer in the merchant navy. He worked for many years at Shell's Clyde refinery in the maintenance team. It was at the Shell refinery that he met his good mate David Hughes. David delivered a moving tribute to Ian at his recent funeral. David spoke of the kindness and support that Ian gave to him and everyone else that he came in contact with. The high regard in which Ian was held resulted in his election as the metal trades union delegate at Shell. Ian held that position for almost 15 years. In that time Ian gained the enormous respect not only of his workmates but also of other delegates in the oil industry and the union and of the employers.


Ian was seen as a tough negotiator and an honest person, a voracious defender of workers' rights and conditions and one who would never back away from a dispute if workers' rights were being challenged. In his capacity as a highly competent union delegate, Ian was recognised by his union, the AMWU, where he became a union organiser, a position he held for 10 years. It was during this time that I became a friend and colleague of Ian's.  found Ian to be a tough and courageous organiser who would never leave you wondering what he thought. He was involved in many tough industrial disputes but always came out of them with the respect of his members and the employers. I have always said that a good union organiser instils confidence in their members, knows the benefits of education and training and fearlessly and tirelessly works for their members. If I was a worker in trouble I would have been extremely confident when Ian Harrington walked onto the job that my interests were going to be looked after by a tough, professional union official. Ian represented workers on the shop floor and as an advocate in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, where his capacity for research, preparation and advocacy helped thousands of workers over his career.


Ian's trade skills were recognised by the former state and federal minister the Hon. Bob Debus when he seconded Ian to his office to help establish the trade courses that are now offered to TAFE students in New South Wales high schools as part of their curriculum. Ian spent his final few working years as a member services manager with the Superannuation Trust of Australia, now called Australian Super. Ian very quickly became an expert in superannuation matters and was a fantastic advocate for industry superannuation and the rights of workers to retire with dignity and security.


Ian was nominated for Senior Australian of the Year for his ongoing contribution to the welfare of others during his lifetime. This was most appropriate, as Ian spent the major part of his life trying to improve the lot of working people, even after he retired. In his retirement, Ian enjoyed a couple of beers with his mates and fishing at Fingal Bay in New South Wales. My wife, Elaine, and I visited Fran and Ian in Fingal Bay not long after he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma. He had a lovely home, a loving wife, fantastic kids and wonderful grandkids. It is an absolute tragedy that asbestos and mesothelioma destroyed Ian's retirement and his life.


Ian was optimistic about his condition but also realistic. His good mate David noted that, when Ian was in the final stages of the disease, his strength and courage amazed everyone. Despite his personal battle with the horrible disease that is mesothelioma, Ian always had a genuine concern for others and was always wondering how he could help them with their problems. As David said, 'Let's not remember the way he died but, rather, how he lived—as a genuine and good man.'


It is important also to remember that Ian was taken from his family and his friends by a disease that was avoidable. We must never forget that workers die while building this nation. I am sure that Ian and his family and the families of the thousands of workers who lose their lives through industrial accidents or industrial disease will applaud the decision of the government to honour the memory of workers who lose their lives while building this nation by building a national workers memorial in Canberra. People like Ian should be remembered for their efforts, and their families should have a place to remember them and contemplate their lives together when they visit the national capital. The memorial will be a fitting tribute to Ian and his fellow workers who have lost their lives as a result of their employment. I congratulate the Prime Minister and Minister Evans for supporting this important symbol of the nation's recognition of the sacrifice of workers. I pay tribute to the government, the coalition, the Greens and the Independents, who have worked together to ensure that a memorial for people like Ian Harrington will be built in the national capital.


Vale, Ian Harrington. You were a good man, a union man and a great family man. You will be sadly missed.

Senator Johnston
  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, upon notice, on 28 September 2010:


If employee entitlements were to be given a higher priority in respect of any fixed and floating charge security a bank holds, would this not make a bank more proactive in monitoring loans it has and in ensuring a situation is not allowed to deteriorate to a position where only a secured creditor recovers their funds.

",Senate,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking (Question No. 61)</title>,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,21,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Senator Sherry:
  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:


Employees would only benefit from their entitlements receiving a higher priority in the distribution to creditors to the extent that any of their entitlements are not already covered by the General Employee Entitlements Redundnacy Scheme (GEERS). To the extent that that employee entitlements are covered by GEERS, employees would receive no additional advantage by receiving a higher priority in the distribution. Almost all employee entitlements are covered by GEERS. 


If payments of employees entitlements were made dependent on the realisation of assets, it is likely that payments to employees of their entitlements would be delayed further, than under GEERS. 


A proposal by the former government to place claims for outstanding employee's entitlements before the interests of all secured creditors was considered by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in its June 2004 report, Corporate Insolvency Laws: A Stocktake. The PJC recommended against its adoption. 


Employees currently receive a special priority in the distribution to creditors under the Corporations Act. If employees ranking was increased to an even higher ranking, it would be expected to increase the costs of secured credit as margins were increased to reflect lower than expected asset recoveries.
