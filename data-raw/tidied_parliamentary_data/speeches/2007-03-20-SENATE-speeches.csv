"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-03-20,"—The Greens oppose this motion. Again, this is the government manipulating the Senate, because it has the numbers, while running the Senate for the least number of sitting days for decades, to extend the hours so that legislation can be pushed through but the government can escape the scrutiny which the Senate has been so good at before the government got the majority. This is using the majority to abuse the role of the Senate in reviewing what the government does and to extensively inquire into the legislation and other matters it brings before the Senate. We can do very little about it. It is an abuse of the Senate in the interests of a government that does not want to be scrutinised as it should be, and the Greens will oppose this motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-03-20,"—What a strange argument we have heard: the government is abusing its numbers in the Senate by extending the hours, so that hon-ourable senators can have more time to consider the bills and the legislation before it. Surely the argument would be that we were abusing our numbers in the Senate if we said, ‘We have the numbers and therefore we will force the legislation through without any concern for opposition and minor party sena-tors.’ The fact that we are willing to extend the time for the Senate to sit—so that honourable senators can spend more time considering legislation—is, I would have thought, proof positive that Senator Bob Brown’s assertion is unsupportable.
This government has been a reformist government. It has a full agenda. Yes, there is a lot of legislation to go through and, whilst those on the other side often say that the government has run out of puff, it is interesting to know that they then complain when we have so much legislation, so many reforms and changes that we seek to submit to this place to make Australia an even better place. On behalf of the government, I have moved the motion to give honourable senators extra time to consider the government’s legislative program.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-03-20,"—The Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and cognate bills represent a significant change to private health insurance policy. As the government says, this legislation is the most significant package of changes since the private health insurance rebate and Lifetime Health Cover scheme were introduced in 2000-01.
The most important policy change included in the package is the extension of private health insurance to provide cover for medical services provided outside of hospital. Under ‘Broader Health Cover’, as it is known, private health insurance funds will be able to cover medical services provided outside of hospitals for the first time. New services included under Broader Health Cover will include services which either substitute for in-hospital services, such as chemotherapy and dialysis provided in the home or community settings, or services which are designed to prevent hospitalisation in the first place. Broader Health Cover will also provide insurance for services designed to prevent people needing to go to hospital, including chronic disease management programs and health promotion programs.
This package represents a significant change in the way we think about health care—in particular, in trying to find ways to keep people out of hospital and to manage chronic illness better. For this reason, as my colleague Nicola Roxon, Labor’s shadow minister for health, outlined in the other place, Labor supports this package. But we do have some concerns, most importantly that the government seems only to see fit to go down this path for private insurance rather than for the whole health system.
Clearly, the private health insurance industry can see that it is better for their policyholders to stay out of hospital if they can. Keeping people out of hospital also makes good economic sense. This is precisely the rationale for Labor’s call to embark on some wider reforms of the health system, particularly in the area of Commonwealth-state relations. Unfortunately, the government has not turned its attention to this issue at all.
As I said, Labor is supporting this package of legislation because we believe it may provide significant benefits for the 44 per cent of the Australian population who currently have private health insurance. Labor supported the private health insurance rebate at the last two elections and will support it again at the next election. Labor accepts and understands that many Australian families have come to rely on this support and we will not be taking it away. So we are pleased that this package could mean that people with private health insurance cover might get better value for their money. And longer term, if it means that we manage chronic illness better and keep people from multiple re-admissions to hospital, obviously that will be desirable for the health of the nation as a whole.
Labor does, however, have a number of concerns about the package. Our main concern here is not primarily with the content of the package—as I said, we support the goal of keeping people out of hospital where possible, and the goal of preventing and better managing chronic disease. Our primary concern is about what happens to those not insured and therefore not covered at all by these changes.
The expansion of private insurance to out-of-hospital services raises equity issues around access to services equivalent to those under broader health cover reforms for people who do not have private health insurance. People without private health insurance, even after these reforms, will continue to be able to access services such as chemotherapy and dialysis through the public system in hospitals. But the privately insured will have options that may well become not just choices regarding a more comfortable venue for their treatment but also choices which will have significant health impacts, especially if, for example, they have better access to preventive and chronic disease management programs than those who rely on the public system. If this turns out to be the case, then it can be argued that the privately insured will have access to a better overall quality of health care. The logical extension of this argument is that people who cannot afford private health insurance may be more likely to end up in hospital because, unlike people with private health insurance, they might not be able to access programs which could prevent them from having to go to hospital. This issue was examined in detail by the Senate committee inquiry into these bills.
It is this element of the package with which Labor is most concerned. We believe it presents a departure from the current balance between privately and publicly funded services and the rationale that private health insurance gives private health insurance consumers additional choice. Unless there are changes in other parts of the health system to create the necessary incentives for public providers to provide similar services, universality as the core of our health system will be threatened.
The government disputes any suggestion that this package represents a shift towards a two-tiered system of health care. But if the broader health cover provisions give people with private health insurance access to services and treatment options which people without insurance may not have access to—and potentially may be disadvantaged by not having access to—then the package will be doing exactly that. As I mentioned earlier, Labor will support this package because we want those with private health insurance to get any improved benefits that they can. We expect that it will have significant benefits for private health consumers and in particular we believe that it will lead to important innovations in care and services provided outside the hospital gate.
Having introduced these changes for people with private health insurance, we urge the government to work toward addressing access to these kinds of services for the uninsured. With the negotiations over the next set of Australian health care agreements due to start this year, the government has a perfect opportunity to show its concern for keeping people out of hospital and for those who rely on the public health system.
There are several other parts of the government’s private health insurance policies that Labor have concerns with. For example, the government insists that the package will not have any impact on premiums. In fact, in his second reading speech the health minister went as far as to argue that some of the changes will actually reduce pressure on premiums. We remember the last time that the government said one of its policies would reduce pressure on private health insurance premiums, and that was in 2000 and 2001 when the private health insurance rebate and the Lifetime Health Cover scheme were introduced. Since then, as anyone with private health insurance knows, there has been a 40 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums. Given the government’s track record, why should we believe anything that Mr Abbott says about private health insurance premiums? Is it not counterintuitive to think that expanding the services offered will reduce premiums? If we manage people’s care particularly well in the long term, we may—and I underline ‘may’—make some decent savings, and the insurers no doubt have this in mind in wanting to go down that path. But, in the short term, we are concerned that the changes may in fact have the reverse effect and lead to further increases in private health insurance premiums in this country.
We should not be accepting the minister’s word on this issue. Despite Minister Abbott’s rhetoric about wanting to protect consumers by retaining his role in reviewing premium increases, this bill actually weakens the existing legislative framework in this regard. Under the National Health Act currently, one of the objectives of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, PHIAC, is to minimise premium levels. However, in the Private Health Insurance Bill that we are debating today, this objective has been removed from PHIAC’s remit. One has to question how serious the government is about keeping premiums down if it is not prepared to include these kinds of consumer protections in the bill. Labor moved an amendment to the bill in the other place to address this issue and will do the same during the committee stage in the Senate. Mr Abbott said in the other place that he would be prepared to consider Labor’s amendment. We urge the government to support it, or the Australian public is entitled to conclude that the government is not serious about its promises on private health insurance premiums.
I would like to turn to a number of specific issues relating to the package. Labor are concerned that the bill does not pay enough attention to the standards and quality of services to be provided under the rubric of Broader Health Cover. We need to ensure that consumers have the protection of robust quality and safety standards wherever those services are being delivered. The legislation to provide for quality assurance mechanisms for Broader Health Cover products does not take effect until July 2008—in other words, there will be a 15-month gap between implementation of Broader Health Cover in April 2007 and implementation of the standards and quality provisions in July next year. Labor believes this represents an unacceptable risk to consumers of private health insurance.
Labor moved an amendment to address this issue during the debate in the other place which, unfortunately, the government refused to support. The issue was also discussed by the Senate committee’s report into the legislation. The Senate committee heard from several important stakeholders such as the Australian Private Hospitals Association and Catholic Health Australia, who share Labor’s concern about quality and safety standards. The Senate committee recommended:
That to demonstrate a commitment to quality improvement and to guarantee patient safety, existing quality assurance, professional standards and accreditation regimes should continue to apply to broader health cover services provided until alternative accreditation or equivalent arrangements have been put in place under this legislation.
We urge the government to accept the committee’s recommendation, and Labor will move an amendment to this effect in the Senate.
Labor also shares the concerns of interest groups such as the Australian Medical Association about the lack of sufficient safeguards in the bill for doctors to expressly continue to make clinical decisions in the best interests of their patients. Some groups have raised concerns about this package as being a move towards managed care—that is, a system whereby the private health insurer assumes responsibility for the health costs of its members, through, by example, direct contracting arrangements with doctors and other providers. This means that the private health insurance provider would be involved in the clinical decision making concerning the patient.
The clinical freedom of doctors as against health funds or any other groups, including governments, to determine the best course of treatment for their patients is a fundamental of the Australian health system which Labor believes should be protected at all costs. This issue was again considered at length in the Senate committee report. Many important groups in the health sector, including the AMA, the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Physiotherapy Association, share Labor’s concerns about protecting the clinical autonomy of health professionals.
The Senate committee recommended that the operations regarding clinical independence currently included in the bill be reviewed after four years:
... to ensure that the implementation of broader health cover has not resulted in any reduced clinical oversight of patient care nor had any negative impact on the quality of and delivery of health services to patients.
Labor support this recommendation, but we also believe that more robust protections of doctors’ clinical autonomy ought to be included in the legislation now. Labor moved an amendment in the other place to address this issue and will be doing the same during the committee stage in the Senate. Again we urge the government to support our sensible amendment.
In addition to the introduction of Broader Health Cover, the bill contains some policy changes of note. The first is the introduction of a requirement for private health insurance funds to produce standard product information on their private health insurance products. People recognise how difficult it is to compare offerings from competing private health insurers—I have to say it is a bit like comparing mobile phone packages. This requirement in the bill is designed to make it easier for consumers to compare different products and to understand what entitlements they may have when they take out a policy. Labor strongly support the introduction of these requirements as, if they work, they will be of significant benefit to consumers—though we do note the concerns of some stakeholders about the implementation of this measure, as was discussed in the Senate report.
A related issue, also canvassed by the Senate report, is the issue of informed financial consent—that is, the ability of patients to access information about the costs of their treatment before that treatment takes place, except in emergency cases, for obvious reasons. According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, almost 20 per cent of privately insured hospital episodes create unexpected bills. Obviously this is bad for patients, but it is also bad for the private health sector and its relationship with its consumers.
Unfortunately, the government has chosen not to address this issue in this package of legislation. There is currently an information campaign underway to encourage doctors to obtain informed financial consent from their patients, which we understand is having some moderate success. However, we believe this is an important consumer protection issue which the government is dealing with extremely tentatively.
The bill will also introduce a change to the Lifetime Health Cover scheme, whereby people who have retained private health insurance for over 10 years will no longer be subject to Lifetime Health Cover loadings on their private health insurance premium, even if they took out their insurance after they turned 31. Labor supports this change.
This package of bills will also streamline the private health insurance legislative framework by bringing the main components of the existing framework and the framework for the new policy proposed by the package under one act. We of course support these changes, though we do share the concerns of some stakeholders, including the Medical Benefits Fund, who submitted to the Senate their concern about:
... the number of provisions under the Bill which can be modified substantially in whole or in part through the making of rules by the Minister or PHIAC (as the case may be).
They were essentially saying that much of the power was now being held by the minister or the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The Senate committee:
... considers that the over reliance on extensive subordinate legislation to implement important reform packages does not allow for sufficient scrutiny of the objectives of the legislation.
The package will also introduce a change to existing risk equalisation, or reinsurance, arrangements. Labor supports this change, as it will result in a better distribution of the overall insurance risk than the current formula, and so is an improvement on the current arrangements. But we remain somewhat surprised that the government has chosen to adopt this model when it was clearly not the government’s preferred option. The explanatory memorandum makes clear that the government preferred a different model—a capitation model—as this would have been the ‘best strategic option for the longer term’. If there is, in the government’s view, a better long-term option, why did it not pursue it? We also note from the Senate committee report that there are some outstanding issues with the risk equalisation arrangements that are yet to be resolved.
To conclude, as we have made clear both here and in the other place, Labor support the package. We think it is important to focus on prevention measures, on better managing chronic disease and on keeping people out of hospital wherever possible. But Labor are concerned about the equity impact of this package. We are concerned that people without private health insurance will miss out. This is not a reason not to support the package, as we endorse the package’s rationale, but it is a reason for the government to turn its attention to thinking about how people who rely on the public system do not miss out altogether. We want to make sure that those who are not insured get the best quality services as well. Private health insurance should provide people with choice and different options but not a whole range of health services that are not available to others.
I would like to thank the Senate committee—Senator Humphries is here—for the work that they did on these bills in a very short period of time. Once again we were tasked with dealing with an extensive piece of legislation and no regulations—admittedly, they appeared on the morning of the Senate inquiry—and we came up with what I think is a reasonable report, given the time frame that we had to work within.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-20,"—This package of seven bills makes changes to the current regulatory regime for private health insurance. Of these, the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 is by far the most significant. It represents the most significant change to private health insurance since the government introduced its 30 per cent rebate and Lifetime Health Cover back in 2000-01. It has implications not only for the privately insured population but also for the 56 per cent of the population who are dependent on the public system—indeed, on our health system as a whole.
The government’s oft repeated claim of being ‘the best friend that Medicare has ever had’ becomes more implausible with this latest insidious step in the white-anting of the health system. This bill does not address the real problems in our health system: inefficiencies and duplication; waste cost, particularly in the private sector; a failure to make the best use of our workforce; neglect of quality and safety issues; and of course the ever-present cost shifting and buck-passing between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. Rather than tackling any of these, the government has spent billions of dollars on cosmetic solutions, leaving the foundations to crumble.
The measures in this bill have the potential to accelerate that deterioration. The bill allows private health insurance funds to provide what the government has called Broader Health Cover. This means that for the first time private health insurance will be able to cover medical services outside the hospital environment. Health funds will be able to cover services which are classed as part of an episode of hospital care or can substitute for an episode of hospital care—services such as home nursing, dialysis and chemotherapy. They will also be able to provide insurance for services designed to prevent people from needing to go to hospital—programs such as chronic disease management and health promotion.
The Democrats have always been advocates for more prevention and early intervention in our health system. Clearly, preventing people from needing hospitalisation is a very admirable goal. Under most circumstances we would strongly support moves in that direction. Similarly, the Democrats support broader access to non-hospital based care. Health care should be provided in the most appropriate and safest setting possible and funding mechanisms should be designed to support that.
But—and it is a big but—these new arrangements will increase the inequalities which already exist within the health system and threaten universalism, which is at the core of an efficient and equitable health system. An individual’s health care, and indeed their health status, should not be determined by virtue of their financial status or their ability to buy or maintain health insurance. A universal healthcare system means that services and benefits are available to everyone on the same terms.
Under the broader healthcare arrangements, services will be available to people with private health insurance that are not equally available to those without it. Under these arrangements, there will be a range of preventive and disease management services available to those with private health insurance. The Democrats say that Australians who do not have private health insurance should have the same access to and the same options for medical treatment, out-of-hospital care and preventive programs as those with private health insurance.
It is not easy to predict the effects of changes to health insurance. This is a very complicated area. But if the government’s goal was to encourage the decay of the public health insurance system then expanding the role of private health insurance while neglecting Medicare and publicly available services would certainly be a good start.
It is true that this legislation offers potential benefits to the quality of health care for the privately insured and may make private health insurance more attractive to some, but we must consider these potential benefits within the context of the broader health system. At the very least it is likely that this bill would exacerbate workforce shortages in public services through further syphoning of a wider range of healthcare professionals into the private sector. The government’s argument that this will reduce premiums is doubtful to say the least. Providing services to patients in the community is not necessarily less expensive, and administration costs for managing these new processes may well be substantial.
In its submission to the inquiry into this bill, MBF noted:
... any potential for health cost control through more innovative models of care are unlikely to be reflected in premiums over the short term.
MBF suggested:
... costs of covering preventive programs will be upfront, resulting in a potential upward pressure on prices in the short to medium term.
The government does not have a good record on keeping premiums down. They have all gone up by 40 per cent since the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate.
It is also notable that this legislation removes the objective of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council to ‘minimise the level of health insurance premiums’ and replaces it with ‘protect the interests of consumers’. It would seem to be the case that the government does not believe its own assertions about premiums not going up.
The Democrats will be moving an amendment during the committee stage to restore the objective of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council to minimise the level of health insurance premiums. We will also be moving our standard appointments on merit amendment, in this case for the appointment of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman and the appointments of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council’s CEO and members. This is essentially an accountability and probity amendment, which is very timely since we are considering aged care. We have moved it before on many occasions and we will no doubt move it again in the future. We think it is an appropriate protective mechanism.
The Democrats are not opposed to private health care and indeed see some value in a private healthcare sector that complements the public health system, but we do not support the extent of public funding for the private sector that has developed under the Howard government. Nor do we support the escalating commitment of the government to subsidising the private health insurance industry. As part of his evidence to the committee, Mr Ian McAuley from the University of Canberra said:
What we have had in private health insurance when we count measures such as the rebate, the one per cent tax penalty and the Lifetime Health Cover et cetera are five rounds of increasing industry assistance now costing about $4 billion a year. That is $3 billion in direct outlays and at least $1 billion in forgone revenue because of the one per cent incentive.
The 30 per cent rebate to prop up private health insurance is highly inefficient and it undermines the health system as a whole. Private health insurance is clearly inflationary; it misallocates resources and it undermines equitable access to health care. A national public health insurer will always be the most efficient and equitable way to fund health care. We are not saying that all health care should be free or delivered by public organisations but that a single national insurer has the ability to contain costs and unnecessary usage. If the government wants to support private service providers and individual choice then there are much more efficient ways than providing what is little more than industry protection to private health insurance.
The legislation does nothing to address the inefficiency and sustainability of the private health sector. There are some aspects in which this package has merit. I have no doubt that the move to provide standard product information to make comparisons between different insurance plans easier will be welcomed by many people. Working out what is and what is not covered and how much it will cost with the many different health insurance products that are available is a daunting task indeed, and adding out-of-hospital options will increase the complexity. It is unfortunate, however, that the government has seen fit to only provide resources for a website to display this comparative information. This will mean that this information is not easily available to the very many people who still do not have access or good access to the internet—and we should be thinking in particular here about the aged population. Given that the government could find $50 million in the last budget to give to the private health insurance industry to advertise its products, it is surely sensible to find money to make useful information available to the public.
The legislation implements changes to streamline the administration of and regulatory arrangements for the sector, and that too seems to us to be a sensible thing to do. However, it is a problem that these bills will allow a health insurance business to operate other health related businesses—for instance, clinics, hospitals and health related financial products—without requiring the health insurer to advise consumers of its links to these other health related business activities. We think this has substantial potential for conflict of interest.
The legislation introduces a change to the Lifetime Health Cover scheme. Under the current scheme, private health insurance gets more expensive as you get older if you join after you turn 31. Currently, people pay a two per cent loading on top of their premium for every year they are over 30 when they first take out hospital cover. Not surprisingly, this is a major disincentive to join for older Australians. This legislation puts in place a system so that people who have retained their private health insurance for over 10 years will no longer have to pay the Lifetime Health Cover loadings. In our view, Lifetime Health Cover erodes the policy of community rating—something which is a central tenet of the private health insurance system in Australia.
The introduction of Lifetime Health Cover frightened many Australians into taking out private health insurance, and it still does. They are unwilling participants in the system. The Democrats would like to see Lifetime Health Cover removed. This would free up millions of dollars which currently go into the rebate—dollars which, we say, could be spent on areas of real need, such as dental care—and it would also release people from a system that is expensive to be part of.
During the committee stage we will be moving an amendment to remove Lifetime Health Cover for everyone, not just for people who have paid loaded premiums for 10 years. Indeed the Democrats are concerned that the broad health cover measures in this legislation will lead to a further erosion of the principle of community rating. Broader Health Cover will give health insurers greater flexibility in designing products targeted at specific populations and the ability to set different prices for different products. As was pointed out in submissions to the inquiry, this will increase the ability of insurers to engage in reducing the risk profile of the insured population. That is known as cream skimming—in other words, attracting low-risk, low-cost members through financial and other incentives not available to high-risk, high-cost members. Will we see higher risk members priced out of the private health insurance market? I think so.
The Democrats are also concerned that this legislation allows for a 15-month lag between the implementation of Broader Health Cover in April 2007 and the implementation of the standards and quality provisions in July next year. What assurances do holders of private health insurance cover have about standards and quality of service within that time? This represents a completely unacceptable risk to consumers of private health insurance. As I said, the exact outcomes of these bills are unknown but there are very substantial risks involved. This is why there must be a review of the impact of the legislation, if it passes.
We will be moving an amendment calling for an independent review of the act, a review which looks at the extent to which broader health cover has eroded universalism in health care and further contributed to inequality in access to services between those with and without private health insurance. The review would also look at whether the new health insurance products that are developed as a result of this legislation are contrary to the principle of community rating, and it would look at the adequacy of the standard information statements arrangements in assisting consumers to compare private health insurance products.
Given the increasing amount of public funding directed to private health insurance, we should be reforming it and making it a better product. But, of course, we should be doing much more than that. We should be reassessing its role in a mixed public-private system that should provide equitable and efficient health care. We should be reassessing the degree of support the government provides to what is essentially an inefficient intermediary service. So this is another wasted opportunity.
My second reading amendment will condemn the government for: escalating commitment to subsidising private health insurance while failing to explore more efficient methods of supporting the private health sector; providing mechanisms which will increase access to services for those with private health insurance while failing to equivalently increase access for those without private health insurance; and failing to invest in the public health system and undertake substantial reorientation of the public health system towards prevention and early intervention.
This amendment also calls on the government to limit the use of taxpayer subsidies of private health insurance by replacing the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate with a capped and means-tested rebate. The Democrats have always deplored the many billions of dollars spent on the private health insurance rebate, because it could have been much better spent.
I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
                  “but the Senate:

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills. As speakers in this place and in the other place have already noted, this package of bills signifies big changes to private health insurance. As my colleague Senator McLucas also said earlier, Labor supports the package, but with some serious reservations and concerns.
My main concern is based on the fact that the government’s private health insurance policies have been a monumental failure in addressing the fundamental issues of access, cost efficiency, quality and equity that are increasingly besetting Australia’s health and hospital services. My worry—shared by my colleagues—is that these bills are, in some respects, sending us further down that track.
The background to these changes is this. Many people living in the outer metropolitan areas of Australia’s major cities cannot get access to a local GP when they need one. The health status of Australia’s Indigenous population remains nothing short of a disgrace. Australians are experiencing a serious increase in the prevalence of debilitating chronic and lifestyle diseases. Rural and remote health and hospital services continue to decline and decay, while rural communities struggle to recruit and retain medical practitioners. It has become indisputable that Howard government neglect over the past 10 years has resulted in Australia having a critical shortage of locally trained general medical practitioners and medical specialists that will take years and years to overcome—if it is ever overcome. All this while the federal coalition government continues to blame the states and territories for anything that goes wrong in the health system, even though it controls the major health funding and policy levers. Do not tell me and other Australians that pressure on the public hospital system has not increased since the introduction of the Howard government’s private health insurance changes and since the Howard government started diverting its health dollars away from Medicare to the private sector.
Over the 11 long years that the Howard government has been in office, there has been a serious and unrelenting assault on the original philosophy and principles of the Medicare scheme, and it is my concern that elements in these bills carry on that assault. I should not need to remind members of the government that, under existing laws passed by the federal Parliament of Australia, all Australians have the right, without qualification, to free hospital treatment for needed medical care.
Despite this legal right, this government now applies a tax penalty on Australian families who earn an average annual wage of approximately $50,000 if the family does not contribute to private health insurance. If that is not an attack on Medicare and average Australian families, I do not know what is. In effect, this government has passed laws requiring average Australian families to subsidise its private health insurance policies. When the government introduced this penalty it said it was specifically targeted at high-income earners. What a sick joke! So far as this government is concerned, a family on $50,000 is a high-income family.
The Howard government’s massive subsidisation of private health insurance was supposed to reduce cost and demand pressures on the public hospital system. It was supposed to provide a private sector example to public hospitals of how to improve the efficiency of hospital service delivery. It was supposed to improve access to public hospital services for people who wished to continue to exercise their right to free hospital treatment under the Medicare scheme. The government’s rhetoric, repeated by Senator Scullion, that federal government subsidisation of private health insurance premiums would take the pressure off the public hospital system has been shown to be a total and utter sham.
The Australian people have had a gutful of the deception of this government in respect of health and hospital services. The Howard government’s response to any problem with Australia’s health system is to blame the states and territories and to play the fear card. The implication constantly made by government members of parliament is that, if you do not have private health insurance, there is a high risk you will not be able to get into hospital when you need to or will not be able to choose your doctor. You can see what this government is about. They are into the fear game. Because their private health insurance policies are so shonky, they have now taken to putting the frighteners on vulnerable Australians. What they are saying to these people is: ‘Forget Medicare—we are going to trash that. Get into private health insurance if you want to ensure you can find a doctor or a hospital when you get seriously ill.’ Yet every time this government sinks the knife into the Medicare scheme and the equity principles underpinning Medicare, it comes out with its holier than thou rhetoric about how it loves Medicare. If this government had any real commitment to Medicare, had any decency towards the less well off in the community, why in God’s name would it be scaring vulnerable, low-income members of the community into taking out private health insurance in order to contribute to the profits and incomes of health funds, private hospital operators and private medical specialists?

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Wasn’t one of the main reasons that Medicare came into existence to ensure that all Australians—the well off, the less well off, the young and the old, Senator Brandis; Australians who live in cities and Australians who live in regional, rural and remote Australia—have access to high-quality health and hospital care regardless of their circumstances? Isn’t this why Australians are so committed to Medicare? It is because it is a fair system, not a fear system.
The government’s health policies are following the same pattern of unfairness that has been typical of much of its actions since it came into power 11 long years ago. If anything, its policies of fear and unfairness and its attacks on the lives of ordinary Australians have intensified, especially since the last election. It is about time that senators opposite realised we are seeing in this country a growing rejection of their tactics of fear.
If the Howard government were in any way sincere about its commitment to Medicare, it would ensure that low- and fixed-income people could continue to rely on having access to Australia’s public hospitals, particularly Australia’s world-class public teaching hospitals. Australia’s public teaching hospitals remain an enduring legacy of previous federal Labor governments. Now these same hospitals are becoming victims of Howard government neglect. The fact is the choice-of-doctor myth is a self-serving tactic of the private health funds and the private hospital sector to sell their services. In reality, choice of doctor is more a choice between a high-cost doctor and a low-cost doctor. It is not about choice between a good and a not so good doctor. The fact is that very few people have access to sufficient information on which to base an informed choice of doctor.
As my colleague Senator McLucas has already pointed out, Labor has serious concerns about some aspects of these bills that take away consumer protection by eating away at the existing legislation. The fact is that when a person becomes seriously ill and requires admission to hospital, they and their family are often in no state, nor do they necessarily have the time, to exercise choice of doctor. The fact is that, since the current government came into office, in many places in Australia there have been serious shortages of medical specialists. As a result, patients often have no other option but to accept the first available specialist. The fact is that these days the biggest challenge is to actually find a doctor who will see and treat you. If the government were really serious about giving patients informed choice of doctor, it would facilitate the availability of public information on individual doctor qualifications, experience and track record. I would like to see that.
Let us look at the facts about private health insurance since the Howard government introduced its private health insurance premium rebates. The government has been taken to the cleaners by the private health funds, the private hospital sector and private medical specialists. They have all creamed it. In fact, they have made a shirt load. What a cakewalk it has been for the private health insurance funds since the introduction of the premium rebate, when an avalanche of taxpayers’ money began to flow into the health funds’ money bags! Since 1999 the health funds have basically not had to do anything. They have simply jumped on the back of Australian taxpayers. The Australian government has done all their work.
Since the time before the introduction of the health insurance premium rebate for privately insured hospital patients, the private health insurance funds, in real dollar terms, have not put one extra dollar of their own money—not one dollar of their own—into the private health insurance system. At the same time, the funds have helped themselves to—wait for it—over $1.5 billion of taxpayers’ money to help fund their management expenses. For senators opposite I will repeat it: $1.5 billion. Surely one of the reasons the government decided to invest so much money into private health insurance, rather than Medicare, was to bring about a similar lift in private health fund contributions. Unfortunately, it did not happen. But do not worry: the well-off people in the community have been able to send a good part of their private hospital bills to the taxpayer to pick up.
Also, how can the private health insurance funds continue to justify their 10 per cent management expense ratio when they do nothing but collect taxpayers’ money and members’ contributions, send out cheques to private hospitals and medical practitioners and run expensive media campaigns? It is about time they stopped living the easy life and began to earn their keep. It is about time the Howard government stopped doing their bidding for them.
Since the introduction of the government’s private health insurance changes, the cost of private health insurance has increased by 46 per cent, way above the CPI increase. The result is that every year the cost of private health insurance is becoming less affordable for the average family. Families are on the same treadmill they were on prior to the rebate. Since the Howard government came into office 11 long years ago, federal outlays for private hospital services have increased from 10 per cent of Australians’ total expenditure on private hospital services to 34 per cent.
The Howard government has clearly taken the lazy view that all you have to do is throw money at the private sector and wondrous things will happen. What it has failed to recognise is that the private hospital sector has one main aim: to maximise its profitability.
—Shame!
—I will take that interjection, Senator Brandis. There is nothing wrong with that, except that increased profits should not be simply derived from maximising access to taxpayer money without proper accountability. The private hospital operators have used increased private health insurance coverage to expand their businesses into hospital services which offer the highest profit mark-up and have the potential for high-volume growth. Private hospital operators certainly have not gone down the road to their nearby public hospitals and asked the public hospital CEOs what the private hospitals can do to relieve the pressure on those public hospitals. So a substantial mismatch has occurred between the private hospital sector’s profits and service growth strategies and sufficient growth in those categories of private hospital services needed to reduce demand on the public health system.
The Howard government’s private health insurance changes opened the door for private hospitals to ramp up activity in those hospital treatments and procedures that provide the greatest profit margins, particularly day-only treatments, and that is what the private hospitals have done. Increased private hospital activity has not taken the pressure off the public hospital system. On the contrary, with the help of the private medical specialists, the private hospitals have created another, more profitable market. We are now seeing that, for many hospital procedures and treatments, privately insured patients have much greater access than Medicare public patients to treatment. This is the threat of the two-tier system referred to by Senator McLucas.
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare published data show that, in the period 2000-01 to 2004-05, private hospital same-day separations increased by 31.5 per cent. That is twice the rate of increase experienced by public hospitals. It is no simple coincidence that private hospitals have ramped up their concentration on same-day services. Between 2000-01 and 2004-05 the average private health fund benefit for a day-only separation in a private hospital increased by 32 per cent while the average bed-day benefit for a multiday stay separation increased by only 25 per cent.
Obviously, the higher the number and proportion of same-day patients, the higher the rate of revenue growth and the higher the profit margin for private hospital operators. While the private hospital sector’s number of low-cost, same-day bed days rose strongly over recent years, the number of private hospital higher cost overnight bed days has remained virtually the same. At the same time, the public hospital system has had to absorb a 4.5 per cent increase in higher cost overnight bed days.
I want this to be very clear: I am not criticising private hospitals for seeking to maximise returns to their owners and shareholders. What I am condemning is the lazy way the Howard government has been willing to so blatantly, and I think wantonly, squander Australian taxpayers’ money and put at risk major parts of Australia’s health system. The public hospital system is in a worse position than it was before the introduction of the Howard government’s private health insurance changes. The fact is that the private hospital sector’s average patient cost weight has fallen. Less average patient treatment complexity equals lower costs and—guess what!—higher profits. So, as a result of the Howard government’s approach to health care, the private hospital sector has managed to shift costs onto the public hospital system. What a testimony to total incompetence by this government. No wonder our public hospitals are buckling under the pressure.
To further underline the total mismanagement by the Howard government of its private health insurance policies, in the five years to the end of 2004-05 the number of licensed private hospital beds increased by only 271—a measly 271 beds across the country. How is that piddling number of additional private hospital beds supposed to take the pressure off the public hospital system? How can the Howard government justify spending nearly $6 billion on private heath insurance rebates in respect of private hospital services over the five years to 2004-05 when all that was achieved was 271 additional private hospital beds? How miserable, how lousy, how stingy! In the same period, the number of public hospital beds increased by no less than 2,700 to meet demand.
Since the Howard government came into office, federal government payments to the private hospital sector have increased by no less than 330 per cent. Over the same period, federal government outlays for public hospital services have increased by only 55 per cent. These figures clearly show what this government is up to. It intends to starve the public hospital system to death while it pours money into the private hospital sector. In cost-effectiveness terms, the government’s private health insurance policies have been a monstrous failure. The public hospital system has for decades been at the very heart of the Medicare scheme. The public teaching hospitals have been the engines of progress in ensuring that Australia’s health and hospital care standards and equality of access to health care have remained the envy of the world. But this government appears hell-bent on breaking the heart of the Medicare scheme, and that is not what Australians voted for.
Finally, I would like to join Senator McLucas in thanking the Senate committee for its work and also join her in urging the government to support Labor’s amendments during the later consideration in detail of this package in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-03-20,"—I congratulate Senator Sterle on that contribution.
—It was nearly as silly as something you might say, Bob.
—Senator Brandis says it was silly, but it was not. It had a lot of factual content—something he might learn from—and it put very clearly the argument that the public health system in Australia is getting a raw deal from this government when compared to the huge amount being poured into the private health system. The figures he gave, which came out of Senate committee work and so on, are a telling testimony to that fact.
Basic to those figures are that 43 per cent of Australians have private health insurance and therefore access not only to the benefits already available but also to those which are inherent in the pieces of legislation now before the Senate: the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills. But that means that 57 per cent, or 12 million Australians, have had that door shut to them. It is a two-tier system with the gap between the two tiers growing greater all the time—a country divided on the basis of the fundamental right of all citizens to a high-quality, effective healthcare system and the health professionals divided on their right to have the support of government in delivering the healthcare system to the public. The increased pressure on the public healthcare system and its professionals is testimony to the neglect of this government—that is, the pressure on doctors, nurses and other health professionals right across the country, where the public system has had such a raw deal.
One thing that is not canvassed in the legislation but which is a telling testimony to that neglect is the dental health system. Just today I read in the Sydney Morning Herald that the private health insurance system gives, I think, $483 million to high-income earners who are accessing the dental health system. Compare that with the 600,000 Australians who are on waiting lists and with the lack of choice which comes to those 600,000 Australians when they actually get to the end of that waiting list in the quality and type of dental health care that is available to them. There is nothing more disgraceful in this area than the Howard government’s very early impulse to carry through the dismantling of the concession card dental health system for Australians on low incomes, including pensioners and poorer people generally. That has meant a general deterioration in the dental health care of Australians who are on lower incomes. It is a matter I will be taking up more in the future in this place.
The government says that the package of bills before us will create new opportunities for the private health sector, allowing greater innovation and even greater choice in private health care. When implemented, the legislation will be a win for consumers, a win for private health insurers and a win for service providers. But it will effectively be a loss for the 12 million Australians who do not have access to that system, and that is the problem with this legislation and many of the components of the bills that come through. They are good in themselves, but they are only good if you are wealthy. They are good in themselves, but they are particularly good for those in the skewed system in which supporters of the government get benefits but the rest of the population, by and large, are left without the benefits. The minister said:
Currently insurers are subject under the National Health Act to no fewer than 48 conditions of registration, and could be deregistered for breaching any of them.
One could say, ‘Fair enough’—but not the government. The minister went on to say, ‘This is as clumsy as it is onerous,’ and that this system will be replaced by a transparent set of product standards. The minister said that at the heart of these standards will be the notion of complying health insurance products and that insurers will have clear obligations relating to community rating premiums, benefits, waiting periods, portability and the provision of standard information. The minister went on to say:
By regulating products not providers—
we are opening—
the door more widely to—
potential—
new entrants into the private health insurance industry and the possibility of existing health insurers adapting their businesses to current market conditions and consumer demands.
It is a standard of regulating products, not providers, that the government has moved to, saying, ‘Let’s not regulate the providers; let’s look at the products.’ In doing so, the minister said that the bill also includes offence provisions for breaching the new product standards, including penalties for insurers that fail to comply with essential information requirements under the act. Then—listen to this—the minister said:
Chief executive officers and directors can be held personally liable only if they do not exercise due diligence in putting in place systems to ensure that insurers comply with the product standards.
I ask: where in all of this is due diligence by the government? Where is the increasing requirement, when there is more public money going out, to ensure that those who handle that money exercise due diligence and prevent fraud? It is not here in the legislation, and it ought to be.
I think the government will live to regret the fact that it is not making sure that, with two or three billion dollars a year going across to the private health system, there is not greater due diligence. There is less due diligence coming from the government itself. These are serious considerations, and the Greens will be pursuing the matter of that requirement if we are going have a pumped-up private health system which advantages all of us in here—we are all on over $100,000 a year—but leaves so many Australians vulnerable. It is our responsibility to ensure that there is greater due diligence, not less, and that the persons who are handling the money—not the products, but the persons who are handling the money—come under greater scrutiny.
I heard Senator Sterle say that 10 per cent of the money goes off to those persons but that there is not an obvious reason for that massive amount of money to be diverted into administrative costs when so little is ostensibly done by the private health insurance sector. That is a matter that requires, I think, a change of policy by the government, and it is something that the Greens will be pursuing. We Greens have consistently opposed the huge amount of public money being diverted into the private health insurance system and away from the public system because, as everybody in this place knows, the public system badly needs those funds. A fairer Australia would insist that the funds were directed to the public system and that the private system be there to compete without the government largesse that the Howard administration has poured into it. With that in mind, I foreshadow that I will move that these words be added at the end of the motion:
“but the Senate is of the view that the private health insurance rebate should be abolished and that the funds should be redirected to the public health system”.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-03-20,"—I want to rise in this debate to support this Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related legislation and to indicate that I think it is a very positive and effective step in a number of directions. As the minister himself said in introducing this legislation, it is designed to be of benefit to private health consumers, private health insurance providers, private health insurance companies and the community generally. I believe that, on any of those tests, this legislation can certainly be seen as a step in the right direction.
I think it would be unfortunate if people listening to this debate were to draw the conclusion that the legislation that is before the Senate at the moment is in some way an adverse outcome for Australian health consumers. I heard Senator Allison, earlier in this debate, describe the legislation—I think she said this—as ‘an insidious step in the white-anting of our health system’. I heard a series of criticisms from Senator McLucas, and I heard the usual attacks from Senator Brown on the concept of private health insurance. It would be unfortunate if it were not recorded in this debate that the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which I chair, conducted hearings into this legislation. The committee heard a majority of witnesses before the inquiry—organisations as diverse as the Private Health Insurance Association, the Australian Medical Association and a number of organisations representing different areas of health consumption, such as motor neurone disease—affirm that they supported the direction of this legislation.
This is a good step towards creating flexibility for consumers of health services in Australia. Let me explain why. At the present time private health insurance in Australia covers a very significant number of Australians—something like 12 million Australians. It provides for a range of services to be supported through the payment of a premium. Those services tend, at the moment, to be concentrated on hospitals, particularly private hospitals in Australia. Despite putting on record the fact that private hospitals in Australia are of a very high standard and meet very important delivery outcomes for the people of Australia, it is nonetheless true to say that there is considerable room for those services to be diversified. For example, at the moment, if a person wishes to obtain dialysis, one might do so through a public hospital. If one has insurance, one might do so through a private hospital, but there are limited options, at the moment, for obtaining that dialysis in the private sector—such as in a community health setting or in a facility designed for that purpose, perhaps even in a doctor’s surgery. There are limited opportunities for those services to be provided to Australians outside hospitals.
We know that hospitals are important parts of our health system, but they are also very expensive parts of our health system. It is logical that we should consider ways of being able to shift some services out of hospitals—where that can be achieved effectively in a clinical and cost-effective sense and where benefits accrue to the community by virtue of that occurring. That is what this legislation is all about. It is about creating a more flexible health system where the users of private health insurance products are able to get a broader range of services that suit the needs that they bring to the health system.
That is essentially what this legislation does. I am sorry that there has been so much criticism of it in the course of the debate today, because the witnesses who came before the inquiry affirmed that they saw this as a positive step. There were some concerns about the way in which this will work, and indeed a number of witnesses suggested amendments to the legislation. A number of those amendments have been picked up by the community affairs committee and made as recommendations to the government to adopt. I look forward to those issues being examined seriously and effectively by the government.
I want to pick up on a number of points that were made in the course of the debate, to indicate why I believe this legislation, in its present form—with some amendments—needs to proceed. First of all, Senator McLucas made fairly strong comments about the possibility of this legislation resulting in increases in premiums. That is an unfortunate line of attack because, as we know, there has been a tendency for premiums for health insurance to rise. Those rises are very easily misunderstood and mischaracterised in the Australian community. Some people suggest that this is because the health system is out of control or because the government does not exercise enough control over the circumstances under which rises are allowed to occur and that this is somehow a sign of the system breaking down. Of course it is not any of those things.
Rises in health insurance premiums reflect the reality that the cost of medical services in this country, and indeed everywhere in the developed world, is rising. It is rising because new drugs are being discovered every day which alleviate conditions which previously were not treatable or not treatable effectively, new technologies are being applied and greater training is being employed to increase the understanding of the way diseases operate. All of those things have an effect on the cost of medical services.
It is frankly disingenuous to pretend that you can somehow, as a government, an alternative government or a minister for health, stand on the shore and hold back the tide of the rising costs of our health system. It is a reality which every government in the Western world is facing and which governments in this country will continue to face for some time to come. It does not mean you cannot adjust the system to decrease the pressure on health insurance premium rises, but nonetheless those rises will most likely continue to occur. The rate of inflation for medical services has historically been higher than the rate of inflation for other services and goods in the community generally. We cannot get away from that fact.
This legislation is designed to give us a more flexible approach to those issues, and it has the potential to result in smaller rises or even no rises at all. If services can be provided outside hospitals in community settings, for example, rather than in hospitals where necessarily costs are very high then there is a chance that those services can be provided more cheaply. By doing that, those services will be provided at less expense and with less pressure on health insurance premiums. That is a good thing, and we should welcome that and embrace the flexibility this legislation creates to achieve that outcome.
We had a general attack from Senator Brown on private health insurance, in the course of this debate, criticising the people who take out private health insurance—in fact, I understood him to be describing them as supporters of the government. He said that supporters of the government get benefits but the rest miss out. I would be very interested in taking a straw poll of which members of the Senate, including those on the other side of the chamber, have private health insurance. I suspect there would be a very large proportion who do. I think they would baulk at being supporters of the government. There are millions of Australians, who might not be described as supporters of the government, who nonetheless have made the decision to take out private health insurance. They do so because they see that they get value for money out of it.
No-one likes to see rises in premiums, and I do not think anyone believes a government or an alternative government that promise they can stop rises in premiums, especially if they do not outline how they propose to achieve that miraculous event. But nonetheless private health insurance is an important part of our health system and, most importantly, it takes an enormous amount of pressure off our public hospital system. If those 12 million or however many Australians were without private health insurance, there would be an enormous shift of demand onto our public hospital systems. I do not need to tell anybody in this Senate what tremendous pressure public hospitals in this country are already under, how underresourced they generally are and how they would simply not cope if they were dealing with not only public patients but also the private patients who are presently being assisted through private health insurance.
It is all very well for those opposite to bemoan the cost of the private health insurance rebate and to say this might be money better spent somewhere else, but the fact is: you cannot devise a system without it which does not result in tremendous pressure—indeed, probably intolerable pressure—on Australia’s public hospital system. It simply does not work. It particularly does not work if you are not prepared to outline what your alternative is. I say to those opposite: we are approaching a federal election. If you do not think the present system is working, tell us what you think will work better. Of course, we are yet to understand what that alternative might be; presumably, we will find out some time before Australians go to the polls.
Another issue raised by Senator McLucas in the course of the debate was a technical issue relating to the role of PHIAC, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. She suggested that one of the criteria for PHIAC’s operation should be to reduce premiums or to prevent rises in health insurance premiums. I say to her, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: that is on the face of it a reasonable suggestion, but when one delves a little closer one realises that there are problems with that proposition. The Private Health Insurance Administration Council’s role is to examine proposals for new products to be added to the list of those which are funded through private health insurance. If someone comes along and says, ‘I want to add this product of dialysis in a non-hospital setting; will you approve that?’ it is their role to see whether this makes sense, whether it is clinically effective, whether it will be a good service to provide to Australians and then, if it is, presumably to tick it off.
A consequence of adding new services to the list of things which are covered by private health insurance is—theoretically, at least—that costs increase as a result of that. You may have a new service which is very good and likely to be used but which will add to the cost of private health insurance premiums. None of us wants to see that, but we have to acknowledge that there is a trade-off between increased premiums and increased services on occasions. These changes propose to allow for Australians to get not just—let’s hope not—theoretically increased premiums but also better services at the same time. If that were the case, we would need to make a decision about how effective those additional benefits might be versus the cost of them. But, if PHIAC’s role were to minimise the cost of premiums, it would be in the difficult position of realising that new services might cost more and increase the cost of premiums, and it might be obliged on occasions to knock back those new services because they add to the cost of a premium. That would be an unfortunate outcome, particularly if there were people who wished to purchase those services. With respect to Senator McLucas and the Labor Party, that position looks superficially sensible but in fact it is others who need to make the decision about the effectiveness and cost of premiums, rather than PHIAC, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council.
Senator McLucas picked up on a suggestion made during the inquiry that the legislation needs to build in a protection for doctors’ clinical decision making—that that decision making needs to be respected and made central to the way in which the legislation works. I think there is a case for that. I do not doubt that the clinical integrity of doctors’ decisions needs to be preserved as part of the operation of our health system, but I am not sure that it has a role in respect of the way services are constructed for the purpose of offering a product through private health insurance—for example, it may be assessed as logical or cost-effective to not offer a certain service in the private sector, in a hospital or outside a hospital. A doctor may disagree. A doctor may say: ‘I think this service must be provided in the hospital. I don’t wish to have that service provided anywhere else but in the hospital.’ It is very hard to determine through the private health insurance process that a product should occur outside a hospital setting if a doctor or doctors are saying, ‘No, we have a different view about where that should be provided.’ In fact, I think it is easy to argue that there are different levels at which that decision making ought to occur that protects a doctor’s clinical judgement and that it should not occur at the level of this legislation.
There has been criticism about there not being enough indication within the legislation on issues such as informed financial consent. Senator Brown made criticisms about things that were not in the legislation. This is not legislation about private health insurance generally or about a range of services available to consumers; it is about increasing flexibility in this particular area of our health system. There is room for other legislation to deal with those issues if necessary.
I want to finish by saying that this legislation takes Australian health care into a new realm. It engineers a level of innovation, flexibility and choice which our health system needs. It is a heavily structured and regulated system. No-one should pretend, in looking at this legislation, that in some ways we are intruding into an area which is basically operated by the market; far from it. It is a system which is very heavily influenced by regulation, and this legislation seeks to make that regulation a little more flexible and to provide for new services to emerge in a setting that is appropriate for those new services. I think that is only to be seen as a good thing. Some testing of this new model is required, and I am sure that will occur. I have no doubt the minister is closely watching what happens with this legislation. I have no doubt that, if changes are necessary, they will be made. But I am confident that this is the right start. It is a very good step towards greater flexibility. It should, in some areas at least, reduce pressure for premium increases, and I look forward to seeing how effectively it delivers services to the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2007-03-20,"—The package of bills before us, and specifically the main bill, the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006, seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory regime for the private health insurance sector and to replace the current regime. The other bills in the package provide for the transitional arrangements and consequential amendments to existing legislation.
Measures contained in the main bill, including those relating to Broader Health Cover, the provision of standard product information and changes to Lifetime Health Cover for consumers with 10 years continuous cover, represent a significant change to the private health insurance sector. Labor has stated that it generally supports the bills as they are likely to result in considerable benefits to the 44 per cent of the Australian population that currently have private health insurance. They are also likely to provide some benefits to the 40 per cent of Tasmanians that have invested their hard-earned funds in private health insurance.
In saying that, it is important to note that the benefits contained in this bill will not be accessible for the majority of Tasmanians, who are statistically less likely to have private health cover because of their locality and status as lower income earners. However, Labor supports those measures in the bill that will assist those people with private health cover, particularly the provisions relating to Broader Health Cover and standard product information. Under Broader Health Cover, private health insurance funds will for the first time be able to provide cover for many medical services provided outside the hospital setting by facilitating funds to provide cover for out-of-hospital services that either substitute for in-hospital procedures, such as chemotherapy and dialysis, or are designed to prevent hospitalisation in the first place.
Broader Health Cover represents a necessary step forward in the provision of health care—likewise, the standard product information requirements, under which private health insurance funds will be required to produce standard information statements for their products, should go some way to helping consumers make informed choices and be more aware of their exact entitlements under their particular scheme. Hopefully, consumers will no longer have to sift through numerous forms and documents to try to figure out their entitlements, as has previously been the case, nor will they be caught stranded by having to pay for services they thought were covered by their scheme. However, while Labor tentatively welcomes such changes, it has several significant reservations about the bill and the government’s approach to health care in general. These reservations were shared by several witnesses who gave evidence at the public hearing and are refected in the recommendations handed down in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs.
Labor’s primary concern relates to the implications of the bill and not the specific content. While Labor supports the benefits that the bill will promote for those Australians with private health insurance, it is concerned about the implications for those Australians without private health insurance, who make up the majority. The expansion of the range of services and benefits that can be accessed under Broader Health Cover means that people with private health insurance will logically have greater access to a wider range of health services than those who do not. This is likely to result in the creation of a two-tiered health system in Australia, where those people who can afford private health insurance will have greater access to a wider range of services and benefits than those who cannot.
People who are without private health insurance will be restricted to the services and benefits covered by Medicare, whereas those who have the capacity to purchase private health insurance will have a greater range of choice and, under Broader Health Cover, will have the ability to access out-of-hospital services as well as preventive health programs. This situation seems to produce an illogical result, as research shows that people who can least afford private health cover are the ones who would most benefit from it. People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to suffer from certain generally preventable conditions such as obesity and heart disease, which could possibly be avoided if they were able to access preventive health services. By choosing to make these improvements and offer these benefits in the private rather than the public sector, the government has paved the way for the further commercialisation of the health system, whereby access to services is determined by a person’s capacity to pay. While beneficial to people with private health insurance, the provisions are aimed at ‘consumers’—to quote the minister—not the Australian public as a whole, and definitely not at those who need it most.
These concerns about the bill were shared by the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, who noted in their submission that the bill will:
... create greater complexities ... between the public and private health systems ... enabling service providers and health care insurers to respond with practices that segregate those with health insurance and those without ...
Labor is also concerned that the bill does not provide enough protection for doctors’ clinical independence—another concern which was expressly shared by groups such as the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Medical Association, who provided evidence at the public hearing. While the bill does provide for safeguards under clause 172-5, these groups considered this safeguard to be too limited. The AMA expressed concern that under the bill there remained real risks that health funds may seek to interfere with clinical decisions made by doctors in relation to patient treatment, such as whether a patient needs to be treated in hospital. They stated:
A broader, more realistic guarantee of no interference in clinical management and clinical decision making ... is necessary. The existing guarantee is too limited.
The APHA shared the AMA’s concerns and recommended that ‘the protection of clinical discretion should be a requirement of all agreements between health insurance funds and all service providers, including hospitals’.
Concern about the threat posed to doctors’ clinical independence resulted in the committee recommending in its report that the provisions in clause 172-5 be independently reviewed four years after the act has commenced, in order to ensure that the implementation of Broader Health Cover has not resulted in any reduction of clinical oversight of patient care or any negative impact on the quality of health services. While Labor supports an independent review of the clause, it believes, as stated in the additional comments attached to the committee report, that the clause should be broadened now to cover all other circumstances in which doctors’ clinical independence may be threatened—such as hospital purchase provider agreements and those that arise from Broader Health Cover arrangements. Labor believes that it is better for the government to have a broad safeguard in place to cover such situations than for it to sit on its hands and wait until something goes wrong. This is what is likely to happen if the clause is not amended and is reviewed only after four years. Labor also included in its additional comments a recommendation that the bill should contain the specific objective of minimising private health insurance premium levels, either in the PHIAC’s objectives or as an explicit responsibility of the minister.
The government claims that the bill will not have an impact on premiums. In fact, in his second reading speech the minister went so far as to state that some of the changes contained in the bill will actually reduce pressure on premiums. However, logic dictates that if the changes contained in the bill will result in funds offering cover for a broader range of products and services then consumers will be expected to pay more. The changes, while in theory beneficial to consumers, will naturally result in an increase rather than a decrease in premiums in the short term. The last time the government said that one of its policies would result in a reduction of pressure on private health insurance premiums was in 2000-01. Since then, there has been a 40 per cent increase in premiums. Between 1998 and 2006, the cost of private health insurance has increased twice as fast as general inflation. Given this track record, it is unlikely that these new changes to the private health insurance regime will result in anything other than an expansion of scope of business for funds and increased costs to consumers.
Any increase in premiums is likely to result in further pressure being put on Australian households with already tight budgets. Figures show that Australian households, particularly families, are already squeezed from many directions by the government—with the average mortgage repayment consuming 32 per cent of family income and recent figures showing that childcare fees eat up as much as 17 per cent of family weekly earnings. Combined with persistently high petrol prices and the ever-looming threat of a further interest rate rise, any increase in private health insurance premiums will hurt Australian households and make private health insurance even less affordable for families.
Labor generally supports the legislation because of the obvious benefits it will afford to those Australians with private health insurance. However, we believe that, at a minimum, amendments need to be made to broaden the protection of doctors’ clinical autonomy and to provide a guarantee against further increases in premiums. I wish to reiterate that Labor is concerned about the effects that the legislation and, more importantly, the government’s decision to pursue changes to the healthcare system through the private rather than the public sphere will have on Australians who are without private health insurance. This legislation sets the stage for the creation of a two-tiered health system where access to health services will be determined by the ability to pay, not by need.
The minister made an undertaking that he would carefully consider the recommendations made by the committee and the concerns raised in the committee hearings. I urge him to consider the issues that I and many of my colleagues have just raised. Access to and the cost of health care in this country is an issue for all Australians, not just ‘consumers’ of private health insurance. The fact that the government has chosen to improve the delivery of health services through the private rather than the public sector proves that it is out of touch with the needs of the majority of Australians who do not have private health cover. Why should only those who can afford private health insurance be the ones to benefit from changes such as Broader Health Cover? Why shouldn’t every Australian have equal access to out-of-hospital and preventive health services? Once again the government has overlooked the people who are most in need of such services.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I too rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills. This is important legislation and includes many changes to our current system. The provisions in this package will provide benefits for 45 per cent of Australians—and, for this reason, it has my support. This bill represents a significant change in the way we view health care. Under these new proposals, private health insurance members will have cover for services outside the hospital. Furthermore, the Broader Health Cover provisions will allow funds to offer their members coverage for services which may prevent an episode of hospital care. There is strong evidence that the overall level of community health will be improved and the total cost of the health system minimised if we focus more on preventative health measures and early intervention with those most at risk of developing illnesses. Therefore, this legislation is, in principle, a step in the right direction.
I do, however, have many concerns regarding this legislation, which I will discuss here today. Firstly, the government has said that this package will not have an impact on premiums. Tony Abbott argued in his second reading speech that provisions in the package may even reduce premiums. I wish to remind the Senate that in 2000 and 2001 the federal government said that there would be downward pressure on premiums, yet Australians have suffered a 40 per cent increase in premiums since then. Between 1998 and 2006 the cost of private health insurance increased twice as much as general inflation, and this is unacceptable. If Medibank Private is sold, there is a real possibility that private health premiums will rise even further.
The fact is that the government cannot be trusted on private health insurance premiums. How can private health insurers expand their services yet cut premiums? Even if the private health insurance companies do save money on preventative programs, such as weight loss programs, to avoid a hospital stay, these savings will not be passed on overnight; it will take time for these savings to flow on. Under the National Health Act, one of the objectives of the Private Health Insurers Administration Council is to minimise premium levels. In the Private Health Insurance Bill as it stands, this objective has been removed. Why will the government not include this consumer protection?
The potential increase in private health insurance premiums as a result of this package will certainly have a negative financial impact on families who have private health insurance. Of grave concern to me are the individuals who are just over the $50,000 threshold—the point at which the government requires individuals to take out private health insurance or suffer further tax if they do not. The government needs to lift its threshold to accommodate the average real wage increase from $36,000 to $54,000.
Secondly, the last budget included a massive $55 million over a period of four years to increase consumer awareness of the incentives and benefits associated with private health insurance. This is a gross misuse of taxpayers’ funds. It would have been of greater benefit to the public to direct those funds into our ailing health system. Fifty-five million dollars could have been used to buy equipment for our hospitals and to train more staff. How can the government justify spending this amount of money on advertising? It justifies spending this amount of money on advertising because it has done it for the last 11 long years.
Tony Abbott has failed to address the huge challenges facing Australia’s ailing health system. Quality health care is unaffordable for many Australian families. Tony Abbott should be trying to cut the huge waiting lists in the public health system and he should be trying to find a way to attract and retain doctors and nurses. Instead, Tony Abbott has been throwing mud at Mr Rudd. This Howard government is all about providing for the few at the top with no regard for the little guy. The Howard government governs for itself and not for the country.
There are many benefits associated with having private health insurance, such as flexibility and choice regarding treatment, less waiting time for some procedures, access to the best quality care and general peace of mind. But these benefits are not something all Australians can afford. While this package will benefit the 44 per cent of Australians who can afford private health insurance, the legislation does not provide insurance for the majority of Australians who do not have private health insurance. I am concerned that people who are uninsured will not have access to the best quality services.
A Labor government will secure the future of our healthcare system and, in particular, ensure that the private sector plays a valuable role within that system. The public and private sectors are being placed at risk by the Howard government’s sale of Medibank Private. The bottom line is that Australia needs both public and private healthcare systems to thrive. Australians understand that private hospitals provide a range of specialist surgical and elective procedures while, typically, public hospitals treat emergency patients and patients with acute conditions—a burden they continue to shoulder.
This means Australians need both the public sector and the private sector to thrive. A policymaker who has thrown up their hands in despair of the public system cannot turn their back on it now and solely focus on the private system to solve the mixed system’s weaknesses and downfalls. Rather than address the real policy challenges required to create thriving public hospital and private hospital sectors, the government is obsessed with selling Medibank Private. This is unacceptable to me and unacceptable to the Australian public.
Support for private insurance is discriminatory against those who pay for their own care. Twenty-one per cent of recurrent healthcare expenditure, to the tune of $16 million per year, is paid from the consumer’s own pocket. This proportion is rising steadily. This legislation does not provide for any quality insurance mechanisms for Broader Health Cover to take effect until July 2008. I believe it is an unacceptable risk to have a 15-month wait for the implementation of quality standards. We should delay this legislation until we can be sure that quality standards are being enforced.
I strongly support the requirement for private health insurance funds to provide consumers with standard product information. This will be of significant benefit to our consumers. Labor believes that better informed healthcare consumers will participate more actively in the health decision making process, which would lead to a reduction in the incidence of adverse effects, foster a greater partnership approach between consumers and providers and increase consumer satisfaction with the care provided.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-03-20,"—Firstly, I would like to congratulate the new ministers on their appointments; I hope that they have better luck tomorrow in finding their seats as they move up the chain. My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister conspired to keep the former Minister for Ageing’s trading in CBio shares a secret? Why did the Prime Minister not advise the parliament and the public of the issue in October last year when he first became aware of the minister’s clear conflict of interest? Why did he agree to do nothing himself and allow Senator Santoro to finally lodge an incomplete and misleading declaration in December last year—some two months after raising the issue with the Prime Minister? Why did the Prime Minister not insist that the declaration advise the full truth about the CBio shares purchase? Didn’t the Prime Minister fail in his duty to enforce his own ministerial code of conduct and ministerial standards of accountability? Aren’t the public entitled to conclude that the Prime Minister will only act on breaches of his ministerial code if the matter is exposed in the public arena?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Responsibility</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-03-20,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister failed to answer the key aspect of the question: why did the Prime Minister not make public the conflict of interest of his minister when he was advised of it? Why did he allow the minister a further two months before he updated his pecuniary interest register? Why did he allow Senator Santoro to make a declaration which was not full and frank, which was misleading about the dates of the purchase of the shares, and therefore continued to mislead in this matter? Surely the Prime Minister had a responsibility to be open, honest and transparent rather than to allow Senator Santoro to continue to mislead regarding the nature of his share holdings and the dates of their purchase?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Responsibility</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-03-20,"—The Prime Minister obviously insists upon all ministers complying with the ministerial code of conduct. It is my understanding that ours is the first government to have such a ministerial code of conduct. The Prime Minister can rightly be proud of the fact that it was he who introduced such a code of conduct and that he ensures that all ministers understand their obligations under his code of conduct to declare their pecuniary interests to him and maintain the contemporary nature of that declaration. All ministers are, of course, also bound by the resolutions of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which also require them to register their pecuniary interests and to maintain them.
It is now obviously well known to one and all that Senator Santo Santoro did neglect to ensure that both the Senate register of interests and the register of interests with the Prime Minister were kept up to date. He has paid the ultimate price for that neglect and tendered his resignation last week as the Minister for Ageing. Could I take this opportunity to commend Senator Santoro on the work he did as Minister for Ageing. I have not heard one word in all the time that has expired on this issue that is derogatory of his actual performance in the ministry—indeed, there are many who have proclaimed the virtue of the very strong performance that he put in as the Minister for Ageing. None of the events that have occurred go to his performance in that role. I think he can rightly be proud of his service since January of last year in that demanding and difficult portfolio.
The Prime Minister acknowledged that, once the issue of CBio had been raised, Senator Santoro dealt with it properly. He wrote immediately to the Prime Minister once he became aware that he had not declared that particular interest. He issued instructions for the shares to be sold. He issued instructions for the profits to go to another organisation and not to himself, and he changed the Senate register accordingly to ensure that it registered that interest and the disposal of that particular interest. It is clear that CBio could represent a conflict and that is why those shares were dealt with as they were. The Prime Minister and his office made it clear to Senator Santoro at the time those matters were drawn to his attention that he must ensure that his declarations of interests to the Prime Minister and to the Senate were full and complete.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-03-20,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Abetz. Will the minister inform the Senate of employment and wage outcomes in the Australian workforce since Work Choices was passed into law almost one year ago? Are there any threats to these positive outcomes being continued into the future?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-03-20,"—I thank Senator Ronaldson for his question and note that he, like all of us on this side, is committed to getting on with the job of creating more jobs and higher wages for our fellow Australians. That is why the Howard government took the tough but necessary decision to introduce Work Choices. It was tough because like all of our reforms it was cynically opposed by those opposite. But it was necessary because we wanted to ensure ongoing jobs and wages growth for our fellow Australians. Almost a year has passed now and the results are in. In four words, the results are more jobs, higher wages. Let me repeat that: more jobs, higher wages—the exact opposite of that which Labor said would happen.
Since Work Choices was passed into law on 27 March 2006, there have been a massive 263,000 jobs created for our fellow Australians. Tellingly, a massive 87 per cent of those jobs—228,810—are full-time jobs; real jobs. What did the Labor Party falsely prophesise would take place? There would be mass sackings, they said. They could not have been more wrong. What we have seen is mass employment, not mass sackings. What about wages? Once again, Labor promised doom and gloom. For example, Labor’s employment spokesman in this place, Senator Wong, repeatedly and falsely asserted that Work Choices would drive down wages. Indeed, so did senators McEwen, Conroy, Sterle and Webber. Get the picture? Every single Labor senator in this place made that false assertion about Work Choices. And the facts? Since the commencement of Work Choices, real wages have risen by 1.5 per cent. In total, real wages have now risen under the Howard government by 19.8 per cent, compared to a fall in real wages under the previous Labor government.
There is indeed a threat to the positive wage and job outcomes that the Howard government has delivered through Work Choices, and the threat is the Labor Party. Make no mistake: if Labor are elected, they will rip up Work Choices; they will rip up 263,000 jobs—and they are cheering. So if Labor gets elected, the jobs of those 263,000 Australians will be ripped up. I thank my colleagues opposite for putting that on the public record. Further, the people of Australia will no longer enjoy the real wage increases that they have obtained.
It is clear that only a strong economy can deliver real wage increases without runaway inflation. The wizardry of the Labor Party when they were last in government gave us high unemployment, high inflation and no real wage increases. That was the wizardry of the Labor Party compared to that of the Howard government, which has delivered real employment growth and real wages growth. The issue that counts for Australians and their families is the opportunity for employment so as to be self-sufficient. The Howard government, by taking the tough but necessary decisions, has delivered on behalf of the people of Australia.

Doesn’t Centrelink’s website state that a failure to do so leaves the individual open to the criminal charge of fraud and a possible fine or a requirement to do community service hours?

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-03-20,"—There were substantive parts to that question, which I will have to take on notice. The issue that it goes to in terms of equity and accountability is very clear: Senator Santoro has had to meet with a number of obligations in terms of his shareholdings, and so have a number of other people on this side and that side of the table. We have a clear and transparent process in this place concerning declarations of interest, particularly with regard to share portfolios. Quite clearly, the Prime Minister found Senator Santoro to be in breach of those arrangements—and he paid a very high price. You cannot ask for more transparency than what has come from this government. In fact, before this government, I did not see any processes in terms of creating a transparent and accountable framework to ensure that there was complete probity in regard to ministerial responsibilities and potential conflicts of interest. I am very proud to be part of a government that has set the way in that regard, and I do not think there is any inequity concerning requirements for people to make presentations on Centrelink payments and the very high cost that the senator has paid in this regard.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Responsibility</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer

He has paid the highest price. I cannot see that we have to answer this in any other way. He has paid the highest price in terms of a breach. Very clearly, the question goes to equity. If someone were on Centrelink payments, would they be required to answer in some particular fashion? I am sorry, I do not have any particulars or details of a Centrelink individual.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to senators’ interests and ministerial responsibility.
It took six questions to get there but finally we got Senator Minchin interested and wound up. What did we get? We got: ‘Let’s slur everybody else because we cannot defend our own standards.’ That is fine; I am happy to debate that, but what we had is: ‘The only defence we have got against the failure of our government to have standards is to say, “Other people do it too.”’ That is the only defence he had. Earlier Senator Minchin gave a very spirited defence of his factional mate Senator Santoro. They have been close for a long time. The Prime Minister has been close to the senator for a long time. Why? Because they keep beating up on the small ‘l’ liberals, the wets, inside the party. Their factional loyalties saw Senator Santoro promoted to the ministry, and no-one claimed he was promoted on merit. No-one on that side of the chamber said it was based on merit.
Putting that to one side, we have the leader in the Senate, Senator Minchin, defending his mate—a very spirited defence—and trivialising completely the offences that Senator Santoro has confessed to. Senator Minchin dismisses it all as a minor problem of failing to declare his interests and says that we all ought to move on. He has been sacked as minister. There is no problem. There is nothing else that anyone ought to worry about. Senator Scullion said he has paid the highest price of all, when explaining that people who misrepresent their financial dealings who are social security recipients actually go to jail. I think some of them would think they paid a bit of a higher price when they got jailed. But the key questions are—
Government senators interjecting—
—Senators on the other side will want to raise all these other issues and that is fine, but the question is: why didn’t the Prime Minister become open and transparent with the public when he discovered Senator Santoro’s conflict of interest? Prime Minister Howard had the opportunity to issue a press release, mention it publicly or insist that Senator Santoro come clean. But in October, when he was told of Senator Santoro’s clear breach and clear conflict of interest, he said, ‘Just fix it up quietly, put in a return and don’t you worry about it.’ So two months later Senator Santoro updates his declaration but, interestingly, is it a full and frank declaration? No. Does it come clean on when the shares were bought? No. It deliberately set out to mislead about when the shares were purchased, and the Prime Minister was involved in that declaration. In fact, the Prime Minister’s office a couple of days later had to get him to fix it up because he confessed to share trading, which is another clear breach. So the PM’s office fixed that up as well.
But why didn’t the PM come clean when his mate came and said, ‘I’ve breached your guidelines’? He had the opportunity to make a public statement. He had the opportunity to ask Senator Santoro to come into the parliament. He had an opportunity to ask Senator Santoro to make it public but, no, he asked him to put in the fix, put in a declaration, which was not open and honest and transparent, a declaration which sought to mislead about when the shares were purchased submitted two months later. That is what John Howard says are the high standards of accountability for his ministers. What nonsense! And we have Senator Minchin trivialising what has occurred.
As with Senator Lightfoot’s previous dealings, I accept that mistakes can be made. Senator Lightfoot came in and said he had made a mistake on a previous occasion. I accepted the fact that it was an honest mistake on the basis of his declaration, but 72 failures to declare shares, 72 failures to remember that he was trading in shares, are clearly not inadvertent; clearly there was an attempt to set out to mislead. That has got to be taken seriously.
I am pleased to hear that Senator Santoro will come into this place eventually and make a personal explanation, but there is a lot of ground he is going to have to cover. The test for him is not only that of a minister; the test for him is as a senator: whether he is fit to hold the office of senator—that is, whether he has complied with the requirements of a senator or whether he has set out to deliberately mislead the Senate. It is a very serious charge and a charge that can be fairly laid against him at the moment. He has to prove why he should not be judged to have deliberately misled the Senate and then be assessed on that. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-03-20,"—What we are witnessing today is a classical example of the Australian Labor Party saying, ‘Do as we say, not as we do.’ The Leader of the Government in this place, who sought to lead the charge and assault on Senator Santoro and the government today, presided over—
—I’m not the Leader of the Government, actually.
—The Leader of the Opposition in this place presided over the state secretaryship of the Labor Party in Western Australia and knowingly used Labor Party funds to pay off the gambling debts of a Labor Attorney-General so they would not become public. That is the standard that Senator Chris Evans brings to this debate. And that was before he got into the Senate. It is something he has never apologised for. A question needs to be asked of Senator Evans: would he accept that standard for an Attorney-General in a Labor government? The fact that Senator Evans has never apologised for that is a message loud and clear to the Australian people that he would deliberately cover up the gambling debts of an Attorney-General, the first law officer of the state of Western Australia, so that the Labor Party would not fall into disrepute.
—It’s all in the public arena.
—It is all on the public record now, after the event. It shows the two-faced nature of this approach. Having earned his stripes in these sorts of deals, he was then moved into the Senate. I remember that, when I was sitting on the other side and Senator Evans was sitting on the government side, he was seen as one of the leading lights—one of the up-and-coming Labor lights. Where was he when we had discussions in this place about the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, failing to lodge his tax returns? There he was: defending Mr Keating. Where was Senator Evans when Senator Richardson failed to disclose a registrable instrument, being a director of a commercial radio station? There he was: defending Senator Richardson. They are the sorts of standards that Senator Evans brings into this debate. Mr Deputy President, if you want to come into these sorts of debates, you have to come with clean hands, and Senator Evans’s are as filthy as they get.
Mr Deputy President, I say this to you: to err is human. We all make mistakes. The test is not whether we make mistakes; the test is how we deal with those mistakes when we are confronted by them. Senator Santoro resigned. Senator Campbell resigned. From the Labor Party, Mr Kelvin Thomson resigned. The only person that has not resigned is Mr Kevin Rudd, who deliberately sought to sup with Brian Burke for his own personal political advantage. Make no mistake: the reason the Australian Labor Party has now continued with this assault is a desperate attempt to raise a smokescreen so the media will not continue to ask what Mr Rudd was doing at breakfast, lunch and dinner with Mr Brian Burke. The excuses Mr Rudd has come up with to date simply do not wash. They are not honest. I withdraw that. They are not believable. The reason they are not believable is that the email trail has now come out, and it has exposed the excuses of Mr Rudd as being absolutely implausible.
If Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, is to be responsible for an improper share disclosure by Senator Santoro, possibly those opposite could tell us the responsibility of Morris Iemma for his ministers’ activities, which I will not go into in detail. What about Premier Carpenter, in Western Australia? What about Premier Lennon, in Tasmania, whose minister is currently facing criminal charges? Let there be no doubt that the Labor Party do not come into this debate with clean hands, nor would they apply the standards they profess on their own state Labor premiers, which shows once again how shallow, how hollow, they are. All they do is continue the lie of that paragon of virtue, Senator Richardson. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I too rise to take note of answers given by Senator Minchin during question time today. We all know that the Prime Minister wants to draw a line under events surrounding Senator Santoro and his lack of compliance with both the Senate rules and the ministerial code of conduct. Of course he wants to draw a line under these events. The Prime Minister himself said that they are embarrassing. He said himself that he is angry. Of course he does not want the scrutiny that we are obliged to apply to his behaviour along with that of the former Minister for Ageing. Of course he does not want us to look at what has occurred but, unfortunately, that is what we are obliged to do.
It is important, in these circumstances, to look at the time line of events leading up to 3 pm last Friday. The declaration on 6 September by the former Minister for Ageing stated that there were no shareholdings held by that minister. It would seem that at that point the Prime Minister and his office did not take the opportunity to ask any questions. They clearly did not use the opportunity to look at that declaration. On 27 January 2006 Senator Santoro was sworn as a minister of the Crown. At that time he had a responsibility for arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions. According to what he has said to the media, he owned a package of shares in CBio, a company which is investigating pharmaceuticals in the use of arthritis. The ministerial code of conduct said:
Ministers are required to divest themselves, or relinquish control, of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.
At around the same time, when he became a minister, the minister would have had to declare his financial interests on the Prime Minister’s register of interests for ministers. He said that he overlooked the CBio shares when sorting out his listed portfolio to comply with ministerial requirements, so the shares were not declared to the Prime Minister at that time. We also know that he says that he has divested himself of other packages of shares that he thought did conflict with his ministerial responsibilities. The question that has to be asked is whether he advised the Prime Minister at that time of the divestments that he made of packages of shares which he has acknowledged were in conflict with his ministerial responsibilities.
We also know that, in August 2006, CBio announced that its government supported study had delivered a significant new anti-inflammatory compound which could provide new hope for arthritis sufferers. At that time, there was a range of media commentary about the success of CBio. It is unbelievable in the extreme that the former minister did not twig to his ownership of CBio shares at that time. These successes were very widely reported. They were reported in the mainstream media, and they were reported in the medical journal Lancet. As we know, Senator Santoro had responsibility for arthritis. He would have received, through his ministerial office, relevant clippings. If he read the clippings saying that CBio had been enormously successful, surely at that point he would have twigged to the fact that he had, in his ‘bottom drawer’—to use his own words—a set of shares.
More important is the role of the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime Minister not ensure that the register was correct in October 2006 when the minister said he owned the shares? It is inconceivable that he did not ask the minister if he had any other shareholdings. Why did the Prime Minister cover up and not immediately require—at that point, in October 2006—that the register be changed? (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-03-20,"—The central allegation of the Labor opposition today in the Senate is what we just heard in the concluding remarks of Senator McLucas—that is, the Prime Minister covered up Senator Santoro’s failure to disclose his share trading activities. This allegation is absolutely unproven. There is not one whit of evidence to support this scurrilous allegation by the Labor opposition against the Prime Minister. On the contrary, the Prime Minister made clear to my colleague Senator Santoro his obligations both as a minister and as a senator. With regard to CBio, the Prime Minister required the disposal of those shares immediately he became aware of the situation. The Prime Minister also ensured the correction of the declaration when he became aware that the declaration was not accurate. When the Prime Minister became aware of further matters regarding Senator Santoro, he required Senator Santoro’s resignation. So this allegation against the Prime Minister is absolutely ludicrous.
The fact is that Prime Minister John Howard is the first Australian Prime Minister to establish a public ministerial code. It did not exist prior to the election of the Howard coalition government. It was this Prime Minister who introduced that code and, in the context of this particular situation, has ensured compliance with that code. In a letter to Senator Santoro on 27 January 2006, the Prime Minister set out in a very explicit and detailed manner Senator Santoro’s obligations as a minister. The same letter also outlined Senator Santoro’s obligations as a senator. There was also correspondence from the Prime Minister and discussions between the Prime Minister’s former chief of staff and the minister and his chief of staff in which the minister’s obligations to both the Senate and the Prime Minister were made very clear. It has obviously been found that Senator Santoro did not comply with those obligations, and he has paid the ultimate price as a direct consequence. He has been forced to resign as a minister. Senator Santoro will be making his own comments to the Senate later today in the adjournment debate. We should perhaps wait to hear what Senator Santoro has to say in that regard.
Earlier, in question time today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin, detailed a number of state Labor government ministers around this country who have been sacked as a result of their nefarious activities. I say ‘state Labor governments’—not just one state Labor government but several: in Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. Do we see the Labor premiers of those states accepting responsibility for the behaviour of those ministers? No. The ministers have been sacked, and that has essentially been the end of the matter. This allegation against the Prime Minister simply does not stand up to scrutiny.
Senator Santoro has acknowledged that he was in breach of the rules of the Senate, and he has resigned. The Prime Minister responded in the strongest possible terms, expressing his anger and disappointment regarding this issue, and the mistakes have been dealt with. As Minister Abetz said a few moments ago, Senator Santoro resigned; Senator Ian Campbell resigned in the circumstances with which he was faced; even Labor’s shadow Attorney-General, Mr Kelvin Thomson, resigned over the letter of reference which he wrote for an acknowledged criminal. But of course, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, has not resigned, despite his association with a nefarious convicted criminal, Mr Burke, the former Premier of Western Australia. Mr Rudd had three quite explicit meetings with Mr Burke during which no doubt Mr Rudd was seeking Mr Burke’s acquiescence and support in moving into the leadership of the Labor Party. Mr Rudd has refused to resign as a result of that very clear association.
The allegations made against the Prime Minister with regard to this issue are hollow and quite unsubstantiated. They do not stand up to any test. They contrast markedly with the Labor Party’s attitude to their own. They do not come to this debate with clean hands in any sense, as Minister Abetz said. The issue simply does not stand up to scrutiny, and the charges are unproven. (Time expired)

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I am really disturbed at the way the government responds to the legitimate questions of the opposition in relation to the behaviour of a minister of the Crown, clearly and flagrantly in breach of the Prime Minister’s code of conduct. I know that the public hate these sorts of matters, but they do expect the opposition to pursue the government in relation to these sorts of matters in an appropriate way—and that is what the opposition has been doing today.
But what have we seen in defence from Senator Abetz and Senator Chapman? They have been dipping into the mud bucket and trying to throw the mud at whomever they think it might stick to. They have been trying to raise the hoary old chestnuts about Kevin Rudd—matters that he himself revealed months ago, which the government only recently decided to dredge up because it thought that there was a political advantage. The fact of the matter is that the public do not like this sort of behaviour from the government. We can see that the reaction of the public to this sort of behaviour has been to mark down the Prime Minister.
What have we asked in relation to the Prime Minister’s actions? We asked why, when he first became aware of Senator Santoro’s flagrant breach of his prime ministerial code of conduct, he did not make it public and indicate that he had required certain action, and, indeed, why he did not dismiss Senator Santoro then. He dismissed former Senator Jim Short from his portfolio because he had ANZ shares—shares that somehow impacted on his portfolio—and now the Prime Minister has the temerity to come out and say, ‘Maybe I should not have even done that.’ The only credible actions that the Prime Minister has ever taken were the dismissals of Jim Short and Brian Gibson from their portfolios because they breached the code. Subsequent to that, it was almost impossible to find a reason to dismiss a minister under the Prime Minister’s ministerial code of conduct.
In this case, when the truth finally came out, there was no choice—and all of this against the background of the government’s attempt to besmirch the name of the Leader of the Opposition for base political purposes. With the claims of occurrences in other states, the government has effectively been saying, ‘Because there are problems elsewhere, you have no right as an opposition to raise matters here in this parliament.’ I can assure the government and the public that the opposition will be raising matters, particularly where ministers breach the government’s own code of conduct—a code which, as I understand it, existed in the cabinet minutes under a Labor government and was observed. After trumpeting the code of conduct and trumpeting that there would be a new standard of government, this government has ignored that code for the best part of a decade after finding it inconvenient to have to enforce it against its own ministers.
In relation to Senator Santoro’s actions in particular areas in which there may have been a conflict of interest when he was a minister, I found it amazing that, as an aside during a press conference, the Prime Minister effectively said to the then yet-to-be-sworn new junior minister, Mr Pyne, that he was giving him the charter of investigating the case. Talk about policy on the run by the Prime Minister! And now we hear from Senator Minchin that, in fact, an investigation was underway. What does that mean? Does it mean that the Prime Minister was making it up as he went along; that he had no idea what was going on; that he was trying to get a glib answer to deal with a question from, I might say, my namesake on The 7.30 Report? Is that all the Prime Minister was doing? Why would you as the Prime Minister make a decision such as that on the run? In fact, why didn’t the Prime Minister make a decision earlier to order an independent investigation into all of the actions of Senator Santoro so that we could all be sure that a conflict of interest was not motivating decisions that this minister made when in office? It is, frankly, an unbelievable proposition to think that the government has not considered this. The public expects that there will be proper activity by this government in relation to the ex-minister’s answers so that we can all be sure that the buck can stop— (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The reaffirmation of the importance of maintaining the integrity and intent of the Registry of Senators’ Interests.
I move this urgency motion today because it is an important matter that the Senate should debate. It is important that we get a clear statement from the Senate that reaffirms the importance of maintaining the integrity and intent of the Register of Senators’ Interests. I genuinely hope that we get a unanimous vote on this resolution so as to reassure the public that we still uphold this important measure, which acts as part of the checks and balances in our democracy.
The Register of Senators’ Interests is a register that records the financial interests of senators. It details their ownership of assets, shares and properties, and seeks to provide a transparent system by which members of the public and the media can examine the interests held by senators and shine a light, if you like, on whether a senator’s actions, voting and behaviour are appropriate and whether or not there is any inappropriate linkage between their assets and interests and their behaviour. It is one of the checks and balances that has been brought into most democratic countries. Just as we have disclosure of donations, we have disclosure of members’ and senators’ interests.
This particular Senate provision did not come in until 1994. The House of Representatives introduced a members’ register of interests in 1983 on the coming to power of the Labor government. But the Senate resisted having a register of senators’ interests until 1994. Since that time we have had cross-party support for that register. We have a committee that administers it, and it has generally been accepted as a positive development. Obviously, for senators, the public interest should be uppermost in mind when they perform their responsibilities. That can obviously only occur when they abide by high standards of probity and integrity. The register of senators’ interests helps build public confidence in the political process. But fundamentally it relies on the honesty of senators. You fill in your form; you make a declaration as to your interests. The whole system is based on that honest declaration. We all have a responsibility to provide the information required under the rules of the Senate. As I say, these declarations are sought and administered for very good reasons that have been accepted across party lines in the Senate since 1994.
There are always some issues surrounding these measures and generally we work through those in a collaborative way. But there have been in recent times a couple of instances where there has been concern about whether declarations have been accurate. There was the case of Senator Lightfoot last year, where concern was raised about whether or not he had accurately declared his shareholdings. Senator Lightfoot made a statement to the Senate following those issues being raised, apologised and corrected the record. I and other senators accepted his explanation as reasonable on the basis that he said that he had made an inadvertent error in filing his declaration. He apologised and corrected the record. People saw that as a reasonable response given the admission from the senator that an error had been made.
The events of the last few days raise much more serious concerns about whether or not the registry is working in the way that it is intended and whether the integrity and the intent of the registry are being honoured. We have all accepted the importance of that. However, on Senator Santoro’s own evidence he has not met the requirements of the Senate in terms of keeping that register up to date. Clearly, by his letter last week—in which he detailed the share trades that he had made that had not been declared in the register—he has admitted to filing returns to the register that were not correct. We now have evidence of at least 72 share trades over a 19-month period from September 2005. Senator Santoro had not made a declaration of some of his interests but chose to be selective in the interests he declared. So, clearly, Senator Santoro has not complied with the requirements of the Senate.
I understand that tonight Senator Santoro will provide an explanation as to why that failure occurred. The Prime Minister has expressed the view that he is very angry with Senator Santoro for his failure to meet his obligations, and a number of senior coalition ministers have expressed the view that they cannot understand why such a blatant disregard for the rules has been perpetrated by Senator Santoro.
As I said, with Senator Lightfoot’s incident, clearly a defence of inadvertent omission was plausible. Such a defence in this case is clearly not plausible. Senator Santoro was trading, was buying and selling shares. He has not attempted to use the defence that the broker was doing so on his behalf; he has conceded that he was engaged. Of course, the thing that counts most against Senator Santoro is that he has made declarations of some shares and not others. He has been selective about what he has declared. We do not yet know—and I would be interested to hear his explanation tonight—whether or not he made honest declarations before he became a minister. Clearly, on looking at his declarations, he alleged he did not own more than a couple of shares prior to becoming a minister. But, as I say, that will be for Senator Santoro to explain to the Senate. Quite frankly, up until now, his explanation has been woefully inadequate.
Senator Santoro has failed to address any of the key issues as to why he failed the fundamental requirement to declare his shares and why, when issued time and time again a reminder as to the need to make full declaration, he did not do so. Why, more importantly, when he signed his name to the declaration does he now admit those declarations were false? On at least three occasions he signed declarations which he now says were false. He declared some shares but not others and, for a long period, he declared that he had no shareholdings at all. If Senator Santoro’s recent declaration is to be believed, he has systematically set out to mislead the Senate and the Australian public about the extent of his shareholdings. Quite frankly, that is a matter that this Senate ought to take very seriously.
I am prepared to wait for final judgement on Senator Santoro’s explanation, but clearly the Prime Minister and other senior ministers in the government are not. The Prime Minister has found that Senator Santoro breached the ministerial code of conduct and has accepted his resignation. But there are other tests for the Senate. While the Prime Minister gets to judge whether or not Senator Santoro has met his obligations under the ministerial code of conduct, the Senate gets to decide whether Senator Santoro has met his obligations to the Senate under the rules regarding the Register of Senators’ Interests. As I said, there is a very strong prima facie case that the Senate has been deliberately misled. The senator has admitted that his declarations were false.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am of course directing your attention to standing order 193(3). I understand that this is a difficult issue for senators. I understand that the conduct of a senator is properly under scrutiny, but the operation of standing order 193(3) does prohibit, as you know, Mr Deputy President, reflections of want of probity and so on against other members of the Senate. I would, through you, Mr Deputy President—and without in any way seeking to limit what Senator Evans might properly say on a matter properly being debated in this chamber—remind him that this is a matter which, as I understand it, is to be referred to the Privileges Committee on the instance of his side. I have read press reports to that effect; I assume that is right. I would ask you, Mr Deputy President, to caution Senator Evans, in whatever remarks he might make, to limit himself to the matters that are a matter of public record and not to speculate on dishonesty or improper motive, which is what standing order 193(3) specifically prohibits.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: firstly, as a matter of fact, as I understand it, there has been no request for a reference to the Privileges Committee made to the President. Certainly, the President has not reported that so that is not a consideration. Secondly, it is competent for us to debate the actions of Senator Santoro. I will abide by any rulings, Mr Deputy President, on motive, but clearly the evidence of Senator Santoro is to the effect that his trading activity was not properly declared. It is not a case I make; it is a case he makes.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: I take on board what Senator Evans said about there being no current reference to the Privileges Committee. Standing order 193(3) prohibits personal reflections against members of this chamber, as well as members of other houses. All I do in the circumstances is to ask you to caution Senator Evans to confine his remarks to matters which are acknowledged and on the public record. Standing order 193(3) does not give him licence—reference to the Privileges Committee or not—to reflect upon Senator Santoro or his motives or indeed his honesty.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order, in addition to Senator Brandis’s comments: I am going on my memory, but I think I heard Senator Evans accuse Senator Santoro of deliberately misleading the Senate. I think the term ‘deliberately misleading the Senate’ is what we are referring to rather than some of the other comments.
—That is right, Mr Deputy President.
—Senator Evans, I cannot recollect the wording myself, but if you have accused a person of deliberately misleading, you should withdraw that. I will deal with that first, Senator Evans.
—I cannot be precise, but I certainly do make the charge. If that is ruled out of order, Mr Deputy President, I will take your advice. It seems to me a particularly precious interpretation, given the contributions of coalition senators to the taking note debate, but this is a subject for your ruling. If you rule that ‘deliberately misleading’ is—
—It has been ruled on here before. You cannot say ‘deliberately misleading’, Senator Evans.
—I withdraw then.
—Senator Brandis, on the other matters that you have raised there is no point of order. I am sure that other speakers in this debate will be cautious in their approach to order before the chair.
—I understand the sensitivity and the seriousness of these matters, and I am trying to walk a line that does not prejudge Senator Santoro’s statement to the Senate. That is why I have not as yet sought to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee, but it may well be necessary. To be frank, Senator Santoro would have to have a pretty damn good story—certainly much better than the one he has advanced so far—for senators across the chamber not to consider that this matter ought to be referred to the Privileges Committee.
It is clear from Senator Santoro’s own evidence that the declarations he consistently filed in the Senate were not accurate—not once, not twice but on numerous occasions. The reminder sent to him—and to all other senators—from the Committee of Senators’ Interests to update his returns were ignored and share trading and shareholdings were not declared. We now know that at least 72 transactions were not declared to the Senate. So any defence based on inadvertence will look very thin, because you can forget one, you can forget two, but to forget 72 different trades is clearly not something that any reasonable person could accept as being an inadvertent omission.
The reason I moved this motion today is that I think this is an important matter for the Senate. These events challenge confidence in the register and people’s confidence in the ability of the Senate to properly maintain the Register of Senators’ Interests. As people know, there is a general disquiet in the community about whether or not the Prime Minister is able to properly maintain the Prime Minister’s code of conduct and ministers’ adherence to that. Clearly, that has not been the case on this occasion. Given the history of share trading impacts on previous ministers of the government, it beggars belief that such trading could have occurred with such contempt for the rules of the Senate and the Prime Minister’s code of conduct.
I am particularly concerned about the Prime Minister’s actions when he was confronted by Senator Santoro with the admission that he had bought shares in a company where a conflict of interest with his ministerial duties had arisen and that those shares had not been declared. The Prime Minister did not seek to have him correct those failings immediately and make a public declaration about them. What occurred was that the minister was allowed at his leisure, over a period of two months, to make a declaration that he had purchased the shares—not that he had the shares prior to that event but that he had purchased shares. The minister made a declaration which did not reveal the fact that he had held those shares prior to a recent purchase. So the Prime Minister was less than open, less than transparent, in the way that he allowed Senator Santoro to behave. That does go to the question of the standards applied by this government. It does go to public confidence in the system where the Prime Minister allowed an issue like this to be dealt with on the quiet, on the hush-hush, without any proper public accountability and allowed the senator to provide a statement that was far from transparent—one which did not identify the fact that the senator had held those shares for a long period of time and had failed to declare them.
On a cursory examination of the declaration made in December, one can note that the shares that he listed as having sold were shares that he previously had not admitted to buying. It does not take a genius to understand that, in making his declaration under the Prime Minister’s supervision, he was declaring that he had previously misled the Senate. That is how amateurish the whole thing is. The declaration lists shares as being sold that were never listed as having been bought, in addition to the key conflict of interest of the CBio share purchase. So there is a real undermining of confidence both in the Prime Minister’s code of conduct and in the Senate’s register of interests that this Senate ought to seek to address. We will address the issues of Senator Santoro following his explanation. I am a bit surprised that he did not bring himself into the chamber immediately.

Senator Ferguson interjecting—

—A senator is required to correct the record immediately. We have been sitting for a few hours. There has been no sign of him. I am told that he has promised to come in. We await that with interest. He will have to provide a very compelling case as to why we should not refer these matters to the Privileges Committee and why he should not be the subject of some censure from the Senate. But the bottom line in all of this, of course, is that that is a decision for the government. Senator Santoro and his coalition colleagues will get to vote on whether any action is taken against Senator Santoro. That is one of the ironies of the government’s control of the Senate—the government will be held to account as to what standards it will apply to its own. You will not be able to escape being held to account for the standards that this government regards as acceptable, because whatever a privileges inquiry finds, the Senate will have to decide what punishment or censure it takes— (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-03-20,"—Those who are listening to this broadcast today cannot see what I can see; the four members of the government sitting in the chamber can. What they can see is that on this matter of urgency the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is being supported by only two Labor senators. This is not a matter of urgency; this is a cheap political stunt. If those opposite were serious about this matter then those benches opposite would be filled. One of those Labor senators has to be here because they are the whip. This is a cheap political stunt. I will wager whatever amount of money Senator Evans wants to put on it that this matter will be referred by the Labor Party to the Privileges Committee. The only reason that has not been done is that they know, and I know, that had they done so this morning we would not be debating this matter this afternoon. It is a cheap political stunt.
—Santoro doesn’t come cheap.
 (Senator Moore)—Order! Senator Carr.
—If my high-pitched friend here keeps quiet then I might get the rest of my speech in. This is a cheap political stunt. The arbiter of the matters contained in this motion are the very group that will ultimately judge the outcome of the senator in question. Senator Evans knows, and I know—and even the chattering Senator Carr knows—that these matters will be referred to the Privileges Committee. In the normal course of events that committee, of which I am deputy chair, will discuss this matter and take into account the very matters that Senator Evans has referred to in the motion. They are the arbiter of these matters and they will refer the matter back to the Senate, which is the final arbiter.
What Senator Evans has attempted to do today is to pre-empt the role of the Privileges Committee, which is chaired by his own colleague. Senator Evans, you should read your speech. If you were hoping to become a household name after this speech today then I am afraid, my friend, that you will be bitterly disappointed. You were not a household name before that speech today and you most certainly will not be after. If you read Senator Evans’s speech, you see that he said he was prepared to wait for final judgment but the PM was not. So what Senator Evans was telling the Senate was that he was waiting for final judgment—presumably from the Privileges Committee—before anything was done. What has actually happened is that the PM has moved to address the very things that you have referred to in this motion to maintain the integrity of this chamber and the very matters you are referring to.
Let us cut to the chase on this. This is a political stunt that would not have been possible had there been a reference to the Privileges Committee. This is about the opposition having a cheap shot at the Prime Minister for purely political purposes. Quite frankly, Senator Evans, your duplicity would not fool anyone undertaking—
—Senator, I would ask you to reconsider the term ‘duplicity’.
—More’s the pity if I have to withdraw that, but I will. Your stunt today would not pass the kitchen table test, would not pass the pub test and would not pass the barbecue test because the Australian public will see straight through your cheap stunt. You have had two goes at it. You have had the motion to take note of answers and you have had this urgency motion. You have repeated yourself. You made no sense in your first speech and you made even less sense in your last speech.
Senator Evans, you know that this should have gone to the Privileges Committee. You know full well that your colleagues on both sides of the political fence treat that Privileges Committee very seriously. You know full well—and if you do not, you should—that there has never been a matter, according to my understanding, come out of that Privileges Committee where there has not been unanimous agreement of the committee. That committee is sitting in judgment on its colleagues; the very judgment you were talking about in your speech. You should hang your head in shame that you have totally bastardised the process of this Senate today by this cheap political stunt. You have bastardised the process that has stood the test of time. It is a process that has required our colleagues to sit in judgment on each other with those very matters that you have referred to as the absolute primary matters for their consideration. For you to debase the process the way you have today is to your eternal shame. You have been shown up as engaging in a cheap political stunt.
I turn now to your comments in relation to the Prime Minister in the earlier debate. The pub test should make it quite clear to you that the general community has expectations that have been met by the Prime Minister. I will read again the Prime Minister’s comments from The 7.30 Report. Just for interest’s sake, I notice that there is no-one else from the Labor Party in the chamber seven minutes into this speech. I will go through again what the Prime Minister said. He said:
As a Senator, he has to disclose these transactions. I reminded him of that obligation when I appointed him as a minister and I wrote to him reminding him of his disclosure obligations. He broke those obligations. I didn’t know of that breach until a few days ago when he owned up, and that is why he’s out.
In relation to a question from Kerry O’Brien, ‘But doesn’t that go to the heart of the probity of your government, that one of your ministers appears to have lied to you about something really quite serious?’ the Prime Minister replied, ‘That would go to the heart of the probity of the government if I, having found out about this a couple of days ago, had done nothing about it. The fact that he went quickly for a clear breach of simple rules that every senator or member of his or her own volition should observe is an indication I do take the probity of my government very seriously, and I resent suggestions to the contrary.’
—You may well resent it, but—
—Are you seriously suggesting that the Prime Minister should be acting on matters that he has no knowledge of? The stupidity of your argument is that, even if the Prime Minister had gone through the registers of interests—for every single one of us, in both the Senate and the other place—they would not have shown up these matters that are before us today, because they were not in the Register of Senators’ Interests and they were not matters of which he had knowledge. How could he possibly have acted as you have told him he should, if he had no knowledge of these matters?
—He had knowledge from October.
—It has not passed the public test on reasonableness.
—He knew in October!
—I hope tonight, when you are reflecting on today—and you can interrupt me as much as like—that you realise what you have done to the process of the Privileges Committee, to a process that has stood the test of time. Senator Evans, you have effectively single-handedly destroyed that process.
 (Senator Moore)—Senator, I remind you to make your remarks through the chair.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Register of Senators’ Interests</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-20,"—What an extraordinary debate this is. I think it is fair to say the standards of probity and accountability in the last 11 years of this government have been seriously undermined. We have had electoral laws that have disenfranchised people and we have had the regime for disclosure of political donations watered down. So many changes in this place have sent a very strong message to people like Senator Santoro that it does not matter. It no longer matters: honesty in government, honesty in politics and honesty in political activity have now taken a back seat. I remember that the Prime Minister, when he came up with the ministerial code of conduct, applauded himself on how wonderful this was going to be and said that there would be no probity issues with his ministers. And the ministers quickly fell at that time. I remember Senator Short, Senator Wood and Senator Gibson, who were sacked in very quick succession. And others went as well. In the lower house there were Sharp and Jull, and I think here too we had Senators Cobb and, at one stage, Crichton-Browne. So there is a long history of ignoring standards, putting them in place and finding that there are too many people who need to be sacked as a result of them, so you need to drop some of those requirements. We are very used to it.
So it is little wonder, I think, that Senator Santoro has not taken the ministerial code of conduct seriously. He is one of the ‘born to rule’ amongst us, who think that having shares is a right and proper thing that everybody should do, otherwise you are a bit of a mug. And that thinking has infiltrated all of the activities of people in this place who now defend Senator Santoro’s appalling behaviour.
I thought it was extraordinary today. We have Senator Minchin saying that the Prime Minister acted honourably on this and cannot be expected to know or act on ministers’ affairs. We have heard it again this afternoon. That is precisely why a ministerial code of conduct, which is up to the Prime Minister to administer, will not work. What we need to do is move to a situation where there is a committee of the parliament which determines both the ministerial code of conduct and the code of conduct for senators and members. That should be set up by a joint committee. It should develop a comprehensive code for ministers and members of parliament, as I said, including rules about avoiding conflicts of interest and strong penalties for transgressions.
—It does! That’s what it says!
—But you ignored it!
—But the problem is, we keep hearing Senator Brandis saying it is already there; there is no problem. Well, there is a problem, and there is a problem because Senator Minchin said, and I will be precise—
—Senators, I am having trouble hearing Senator Allison.
—Senator Abetz said this afternoon: ‘The test is not whether we make mistakes; it’s how we deal with it.’ In other words, if I am a bank robber and I go along and I rob the bank and threaten the employees and whatever else, and then when I am found I hand over the money that I got from the bank to charity and I apologise, then it is okay. So it is only a question of being caught and how well you handle being caught that is an issue here for the government.
We would rather see things done rather differently. We would rather that this parliament was the place that determined such things—not the Prime Minister, not Senator Brandis, not individuals within the Liberal Party. It is a parliamentary matter, and I remind senators that one resolution about senators’ interests says:
Any senator who:

That is the whole point here. It is not up to the Prime Minister to say, ‘Well, we’ll let him off this time because he really is a nice guy and he didn’t mean to do it, and in fact we’ll take his ministerial position away from him.’ And that will be seen to be—what was the phrase being used over and over again? A high price to be paid. So he has already paid the high price! Judge and jury over there have determined that Senator Santoro is a bit guilty— (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-03-20,"—This urgency motion, in truth, deals with the lack of probity under the Howard government and, in particular, the failure of the former Minister for Ageing, the honourable Senator Santo Santoro, to comply with the requirements of the Register of Senators’ Interests. The actions of the honourable Senator Santoro bring to light a wider and worrying trend under this government. It is a trend that we senators in the chamber know only too well, it being the reduction in avenues for scrutiny and accountability.
From the moment the government took control of the Senate, from 1 July 2005, the Howard government drew the curtains, turned off the lights and threw away the keys on scrutiny. Why? It was so that it could begin to govern true to its form: away from the watchful eyes of the opposition, the media and interested members of the public. That was the true intent. In terms of public policy, the manifestation of this cloak of secrecy is best exemplified by extreme industrial relations. Witness how the government refused to provide statistical analysis of the AWAs. This government wants to claim how great AWAs are, how much better off workers are under them. Yet it will not even reveal the statistics to back this up.
We have all heard of the expression ‘lies, damned lies and statistics’, stemming from the common observation that, with sufficient manipulation, statistics can be made to say anything. What this government does do is not provide transparency. It keeps its secret records. I will tell you what it says. This government sends in its expert spin doctors to spin what it needs to, whatever positive message—
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Moore)—Would senators stop shouting across the chamber!
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. This is an opposition motion. The terms of the opposition motion are:
The reaffirmation of the importance of maintaining the integrity and intent of the Registry of Senators’ Interests.
It is quite specifically directed to the topic of the Registry of Senators’ Interests. Can I ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to direct Senator Ludwig to the topic of the opposition’s own motion.
—Senator Brandis, I hear your point of order. I believe that Senator Ludwig is making a case in terms of his argument. I will let Senator Ludwig continue with the process. I do not accept your point of order.
—I have 10 minutes, and I hope you will stay to listen to all of it, Senator Brandis. Meanwhile, once the government has sent in its spin doctors to spin a message—I see Senator Brandis is now leaving the chamber—

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—I see that you do not want to hear my points, Senator Brandis. That is the government: it turns its back on the Senate. That is what the government members are very good at: taking a point of order, turning their backs and running out of the chamber. That is what government members do very well because they do not want to hear and they do not want to hold the government to account.
Meanwhile, the actions of the honourable Senator Santoro demonstrate the decline under this government of accountability and probity. It is a small example, although, when you listen to Senator Santoro, you hear that it started out as a small one and then grew like Pinocchio’s nose. But it is an example of where this government is failing on accountability and probity issues. It is but one, and it will be interesting to find out how many more will be dragged out.
There are three key things that hold governments to account in Australia and keep them from straying down the path of maladministration and misappropriation. The first is the government’s own conscience and sense of responsibility. We all know that that flew out the window back in 1997 when the Prime Minister realised just how few of his Liberal and National Party colleagues could actually pass the ministerial code of conduct. So he abandoned it soon after.
When you look at the recent departures of former Minister Ian Campbell and the honourable Senator Santoro, you realise that, in the eyes of this Prime Minister, the sin of these two men was not one of a lapse in good character or judgement. I add that, for the honourable Senator Santoro, it in fact looks like quite a long lapse. No, the sin of these two men was that they stood in the way of the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, and his hold on power. The unwritten ministerial code of conduct that operates in the year 2007 has only a single sentence: do not get in the way of Mr John Howard and his desire to win the next election.
Given that we cannot rely on the conscience and ethics of those on the government benches—the Prime Minister, in particular—to keep themselves in check, let me turn to the next line of defence. The second line of defence is the Australian parliament. That includes the committees, including the Senate Standing Committee of Senators’ Interests. All of those matters are wrapped up in how the Australian parliament and, in particular, this chamber operate effectively both to meet accountability and probity standards and to hold the government to account.
So what happened? The Liberal and National parties, on gaining control, could not wait to sink their teeth into how they were going to control. In a short space of time this government passed extreme laws, took complete control of the Senate committee system and altered it, instructed public servants not to answer difficult questions on AWB at estimates hearings, stopped the Senate committees looking into matters of the AWB and dramatically cut the length of inquiries into government legislation.
That is the record that this government stands on. When it talks here about accountability and probity, this is the record that this government says it should be exemplified for—wrong, wrong and wrong. The actions of the honourable Senator Santoro are just the latest example of how little regard the Liberal and the National parties have for this chamber, this great institution of ours. The honourable Senator Santoro has shown blatant disregard for the rules and procedures that have long been in place here—not just once, but 72 times. And that is just what he has admitted to at last count. We hope to hear more tonight.
It reminds me of the television show Get Smart, where the bumbling Maxwell Smart cannot help but always exaggerate his hand. In this case, the honourable Senator Santoro first fronted the media claiming that it was only one oversight and that he had been proactive in the resolution of that. When caught out, the honourable Senator Santoro fronted the media for a second time, this time saying—would you believe it?—that there were 50 or 60 oversights. But now we know there were 72, at least to date. The only difference is that, while the Chief was keenly aware of and accommodating of his agent’s clumsiness, Mr John Howard expects us to believe that the Prime Minister wears no responsibility for the indiscretions of his own people—his own agent 86. If that is how it is then the Prime Minister really has lost control of his own show.
There is a very simple reason why the honourable. Senator Santoro has disregarded both the ministerial code of conduct and the standing orders of the Senate—that is, he did not expect them to be enforced, quite frankly. That is the worrying element of this whole episode—that he expected neither the code of conduct by the PM nor the senators’ rules by this government’s majority to be enforced. That is the concerning part.
I draw the Senate’s attention to what senior Liberal Party sources said in the media today about the behaviour of the honourable Senator Santoro: ‘He’s actually very secretive.’ I think we would all agree with that. But it is not just the honourable Senator Santoro that is secretive. That is a trait of this entire government. One of the other acts passed after it assumed control of the Senate was a relaxation of the political donations disclosure rules. This government raised the threshold from $1,500 to $10,000 so that fewer donations would need to be reported.
Notwithstanding this, one more check on the growing arrogance and lack of accountability—that is what this government has been removing—is the votes in the ballot box. They in turn are assisted by the media and the opposition in shedding light on this government’s lack of probity. This government has commenced its attack of smear and innuendo only to find its own house not in order. The message is simple: this government needs to clean up its act, get its house in order and join Labor in the debate about the future of this great country. Failure to do so will risk damage not just to its own standing but to that of this fine institution, the Commonwealth parliament. We should stop it and get on with debate about policy and substantive matters. That is what the debate in this house should be on. Those are the issues that need to be debated. But bear in mind that this government has not been doing that. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2007-03-20,"—I read with interest the terms of this urgency motion. I wonder where Senator Ludwig has been, because, in all of the remarks that he made in those 10 minutes, scarcely did he refer to maintaining the integrity of the Register of Senators’ Interests. For the enlightenment of those senators who are present in the chamber—apart from one of the officials at the table, I think I was probably the only senator in the chamber who was here when the register of interests was brought into this chamber—it was brought in in the last years of the Keating government.
A Labor Party motion to introduce a register of interests into this place had been on the books for almost 10 years. Do you think they did it during those 10 years? Not on your nelly. They never bothered to bring that motion forward. After they had made a register of interests for the House of Representatives, the motion lay on the Notice Paper in this place for 10 years. In the dying days of the Keating government, in order to do some grubby deal with the minor parties, they decided to bring it in under pressure from the minor parties. These people did not want a register of interests in this place. For 10 years they left it sitting on the Notice Paper without bringing it in.
Senators opposite talk about transparency. What transparency did we have in this place in the time of the last Labor government? We went to the 1996 election with a $96 billion debt and a $10 billion deficit that nobody knew about because there was no Charter of Budget Honesty and no ministerial code of conduct. Their good friend Senator Richardson and a number of others could get up to their pranks in this place without any scrutiny because at that time there was no register of interests, no ministerial code of conduct and no Charter of Budget Honesty. And you, Senator Ludwig, have the hide to come in here and talk about transparency.
The ministerial code of conduct works. That is why Senator Santoro was forced to resign. The Register of Senators’ Interests works.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—We will now have a situation where, as we heard from Senator Evans, this matter—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, there is a lot of talk over on the other side, and I think we listened to Senator Ludwig in near silence.
 (Senator Moore)—There is. Senators on my left, I wish to listen to Senator Ferguson.
—The integrity of the Register of Senators’ Interests is maintained because if someone fails to comply with the requirements of the Senate it is referred to the Privileges Committee.
—The Prime Minister tried to cover it up.
—Senator Hutchins, if you want to get on the speaking list, I suggest you get into the whip’s office and try and get on there.
—You know that those comments should be through me, Senator Ferguson.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I would attempt to address my remarks through you, but I have a lot of noise coming from the other side—
—I understand.
—which makes it rather hard to concentrate, as you know. The events of the past few days have proved that each of those safeguards that have been put in in this place actually works. Senator Santoro has resigned because he did not comply with the ministerial code of conduct. This matter is going to be sent to the Privileges Committee. The people opposite us suggest that it has not been complied with and so it will go to the Privileges Committee and then come back to this chamber to be adjudicated on, which is the intention of how it should work.
But no-one on that side has yet told me why, if the register of interests is so important, they let it lie on the Notice Paper for 10 years before they introduced it into this chamber—on the Notice Paper since 1983. In 1994, I think it had something to do with the Keating piggery and the Marshall Islands affair of Senator Richardson, which you are all quite proud of. They refused to introduce a ministerial code of conduct and they refused to introduce a charter of budget honesty.
The people on that side earlier today talked about this critical accountability mechanism. I would like to repeat what I said back in 1994 in relation to this Register of Senators’ Interests: it tells you everything and it tells you nothing. I still remember—and some of you may remember—that a couple of years ago the Labor senators opposite came in here virtually salivating at the fact that they were going to pin Senator Minchin on a conflict of interest. In his register of interests he had BHP shares and, as minister for finance, he had a conflict of interest owning them. They were salivating; you and your colleagues were salivating. The question was asked and Senator Minchin said, ‘Yes, I do. It is true. I do have one share in BHP. It was given to me the day I was born by my grandfather, and I refuse to sell it.’ One share at that stage was worth $14. As I said to you, the Register of Senators’ Interests does not tell you whether you have a million dollars worth of BHP shares or one share, or how much it is worth or how much it is geared. It tells you absolutely nothing, and so if they were going to establish a register of interests it ought to be a register that means something.
We had a situation back in 1994 at the time of Mr Keating’s piggery interests. I looked at a speech made by one of my colleagues at the time on 17 March 1994 when he talks about the seriousness of whether Mr Keating obtained a loan from the Commonwealth Bank when he was Treasurer or Prime Minister. He said:
It would be interesting to know whether the Prime Minister discloses his interests in the Commonwealth Bank or his loan dealings with the Commonwealth Bank when he makes decisions at the cabinet table on the Commonwealth Bank ... in the past wholly owned ... now a major shareholder.
We had a situation where there was no ministerial code of conduct. There was a register of senators’ interests, and the Prime Minister had a commercial interest in a piggery which was kept in the dark and where he made a considerable amount of money—much more than I am sure Senator Santoro has ever made out of his shares—and yet he refused to divulge it, refused to tell us. I can tell you: if Senator Santoro had every one of those shares on the register you still would not know whether he had one share in each of those companies or 5,000 shares. It does not tell you a thing. I support the motion before the chair; no-one could not support the motion before the chair. But unfortunately those opposite have gone on all sorts of tangents talking about everything except the integrity of the Register of Senators’ Interests— (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-03-20,"—The problem with ministers and members generally being involved in commercial matters while they are elected members of parliament representing the voters and the people and their wider interests is that inevitably there are points of conflict. That is why I, in this Senate on behalf of the Australian Greens, have pursued for more than a decade now—

Senator Ferguson interjecting—

—I am sorry; the member opposite has gone quiet on that comment. The Greens have pursued the concept of ending that conflict of interest through having an opaque or blind trust so that, if ministers wish to hold shareholdings, their shares go into a blind trust, which is then traded by an independent authority but without the knowledge of the minister. If the former minister opposite says you cannot achieve that, then the alternative would be to divest yourself of those shares.
We come into this parliament in a place of obligation to be open and fair to the electorate. We get highly paid. Average senators are on a base rate of $118,000 a year plus the electoral allowance and all the other allowances that come with it to be commensurate with the work that we do. It is an affront to probity and democracy that ministers in particular continue to trade on the share market with all the implied biases that that brings to mind while they hold the high office of minister and authority under the Crown.
I think the Prime Minister should have put an end to this a long while ago. The Prime Minister should have acted to adopt the Greens’ recommendation. It has been adopted in other parliaments. The legislative option is clearly available. It is the right thing to do, but I suspect that, because Prime Minister Howard holds the market so high in his esteem, he is unable to see the risks that inevitably are involved with continuing to allow ministers and members to trade on the Stock Exchange. It should be stopped. It would be better for all ministers involved it if it were stopped. If the Greens’ concept of an opaque or blind trust as is used overseas had been adopted 10 years ago we would not be in this position today. Senator Santoro would not be. A number of other ministers who have gone from this chamber and from the other place would still be safely here in the parliament and the cabinet.
It is time we looked much more rigorously and sincerely at the options that are available. In the near future, the Greens will introduce into the Senate legislation to require ministers to place any shareholdings they might have into an opaque trust that is administered at arm’s length and without the knowledge of that minister so that her or his work cannot be influenced by the profitability of shares being exchanged and traded on the Stock Exchange.
We will also introduce legislation to clamp down on lobbyists—to make sure that they are registered and that their activities are open and available to public scrutiny. We believe there is a lot to be done to improve the safety of parliamentarians who cannot work it out for themselves and to deliver a more honest and secure performance by ministers in particular to the electorates they represent—to the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Register of Senators’ Interests</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-03-20,"—I stand this afternoon to support this motion and to highlight the importance of maintaining the integrity and intent of the Register of Senators’ Interests. It is patently obvious that we should support such a motion. However, the Labor Party and those on the other side have handled this in a very high-handed manner. It is nothing short of political shenanigans that they have placed this motion before the Senate this afternoon. By doing so, and by highlighting the concerns in the way that they have—by throwing the mud in the manner that they have—they have hijacked their own motion. They have turned the heat on themselves.
They have turned the heat on their own colleagues in the various state governments around Australia because, by any means, it has been quite clearly demonstrated that the system that has been working here at the federal level is actually working well. The system was implemented by Prime Minister Howard, who introduced a ministerial code of conduct for the first time ever in Australian political history. The Charter of Budget Honesty, the system of ensuring accountability and full disclosure, has been supported, acted upon and instigated by the Howard government. Why do you think the Prime Minister is nicknamed ‘Honest John’ from time to time? I can tell you that it is because he is honest, which is important to the Australian people. They accept that and they know that.
The system has been and is working. Yes, Senator Santoro made a mistake. In his resignation statement, Senator Santoro said:
None of these investments involves either impropriety or a conflict of interest and there was never any dishonest intention on my part. Nevertheless I have neglected to properly report a number of investments to the Prime Minister and to the Senate. This is the reason for my announcement today.
The Prime Minister accepted that and said that Senator Santoro had failed to comply with his obligations as a senator and with his ministerial obligations of disclosure. so, on both counts, there is an acceptance that there was a mistake made and the price has been paid. Senator Santoro has paid the highest price possible: he has resigned his commission as a minister in the Howard government.
Senator Santoro, as everybody would acknowledge, got across his brief very well and very quickly. He was competent and professional, and he conducted his ministerial role to a very high standard. He was responsible, at least in part, for the $1.5 billion announcement made by the Prime Minister, on investing in Australia’s aged-care industry. There will be a legacy. People will look back and say thank you: ‘Thank you for your role. Thank you for your contribution. Thank you for your input and for that tremendous investment in Australia’s aged-care industry.’
With the Labor Party, it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. They have set benchmarks and key performance indicators that contrast with the various state Labor governments around Australia. They are waxing lyrical today over what has happened in the last few days, but they make no mention whatsoever of the very busy schedule of the various anticorruption commissions in the state governments around Australia. Those commissions are implementing their brief to seek out and to act upon corrupt officials in those state governments. Look at what has been going on in Queensland and New South Wales. Look at Western Australia, with the Brian Burke affair. What about Tasmania? Tasmania does not have an anticorruption commission; however the Deputy Premier, Brian Green, has resigned his commission and the DPP is now taking action against him in the courts. I will not speak about that, because it is before the courts.
The Labor Party, in doing what they have done today—throwing mud and allegations and getting involved in political shenanigans—have highlighted their own lack of standards in the various state governments around Australia. The best indicator of how Labor in office would handle public moneys, how they would be accountable to the Australian people, how they would support full disclosure and how they would be responsible for their actions and accountable for their decisions is how they do it elsewhere. What are their brothers and sisters doing in the various state governments around Australia? They are acting in a most irresponsible fashion; hence the very busy schedule of the anticorruption commissions in the various state governments.
I urge senators on the other side to exercise influence over their colleagues in the various states and to ensure that they are acting in an honest fashion. What has been proven once and for all today is that the system that was established under Prime Minister John Howard’s responsibility and control in this parliament is working. There is evidence of full disclosure and accountability. The minister has resigned. He has paid the highest price possible, and you can see exactly the result. (Time expired)

That business of the Senate order of the day No. 1, relating to the presentation of the report of the Economics Committee on the Qantas Sale (Keep Jetstar Australian) Amendment Bill 2007 be postponed till a later hour.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,22,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2007-03-20,"—As I was saying before question time, I strongly support the change to the Lifetime Health Cover scheme, whereby people who have retained private health insurance for over 10 years would no longer be subject to Lifetime Health Cover loading, even if they did not take out private health insurance before the age of 31. I also support the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, as I am aware that many Australian families would not be able to afford private health insurance without it.
It is important that consumers have some input into which additional services they would like to be covered by private health insurance. This would ensure that the changes are reflecting Australians’ needs and priorities. I believe it is imperative that a range of health decisions start being made that focus on prevention measures and keeping people out of our clogged hospital system. This legislation can be the foundation for this to happen. Furthermore, allowing private health insurance to cover chronic disease management is certainly a solid step forward.
Labor believe that spending money on health is important, because we care about people and we care about improving the health system. However, we believe that spending on health has to be managed well to ensure that every dollar is spent well. Under this legislation proposed by the Howard government, only people who can afford private health insurance will benefit. What about everyone else? Everyone else has been put in the ‘too hard basket’, which is a testament to the last 11 long years of this arrogant Howard government.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-03-20,"—It is a pleasure to follow my colleague, Senator Polley, in this debate on the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills. A number of Labor senators have contributed to the debate on this legislation, but only one coalition senator has made a contribution; that is, Senator Gary Humphreys. He challenged us to say what the bill was about. Mr Acting Deputy President, in my contribution, I will tell you what the bill is about. Labor will support this bill because we recognise that it has the potential to deliver benefits to a significant number of Australians—some 44 per cent of the population who have private health insurance. However, in offering our support, we on this side are urging a closer examination of the consequences of this bill down the track for those 56 per cent of Australians who do not have private health insurance—some of whom will never be able to afford that level of cover.
I think it is worth beginning my contribution by highlighting the fact that this is a government that has an ideological bent when it comes to universal health care. It simply does not believe that it should exist. The Prime Minister has a track record of bitter opposition to Medicare and would dismantle it if he had the opportunity to do so. In fact, in 2001, he told Sydney Morning Herald journalist Jennifer Hewett that Medicare—or Medibank as it was known at its inception—was a cardinal mistake.
The Prime Minister is all for a have and have-not Australia. If some Australians are falling through the cracks, as far as this government is concerned that is perfectly acceptable. We have seen it time and again—after a very long 11 years of coalition government. Work Choices is happy to deliver so-called choice to workers, but in reality this only works for those with the power to bargain; the rest must cop their AWAs sweet or be shown the door. Electoral legislation reforms introduced by this government make it easier to donate big money to political parties anonymously but disenfranchise the illiterate, Indigenous or simply time poor. Promises were made by this government on interest rates that paid lip-service to voters at the last election but, when it comes to the crunch, those same voters who put faith in the government’s empty promises are now pinching pennies or defaulting on their mortgages.
To a majority of Australians who benefit from universal health care, I think the idea that it is somehow a cardinal mistake is offensive. I think that every time the Minister for Health and Ageing gets up in the other place and proclaims that this government is Medicare’s best friend, even members and senators on the other side of the chambers cringe at the obvious doublespeak, because they all know the ideology of their Prime Minister, and that is one of opposition to universal health care.
On this side we are not opposed to the concept of private health insurance; indeed, we embrace it for its supportive role of the health system. The fact that 44 per cent of Australians have private health insurance is indicative, too, that the electorate is supportive of the system as well. This take-up rate is of course closely linked to the government’s Lifetime cover policy, which penalises people for delaying their private health cover beyond the age of 30 by levying an additional two per cent on their premiums for every year over 30 they were not covered. So, buoyed by that decision, the private health coverage of Australians is at the level it is at now.
With that level of people with private coverage, it is reasonable for them to be expecting value for money—and Labor supports this premise, particularly in the face of a rise in premiums of some 40 per cent since 2000-2001. That significant rise in premiums in fact corresponds to another empty coalition promise: that its Lifetime cover and 30 per cent rebate would put downward pressure on premiums. Forty per cent increases do not indicate a great deal of downward pressure on anything—apart from perhaps the disposable income levels of families who have been slugged with the rise in premiums. The Broader Health Cover component—
—Have a look at the premiums under you. They skyrocketed!
—The previous health minister is interjecting. The Broader Health Cover component of this bill will allow private health insurers to cover out-of-hospital services that substitute for or help to prevent hospital treatment. Labor has continually argued that we need prevention programs for public health issues such as obesity. The Broader Health Cover will in some sense go towards addressing health problems that ultimately become a heavy financial strain on the public system years down the track.
Of course, the commercial imperative for private health insurers to also take part in these preventative programs is to minimise their exposure to similar costs from their own members. This bill will allow insurers to cover hospital treatment, general treatment or a combination of both. The general treatment category includes disease and injury management and can include the provision of goods and services, but only those for which a Medicare benefit is not payable. This will have obvious benefits in broadening access to out-of-hospital treatments for chronic conditions that would otherwise be treated in hospital, and would ultimately have the effect of minimising such conditions and therefore the number of cases needing to be treated in hospitals.
As I indicated earlier, Labor takes no issue with the principles laid out in this bill in terms of Broader Health Cover. But where I and my colleagues on this side do share a great deal of concern is the establishment of a two-tier system. Broader Health Cover would provide an attractive series of benefits for members of private health insurers, but the question ought to be asked: what of those without private insurance? Under the current system, the distinction between private health insurance and the public health system can be a matter of choice of treating doctor or additional levels of comfort as well as support for some things like optical and dental. Essentially, these are all areas where the public health system does provide some cover—except perhaps for dental after this government abolished the national dental health scheme.
This bill proposes to broaden the range of those services to those that have not been traditionally provided universally. This essentially means that access to such services will narrow to either the people who can afford to pay for them outright or those who are covered by private health insurance—and, at current figures, that is far from the majority of Australians. Equity of access to health services should be a top priority of this government, but we all know it is not and, in seeking to improve the scope of private health insurance, the concerns surrounding that equity of access have not been addressed and indeed have been entirely dismissed.
Obviously treatment like dialysis and chemotherapy—two services flagged in this bill as examples of treatments falling within the Broader Health Cover—would still remain available to public patients. But other programs, such as disease prevention, which go to the heart of the thinking behind this legislation, could eventually become a service provided predominantly to only those with insurance. Where does this leave people without private insurance but who are equally, if not more, at risk of the same diseases?
While I am certain those opposite me in the chamber would argue this bill does not represent a shift in that direction, I think the weight of logic would indicate that it does. I challenge them to overcome their ideology and address these issues in committee. I know they do not believe that everyone should have access to health care, but, if they are serious about putting in place measures to reduce the future burden of health costs on the Commonwealth, they must confront the fact that people who cannot afford private health cover are those most likely to be unable to access programs that would prevent them going to hospital for treatment. As Australia ages, we must be looking at ways to reduce the incidences of preventable diseases before they become a serious health problem and subsequently a major cost to the public health system.
This brings me to the point of the affordability of premiums. As I stated earlier, premiums have risen by 40 per cent since 2000-01. It should be recognised that a component of this correlates to the rise in costs of health care, but, nevertheless, premiums rising at a rate of twice that of inflation is a significant cost to families. Under the coalition, health insurance premiums are one of a number of rising costs that families must deal with: childcare fees rising at four times annual inflation; interest rates rising eight times in a row; interest repayments doubling as a proportion of disposable income; HECS debts spiralling upwards; and petrol prices remaining historically high, part of which is motorists paying a tax on a tax to the Commonwealth. Add to all of that a 40 per cent increase in the cost of premiums over the last six years.
Those families have been given no guarantee from the government that premiums will not rise again under this new scheme. The minister has refused to acknowledge that possibility, instead putting faith in the streamlining of the regulatory environment that will come with this legislation placing downward pressure on the costs of private insurers and the follow-on effect that will have on premiums. But I think Australians will be excused for not taking the minister at his word, primarily because they did so in 2000 when the government introduced its Lifetime Health Cover initiative and the 30 per cent rebate, yet they have had to absorb a 40 per cent increase in their premiums since. Is the government serious about keeping premiums down? If it were, it would have given greater consideration to the issue in the drafting of this legislation, which contains no guarantees for consumers despite the rhetoric from the minister. If it were serious, it would not be intent on selling off Medibank Private. The government is not putting its shoulder to the wheel in terms of making sure families do not have to keep paying higher premiums. It would rather spend $50 million of taxpayers’ money funding advertising campaigns for the private health insurance sector instead of directing that money to better uses, such as improving the equity of access I spoke about earlier.
In the time remaining, I would also like to address some concerns that have been raised in submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill regarding the issue of managed care. This was a much-maligned practice of the early 1990s—particularly in the United States but also, to a lesser extent, here—whereby private health insurers sought to limit costs by directly interfering in the clinical care of patients. More costly treatments usually performed in hospitals were being done on the cheap at home, and a substantial proportion of the cost was then borne by the patient or the patient’s family. While the overt intention of this bill is not for managed care, the AMA argued in its submission to the inquiry that the scope is there in this legislation. Private health insurers are given discretion in what is classed as general treatment and there is no stipulation of default benefits. The insurers can finance and provide the health care, which means they will necessarily want to minimise their costs—a decision directly affecting the level and quality of care.
Managed care has been widely criticised for compromising quality. In an examination of 58 surveys of American physicians from the late 1980s onwards, most had very strong and very negative sentiment towards the managed care system. A majority in most surveys felt that, while costs might be reduced in some circumstances, necessary tests were not being ordered. The nature of managed care is such that physicians contracted to the organisation are pressured to keep costs down and the first sacrifice can be quality of care. This is precisely the situation we want to avoid in Australia, and the warning has been sounded from the AMA and from Labor that the government needs to recognise that under this legislation there is the possibility for these schemes to emerge.
I would like to conclude my remarks by reminding the government that Australia has at its core the principle of equity. Labor support consumers having greater choice and value for money, but we do not want to see it at the expense of the less fortunate. If anything, this government has shown that its legacy after 11 years is one of division, but an incoming Rudd Labor government will restore the notion of equity to the decision-making process so that we do not become a country of haves and have-nots.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-03-20,"—The Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and the related bills comprehensively deliver on the government’s commitment to bring about the next wave of innovation in private health care. The legislation, which is due to come into effect on 1 April, does two distinct things: firstly, it facilitates increased innovation and choice in private health care; and, secondly, it clarifies and simplifies the regulatory framework. These changes are consistent with the government’s commitment to a vibrant private health sector, but that is not an end in itself. Rather, it gives consumers choice and peace of mind in their health care. It also complements the public health system, which is underwritten by the universality of Medicare. The government has an ongoing and very strong commitment to Medicare. This legislation does not weaken that commitment in any way.
The bills give effect to the reforms announced on 26 April 2006 to: allow insurers to provide and include in risk equalisations benefits for out-of-hospital services under broader health cover, require insurers to provide standard product information to help people compare policies and understand entitlements, eliminate lifetime health cover penalties for those who have retained their hospital cover for 10 years continuously and provide a framework for the quality and safety of services covered by private health insurance. Broader health cover is the key change that will affect private health services. Hospital cover will expand to cover out-of-hospital services that substitute for or prevent treatment within a hospital. This is an important innovation that will transform chronic care management. It removes the barrier to the development of flexible products that better reflect clinical practice and better meet consumer needs.
The bills also consolidate the regulatory framework into one primary piece of legislation. The current system of regulation through conditions of registration is replaced by a transparent set of product standards. This will result in much clearer and simpler regulation of private health insurers and service providers. The government has continued to work closely with health insurers and service providers since the legislation was first introduced in December to improve the clarity and operation of the legislation. The government amendments that will be circulated shortly are the result of these ongoing consultations. They will help ensure that the various elements of the policy work as they are intended to.
The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has also just finished scrutinising the bills. Following its review of submissions from interested stakeholders and a public hearing, the committee concluded that it supports the measures in the bills. We will be making some refinements in implementing the new framework to reflect the committee’s constructive suggestions. Most of the recommendations have been taken on board in an appropriate form. I should note here that in relation to the committee’s recommendations we will, after further consultation, incorporate the recommended care plan charter, a set of guidelines to assist in the relationship of services provided under broader health cover to those provided under Medicare in the statutory rules to ensure that they have legislative force as disallowable instruments.
While the legislation generally has been received positively, some incorrect claims have been made about what the package will or will not actually do. It is important now to put some points on the public record to assist in the understanding and interpretation of the legislation. First and foremost, broader health cover, which is the centrepiece reform element, will not disadvantage those Australians who do not have private health insurance. Broader health cover is about giving health insurers the legal framework to pay for clinically appropriate treatment wherever that is provided. It is not about creating a new set of services that only the privately insured will be able to access. Privately insured patients will now be able to have their treatments more conveniently in local clinics or more comfortably in their own homes, instead of having to go to hospital. It may come as a surprise to some, but in fact such arrangements have been commonplace in state run public hospitals since the 1980s.
Broader health cover will allow the private sector to follow the lead of the public sector in designing and delivering outreach services. There are many examples of outreach services already provided by the public sector. Broader health cover arrangements therefore will not disadvantage public patients. All Australians will continue to have equal access to hospital treatment as public patients and access to the wide range of treatments available under Medicare. We are doing nothing that stops states pursuing similar innovations of their own in relation to public patients; nor do the Australian health care agreements throw barriers in the way of states who wish to fund out of hospital patient services.
Secondly, related to the introduction of broader health cover, claims have been made that it will lead to further increases in private health insurance premiums over time. Broader health cover arrangements are not expected to increase pressure on premiums. They will provide cover for community based treatment as an alternative to treatment within a hospital setting. In essence, broader health cover will replace hospitalisation with care in other settings where it is clinically appropriate and convenient for consumers. This replacement means that broader health cover has some scope to reduce hospital costs and out-of-pocket expenses for consumers, which means over time downward pressure on premiums. The government is keen for consumers to be able to access broader health cover products. However, it will be a commercial decision for private health insurers in choosing whether to offer broader health cover.
Thirdly, it has been suggested that the legislation pays scant attention to quality and safety issues. The main bill introduces the first comprehensive safety and quality regime for all privately insured services, to take effect from 1 July 2008. This start date allows sufficient time for service providers to take a considered approach to the level of accreditation required and to get accredited. The timing allows the accreditation industry to spread its workload, rather than creating a huge administrative bottleneck. It will avoid current available accreditation arrangements potentially determining the shape of what is to come. It will also allow insurers time to develop and negotiate effective and quality based contracts for broader health cover with providers including, but not solely, medical practitioners and private hospital interests. The 1 July 2008 start date for the quality and safety regime has attracted undue attention. It is important to understand that insurers will continue to exercise care on behalf of their members as they do now in choosing who will deliver services. The public expects it and this government expects it.
Indeed, taking into account issues that emerged through the Senate committee inquiry, we will be incorporating provisions in the statutory rules to provide that there must be no diminution of existing quality and safety standards and regimes where they apply to services and providers operating under a care plan facilitated by an insurer. Where accreditation is now usual for such services in other contexts, it will be expected for relevant care plan services. These will be interim and transitional measures pending the commencement of the new dedicated accreditation regime.
Fourthly, elements of the medical profession have raised concerns about the issue of clinical freedom and whether the new private health insurance framework provides sufficient safeguards for it. The government wants to make very clear that clinical freedom—that is, the right of medical practitioners to make unfettered clinical choices—is very important. Decisions about clinical care are and will remain matters for patients and their doctors. There is nothing in the bills that gives insurers more influence over clinical choices.
The new legislation provides the same level of protection for clinical freedom as the current National Health Act. Furthermore, the government are unaware of any complaints from doctors about interference from health insurers under the current regime. If there are demonstrated grounds to review this in the future we will monitor implementation very carefully but, without hard evidence, it is not appropriate to act in a heavy-handed way. Conversely, however, it is up to health insurers to keep faith with medical practitioners and other providers, to reassure them and the public that patients will always get the care they need. The government have every confidence in them and are sure that their trust in the industry will be justified under this new framework.
Finally, concerns have been raised by the opposition about a change to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council’s objectives. The council is the prudential regulator of the private health insurance industry, although, through the administration of standards, the council ensures that health insurers have sufficient money to pay benefits to their members. Nothing will change. The council does not and never has had any power to minimise the level of private health insurance premiums. Control over premiums resides wholly and solely with the Minister for Health and Ageing, and it always has. The new legislation reflects this. The minister’s job is to ensure that premiums are kept as low as possible and that a fund’s obligations to its members and its prudential requirements around minimum reserves are always met.
The government are concerned that, as far as possible, we ensure these major reforms are introduced and implemented smoothly. I therefore foreshadow that the government will monitor the initial month of operation and are prepared to address specific difficulties that may arise in the spring sittings, with legislative adjustments as necessary. I am happy to give a similar undertaking on behalf of the government in respect of the operation of the statutory rules and regulations made under this legislation. I commend this legislation to the Senate.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-20,"—The Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Bill 2006 was passed in 2005, based on a policy recommendation from the Prime Minister’s 2004 statement on energy entitled Securing Australia’s energy future. The object of the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006 is to improve the identification and evaluation of energy efficiency opportunities by large energy-using businesses and, as a result, encourage implementation of cost effective energy efficiency opportunities.
The Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Bill 2006 makes minor technical amendments to the act. The history of the federal government’s energy efficiency efforts date back over a decade to 1995 when the previous government introduced the Greenhouse Challenge program, a voluntary greenhouse reduction program for large businesses and corporations. Recently, the Greenhouse Challenge program became the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program, incorporating two other voluntary programs, Energy Efficiency Standards and Greenhouse Friendly.
The government said it wanted to improve energy efficiency through the National Framework for Energy Efficiency, or the NFEE, the specific implementation of which was agreed by Australian state and federal energy ministers in August 2004. The actions for implementation through the NFEE, stage 1, relate to energy efficiency in the built environment, continued support for appliance minimum energy performance, awareness and capacity building with the commercial and industrial sector. Requirements for energy efficiency beyond the incremental awareness and capacity building is referred to in NFEE, stage 2. The Ministerial Council on Energy outlines that, under a NFEE, stage 2, governments will consider possible further measures which could include broad based incentives. These measures would have the potential to deliver significant energy savings in addition to those being delivered through the NFEE, stage 1.
That statement was made by the MCE in December 2004. Two years later, there has been no further development or consideration as to what a broad based incentive for energy efficiency ought to look like. The problem with all of these schemes is that they are voluntary, and they have done very little to improve energy efficiency or reduce emission intensity or energy use.
It is noted that the original intent of the legislation, as outlined in the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Bill 2006, was to establish a framework for mandatory energy efficiency opportunities, assessments and public reporting of outcomes by large energy-using businesses, including compliance and enforcement arrangements. The scope for energy efficiency is enormous and, frankly, it is a disgrace that governments have taken so long to act. Energy efficiency is the least costly of greenhouse abatement activities. It results in real productivity gains and a reduction in energy consumed and, therefore, a reduction in energy bills and real savings to householders and businesses.
Australia’s historical performance and rate of energy efficiency improvement have been very poor compared with many other countries. Since 1973, Australia’s energy efficiency improvement has been significantly lower than those of major industrialised countries such as Canada and the United States. Economic modelling to estimate the benefits of energy efficiency was undertaken in 2004 by the Ministerial Council on Energy for the National Framework for Energy Efficiency. Economic modelling undertaken by the Allen Consulting Group and McLennan Magasanik Associates showed that if only a one per cent national energy efficiency target were adopted and achieved by implementing those efficiency activities that have less than a four-year payback, if 60 per cent of these less than four-year payback efficiency activities were implemented at no cost or at low cost and if less than four-year payback energy efficiency opportunities were those cost-effective energy efficiency activities, they would pay for themselves within four years. That is a 25 per cent return on investment, which compares with the current bond rate of 6.25 per cent.
The results of the economic modelling of a one per cent efficiency target using only cost-effective energy efficiency activities of less than the four-year payback would be the following net economic and environmental benefits in the 10th year: real investment increases of $586 million, real GDP increase of $1.582 million and a maximum peak demand reduction of 8,322 megawatt hours. That is a reduction in peak demand in the order of 25 per cent of the national electricity market and, as a result, it would make possible the retirement of older power stations and the deferment of capital investment required for new generation.
There would also be a reduction of 19 per cent in the average wholesale market electricity prices by 2014—that is a reduction in electricity bills, not an increase; a net present value of national savings in electricity and gas of $7.7 billion—that is savings not expenditure; greenhouse emission reductions of 28 mega tonnes of CO equivalent—that is a 10 per cent reduction in emissions from the stationary energy sector and a five per cent reduction in Australia’s total greenhouse emissions. We are talking about very substantial opportunities in energy efficiency.
The Australian Greenhouse Office report entitled Tracking to the Kyoto target, which was released in December last year, confirms that Australian government current and committed policies are inadequate to meet Australia’s Kyoto target. Even more concerning is that the AGO report indicates that greenhouse emissions are due to continue to increase strongly to 2020 and that Australia’s emissions will be 127 per cent higher than 1990 levels. The Business Council for Sustainable Energy estimates that for Australia to meet its Kyoto target a further six million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions abatement is required by 2125. However, as long as the decision to implement the cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities through this legislation remains at the discretion of businesses, even if they have a no- or low-cost payback, these very clear economic productivity and environmental benefits will be lost.
What are the barriers to the uptake of energy efficiency? Commonsense economics suggests that, if energy efficiency has such a strong case for being cost effective, energy efficiency would be implemented through the invisible hand of the market. However, the Ministerial Council on Energy and the National Framework on Energy Efficiency have documented those known barriers. Lack of information, high transaction costs, access to finance, low-order management priorities and split incentives are some of them. Relevant information is not always available at the right time to the right people to enable informed energy efficiency choices to be made. Policies and programs that only provide information do not address or overcome behavioural barriers and inertia. As energy is a small proportion of total expenditure for most consumers, the potential savings are not perceived as justifying the necessary investment in time and effort to consider and implement energy efficiency improvements.
Many organisations do not have easy internal or external access to the necessary expertise or tools to identify or take advantage of the available energy efficiency opportunities. There are limits and priorities on the capital available to any organisation, and energy efficiency has to compete for this capital with other potential investments. Organisations appear to use a higher hurdle rate for energy efficiency investment than they use for other investments. In some situations, the financial incentives are split—the person or organisation that would need to invest in the energy efficiency improvement is separate from those who would gain the benefits from the resulting reduction in energy use. There is also uncertainty about the consistency and adequacy of resources and the continuity of government measures over the long term. Energy efficiency is not broadly integrated into the current curricula of TAFE colleges and universities or in the professional development programs of both professional and trade organisations. There is a lack of evidence of achievements from energy efficient applications and government measures as a result of a lack of consistent measuring and reporting of energy use and efficiency.
So, while NFEE stage 1 goes some way towards addressing these barriers, they are still very real There will always be real barriers when the government relies on voluntary implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities. The uptake of energy efficiency is a front-line tool in the transition to a carbon constrained future. It is the least-cost abatement activity with positive economic and productivity benefits, yet energy efficiency is also the most underutilised policy with the government, which has not progressed past voluntary measures. Energy efficiency implementation is much too important to leave to the goodwill and voluntary undertakings of corporations, however socially responsible those may be.
Energy efficiency implementation is, we say, much too important to leave to the goodwill and voluntary undertakings of corporations, however socially responsible they may be. Some will progress and others will have it as a low priority. As the act is currently written—that is, identification and reporting but leaving the implementation to the discretion of the corporation—it will result in the same policy failure that was seen in the mid-nineties when corporations were required to undertake audits but not to implement the recommendations even when it resulted in reduced costs and improved profitability.
Mandatory energy efficiency schemes already exist in places such as Italy and the UK. The energy efficient opportunities implementation of the UK schemes is predominantly delivered through energy retailers in order to simplify the administration. In Europe other energy efficiency schemes are developed with a trading component and therefore incorporate incentives for the implementation of energy efficiency activities. In Europe these schemes are referred to as white certificate trading. Currently the Victorian government requires all EPA licence holders with an energy usage greater than 500 gigajoules per annum—that is greater than 100 tonnes of energy related CO equivalent and equates to $15,000 expenditure—to identify, report and implement all cost-effective energy efficiency activities with a payback period of less than four years. The Victorian government has announced an energy efficiency target. While details have yet to be released, I understand that a mandated energy efficiency target with a trading component is being considered in order to create further incentives for the implementation of efficiency activities. The New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme, while primarily a carbon abatement program, also creates incentives for the implementation of efficiency activities. These are just a few examples of where energy efficiency policies are being introduced and supported with targets and frameworks to deliver real and mandated efficiency outcomes.
If this bill passes in its present form, the result will be a lot of energy audits but little implementation and productivity or economic benefits. The Democrats have circulated amendments that will deliver a broadened level of participation. For instance, the current act applies only to corporations that use 0.5 petajoules of energy per year and it is anticipated that that will only apply to 250 corporations. Making the scheme mandatory and lowering the threshold for participation will reduce Australia’s greenhouse emissions by 10 per cent and result in real productivity gains. Our amendments will require corporations to implement those opportunities with a less than four-year payback—that is, it would be no longer at the discretion of the corporation but become a mandatory requirement. If the company has implemented all cost-effective energy efficiency activities with a less than four-year payback then the company is not required to act further.
We would also reduce the threshold for participation to include commercial and industrial organisations with greater than 1,000 tonnes of energy related CO equivalent emissions or energy consumption of greater than 5,000 gigajoules, whichever is the lesser. Lowering the participation threshold would bring in 5,000 companies to implement those efficiency activities. Those 5,000 biggest energy users would all be companies that would have more than 200 employees. So we are not talking here about small organisations. Clearly, there is a range of economic, national, social and environmental benefits to be gained from improving energy efficiency throughout the economy. It will result in gains in economic growth, consumer welfare and employment. It is in fact the most cost-effective greenhouse abatement activity there is. It will also ensure improved energy infrastructure utilisation and reduce energy supply costs. Another advantage of energy efficiency is that it can defer new capital investments until such time as cleaner generation technologies become less expensive and are geared up in terms of our own industry here in creating them.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-03-20,"—The Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Bill 2006 seeks to make a number of minor technical amendments to the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006. Labor will be supporting the passage of this amendment bill, which will address deficiencies in the parent legislation which came into effect in July last year. The energy efficiency opportunities framework is worthwhile and we support these amendments. We are, however, deeply concerned by the Howard government’s approach to energy policy more broadly; in particular, its failure to accept the realities of climate change and the need for action on carbon emissions, a topic I will return to.
The purpose of the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act was to provide a structure for mandatory assessment of energy efficiency opportunities and the public reporting of outcomes by businesses which use large volumes of energy. It is noted in the explanatory memorandum to the original bill that usage by business accounts for around 80 per cent of primary energy use. Within that, according to the ABS, 250 or so of the largest users account for 60 per cent of business energy use. The act’s requirement to conduct efficiency assessments and report on outcomes applies to the largest energy users—those using in excess of 0.5 petajoules per year, which is around 250 businesses, according to the ABS. The act leaves to the business in question decisions on investments identified by their normal business processes.
Labor have supported the establishment of the energy efficiency regime in this form with the coverage that I have indicated and with the take-up of efficiencies left to the businesses involved. We have consistently said that we want to see the scheme up and running in this form before we consider any further changes. I think these amendments will help to ensure that the scheme is given a fair chance, but we will be monitoring its effectiveness over the coming period. The bill, as I say, seeks to remedy a number of deficiencies in the act. It will ensure an unambiguous definition of the trigger year in which energy use creates a requirement to register under the act. It will allow participants to submit their assessment plans within 18 months of the end of the trigger year. It will clarify that assessment plans must cover the five-year period commencing the day after the end of the trigger year and that subsequent plans are required to start the day after the end of the previous plan. It will allow the delegation of the secretary’s powers under the act to certain officials.
Labor support those amendments. We support the intent of the act as a means to encourage business to identify and utilise efficiencies which otherwise might not be taken up. Despite the economic advantage, there is evidence that some firms just do not take those opportunities.
Australia is blessed with enormous energy reserves, but that abundance is perhaps not the best incentive to ensure that we are harnessing energy use and utilising all cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities. Our rate of energy efficiency and the improvement in that rate over the last three decades do not compare well with other industrialised nations. There is a clear challenge for us to remedy that. That applies as much to the way we use energy across our economy and society as it does to the largest business energy users. There are opportunities to increase efficiency in transport and in our homes as well as in our businesses.
While the measures in the act are worth while, they do nothing to address the broader challenge of the need for increased energy efficiency. We need to take a fresh look at energy use to meet the challenge of climate change in the context of our abundant energy supplies. This act will, we hope, encourage a greater rigour in the use of energy, allowing business to gain greater benefit from Australia’s comparative advantage in the area.
Rising energy costs, the economic expansion of China, India and other economies, and the challenge of global warming all demand that we get the most out of our energy sources. Efficient energy use is a key contributor to our long-term energy security. As a nation we face complex energy challenges, and it is increasingly clear that the Howard government is not capable of meeting those challenges. It has proved unable to work with the states and territories to improve public transport, particularly in the major cities—an area of importance if we are to increase our energy efficiency and emissions reductions. The Howard government’s decade in power has been marked by its failure to support the renewable energy and alternative fuel industries. But where it has failed most abjectly is in its response to climate change. On this front the Howard government has given us a decade of denial and inaction. This is despite the IPCC reports and other reports that culminated in the 2006 Stern report.
We have seen the unedifying sight of the Prime Minister backtracking and backflipping. First he is a sceptic, then he is not; then he is again and then he is not. We have an industry minister who said just six months ago, ‘I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate change’. He apparently has had a conversion, although I do not think Senator Minchin has quite been able to swallow the new government line. The government is simply incapable of taking us forward on this issue. Its scepticism—its denial—is just too deeply ingrained.
Four years ago the COAG Energy Market Review recommended a national emissions trading system. Bill Scales’s report for the Energy Reform Implementation Group, released last year, said that the ERIG had been struck by the significant concerns raised by market participants about market uncertainty in relation to possible future greenhouse gas abatement initiatives. There is a pressing need for investment decisions to ensure adequate baseload and peakload power is supplied for Australia, but these decisions cannot be made currently because of uncertainty over our national response on carbon emissions. Business tells me this every time I meet with its representatives. And Mr Scales continues to say that market participants have indicated to ERIG that greenhouse risk constitutes one of the most important barriers in the energy industry, particularly to new baseload coal investments. ERIG notes that most market participants desire a coordinated and sustainable policy approach to greenhouse. I note also that the Energy Supply Association of Australia has now come out in support of a national carbon emissions system, leaving the Howard government completely isolated on this issue. We have CEOs of major electricity generators and downstream gas providers calling for a national carbon emissions trading scheme and long-term targets for greenhouse reductions.
It echoes Labor’s policy and its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. As the Energy Supply Association notes, the electricity generation sector is facing investment decisions that might total $100 billion over the next 25 years to ensure Australia’s future electricity supply. The government, in refusing to agree to a national emissions trading scheme, is holding up investment and jeopardising our future electricity supplies. Labor and the business sector are in agreement that we need to dramatically cut our greenhouse gas emissions and that the best way of achieving those cuts is through a trading scheme that sets a price signal on emissions. This will ensure that business has the certainty it needs to make the necessary investment decisions to ensure adequate future power supplies. The government, through its denial and inaction, has left Australia unprepared for the huge economic and environmental challenges we now face.
In conclusion, Labor supports the amendment bill to iron out anomalies in the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act. It is a small but important measure; we supported the original act, and we support this amendment bill. It is a useful way to encourage business to take up advantages of valuable efficiencies. It is a useful step and, while it does not go as far as many would like, we think it is an important addition to measures to encourage energy efficiency. We will be supporting the bill.
Sitting suspended from 6.28 pm to 7.30 pm",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-03-20,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Bill 2006. In fact, it should be called the ‘Energy Efficiency Lost Opportunities Bill’. What we see here is a technical amendment. We will be supporting that technical amendment, but the lost opportunity is to actually deal with energy efficiency. I will get to the amendments that the Australian Greens will be moving in relation to this bill when we get to the committee stage.
I am always appalled when I hear any debates on climate change in which the side of the equation that gets the most emphasis is producing greater supplies of energy. The other side of the debate—reducing demand through energy efficiency—is nowhere to be seen. Only last night, on an ABC program, we again had the former head of the Prime Minister’s task force on nuclear energy talking up the opportunities as he sees them for nuclear energy to increase supply and the coal industry talking up the need to continue to use coal. But we also had Alan Pears and Mark Diesendorf talking about renewable energy, energy efficiency and the capacity to reduce demand through energy efficiency measures.
The importance of energy efficiency is that it is the easiest and the fastest way to reduce energy use and therefore to reduce greenhouse gases. It is not something that requires any kind of rocket science; it just requires commitment from government to change the regulations to make sure that it happens. We have a situation in which the government has recently announced its intention to phase out light bulbs and bring in the more energy efficient light bulbs—and I applaud that; I think that is a good idea. But what it seeks to do is to distract the community into taking personal responsibility for their energy use whilst taking their eye off the fact that the government is not doing anything in terms of policy initiatives to deal with the main energy users.
Let us face it: it is not the domestic sector that is the main energy user when it comes to electricity. In fact, in the minister’s own document he said that 250 corporations that use more than half a petajoule of energy per year cover around 40 per cent of Australia’s total energy use. So we are talking about 250 corporations. What this bill did originally—and the amendment does not change it—was simply to say to those large energy users: ‘You are required to do an audit of energy efficiency opportunities and you have to report on that audit. And that is it; you are not required to implement the findings of that audit.’
When the legislation originally came in, I asked the then minister, Senator Ian Campbell: ‘Why is the government so resistant to requiring these companies to implement their audits and to start off with a low, very easy bar and then take it out to more difficult ones? Why is the government only concentrating on those companies that use more than half a petajoule of energy per year? Why don’t we phase in gradually and include companies that use lesser amounts over a period of time so that we capture more and more energy users and require them to implement the findings of their audits and get the bar higher and higher over time?’ He could not answer the question, and I will be very interested to hear Senator Colbeck’s response as to why the government still will not require these companies to implement the findings of their audits.
Why have we still got the focus on voluntary measures? Between the time that this bill was introduced and now, we have had the IPCC report globally, which has told us that things are grim in terms of climate change. We have reports virtually daily from scientists telling us that the IPCC report was way too conservative in its findings, that the impacts of climate change are accelerating and that the predictions scientists were making for 10, 15 or 20 years from now are actually occurring as we speak. We are seeing species extinction. We are seeing ice melt at a rate never expected. We have predictions coming out in April on the IPCC’s report on the impacts of climate change which are telling us that the polar bear is going to be extinct in the wild because the amount of ice we are losing in the Arctic is such that they will lose their habitat. That is just one example of what is going on as we speak.
Yet we still have a government that says, ‘We are only interested in voluntary arrangements.’ From the explanatory memorandum we know that the companies that used over half a petajoule in 2005-06 have until March, the end of this month, to register in relation to this energy efficiency opportunities legislation. By late November last year six companies—Alcoa World Alumina Australia, Hanson Australia, New Hope Mining, Queensland Alumina, Rio Tinto and Leighton Holdings—had registered for the energy opportunities program, and more are expected to register shortly. They are looking at their energy efficiency. They are required to register, but these companies can well afford to implement the findings of their audits.
The importance of doing it is that, if we implement energy efficiency initiatives now, it will buy us the time that we need to be able to roll out the renewable energy technologies so that we do not have people talking about building new coal fired power stations. We have just had the United Nations Foundation saying no new coal fired power stations should be built unless they can be retrofitted for carbon capture and storage. We also know that carbon capture and storage is at least 15 to 20 years away—if it ever occurs; it is unproven technology. We have had admissions in the last couple of months that the government’s big promise with clean coal is not working out as they expected. In fact, their aqua ammonia process is a complete failure. It is not scientifically viable as it releases large clouds of ammonia. So we are back to square one. We are back to the only process they have, which is a monoethanolamine process. It is going to double the price of coal fired power and it reduces the efficiency of power stations by 30 per cent, therefore increasing the pressure on the demand and supply side.
We need to buy some time, to not build polluting new infrastructure and to allow the renewables sector to roll out, by reducing energy demand. Why is that such a difficult concept for the government to grasp? Why is it that every time we are told about climate change and the government’s response we are told that demand for energy is soaring and therefore we need to build new supply constantly? Why can’t we reduce demand at the same time as we are working on rolling out the renewable energy supply?
In Europe they introduced an energy efficiency target by way of a directive from the European Commission. It has been hugely effective. They have brought in programs that deal with things like stand-by power. Most people are not even aware that 11 per cent of their energy usage is in the flickering lights that they might see if they walk around their house at night in the dark. They do not need those appliances to be on. It is carelessness, a lack of awareness and the fact that it is so difficult to reprogram a lot of these technologies. People would quite like to turn them off but in many cases they get frustrated because they have to reprogram them to get them back on again, and that makes it a no-win exercise.
We need governments to move in and require appliances to meet new standards so that the consumer can easily do what they want to do, and that is reduce their energy consumption and reduce their power bills at the same time. People want to do the right thing and they want to save money as well. But they are not being facilitated in doing so because the mandatory energy performance standards are too low. Why is it that you can still buy in Australia such inefficient appliances? Why is it that you can buy such inefficient electric hot water cylinders? We should not be doing that. They are not doing that in Europe because they recognise the cost savings that they can achieve by bringing in government regulation that requires new standards.
The Greens announced a few weeks ago a plan to roll out solar hot water across Australia. We pointed out that the government is forgoing $1 billion a year by providing people with a fringe benefits tax concession which is an incentive for them to drive their cars more and waste fuel in an effort to get to a higher level of concession. That is a nonsense when Australia is running out of oil and our bill for imported oil is growing larger. If you were to abolish that fringe benefits tax concession for using more and more fuel, you could use that billion dollars to roll out solar hot water across the country and you could back it up with higher mandatory energy performance standards so that you could not buy inefficient hot water technology.
At the same time, we need to strengthen the Building Code of Australia so that it is uniform across the country and is a higher standard than it is now. It was ludicrous, when I was in the Tasmanian parliament only a few years ago and introduced legislation to make it mandatory for insulation in new houses in Tasmania—which you would think was a logical thing to do—that the Master Builders Association came out and condemned it, saying that all that would do would be to increase the price of new houses. They refused to concede that not doing so adds inefficient housing to the building stock and leaves people with higher and higher power bills over time as they try and heat inefficient houses in the Tasmanian winter. Now, of course, people cannot understand how it was possible that people building relatively new houses in Tasmania were allowed to get away with not insulating them. It is ridiculous when we have an energy and global-warming crisis.
We need incentives to roll out energy efficiency technology, increased mandatory energy performance standards and mandatory and uniform increased standards in the Building Code of Australia for new houses, for retrofitting older houses and for extensions to existing housing stock. Where state governments are providing government housing they should be required to build that state owned housing stock to the highest levels of energy efficiency, because it would cost the consumers in those houses far less to live. They are the people who need those sorts of benefits, and we all need them as a community in terms of climate change. But we are not seeing that level of consistency. Here we have a completely forgone opportunity.
With our amendments to this, the Greens are proposing, first of all, to set up a mechanism for the government to establish a national energy efficiency target. Then, from that, we need a strategy that is designed to achieve the target not only for big business but also for the transport and residential sectors. We would roll it out over a period of time, as the European Union has done. I congratulate the European Union for the leadership they showed on climate change just recently when they announced a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2020.
I remind the government that Jacques Chirac has said that the European Union is not going to tolerate countries around the world getting a free ride and that the European Union is considering bringing in a tariff on imports into Europe from countries that have not ratified the Kyoto protocol, that have not taken these matters into account. So, whether we like it or not, Australian exports going into Europe are very likely to be taxed in the foreseeable future with a carbon tax because of the failure of the Australian government to introduce appropriate policies.
Our amendments set up a mechanism for a national energy efficiency target. Secondly, it is a mechanism to require companies that are captured by this bill, those 250 that are effectively using 40 per cent of Australia’s total energy, to implement the findings of their energy efficiency audit over a period of time with an increasingly high bar. Another amendment is to capture those medium-sized companies so that they also get involved in this energy efficiency program over time.
Our amendment will require those companies to report to their shareholders what the energy efficiency audit says about what they could achieve over a 10-year time frame, for example. Whilst the government requires them to report on what the audit is doing, frequently they do not tell their shareholders because, contrary to the government’s view that they will automatically understand the cost savings and so just go ahead and do it, many of these corporations have other priorities that do not include energy efficiency and spend money on those and do not implement the energy efficiency audit.
So we need to achieve serious cuts—and it is my view that we need in excess of an 80 per cent reduction in Australia’s greenhouse gases below 1990 levels by 2050—if we are to have any hope of stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and containing a global temperature rise below two degrees, and that should be our aim as this parliament. It should be our aim if we are interested in the wellbeing of future generations and particularly our capacity to sustain ourselves in Australia in what is effectively a desert landscape in many parts of the country. We are already living beyond our ecological limits. Climate change is making that absolutely apparent in terms of extreme drought, extreme flood and bushfires. We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. It is not good enough for the environment minister, Mr Turnbull, to stand up and say he is going to change over light globes and then not take the obvious step. Just one of these companies implementing their audit is the equivalent of 10,000 households. We are talking about serious energy efficiency savings if the government was actually serious, but I do not think it is.
I was disappointed to hear Labor’s spokesperson, Senator Evans, saying that Labor will support the framework as it currently is. Last time, Labor voted against these amendments that I am going to move again which require companies to implement their audit. I would hope this time that we get that support because since then the world has had a much clearer understanding of the size of task. Frankly, if we cannot act on the lowest hanging fruit, which is energy efficiency, then we have got no hope of getting where we need to be by 2020 and 2050.
There is an opportunity now for a tripartite response to the challenge, and I honestly believe that if the government moved in this way the Australian community would be enormously grateful, because 250 companies can make a big difference. This is not about a government subsidy; this is about a change to government regulation and abandonment of the notion of voluntary commitments and going with regulating for change. I would remind the government that Sir Nicholas Stern has said that climate change and the impacts of climate change are the biggest market failure of all time. The free market has failed in our efforts to address climate change.
Let us bring in the regulation now, and I urge both the government and the opposition to support the Greens’ amendment for these companies, these 250 large energy users, to implement the findings of the energy efficiency audit and therefore delay the time in which decisions have to be made about new infrastructure at the same time as rolling out more renewable energy. It is a win-win for the country, and I would be very interested if there is any logical argument against it, because none are apparent to me.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-03-20,"—in reply—Thank you to the senators who have contributed to the debate on the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Bill 2006. I hope that we can see agreement on this bill, which makes amendments to the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006 to correct a small number of technical problems. These amendments will properly align the act with the original policy intent and improve its administration. They are consistent with the explanatory memorandum to the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006 and the obligations as set out in the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Regulations 2006 and the Energy Efficiency Opportunities industry guidelines. The amendments will enable the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program to be delivered as originally intended, ensuring that industry is not disadvantaged, and will assist in its administration. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2007-03-20,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Economics Committee, Senator Ronaldson, I present the report of the committee on the Qantas Sale (Keep Jetstar Australian) Amendment Bill 2007, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>QANTAS SALE (KEEP JETSTAR AUSTRALIAN) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Report of Economics Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-03-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate some remarks about the report.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Family First campaigned strongly against the Qantas takeover for three reasons —jobs, jobs and jobs.
Job security is a huge issue in Australia —it is a major concern for Australian workers and their families —and Family First wants to ensure that jobs stay in Australia and are not sent offshore.
Protecting Australian jobs is Family First’s top priority because that gives workers and their families peace of mind.
It is extremely disappointing that the Economics Committee has decided to oppose the Qantas Sale (Keep Jetstar Australian) Amendment Bill 2007.
The decision reflects the Government’s lack of commitment to Australian workers and their families as well as Australian jobs.
It is not the first time the Government has abandoned Australian workers.
The Government’s workplace changes removed guarantees for public holidays, meal breaks and overtime and penalty rates. Family First voted against the WorkChoices legislation – I repeat, voted AGAINST the workplace changes —because they undermined family life and forced workers to bargain for conditions which were previously protected.
Now Australian workers at Qantas and its associated entities will also have to fight – to retain their jobs – as increasingly the company slashes costs in its quest to boost profits.
Jobs matter – all jobs matter – and job security is crucial for families.
Family First’s bill would have closed a loophole where currently only part of the Qantas Group is covered by the Qantas Sale Act.
Qantas associated entities are not covered and the company can exploit that loophole to send Australian jobs offshore and to reduce wages and conditions. That is what Family First wanted to stop.
Sadly, both the major parties have been reluctant to stand in the way of a huge debt-ridden $11 billion buyout that threatens the jobs of thousands of Australian workers and their families.
Family First’s amendment to the Qantas Sale Act would have closed this loophole and ensured that restrictions that apply to Qantas – including rules about maintenance, training and administration – also applied to Jetstar and other associated entities like catering.
It is not difficult for Qantas to push operations into associated entities with a lower cost base like Jetstar. There is extensive evidence this is happening, even at the expense of Qantas-badged services’ growth and profit.
Michael Ryan, co-founder of pioneer low cost airline Ryanair commented on the Qantas strategy:
I would imagine that what they [Qantas] are trying to do is put as many of Qantas’ routes into Jetstar [as possible].
More recently, one commentator has argued that the Airline Partners Australia takeover deal
is predicated on Qantas growing. The only place that can happen, with a company altering scale, is outside of Australia. And the only platform that can happen from, is Jetstar. Why? First, because Jetstar’s cost base is made so wonderfully competitive because Dixon & Co don’t have to deal with Qantas’ 13 unions. And second, because all the growth in the airline business is in the discount airspace.
As a result of this conscious strategy by Qantas to move more and more seats to Jetstar, more and more people will find themselves flying on Jetstar rather than on a Qantas flight.
Qantas has been transferring more and more of its seats to Jetstar, because of Jetstar’s lower costs and higher profits. As one reporter wrote, “Jetstar’s ... behind the improvements in all of the key measures of Qantas’s performance and its falling cost base.”
In another example, Qantas is using associated entity Australian Airlines to cut costs on Qantas-badged services. Jetstar may also end up flying aircraft on behalf of Qantas under Qantas colours, completing the corporate manoeuvre to achieve lower cost flights with fewer Australian workers and lower conditions.
It is vital to tighten the Qantas Sale Act given Qantas executives at the hearings stated:
The act does not require [Qantas] to maintain a majority of facilities in Australia ...
Family First was startled at the inquiry to hear Qantas executives admit “... all jobs within Qantas are under review ... It.
We already know the attitude of Qantas CEO Geoff Dixon about his workers and job security. Mr Dixon has said that his workers should be grateful to have jobs. Further, he has said profits are more important than workers and their families:
I sometimes get criticised for this, but I have always seen shareholders as our most important stakeholders. I know some CEOs say look after your customers, look after your employees, and the returns for shareholders will follow. I do the exact opposite.
Representatives of maintenance workers told the hearing about their involvement in an ongoing review:
I can say categorically and the Seabury consultants that were engaged by Qantas have said so quite bluntly that their recommendation to the Qantas board is to offshore the whole lot. We are struggling to save Australian jobs in maintenance and engineering.
The jobs are not only valued by the workers and their families, but by many others who have related and dependent employment.
Family First believes there is more to running a business than making a profit. Companies like Qantas and its associated entities have an obligation to the communities they serve.
Protecting  Australian jobs for workers and their families is Family First’s top priority which is why Family First believes the Qantas Sale (Keep Jetstar Australian) Amendment Bill 2007 must be passed by the Parliament with amendments.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-03-20,"—It is important that the government has brought forward the Airspace Bill 2006 and consequential legislation, and I am very pleased to speak on the bill tonight. I know that a number of my colleagues are very keen to participate in this debate, because it is a matter of national importance. As we have seen from recent tragic events, air safety is something that we cannot afford to overlook. That comes to issues around the proposed sale of Qantas. There are significant air safety issues and airspace issues. There have been arguments between Qantas, the pilots and the Civil Aviation Authority, which is why it is very important that this bill is given due consideration by the parliament. We cannot rush this bill through. We cannot have a government that is intent on driving this bill through without adequate consideration, and that is why it is important that we have the time tonight—and we appreciate that the government is allowing the time tonight—to debate this bill. We are very keen indeed to ensure those matters around air safety, airspace and the role that is played by the Civil Aviation Authority in the regulation and function of airspace.
This change is aimed at addressing any perception of a conflict of interest in Airservices Australia in its role as both the commercial air navigation service provider and the regulator of the level of service to be provided in particular volumes of Australian administered airspace. I was previously on the transport committee of the Senate, and I participated in a number of lengthy inquiries into the conduct of Airservices Australia—and not always, I have to say, have I been satisfied with how they have handled some of the difficulties. It is fraught. There have been many conflicts: many vested interest groups and many people have been involved in arguments. Prominent Australians—for example Dick Smith, who I am sure is known to many on the other side of the chamber—have had very strong and passionate views.
There have been failed experiments with airspace regulation. We have been backwards and forwards, so it is important to make sure that we deal with these potential conflicts of interest. This bill will require the minister to make an Australian airspace policy statement on the administration and regulation of policy objectives for Australian administered airspace. The transfer of airspace regulation and administration from Airservices Australia to CASA will provide an additional function for CASA to regulate civil airspace.
Since 1995 the function to classify non-defence Australian airspace has been undertaken by Airservices Australia. There is a potential conflict of interest in a commercial provider of airspace services also being a regulator. The transfer of function will require CASA to establish a dedicated administrative unit, the Office of Airspace Regulation. The requirement on the minister to outline an Australian airspace policy statement should provide certainty for the industry, particularly in view of the significant changes to technology currently being instituted within Australia and in other jurisdictions. This statement will require major changes to Australian airspace to be subjected to risk analysis, detailed examination of the potential costs and benefits and stakeholder consultation. I note that my colleague Senator O’Brien, who I assure you knows far more about this bill than me, will be able to take this up in much greater detail than I have explained so far. I will defer to my colleague Senator O’Brien.",SENATE,<title>AIRSPACE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I did not catch the first part of the speech. I do not know how much of my contribution has been gazumped in a very effective way by Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy tells me he has not spoken about the opposition’s position on this legislation. I can say that the opposition will support this legislation. That probably encapsulates our position in a nutshell.
The purpose of the Airspace Bill 2006 is to ensure that Australian administered airspace is administered and used safely, taking into account protection of the environment, efficient use of that airspace, equitable access to that airspace for all users of that airspace and national security. Clause 8(1) establishes the requirement for the minister to make a statement of national airspace policy. The purpose of this statement is to define the basis for Australia’s airspace architecture, to outline the government’s objectives for airspace and air navigation services, to describe a process for airspace change, including a risk assessment, and to provide clear guidance to airspace regulators of the policy frameworks under which they operate. The statement is also to set out a strategy for the administration and use of Australian administered airspace.
The minister’s power to make the statement is not to be delegated. The details relating to this statement are set out in the remainder of clause 8. In general, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority must exercise its powers and perform its functions in a manner consistent with the minister’s statement. Under the Airspace (Consequentials and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will be amended to include a new section stipulating that, subject to the Aviation Act 1988, which requires CASA to regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration, CASA must exercise its powers and perform its functions in a manner consistent with the statement. This amendment to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will also require that CASA notify the minister in writing if it is proposed to exercise a power or perform a function in a manner that is inconsistent with that statement and to provide reasons for doing so. Some of the matters described in the statement are to be covered by regulations as well.
Clause 8(2) sets out the items that must at a minimum be included in that statement. This list requires that the statement must specify and describe the classifications to be used to administer Australian administered airspace, and these must be consistent with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s classification system for airspace described in the Chicago convention or with differences lodged by Australia under article 38 of the Chicago convention and specify and describe the designations to be used for the purpose of restricting access to or warning about access to particular volumes of Australian administered airspace.
The equivalent provisions to these designations in the current regime are the volumes of airspace above areas of Australian territory declared by Airservices to be prohibited, restricted or danger areas under part 2 of the Air Services Regulations. These volumes of airspace currently include the airspace above prohibited, restricted and danger areas defined in the Air Services Regulations, to be transferred to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
Further, the statement will describe the processes to be followed by CASA as the airspace regulator when changing the classifications or designations of particular volumes of Australian administered airspace. The statement will describe a robust risk based decision-making process for major changes to the classification and designation of airspace. It is intended that the process to be followed for such changes will require at least the following three elements: a risk assessment, a cost-benefit analysis and consistency with government policy objectives. The statement will also ensure that major changes to the administration of airspace will be tested through consultation with stakeholders.
Further, it will outline the government’s policy objectives for the administration and use of Australian administered airspace and include a strategy for the future administration and use of Australian administered airspace. This strategy will make future airspace changes more predictable. For example, the strategy may include descriptions of how Australian administered airspace will accommodate technological change. Clause 8(3) allows the minister to include any other matters that the minister thinks appropriate, and clause 8(4) states that the statement described in clause 8 must be consistent with the Chicago convention, and this includes the annexes to the convention. Where Australia has notified differences under article 38 of that convention, the statement must be consistent with those differences.
Clause 8(5) provides that the Australian airspace policy statement will be a legislative instrument, but neither section 42 nor part 6 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 applies to the statement. This means that the statement must be tabled as required by the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 but is not disallowable and may not be the subject of a sunset clause. However, clause 10 of this bill requires that it will be subject to regular review, including a comprehensive consultation process. Clause 9 does deal with that. It requires the minister, when developing the statement, to consult the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Airservices Australia and any other person or body the minister thinks appropriate. Consultation under clause 9(2) will include consultation with the Minister for Defence, and it is likely that the first statement will be developed as an interim statement in order to be in place at the point that regulations are made conferring relevant airspace functions and powers upon the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and removing those functions and powers from Airservices. That is to ensure that CASA has in place a complete legislative framework for administering and regulating Australian administered airspace. All of this is in a framework where a statement must be made by the minister every three years. Clause 10 directs that this must occur. The intent of the provision is to ensure that there is no more than three years between the end of one review commissioned by the minister and the end of the next airspace regulation.
Clause 11 makes provision for regulations to be made under the proposed Airspace Act to provide the Civil Aviation Safety Authority with the powers and functions necessary to administer and regulate Australian administered airspace. At the time those regulations are made, part 2 of the Air Services Regulations will be repealed, and all instruments made under those regulations will be grandfathered in order to maintain continuity of airspace architecture in Australian administered airspace. Transitional provisions enabling regulations to be made to put this arrangement into effect are included in schedule 3 of the related consequential amendments bill.
The provisions of clauses 11(2)(a) to 11(2)(k) list some of the matters that may be dealt with in regulations under this bill. It is not an exhaustive list. Clause 11(3) notes that the matters listed under clause 11(2) do not limit the matters for which regulations may be made under this bill. Subclauses under 11(2) describe matters that may be put into regulations to allow CASA to determine the appropriate services for particular volumes of airspace. In addition, regulations may be made to empower the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to regulate the provision of aeronautical information services in Australia. It is intended that Airservices Australia will remain the provider of Australia’s aeronautical information service pursuant to annex 15 of the Chicago convention. Clause 11(2)(j) will enable CASA to regulate the quality of the information provided by Airservices Australia and other providers of civil aeronautical information services in Australia. Regulations may be also be made to empower CASA to obtain information from the operators of aerodromes, the owners or operators of aircraft, or the providers of air navigation services. Clause 11(3) notes that the matters listed under clause 11(2) do not limit the matters for which regulations may be made under this bill.
There are a variety of other matters which make provision for such matters as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority delegating its functions and powers to another person. Circumstances when that might occur are most likely when decisions are required in the management of Australian administered airspace. For example, this could occur with respect to the designation and conditions of use of an air route or airway and the giving of directions in connection with the use or operation of designated routes and airways. In addition, provisions define ‘aerodrome’, ‘aircraft’, ‘air route’, ‘air route facilities or airway facilities’, and ‘airway’ and draw those meanings into line with the meaning in the Civil Aviation Act 1988. Other terms will defined in the airspace regulations.
Clause 12 provides direction to CASA on how it is to perform the functions and powers given to it in the airspace regulations, in particular to achieve the balance of matters referred to in clause 3 of the bill, subject to obligations in sections 9A, 11 and 11A of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and it requires the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to actively encourage the efficient use of Australian administered airspace and equitable access to it and to ensure that national security concerns are accounted for.
As I mentioned earlier, as part of the role of the airspace regulator, clause 13 specifies that CASA is expected to conduct regular reviews ‘of the existing classifications of volumes of Australian-administered airspace in order to determine whether those classifications are appropriate’, in clause 13(1); ‘of the existing services and facilities provided by the providers of air navigation services in relation to particular volumes of Australian-administered airspace’, in clause 13(2); and ‘in order to identify risk factors and to determine whether there is safe and efficient use of that airspace and equitable access to that airspace for all users’, in clause 13(3). Clauses 14(1) and 14(2) provide for the minister to request advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, by writing to that organisation, on a matter related to Australian airspace policy. In other words, CASA will assist the regulator in relation to that matter.
In essence, all of that means that this bill provides for the transfer of airspace regulation and administration from Airservices Australia, which has had this power for some time, to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. This will provide an additional function for CASA to regulate civil airspace. Since 1995, the function to classify non-defence Australian airspace has been undertaken by Airservices Australia. There is a potential conflict of interest in a commercial provider of airspace services also being a regulator. The transfer of function will require the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to establish a dedicated administrative unit, which will be called the Office of Airspace Regulation. In addition, the bill requires the minister to outline an Australian airspace policy statement. This change should provide certainty for industry, particularly in view of significant changes to technology currently being instituted within Australia and in other jurisdictions. The statement will require major changes to Australian airspace to be subject to risk analysis, detailed examination of the potential costs and benefits and stakeholder consultation.
As I said earlier, the opposition will be supporting this bill. That is not to say that we do not have some concerns in relation to this arrangement—not that it is inappropriate, because it is appropriate; not because the principles that underline the bill are flawed, because we do not have that concern. Our concern is that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has not performed to the standard that would give the opposition complete confidence that allocating an additional power to that organisation is the best course of action at this point in time. However, we are guided by the principle that the structure to be put in place ought to be the most sensible and consistent. We also believe that these provisions are capable of delivering for Australia a sensible and consistent model of regulation and removing the inconsistency of a service provider of airspace also being the regulator of that airspace.
I have had a lot to say in this chamber about the deficiencies in the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—not in relation to this power, of course, because they do not yet have it, but in relation to their regulation of operators in Australian airspace. The Lockhart River tragedy has taken some time of this chamber. I make no apology for bringing matters such as that before this chamber. We still await the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s final report on that tragedy. It has been some time since the draft was sent to interested parties—which I believe included the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I will not be surprised if there are criticisms of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in the document when it is finally issued.
We will hold our opinion until we see that document, but there are certainly great concerns held within the community of North Queensland about the way that CASA performed their functions in relation to Transair. It of course is a matter of history that Transair was finally, some time after the crash, the subject of regulatory action by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which ultimately saw it concede its licence following two particular actions by the authority under its legislation. Of course, the families of those killed in the Lockhart River tragedy will continue to wonder whether their loved ones would have been saved had CASA acted more expeditiously in relation to matters that were drawn to its attention over a long period of time—matters which seem to go to the very fundamentals of the safety of the operation of that organisation.
There have also been concerns expressed about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s performance in the minister’s own state, Western Australia. There has been at least one instance—but I believe there could have been more—where a coroner has made very critical comment about the performance of the authority in relation to a fatality: for example, where the authority approved the manufacture of an aircraft part inappropriately and that aircraft part, according to the coroner, led to a crash and a fatality. The performance of the authority has been good in some areas. I think, overall, the opposition’s view is that its performance nationally has been quite patchy.
There have also been concerns expressed from the state of Western Australia, in particular, about the way that officers of CASA have used their authority to pursue, if not persecute, particular operators—matters which have led to proceedings before administrative tribunals and, I believe, the Federal Court. One particular case, which I will not put on the record now, ultimately saw the operator continue to operate because, frankly, in the operator’s view, he had pockets deep enough to continue to challenge the decisions, the processes and the practices of CASA in relation to his business.
Those concerns are matters which the opposition and I have raised in this chamber before. They are matters that the opposition will continue to pursue. We do hope that, in this new section of CASA that is being created to regulate airspace, the organisational culture being created can ensure that this area functions most efficiently, because there is one certainty in aviation regulation: if airspace is not regulated properly, the chance of incidents and accidents occurring is greater. That is something that the Australian travelling public will not countenance. That is something which will affect the credibility of aviation services in Australia and which will impact on Australians’ preparedness to travel. We will support this legislation, but we do so whilst having serious concerns about the performance of and the culture within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. We hope that can be improved; in government, we would certainly make sure it was.",SENATE,<title>AIRSPACE BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-03-20,"—In summing up this second reading debate, I am going to be very brief, given that we have only had a few speakers—though nonetheless very important speakers—on the subject of air safety. I would like to thank the senators for their contributions to the debate on the Airspace Bill 2006 and the Airspace (Consequentials and Other Measures) Bill 2006, which form an important part of the government’s approach to airspace reform. Transferring the airspace regulatory function from Airservices Australia to CASA will address a perceived conflict of interest, as set out by Senator O’Brien, between the service delivery function of Airservices Australia and its role as the airspace regulator—a very important distinction.
The world is a changing place, and these bills will ensure that Australia is in a position to take advantage of the benefits that new technologies currently offer. We are keen to do so in a way that is inclusive of stakeholders and allows them to understand and embrace those changes. The bills will ensure that airspace regulatory decisions made by CASA are consistent with government objectives, subject to the safety of air navigation. Future reform proposals are to be better backed by solid analysis, including cost, benefit and risk analyses. The safety of air navigation will continue to be the most important consideration—the overall priority, in fact. However, CASA will also need to embrace opportunities to enhance efficiency, access, environmental protection and national security without compromising that important objective of safety.
In closing, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport during their inquiry into these bills and thank them for their comprehensive and timely work. As the government wants to see the new airspace regulatory arrangements in place by 1 July of this year, it appreciates the prompt consideration of these bills and the additional opportunity provided by the committee’s work for the aviation industry to provide comment.
The committee made three recommendations in its report, primarily concerning the preparation and publication of airspace policy statements and the delegation of functions and powers under the bill. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has written to Senator Heffernan addressing each of these concerns. The government is committed to industry and stakeholder consultation in the preparation of all airspace policy statements. These statements will be publicly available via government online resources in addition to the tabling requirements provided for in the bill. Any delegation of powers and functions under the bill will be defined in regulations. I acknowledge the concerns that prompted the committee to recommend these amendments; however, I consider that the bill and the clear commitment from the government on stakeholder consultation provide satisfactory mechanisms to address these concerns. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I rise today to speak on the government’s amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, more commonly known as the AML-CTF Act. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007 represents another step in the long and painful process that only last year resulted in the passage of the act itself. Once again, we see more evidence of the government’s lax approach to this critical area of Australian security. The government has tried to talk tough on protecting Australia, yet its actions let us down again. Before I begin, I would like to make clear that Labor supports this bill. In fact, it was Labor’s efforts in highlighting the delays in this process that shamed the government into action on the anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing front. It is Labor’s support for business that ensures we arrive at a workable model. However, here we are again trying to correct the government’s legislative drafting errors in an act that is, in fact, still largely to take effect.
It must be pointed out that all of these amendments could have been dealt with last year when we were debating the bill that became the principal act, but the Howard government insisted on shunting the bill through the parliament without it even being corrected. It is no wonder that the Howard government has become the master of red tape. It is a government that operates at only two speeds: legacy and panic. After the passage of this bill, the AML-CTF Act will accumulate another layer of unwieldy complexity. We will have an act, an amending act, a set of regulations, a set of rules, and no doubt there will be guidelines somewhere as well. The bill before us will introduce a range of technical amendments to the AML-CTF Act. As I have already indicated, the act itself was only passed finally last year after what will, I am sure, be remembered by all as one of the longest and most drawn-out legislative processes in parliamentary history—subject, I think, to the native title legislation.
The impetus for the AML-CTF Act were the recommendations of the financial action task force, more commonly referred to as FATF. FATF is essentially an international cross-governmental body which sets out international standards for financial security to fight money laundering, and it updates these from time to time. The bill’s general provisions are contained in FATF’s 40 general recommendations. Since late 2001, FATF has also developed another set of recommendations relating to counter-terrorist financing. These were released in the wake of the September 11 attacks. All up, there are 40 general recommendations and nine special recommendations representing the international standard for financial security and the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. Let me be perfectly clear about how important these recommendations and standards are: they are fundamental to a coordinated fight against international crime and terrorism. The previous Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said as much in 2002 when he stated that criminals and terrorists will continue to take advantage of jurisdictions where the law enforcement and regulatory powers are the weakest.
Legislation to bring Australia into line with our international obligations was promised back in 2003. But, as I have already said, the previous minister’s actions and those of the government have not matched the rhetoric. For years, the government dithered and refused to bring legislation before parliament to bring Australia’s legislation in line with the international standards. If FATF provided the impetus, the government provided the inertia. In fact, in 2005 two international reports were released which slammed Australia’s tardy response. Firstly, the FATF country report found that under the Howard government Australia had met only 12 of the 40 general recommendations and not a single one of the nine special recommendations. Secondly, a department of the United States released a report in the same year which was also scathing of Australia’s response. Australia was labelled as a ‘major money-laundering country’ and ‘a country of primary concern’. In other words, the United States labelled the Howard government as a soft touch on money laundering and terrorist financing. The scathing international criticism of Australia had one advantage, however, because—combined with pressure from Labor—it finally started to convince the Howard government of the urgent need for reforms.
Still, the government’s response in late 2005 and through 2006 could best be described as a panic in slow motion. We saw the first raft of bandaid solutions in the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005. This introduced a few of the measures that were required to bring us closer to the international standards. The problem with these bandaid solutions, though, was that the Attorney-General’s Department failed to consult properly with affected industries. During the Senate committee’s inquiry, it was revealed that the government had not shown the final draft to industry. In fact, the affected industry and the government disagreed strongly on the critical question of the cost of the new arrangements. To little surprise, the industry had the better estimate of the cost. Before the bandaid solutions contained in the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 had even commenced operation, the government was forced to go back and revise it. It was forced to do this because, and here I quote directly from the explanatory memorandum of the bill:
If the amendment to restrict the application of Division 3A of Part 11 of the FTR Act to ADIs is not made, then certain legitimate non-bank money remitters assert that they could be put out of business.
The government was forced to concede that their own legislation had been so poorly drafted that it would have put people out of business had it actually come into force. This is the low standard of law making to which the Howard government has declined.
We finally saw the complete legislation at the end of last year, but even at the 11th hour the government was making last-minute alterations. The explanatory memoranda were written and withdrawn and new ones were released.
Finally, I would point out that, even after half a decade of delays, international criticism and bandaid solutions piled upon bandaid solutions, the legislation that was passed by parliament last year does not even contain the full complement of the recommendations. The government is still to bring forward a second tranche of reforms to finally bring Australia into line with our international obligations. But I will not be holding my breath. Without the implementation of the full range of recommendations, you have what is at best a maginot line—that is, a wall of seemingly impregnable defences that might look threatening but can be circumnavigated with surprising ease.
—You do not circumnavigate land walls.
—The legislation that we have seen to date delivers only part of what is required. Senator Brandis, I see that you are here in the chamber today. I turn now to the bill before the Senate. This legislation continues the government’s piecemeal approach under which legislation is constructed in patchwork one fix at a time.
—I am just trying to patch up your cliches.
—Let us hope, Senator Brandis, that when you bring legislation to parliament you do not follow this outline. Before us today is the latest attempt from the government to patch up its money-laundering regime. But if you do, Senator Brandis, I will be here looking.
The bill makes a number of changes, the most significant of which I will quickly address. The substantive amendments to the bill extend the operation of the AML-CTF Act to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS. It effectively gives ASIS the same access to AUSTRAC information that ASIO has. In Labor’s view, this is a sensible amendment which will give Australia’s chief foreign intelligence agency the same access to information that Australia’s chief domestic intelligence agency has. There does not seem to Labor to be any reason not to extend the availability of AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence. Labor is in support of the general principle that our intelligence agencies should have access, provided civil liberties are adequately protected.
In this case, ASIS is governed by the Intelligence Services Act 2001, which provides a range of safeguards and oversight mechanisms for ASIS. There is also a raft of amendments to improve the technical operation of the act. For instance, the bill will clarify that signatories to a range of types of accounts, rather than simply the holder of the account—as provided for under the current legislation—fall under the aegis of the legislation. Similarly, exemptions from certain obligations under the act are extended to merchant terminals. There appears to be a drafting error in the act because the term ‘merchant terminal’ is not defined, although we can glean from the explanatory memorandum that it is intended to refer to EFTPOS and like services, but it is not defined. I ask the minister responsible—and I am sure the advisers will take note—whether, in his summing-up, he could indicate whether ‘merchant terminals’ was intentionally meant to be read on the plain words or whether an actual definition is required, and whether the government has taken into account the possible impact of technological changes in this area.
Before I conclude, I would like to address the government’s response to a range of recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which examined what is now the principal AML-CTF Act. The government has agreed to a number of recommendations that were made by the committee and, in some instances, has gone further. Labor welcomes these improvements. Unfortunately, a range of recommendations were not adopted by the government but should have been.
I foreshadow that Labor will, again, be moving amendments in the Senate to improve the AML-CTF Act. Firstly, I turn to recommendation 4 in the committee report. This recommendation stated that clause 6(7) be deleted from the bill. Briefly, this is a matter that has obviously been aired before. That clause is a Henry VIII clause, a clause which allows regulations to alter legislation. Clause 6(7) would allow the government, by regulation, to expand the range of products and services to which the act applies. In effect, the government would be able to expand this piece of legislation to include any financial service it wished. Indeed, this is precisely the government’s argument for its retention. Labor does not agree and believes it is unacceptable.
If there is a need to alter the legislation then the bill should be brought before parliament and the legislation should be altered in that way. The government, in its response, indicated that these provisions were necessary and gave a commitment that it would not use the power to expand the legislation to include services that were intended to be dealt with in the second tranche of the legislation. But this is beside the point.
Whether or not the government intends to expand the operation of the legislation to include tranche 2 services, it still intends to retain the power to expand the legislation to any service it wishes by executive fiat and without adequate parliamentary oversight. Labor does not believe this is acceptable, and I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in line with the committee’s recommendations.
The committee made the further recommendation, recommendation 5, that the CEO of AUSTRAC be given the power to deregister or refuse registration to an organisation which is seeking registration as a designated remittance service. The government rejected this with the reasoning that registration did not confer any status on designated remittance providers and existed solely to locate and identify remittance providers. Again, I believe this response from the government missed the point. Quite simply, if there is a repeat offender then the CEO of AUSTRAC, as a regulator, should have the power to refuse to allow that organisation to operate as a designated service provider or to deregister it. Again, I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in line with that recommendation.
Recommendation 1 was a recommendation by me and my Labor colleagues on the committee which went to the oversight of AUSTRAC by the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, or ACLEI. Currently, there is no oversight by ACLEI because the government claims it is not required at this stage. This is despite AUSTRAC’s new role as a regulator. Given that AUSTRAC, for the very first time, now holds powers both as a regulator and as a law enforcement intelligence collector, to leave it without effective oversight is not acceptable. Labor will be calling on the government to rethink its position on this recommendation, and I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in the Senate to give ACLEI oversight of AUSTRAC.
To conclude, we are yet again correcting mistakes in important national security legislation. At some point you have to ask: when will the Howard government get the legislation right? The previous Minister for Justice and Customs liked to talk about security as a work in progress, yet in a large part much of the progress seems to be fixing up the government’s own mistakes. Have no doubt: sloppy legislation is a threat to national security. We have already had parliament recalled to specifically change the drafting of a single word. It is my hope that both the new Minister for Justice and Customs and the current Attorney-General will wake up to this government’s past failings and lift its performance.
Notwithstanding the outstanding problems, as I have said in my opening, Labor will support this bill as the amendments contained within it are appropriate and ones with which we agree. In addition, as I have foreshadowed, we will move amendments to improve both the bill and the act, but I reiterate Labor’s support and commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-20,"— The shadow Attorney-General has put the case very clearly with respect to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007—that is, the bill is still part of a process to which, regrettably, the government has had to be pushed. There are areas where the government has acted promptly and well, such as Corporations Law and laws to better advance corporate governance. But there are other areas where it has not done anything at all and, in fact, has moved backwards—for instance, political governance. In the area of anti-money laundering, the Labor Party indicated that it had put the government under considerable scrutiny with respect to its very slow progress—so too did the Democrats. In my portfolio responsibility, I argued the case many times for the advancement of counter-money laundering measures and questioned the responsible minister on the matter. This is one of those cases where we have to be thankful for the existence of vigorous foreign organisations and bodies, supported by foreign governments, which are very anxious for Australia to catch up in this area. That time line has been outlined by the shadow minister.
The second area that the shadow minister has covered successfully is that of continuing concern about the provisions within the legislation itself. I note with some approval that amendments which were previously put to the substantial bill and which failed are to be put again by Labor. These amendments will again attract the support of the Democrats because they are necessary.
I noted with mild amusement the shadow minister’s historical reference to the maginot line. I expected him to then start quoting Sun Tzu, Clauswitz or even Shaka Zulu—all of whom were quite expert on the issue of frontal versus flanking attacks. I think all three came to the conclusion that a flanking attack was often more effective than a frontal attack and that a frontal attack should only be used when the other side would be surprised by it. Maybe an analogy in politics might be apposite. I tend to see far too many frontal attacks in politics, and I would suggest flanking attacks might be as effective in politics as in war.
Returning to the bill—and moving away from an indulgence—it makes technical amendments to seven acts. Those seven acts include the substantive act, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Act 2006 and its companion act, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2006, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Financial Transaction Reports Act, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and the Security Act and the Surveillance Devices Act. It is not an omnibus bill. It is just a sign that when you are making a series of technical amendments to a piece of legislation which has tentacles into other areas of responsibility, you are going to have to amend a number of acts.
The legislation does take into account—and the government is to be congratulated on this—concerns raised by reports of both the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Some of the amendments before us address concerns raised by the Democrats, Senate committees and Senate colleagues last year. In particular, the bill addresses the issue of absolute liability rather than strict liability and moves down the scale somewhat, at the request of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, from absolute liability to strict liability provisions. Amendments also address the issue of the merits review, AUSTRAC Chief Executive Officer decisions and the right to apply to the Federal Court. Like ASIO, ASIS is also going to be made a designated agency, granting its officials access to AUSTRAC information. Further technical amendments will enable intelligence agencies to fulfil their functions under legislation and consequential technical amendments.
The amendments in the bill address the concerns of several stakeholders both in the public policy field and in the political field. What remains are concerns about how the act and the amended act will operate and how effective this legislation will be at counteracting money laundering. As I have emphasised when I have addressed this matter before, in that regard this legislation is as important to tax integrity issues and the health of our economy and society as it is to the concerns surrounding terrorism.
The other point with respect to how this bill will operate is privacy concerns—whether in the proper exercise of this policy there will be transgressions in privacy matters which we might end up regretting or which might upset members of the community. Any government needs to watch that with care and react to it with sympathy and understanding if, indeed, the legislation is found to go further in its practice than it was intended.
When introducing the bill into the House of Representatives the Attorney-General did note that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had raised concerns about the application of absolute liability rather than strict liability to some elements of offences under many sections in the act. The Minister for Justice and Customs, a former member of that committee, did undertake to amend these sections to replace the application of absolute liability with strict liability. It is with some pleasure that I note that the new minister in that portfolio, who I congratulate on his promotion, was indeed recently a respected and valued member of the Senate scrutiny of bills committee. I look forward to as few transgressions of that committee’s reference as possible under a minister who is sensitive to those areas.
The question then is: what will be the Democrats’ attitude to this bill? Despite being cautious on privacy matters, we are nevertheless of the belief that an anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing act was an essential element in our criminal law and in our fight against these diseases that exist at large in international and domestic affairs. We are supportive of these amendments. We think though that regular review and regular oversight should be dedicated to this new act to ensure that its actual operation does not go further than its intention. I conclude by again indicating that it is our intention to support the Labor Party’s amendments.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-03-20,"—Australians value their privacy. They expect that if their government is to create new powers for Commonwealth agencies that will potentially violate their privacy, such changes are necessary and justified. Such an expectation is reflected in the history of government attempts to introduce a national ID card. First Labor’s Australia Card and now the Howard government’s access card have floundered after the failure of both governments to justify such intrusions into people’s human rights and privacy.
The changes outlined in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007 have been characterised by the government as technical amendments that have arisen out of further consultation regarding the controversial anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws. Whilst that is true for most aspects of the bill, it is not true in one important respect—this bill will, for the first time, give Australia’s overseas spy agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service or ASIS, access to the personal financial information held by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, or AUSTRAC. The government have not justified why they believe that this is necessary. They have said virtually nothing at all about the reasons why ASIS needs this unprecedented power.
As far as we know, the government have not raised this plan in discussions regarding the first round of money laundering bills that this piece of legislation is seeking to amend. There has been no Senate inquiry into this proposed change and there has been virtually no public discussion about this particular aspect of the changes. In fact the government are seeking to make what the Australian Greens consider to be a very significant change under the guise of a technical amendment. The Greens want to know: is it a technical amendment to allow ASIS access to the financial records of many Australians? Is it a technical amendment to allow ASIS access to the financial records of many Australian businesses? Is it a technical amendment to allow ASIS to access such records in secret? Is it a technical amendment to give ASIS a substantial and powerful new means to collect information on many Australians? The answer is that this is not just a technical amendment; this is a substantial and questionable new power being given to ASIS without the necessary safeguards and without reasons having been put forward as part of public debate.
AUSTRAC is Australia’s anti-money laundering regulator and specialist financial intelligence unit. It collects a wide range of financial information and regulates a risk based reporting regime that requires the finance industry to report on their customers where they believe that there is a risk of funding terrorism or money laundering. As such, it holds information on and has access to the financial dealings of large numbers of people, businesses and organisations in Australia. The Australian Greens accept that there may be cases where it might be justified to allow access to AUSTRAC information by ASIS—for example, ASIS may be involved in disrupting a terrorist effort—however, we believe that such access should be clearly limited by legislation and mediated through the domestic security and police agencies or a judicial authority. We do not accept that ASIS, Australia’s most secret intelligence organisation, should have such wide access as this bill would provide.
It is worth recalling exactly what ASIS is, what it does—or at least what we know about what it does—and some of its history so as to understand the concerns that the Australian Greens have about this particular aspect of this legislation. ASIS’s function is stated in the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The role of ASIS is defined as being: to collect foreign intelligence, not available by other means, which may impact on Australian interests; to distribute that intelligence to the government, including key policy departments and agencies; to undertake counterintelligence activities which protect Australian interests and initiatives; and to engage other intelligence and security services overseas in Australia’s national interests. According to the government in their reports they put out about the various different intelligence agencies that exist, ASIS is not a domestic law enforcement agency—it does not have a policing role; its job is to collect overseas intelligence. Like America’s CIA and Britain’s MI6, ASIS was born at the beginning of the Cold War in 1952. Its activities are so secret that it was not even publicly acknowledged until 1977, by the Fraser government. It has only been governed by legislation since 2001. So this is an organisation that came into effect in 1952 and was only governed by legislation for the first time in 2001.
At times ASIS has been mired in controversy, firstly for its role in the bloodletting following the 1965 military coup by Suharto in Indonesia, where it was alleged to have provided lists of names to death squads, and then for its work in Chile under the Pinochet regime. Its 1983 bungled hostage exercise in Melbourne’s Hilton Hotel left guests and employees being terrorised by ASIS members wearing masks and carrying machine guns. This, of course, caused an uproar at the time. Even the hotel manager was assaulted by ASIS officers. More recently, in 1993, ASIS attracted attention when former employees claimed that it was out of control and compiling dossiers on Australian citizens. A subsequent royal commission found these claims to be substantially unproven, although the foreign minister at the time, Gareth Evans, acknowledged that some files on Australians were being kept by ASIS.
In short, ASIS has had a chequered history in the eyes of the public, and the fact that people know little about this secretive organisation means that there are lingering concerns about its accountability activities. It is certainly assumed, and this is what the government tells us, that its job is to spy on overseas governments and organisations, not to spy on Australians. This was reflected in the original charter for the organisation established by the Menzies government, which expressly required ASIS to operate ‘outside Australian territory’.
Subsection 11(1) of the Intelligence Services Act also reflects this principle when it states that the functions of ASIS are:
... to be performed only in the interests of Australia’s national security, Australia’s foreign relations or Australia's national economic well-being and only to the extent that those matters are affected by the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia.
Concern over the privacy of Australians is also reflected in section 15 of the Intelligence Services Act, which has rules to protect the privacy of Australians. This section states that the foreign minister must make rules for ASIS regarding the communication and the retention of information concerning Australians and that the minister must ensure that the privacy of Australians is preserved as far as is consistent with the agency’s proper performance. Those rules, like almost everything else about ASIS, are secret, and the Greens are therefore rightly sceptical about the extent to which they can offer the protection that they are designed to offer.
Has Minister Downer, for example, ensured that ASIS is prevented from placing Australians under surveillance in their homes, not only now but when they travel overseas? Is ASIS able to keep files on Australian residents? What protections are there for Australian businesses? We just do not know, because the information and guidelines are not in the public realm. All of my comments are based on the little information we do have in the public realm about the activities of ASIS.
But the very existence of section 15 of the Intelligence Services Act does reflect the public concern that exists about ASIS’s operations in relation to Australians on Australia soil. With that in mind, is it legitimate to give ASIS open access to AUSTRAC’s records and information? The Greens say no, and that is why I will move, when we get to the committee stage of this legislation and amendment, to remove this power from the bill.
No doubt the government will claim that there is sufficient accountability in place from the under-resourced, understaffed Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. It will also say that ASIO already has this access, and that is absolutely correct. That is precisely the point. It is ASIO’s job to keep an eye on people in Australia; it is ASIS’s job to be our spy agency overseas. It is the AFP’s job to do the law enforcement, as the government points out in its publications. It is not ASIS’s job to do law enforcement. We have got a situation where ASIO and the AFP already have access to AUSTRAC. Law enforcement is the role of the AFP; it is explicitly outlined as not being the role of ASIS. Therefore people’s legitimate concerns, wanting to ensure that there are protections and that there is the capacity to scrutinise the financial transactions of Australians, are covered by the existing security organisations. The two I have mentioned out of 30 organisations that have access to the AUSTRAC information are covered by the existing legislation.
Why then should ASIS have access to the personal financial information of an enormous number of Australians and Australian businesses? It should be remembered that ASIS, as is proposed in this legislation, would have access to this information in secret. That is, any Australian or Australian business that had its privacy violated would not be informed about any violation of privacy. Their capacity, then, to complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security about any breaches of their privacy is at best a nice principle; it is unable to be put into practice because this legislation is specifically designed to allow these security agents in ASIS to have access to the information in secret—that is, without people knowing. They will not have the capacity to complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security because they will not know what interaction security organisations have had with them and their information.
The Greens argue that ASIS does not need this power. It was not proposed in the original piece of legislation. There is no evidence that it was raised in the Senate inquiry into the original piece of legislation or in any subsequent public comments by the government about this particular aspect of the bill. There is no evidence that they have been calling out for access to this information prior to the enactment of the legislation last year, or indeed since then. But we have a situation where the government is coming to the Senate and asking us to approve this change, this additional organisation having access to AUSTRAC records, without a rationale being put forward. It is a fair enough question to say: ‘Where is your argument? Let’s hear it.’ And I certainly would be appreciative if we were able to hear from the minister about what the argument is, because it has not been made at all to date.
I want to talk briefly about the other aspects of the bill, because the Greens support all of the other aspects of this bill, such as the removal of absolute liability offences and the capacity to review certain decisions of the AUSTRAC CEO. We believe that all the other aspects, the technical amendments, which are rightly in the bill—although we argued for the strict liability offences earlier—will go some small way to addressing the concerns regarding the operation of this whole financial reporting regime, which has been widely criticised by both the finance industry and legal and community groups during the passage of the original piece of legislation.
It is worth reviewing some of those concerns, as they underpin the view that the Greens have that this latest extension of these laws to encompass ASIS is flawed. The Greens had a number of concerns, which I articulated previously, about the original anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing laws that were passed in December of last year. I talked at the time about the way in which they radically changed the level and the sort of information that financial institutions were collecting on their customers and the manner in which this information would be used by national security agencies and police.
I think I described the legislation at that point as being designed to require banks to spy on their customers for the government. That was how it was being described at the time that the original piece of legislation was being dealt with. The Greens accept—and I said this at that time—that some information collected by financial institutions should be made available to government agencies when it relates to criminal behaviour, including terrorism and money laundering. But what we are dealing with here, with the extension to ASIS, does not relate to law enforcement in that area. The government has been quite clear and quite explicit in the little information it has provided about ASIS that it is not a law enforcement body; it does not have a policing role.
So the genuine issue that people want to ensure is not occurring—that is, the financing of terrorist organisations—is not within the purview of what we are told ASIS does. Of course, I am basing this on the limited information that is available—that is all we have got. Even in that, the government has been very explicit in saying that it is not a law enforcement agency, it is not involved in policing, it is not involved in spying on people in Australia; it is designed to spy on people overseas. The government has quite clearly defined the role that it has.
As I have said, we are quite happy to support sensible changes to the law to address the threat of terrorism, and we have done so. As I have also said, we are happy to support the other aspects of this piece of legislation. It is just the extension to grant ASIS access to this information that we have concerns about. And we have not heard anything at all—from the government, from ASIS, in any Senate inquiry, in public debate—about why there is this requirement to list another organisation as a designated authority. There are already 30 there. They include ASIO and the AFP. Why ASIS? It is a simple question. I hope that the minister will be able to address it in his remarks.
When we were dealing with the original piece of legislation I talked about the way in which the existing terrorism laws have led to innocent people having their accounts frozen and how some communities who support independence movements overseas—for example, the Tamils or the Kurds—face criminalisation of their legitimate activities. At the time I went through a range of examples: people like the gentleman in Melbourne who owned a record store called Shining Path who had all of his assets frozen and was not able to get government agencies to allow him access to his legitimate business. It was a record store; it just happened to be called Shining Path. Because of the name, shared by a Peruvian group, his funds were frozen.
There was another example at the time that we last mentioned this legislation of an Iranian woman who runs a number of restaurants. She was transferring funds for dates or whatever she was getting in for her restaurants, and she talked about having been treated as a criminal and as though she were funding terrorism. They were legitimate business activities that had been occurring in an ongoing nature. Because of the way the legislation is designed—so that it is up to the banks to manage the risk—and in exempting the banks from anti-discrimination legislation, as was done in the original legislation, you create a situation in which it is quite legitimate for them to say: ‘You have got an ethnic name. You are sending money to Iran. We are going to freeze your assets.’
So you have this woman who is an Iranian restaurant owner trying to get her dates sent in having her assets frozen. I have raised many times, in this chamber and in other forums, the possibility of this occurring, and it is precisely what we have seen happen. The laws have enabled the two examples that I quoted at the time—the record store owner and the Iranian woman running a restaurant—to occur. These are criticisms I have raised before about how broad the definition of terrorism is and that it does allow innocent people to be caught in the web. And it does not allow us to focus on the efforts that everyone agrees that we need to be focusing on. When we throw the net too wide, these are the reasons why we create problems.
Former Justice Merkel put it very precisely when he said:
The move to granting ever-expanding coercive power to the executive arms of state and federal governments, to be exercised behind closed doors and without public scrutiny, carries with it grave risks to the democratic values we are trying to defend.
He went on to say:
One must have serious concern as to whether the political hierarchy is deserving of the kind of trust and integrity that the public are entitled to expect of them in administering that power.
The Greens say that the granting to ASIS the power to access AUSTRAC’s financial information is too great a power to be exercised behind closed doors and away from scrutiny. It is far more than a mere technical change, despite the government’s claims. There is no clear need for this power, and the government has certainly not articulated one.
ASIO and the AFP can already do this. ASIS is the overseas spy agency. It is clear from its founding charter and its current legislation that its job is to spy on overseas governments and groups, not on Australians. The Australian people have not been consulted about this change. There has not been sufficient public debate or scrutiny. The Greens will not support ASIS having these powers without such a debate. Therefore, I ask senators, when we get to the committee stage of this legislation, to support the Greens amendment to remove this change from the bill. If the government want to push ahead with this change, they can bring in specific bill that relates to this when they have had the public debate and put forward the arguments and the reasons why this extension is needed. To date, they have failed to do so and, whilst we support the rest of this bill, we are not in a position to be able to support them on that aspect of it.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-03-20,"—I want to make a few comments on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007. Before I do, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the new Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Johnston. I do not think there is a more able and appropriate person to take on that role following Senator Ellison’s elevation into cabinet. I know Senator Johnston, with his background in law and as a very distinguished Western Australian, will carry out these very important duties as the justice and customs minister with great skill and style.
Justice and Customs is a portfolio where there is a considerable amount of activity in keeping Australia safe and keeping our citizens safe and secure both in Australia and overseas. Customs do a fabulous job. It is a very busy part of the portfolio for the minister. I know the minister, as a Western Australian, will relish the work of the Customs marine branch, with which I had quite a lot to do during my time as fisheries minister. The Customs marine branch do a fabulous job, and I know that Senator Johnston will take a very keen interest in the great work that they do, as well as the work that Customs generally do. They perform a fabulous job right around Australia and overseas. If you have been overseas and seen how Customs operates in any other country and then you have come back to Australia and seen what a tremendous job the Australian Customs people do for ordinary tourists coming in, you feel very proud to be Australian and to be part of a government that has built this culture within the Customs Service. While I am at it, I want to pay very high regard to the work of the former minister, Senator Ellison, with whom I have had a great many dealings in the past. Senator Ellison continued to perform his duties as the justice and customs minister in a particularly able way.
I just want to make a few comments. I did not come here to take issue with Senator Nettle on the Greens’ views of these issues, although—without wanting to get into the precise and particular debate—the Greens have strange views on many of the issues that most other Australians consider essential for our safety, welfare and security. I can refer to some of the things that Senator Nettle mentioned by reference to an issue I want to briefly raise in the Senate.
Earlier this year I was privileged to be part of a delegation of the Australian parliament to the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, which was held in Moscow. That forum consists of parliamentarians from the Asia-Pacific region. Should anyone be wondering why an Asia-Pacific forum would be held in Moscow, east Russia is on the Pacific, and it was suggested that Vladivostok would not have the facilities for the conference—hence we held it in freezing cold Moscow in the depths of winter.
One of the topics for discussion there was international terrorism and international crime. It became very clear in talking to other parliamentarians from all of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region that one of the real problems confronting law enforcement and security agencies around the world was the transnational nature of crime and terrorism. Crime and terrorism only exist because they have the money to operate. Limiting the financing of terrorists and terrorism organisations and of organised crime gangs depends on trying to cut off the money supply to these organisations. The committee which I chair, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, has just completed an inquiry into amphetamines and other synthetic drugs. In the course of that inquiry as well it became known to those on the committee that drugs were a major source of financing for international crime and international terrorism.
Senator Nettle asks: why is ASIS involved? I thought the second reading speech made it very clear, and I am sure the minister will also address the issue in his summing up. One of the purposes of the legislation is to allow the Director-General of ASIS to communicate AUSTRAC information to foreign intelligence agencies and agencies right around the world that are concerned with the international trafficking of money, and the arms and drugs that money can buy. They need a bit of coordination.
One thing that came out of my committee’s inquiry was the ridiculous situation in Australia where we have seven different states and territories, each with different laws and boundaries, and all the law enforcement agencies of those states and territories, and indeed the Commonwealth, have to abide by the laws that apply within these artificial lines on a map, and yet the criminals have no such constraint. The criminals can slip across the borders and conduct criminal activities in any state or in more than one state. It is very difficult for the law enforcement agencies to get criminals in one state, because they might have done some things in other states. I was appalled to hear of the difficulties the law enforcement agencies had because of the different styles of legislation in each state, the different nuances of the criminal enforcement activities and the different way courts in each state interpret the law. We give a free kick to organised crime within Australia by not having laws that are uniformly applied.
I know a lot of work has been done. Congratulations to Senator Ellison for bringing the states’ police ministers together to try and do something about that; I know a lot of good work has been done. But it seems inconceivable to me that in this day and age the states would still jealously guard particular criminal laws that are different from those of other states not five kilometres across the border, so to speak. The sooner we can take a national approach—certainly we do to money laundering—to the laws that currently constrain our law enforcement agencies, the better Australia will be. More directly aligned to this bill, we need to have that same flexibility in sharing information with agencies around the world which are, as our agencies are, engaged in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
I think this bill before the Senate tonight attempts to make it easier for the law enforcement agencies around Australia to deal with terrorism and organised crime. It is part of an ongoing approach by the Howard government to try and ensure the safety and security of all Australians by acting in a way favourable to the law enforcement agencies not only in Australia but overseas where that overseas activity impacts on the security and safety of Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Troeth)—Before you rise to speak, Minister Johnston, I also congratulate you from the chair on your elevation to the ministry. It is very well deserved after all your hard work in the parliament since your entry.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-03-20,"—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, for those very kind words. In summing up this second reading debate, I want to take up a few points before I generalise about this important bill. This is a very complex matrix of terms, provisions, clauses and approaches to what is a very versatile, robust, innovative financial system in Australia. We have some of the world’s most efficient financial agencies in the nature of banks, building societies and other financial institutions that are continually evolving modes and methods of dealing with large sums of money and moving them around the country. The object of this legislation is to accurately obtain data and analysis of what is happening with those large sums of money being moved around. We have the amendment bill of 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007. The amendment bill of 2007, of course, is largely only technical in nature and has for some time been foreshadowed.
Senator Ludwig made some points with respect to the amending regulations regarding clause 6.7. The reason the legislation has what is called a Henry VIII clause is because the financial institutions which I have spoken of have disclosed a capacity to make ready and quick alterations to their processes such that they can avoid the provisions of legislation of this place. I point to cash management trusts as being a very real example of what evolved in response to previous legislative requirements and frameworks. That is not to suggest they are doing anything wrong; they simply order their affairs in an expeditious and convenient way to include a minimal amount of reporting and inconvenience. That is their wont and that is what they are very likely to do. Having the provisions as we do enables us to respond quickly to close off that avenue before a hole in the database collection methodology occurs.
Senator Ludwig also raised the Department of State’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. I want to make the point that all of what he said was, with some great respect to him, misconceived. The report assesses the level of risk of money laundering rather than the effectiveness of the country’s response. Given that we are a sovereign nation with a high-valued currency and a reliable reporting and electronic transfer system, the risk underlying money laundering in this country is very high. That is the point the report makes—and I think the report well makes the point. The onus upon the legislators, namely the government, is to make sure that we provide a robust, foolproof, reliable system of keeping track of what is going on with respect to the movement of large sums of money.
Turning to summarising where we are with respect to this legislation, the reforms implemented by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2006 strike an important and appropriate balance between the government’s law enforcement and national security objectives on the one hand, which are of course a very important priority for this government, and the needs and operational reality for business on the other as well as the need to maintain a relatively low-cost, viable, workable regime for financial institutions.
This amendment bill should come as no surprise. In the speech and reply during the debate on those bills in December 2006, my friend and colleague Senator Ellison—and, of course, I endorse the remarks of Senator Ian Macdonald, as Senator Ellison did a magnificent job in the position that I now occupy—foreshadowed that he would introduce a technical amendments bill in the 2007 autumn parliamentary sittings to address the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This course was adopted, as the recommendations of those committees were made only a short time before the second reading debate in the Senate. Amendments caused by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007 address some of those issues raised by these committees as well as some other relatively minor technical matters. I emphasise that this is a technical matrix of provisions that has been very carefully and thoroughly reviewed.
The opposition know the importance of the anti-money laundering legislative package in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The opposition have acknowledged the significance of the legislation and, in debate in the House of Representatives on this amendment bill, supported amendments such as the one that will allow ASIS access to AUSTRAC information. In spite of their general agreement on the policy, the opposition have chosen to use this debate to reiterate the same criticisms raised in the debates on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006. In fact, in the House of Representatives debate on 28 February this year, the notice of motion for the amendment bill, moved by the honourable member for Brisbane, Mr Bevis, was effectively the same as the notice of motion he moved during the debate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Billin the House of Representativeson 28 November 2006.
The opposition alleges on the one hand that the process has been too slow and in the next breath that there was not enough consultation. The facts are that the government has undertaken extensive consultation, and this process has taken time. Indeed the bill and the committee’s report acknowledge the inordinate amount of consultation because, effectively, this legislation does require a substantial degree of cooperation from financial institutions. That is not to say that it does not have enforcement provisions, but the best way to go with legislation such as this—and I am sure Senator Ludwig understands this—is to have a degree of cooperation from financial institutions.
I reject the suggestion that the government has taken too long to implement the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. These important reforms respond to increased and more sophisticated criminal and terrorist activity across a wide range of sectors delivering complex products and services. The need for thorough deliberation of these issues can be illustrated by the progress of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. Following its adoption of the revised 40 recommendations in June 2003 and the finalisation of the nine special recommendations on terrorist financing in October 2004, the FATF has moved carefully to develop interpretative notes and guidelines. The last of these interpretative notes was released in February 2006.
Given the importance and the complexity of the issues involved, the government has moved with appropriate speed to introduce comprehensive, well thought out legislation. I do emphasise that it is comprehensive and it is complex. The breadth and responsiveness of the consultation process has been widely acknowledged and applauded by affected businesses. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has also acknowledged these consultation efforts. The government does not apologise for the time spent in achieving this balance and limiting the burden on Australian business. This has been time well spent. The ultimate objective will be one that hopefully generations in Australia will appreciate as we continue to maintain a very strong fight against money laundering and terrorism financing.
An important element in the success of the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing is the collaborative approach between government and business stakeholders. I thank industry for their contributions throughout the consultation process on this bill and on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. This cooperation continues as various obligations of the act are implemented and various rules under the act are finalised. The financial and gaming sectors are to be commended for their commitment to the important goal of fortifying the Australian financial sector against money launderers and those who would seek to use the Australian financial sector to fund terrorism. As I have said, it is a very internationally renowned reliable sector that provides high-value currency and efficiency. Accordingly, we must make it robust against the threat of money laundering and terrorism financing.
I thank the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The work of these committees was carefully considered when preparing the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007. I have pleasure in commending this bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-03-20,"—I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment Bill 2006. Labor want to see native title claims resolved quickly, effectively and fairly. This is manifestly in the interests of all parties, and we support reasonable and effective measures to assist this. Unfortunately it has not been happening. The current situation is far from adequate. While 91 claims have been resolved, more than 600 remain unresolved. Claims are taking, on average, six years to resolve. All sides to this debate can agree that this is an unsatisfactory situation and in need of improvement.The question remains as to whether this legislation before the Senate contributes towards the goal of improving both the effectiveness and efficiency of this legislation—that is, will the Native Title Amendment Bill 2006 make a difference? It is my concern that this bill will generate uncertainty for native title claims and for development. It will undermine the capacity of native title representative bodies to represent Indigenous interests.
The primary purpose of this bill is to amend the Native Title Act to implement aspects of four of the six elements of that package. The bill is expressed in terms of four schedules. I will turn to each of those schedules and make some observations about each of them. Before I start that, I foreshadow that Labor will move substantial amendments to the bill to seek to fix it. Our opposition to schedules 1 and 2 of the bill reflects the widespread views of stakeholders. The native title representative bodies unanimously oppose the bill. The Federal Court has expressed serious concerns with substantial portions of the bill. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner rejects most of it, and the Western Australian state government and mineral councils have also expressed concern. I foreshadow that Labor will move amendments in opposition to schedules 1 and 2.
Turning to the committee report, while I respect the work of the committee on this bill, as noted in the minority report the report does not go nearly far enough in relation to a number of fundamentally flawed areas in the bill. I will touch upon each of those in a moment, but the problem goes to the very heart of the bill. This bill is, as it stands, a seriously flawed piece of legislation. It will not reduce red tape and it will not save taxpayers money. It will instead continue the uncertainty and delay that plague both industry and the Indigenous community. If anything, the changes being introduced will exacerbate the problems that currently exist.
I turn to schedule 1. At the heart of the first schedule are very substantial alterations to the operation of native title representative bodies, or NTRBs. The bill makes a range of modifications to the regime under which they operate and the regime under which they are recognised. The current scheme of recognition works this way: once an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation is recognised as an NTRB, it remains recognised until it ceases to exist. The body requests withdrawal or the minister withdraws recognition, which the minister may do upon satisfaction of certain legislative criteria. Schedule 1 will alter the scheme in a number of ways, and I want to touch upon a couple of major ways in which it alters the scheme. First is the introduction of periodic terms applying to the recognised status of NTRBs, with those periods to range between one and six years. Second, the first schedule also broadens those native title service providers which can be recognised. This broadening could easily lead to the government performing an open tender and bringing in non-Indigenous law firms. It was indicated in a briefing to my colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson, the former shadow Attorney-General, that this is not the government’s intention. Nonetheless, that is the way the legislation is drafted, and it leaves the door open for the future. Third, the changes in the first schedule would reduce the amount of notice of closure the minister is required to give an NTRB from 90 days to 60 days. Fourth, the changes would allow for the minister to unilaterally alter the areas of the representative bodies. Finally, the changes in schedule 1 would remove the requirement that NTRBs present annual reports to parliament.
There are also changes in relation to the use of legislative instruments in relation to recognition and withdrawal of recognition. I will turn to those changes in a moment, but I also want to comment on schedule 2. Schedule 2 acts primarily to expand the power and role of the National Native Title Tribunal. This feeds off concerns expressed by stakeholders about the role of the tribunal being slow and overly bureaucratic. I will come back to this.
I can perhaps deal with schedules 3 and 4 quickly. I note that both of these schedules appear, in my view, to be largely uncontroversial and can be supported. Schedule 3 deals with prescribed body corporate amendments and schedule 4 contains provisions for assistance for nonclaimants and other measures designed to encourage negotiation over litigation. They can be supported for that aim.
Coming back to schedule 1, Labor has a range of concerns with this schedule, and in the time available it is necessary to deal at some length with those changes. Firstly, as I noted above, one area of concern has been the length of time for which a representative body is recognised. The proposed bill provides that the period of recognition for a representative body would be between one and six years. Discretion would be given to the minister to stipulate a period of recognition between one and six years for each body.
These changes are unnecessary and will introduce uncertainty into the process. This is not only said by Labor; it is criticism which has been levelled at the legislation by a range of bodies. The Minerals Council of Australia, for instance, proposed that the period of recognition be raised to at least three years. Others have also commented on this issue, arguing that it is impractical from the point of view of capacity building, corporate knowledge and long-term planning. Clearly, there is still significant argument about how beneficial this provision would be. It is still being argued about whether two years should be a minimum or whether capacity building, corporate knowledge and long-term planning can be undertaken if periods less than that which is otherwise provided for in the legislation are granted to the minister to use at their discretion.
The point we have now reached is where the government is seeking to broaden the ability of the minister to have discretion on those points. But is that going to be beneficial? The people within industry do not see that. The National Native Title Council also outlined a range of similar concerns. It is already the case that the minister is able to draw status recognition if a body is under-performing. Periodic terms of recognition will destabilise negotiations with third parties and create uncertainty around developmental proposals, discourage already fragile staff tenure and the build-up of corporate knowledge, inhibit strategic business planning and the liquidity of these organisations, and probably increase infrastructure costs so that they cannot be spread out over the period. One-year periodic terms are inconsistent with the spirit of reducing red tape. I also note that these organisations are representative institutions; they ought to be improved in quality and capacity rather than disbanded.
The Senate committee examined this issue and came to the conclusion that the proposal for the terms of recognition would militate against the effectiveness of the NTRBs. The government’s legislation would make the NTRBs less, not more, effective. The Senate committee recommended that the minimum term be increased to two years. This is not sufficient. The length of recognition is a serious problem with the bill, and it will not be solved by the minor tweaking recommended by the report. This section is not conducive to the effective operation of NTRBs. It will not allow long-term planning and the accumulation of corporate knowledge. It is clearly unnecessary and it does not fulfil the central requirement of keeping red tape to a minimum and keeping the waste of taxpayers’ funding to a minimum—if there is at all to be waste.
Another area which I touched upon was the process of derecognition, the use of legislative instruments to accomplish that, and the limiting of the time frame in which NTRBs are entitled to respond to a withdrawal notice. The standard time frame in which representative bodies are required to respond to such a notice has been shortened from 90 days to 60 days, and the references in the current act to the need for a representative body to satisfactorily represent the native title holders and consult effectively with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have generally been abandoned in favour of a shorter formulation focusing on whether the representative body is satisfactorily performing its functions. The practical effect of this is that that there will be very little time in which an NTRB has to consult and formulate a response to the notice as the period of time has been reduced. Again, this will not assist in the provision of effective administration of these bodies. In fact, it is more likely to do the opposite.
The next area of concern is the fact that the minister is able, after due consultation and consideration—whatever that might mean—to unilaterally extend or vary the area of a representative body. While the minister is required to consult before making these changes, there is no requirement that the views of the relevant representative bodies be a concluding feature of the matter, which is also the subject of some controversy. The changes that would allow the unilateral variation of the area of representative bodies was vigorously opposed by a range of submissions, as noted in the committee report. Firstly, I note the opposition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner on this point, with the committee report indicating that the commissioner opposed these amendments and suggested that the criteria of effective consultation and satisfactory representation should be retained. Similarly, the Native Title Tribunal Council pointed out that the boundaries reflected cultural groupings rather than being an administrative convenience.
In summing up, I would also like to refer back to other problems with the schedule that Labor raised tonight, including that it is possible for non-Indigenous organisations to become NTRBs and that the annual reports will no longer need to be tabled in parliament. As I indicated earlier, the National Native Title Tribunal, the NNTT, is to be given new significant powers. The powers are contained in schedule 2 of the bill. This schedule would disallow the Federal Court to conduct mediation at the same time as the NNTT. The bill also gives three new powers to the NNTT: the power to make reports to certain persons regarding the failure by a party to act in good faith in mediation; the power to issue directions to parties to attend mediation or produce documents; and the power to conduct inquiries regarding a group’s connection to the area claimed.
Labor has concerns about whether these changes are going to help matters and result in the swifter and more efficient resolution of claims or whether they will result in more uncertainty and more delays. The minority report of the Senate committee noted:
During the inquiry, significant concerns were expressed about the expansion of the NNTT’s powers, particularly as most stakeholders do not have confidence in the NNTT’s capacity or expertise to conduct effective mediation.
The minority report went on to note that NRTBs unanimously rejected the expansion of the mediator functions.
Further, the proposed bill would empower the NNTT to make reports about breaches of the good faith requirement to certain entities and to include details of alleged breaches by government parties in its annual report. It seems that there is no requirement under the legislation for the tribunal to advise and/or seek the views of parties considered to be in breach before the tribunal reports or publishes details of any alleged breach. It is recommended that the proposed provisions be amended to require the presiding NNTT member to advise a party if he or she considers they are not acting in good faith and give that party an opportunity to respond.
Further in relation to schedule 2 is the question of the power to investigate the connection that a group has to the area claimed. The Office of Native Title in Western Australia has stated:
The proposed amendments ... have the potential to undermine State and Territory government connection assessment processes, cause further delays in the resolution of native title claims and place increased pressure on an already limited pool of experts in the system.
It is understood that the main intent of the provisions is to facilitate the agreement of non-government third parties to proposed consent determinations where they are reluctant to accept the relevant state or territory government’s assessment that connection is met.
Despite participation in the proposed NNTT connection reviews being voluntary, native title parties could nevertheless use the provisions as a means of forum shopping if the state government considers that connection is not met, potentially undermining the transparent processes of state governments, such as those that Western Australia undertake. In addition, if claimants seek an NNTT review following a decision of the relevant government that connection is not satisfied, the resolution of the claim, whether by an agreed or litigated outcome that native title does not exist, will also be further delayed.
These amendments also anticipate that the NNTT will rely on consultants to conduct a review, which could further increase demand on an already limited pool of qualified experts, such as anthropologists. The Commonwealth Attorney-General’s recent comments acknowledge that the current shortage of anthropologists in the native title system is contributing to the delay in resolving native title claims. If the NNTT also seeks to rely on anthropologists in undertaking reviews of connection, the demands on anthropologists and the associated delay in resolving claims would be more than likely to increase. As I said earlier, schedules 3 and 4 are not controversial, and Labor does not oppose them.
In conclusion, Labor believes that the bill is ill-conceived and poorly drafted. It fundamentally fails to address the problems of the native title system; it will instead have the effect of exacerbating them even further.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-20,"—I speak on behalf of the Democrats on this legislation amending the native title law of Australia. It is, as has been detailed by Senator Ludwig, relatively complex in some aspects; it is, of course, a complex act. It is interesting to compare the focus and attention on the Native Title Amendment Bill 2006 now to the attention focused on amendments to the Native Title Act nine years ago in mid-1998 or, indeed, that focused on the debate that put in place the original Native Title Act a few years before that.
In some ways, it shows that the way native title has developed has been quite different from a lot of the frenzied concerns of the era, but it also shows some of the missed opportunities that have occurred over that period of time. Thinking back to the atmosphere at the time some of the major amendments were made in 1998, it seems almost bizarre that, another eight or so years later, these reasonably significant amendments to the Native Title Act are attracting so little attention and controversy in the wider community and indeed, to some extent, relatively moderate engagement from members of Indigenous communities around Australia. I think there are a range of different reasons for that which I will not go into now.
Before addressing the specifics of the bill, I think it is appropriate to start out by expressing my dismay at the way this parliament and previous parliaments and governments around the country have mishandled native title as an issue, both in terms of the content of the law and in presenting, explaining and promoting it or otherwise to the public. We have collectively squandered many opportunities that were presented by the historic High Court decisions in the Mabo and Wik cases. Those were opportunities not just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also for the entire Australian community. Many of those opportunities have, I fear, been lost—but not all. Whilst there have certainly been some positives to come out of native title law and native title decisions, there is still more potential there that will not be realised without positive and proactive action.
Given all of the drama of years gone by, it is curious that, when people talk about native title law now, the context and nature of the discussion is often about the nitty-gritty and the arcane aspects of the legal processes: the tribunal processes, representative bodies, prescribed bodies corporate and all of these sorts of things. It is presented as something complex, which it is; onerous, which it often is; and grinding, which it often is. It is generally seen as something difficult, painful, arduous, expensive, a lot of hassle and fairly traumatic—sometimes people wonder whether it is really worth all the bother. It is really quite sad to think of that being the way a lot of people perceive and engage with the native title system compared with the opportunities and dreams first presented by those High Court decisions and the original piece of legislation passed by this chamber back in 1993.
It is appropriate to remind ourselves of what native title actually represents as a concept and as a reality—not the Native Title Act per se, but native title and the existence of it. It represents the burying of the lie of terra nullius—the lie that Australia was an unoccupied land that could just be moved into and that the people who had lived here for millennia before that had no claim to it and no need for recognition. It also represents recognition of the fact that much of the cultures of Australia’s Indigenous peoples are still alive and of great value, meaning and significance. For that very reason, it presents still a golden opportunity for all Australians to recognise the extraordinary heritage we are privileged to have a connection to as residents of this continent. Indeed, I believe that, in many ways, native title presents as much as an opportunity for non-Indigenous Australians as it does for Australians with Indigenous heritage and ancestry. But it is an opportunity and potential that, on the whole, has not been realised and grasped. It is imperative that we revisit and remember the spirit of those early years of native title. We must continue to work to change attitudes and to make people recognise that those opportunities are still there but they need to be grasped—they will not just occur as a result of this grinding legalistic process that is represented by the act as it now operates.
Native title was represented by many in the community—including by some who knew that the reality was otherwise—as a major threat to many aspects of Australia’s society and economy. It is often still seen and sometimes still presented as a threat, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. At best, it is seen as a grinding hassle or a grudging paper recognition. But it is more than that, it has been more than that and it deserves to be far more than that again. That requires a change in attitude and a change in approach, and I am afraid that by and large this legislation before us does not provide that. There have been positive exceptions. There have been a number of very important claims that have been recognised. While the reality is that native title in the sense of land title is very much a residual right that does not present economic windfalls, it has been a vehicle for beneficial outcomes for some Indigenous peoples and communities in various parts of Australia and it presents opportunities on top of that.
A number of positive Indigenous land use agreements have come out in various ways as consequences of the existing process. There have also been some quite poor ones, of course. We have recently had the very positive example of the recognition of the claim of the Githabul people in the far north of northern New South Wales. In itself, the recognition of that native title does not instantly bring with it enormous amounts of money, but it brings with it potential for the future in that regard. Most importantly, it brings clear, unequivocal, official, formal recognition under the laws of Australia of a continuing ongoing connection to the land of Indigenous peoples which stretches back tens of thousands of years. Frankly, to me it is not just very important for those people whose connections to land have been recognised but very important for Australia as a whole to be able to say that we as a nation have part of our people those who have that connection—the oldest continuing living culture in the world today. Those are words that I hear now and then around the place. I do not think that the significance of them sinks in terribly often for Australians, but it is about time they did. That is an enormous and very valuable claim that we can make. It is one for all Australians, not just Indigenous ones, to celebrate and to make use of.
While there have been some positive exceptions, there has also been a lot of disappointment. Just on the other side of the border in the south-east corner of my own state of Queensland, that very same claim from the Githabul people has yet to be progressed and recognised. The border has no meaning for the Githabul people in terms of their traditional connection to land. Other longstanding attempts to get native title recognised in parts of the Gold Coast have made little progress. Indeed, the Quandamooka claim over Stradbroke Island just to the east of Brisbane, which showed such great potential that I recall making special mention of it in my first speech in this place nearly 10 years ago, has been largely frustrated since that time for a whole range of reasons. The missed opportunities there are very disappointing. While they still present themselves in some ways, the lost opportunities, the lost time and the trauma that has been involved in trying to reach resolutions in that regard have been very disappointing. I am not sheeting home all blame to governments, state and federal, but we all know how important leadership can be. If we had had strong, positive, consistent leadership from state governments then we would have advanced much further.
It has been interesting to see the shifts in some attitudes that have occurred. Indeed, in the Senate inquiry into this legislation, evidence that was presented from the Minerals Council of Australia and the Queensland Resources Council was supportive of giving more resources, more assistance and more capacity building to native title representative bodies and Indigenous people working within them. There has been a real shift forward by many—not all—mineral companies and mining bodies compared to 10 years ago, so there are opportunities there.
I believe that, through the processes that have led to this legislation, there have been some genuine attempts to try and improve some of the ways in which things operate at the moment. There is a lot of red tape and lots of starts, stops and expense. But I would have to say that the evidence presented to the Senate committee by those people who engage with this process and have a pretty good idea of what will work and what is not working was not very positive. It was not very positive about more power going to the tribunal; it was not very positive about some of the other mechanisms that are being put forward here. Frankly, while the committee made 10 recommendations that I hope the government picks up, I do not think that they go far enough to address the genuine concerns that were put forward. These were concerns put forward totally outside the context and the paradigm of the ideological battles of the past. They were simply put forward in the context of making this work better.
People recognise and accept native title now. You would not know it sometimes from some of the controversies that appear in the media every time that there is the prospect of a successful claim, such as the Nyungar claim in Western Australia, but there is an acceptance of it among many who work with native title, and people just want to make it work better. Aspects of this legislation may do that, but a lot of those people who work on this on a daily basis and who presented information to the inquiry suggest that aspects of it may, if anything, make it worse.
The Democrats have a number of amendments regarding that, which we will talk to when we get to the committee stage of this debate towards the end of this week. I hope that the government is open to some of those, because, regardless of the past history in this area, there is a genuine desire for the whole native title process to work better. It has achieved some positive outcomes, as I said. But the potential that was presented there initially has on the whole not been realised, and that is a real missed opportunity. A lot of that potential still exists, and I believe that we need to redouble our efforts not just in improving the law but in improving the capacity of and opportunities for Indigenous people—both through representative bodies and other organisations—to engage with this process and make it work better. We also have a responsibility to make the Australian community aware of the positive opportunities that native title presents.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2007-03-20,"—I stand here tonight with a heavy heart to address an institution that I hold most dear. By now, honourable senators are well aware of my transgressions of Senate reporting requirements which have led to my resignation from the Howard government’s ministry and which I am taking this first opportunity to confirm in the appropriate forum. Last Friday I corrected the Register of Senators’ Interests to include several dozen omissions from my assets holdings which should have been included both prior to and during my time as Minister for Ageing.
I am now confident that the register accurately reflects all of my assets both leading up to and during my time as minister and that my current statement is utterly complete. I am also currently in the process of engaging an independent auditor to scour my and my family’s records over the years since my appointment to the Senate to ensure that I am able to assure the Senate of a complete historical record of our assets.
Tonight I want to deliver the following assurances: despite some of the more convoluted allegations to which I have recently been subject, I can proudly assert that I have at no time acted with dishonesty, deceit or deliberate intent to withhold information from the Senate. Further to this, I can assure honourable senators that I have at no time held assets which have provided a conflict of interest in my role either as a minister or as a senator. This question will be put before the independent auditor, and I trust it will satisfy the curiosity and fears of my fellow senators. Nonetheless, I am aware that my omissions, which are purely the product of poor attention to compliance, have let down the government, my party and the reputation of the Senate. Consequently, I wish to unreservedly apologise to the Senate.
I hope my colleagues here will come to recognise this episode as a tragic blemish on an otherwise careful and committed parliamentary career during which I have held both the parliaments in which I have served in the public interest, which they represent, in the highest esteem. I believe everyone here is aware that my regard for the institutions of this nation lies at the centre of my political beliefs, and I have sought since I first became involved in politics to serve and to honour them. In this case I have, through my own fault, failed that goal. Once again, I apologise for that failure.
I am also most distressed that my failure to comply with reporting requirements has represented a distraction from the achievements of the Howard government. I am glad to be able to say that I have served as a minister in this government and that I can also count the Prime Minister as one of my oldest and dearest friends. Nonetheless, it is part of the current political environment where scrutiny is applied in only one direction and where we have reached an unprecedented double standard that my continued presence here presents an excuse for that double standard to be played out in the nation’s papers on a daily basis. So I have advised the Prime Minister tonight, and I here wish to advise the Senate, that I will shortly resign from this august institution. I will make that advice formal at the close of this current two-week sittings, giving both the Queensland Liberal Party and the Queensland parliament time to appoint my replacement before the Commonwealth parliament again meets.
I began tonight by saying that I stand here with a heavy heart. I am pleased to say that one thing which has lightened my mood over recent days is the remarkable gift of friendship. I would like to pay tribute to my family, colleagues and staff who have supported me and encouraged me to fight on. It is their support and friendship which makes this choice so difficult and so necessary. I look forward to the next two weeks. I look forward to advising the parliament once the audit of my records is complete, and I look forward to the re-election of this government.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ministerial Responsibility</title>,Adjournment,30,1,speech
