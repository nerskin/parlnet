"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-10-12,"—Senator Lundy asked me a question in question time about drugs in sport, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Sport and Tourism. I seek leave to incorporate my answer in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
.	 The Government and the Minister the Hon Jackie Kelly have on the Communities concerns regarding drugs in sport.
.	 For example, in May of this year, she launched the Tough on Drugs in Sport  strategy which clearly spells out a comprehensive set of measures to combat doping in sport.
.	 Reducing the illicit supply of drugs banned in sport is a key element of the strategy and the Government is already acting in this area. For example, on 13 September 1999, Senator Vanstone announced tough new restrictions on the import of EPO. Importation of EPO is now prohibited, except via permit.
.	 In addition, the Ministerial Council on Drugs Strategy and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General are currently looking at penalties across all jurisdictions, on the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of anabolic steroids.
.	 Also, the Australian Customs Service has deployed a range of strategies to combat the importation of prohibited drugs in Australia ahead of the Sydney 2000 Games. 

.	 The reason that almost 30 countries are enthusiastic about attending the International Drugs in Sport summit is that Australia is regarded as a world leader in the fight against drugs in sport. It is interesting to note that representatives from the Olympic Committees in a number of countries will be attending the summit as part of their country's delegation.
.	 The OAC has advised they have an issue about the appropriateness of attending as part of a Government delegation.
.	 They want to preserve their independence.
.	 The Federal Government has issued an invitation for the AOC to attend as part of a national team.
.	 I commend the initiative of Jackie Kelly in organising this international summit.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Drugs in Sport</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-10-12,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during this sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1999 SPRING SITTINGS
FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999
The proposed amendments implement key reforms to Commonwealth fisheries management legislation necessary to combat the increasing problem of illegal and unregulated foreign fishing. They include provision of a more effective forfeiture scheme against foreign fishers and a doubling of penalties. The amendments will also enable Australia to ratify an important international fisheries management agreement—the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks  (the UN Fish Stocks Agreement)—which will assist in combating illegal fishing. Implementing the Agreement is also vital to ensure the 
 sustainability of valuable fish stocks, such as Southern Bluefin Tuna, Orange Roughy and Patagonian Toothfish, on which our domestic industry relies, both within and outside the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ).
Reasons for Urgency
Illegal foreign fishing impacts on the sustainability of resources and adversely affects the Australian domestic fishing industry The fish stocks affected are high value species on which our domestic industry relies. Illegal fishing undermines the strict environmental controls imposed on Australian vessels fishing on the high seas, and the sustainable management measures taken within the AFZ.
Australia signed the UN Fish Stocks Agreement in December 1995 and there is increasing pressure from industry and conservation organisations to ratify and implement it. Twenty-three countries have already ratified the Agreement to date and it will come into force once the number reaches 30. It is understood that New Zealand will be in a position to ratify in November 1999, and a number of other countries are well advanced in the process towards ratification. Australia is recognised as a world leader in fisheries management and played an active role in negotiating the Agreement. Being an original party to the Agreement (in the first 30 countries) will ensure that our reputation as a leader in sustainable fisheries management is maintained.
The Government committed to ratifying the UN Fish Stocks Agreement in Australia's Oceans Policy, launched in December 1998. At the recent meeting of the Ministerial Council on Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Ministers endorsed proceeding towards ratification of the Agreement. The amendments are consistent with current Australian fisheries management and environment policy. Industry and the Commonwealth will benefit from expeditious implementation.
Based on consultation to date, there is general agreement amongst Government, industry and conservation groups that the benefits to be gained from implementing the Agreement far outweigh the costs. Extensive consultation with these groups will continue to occur on the practical implementation of the Agreement. This will enable increased understanding of the implications and costs and assist in minimising administrative complexity.
Without ratification Australia would not be in a position to authorise fishing on the high seas which would have adverse financial and operational impacts on industry. There would be negative implications for successful enforcement of Australian action against illegal foreign fishers.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-12,"—Before giving a notice of motion, I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to the notice.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. My statement relates to the return to order from Minister Newman. The minister was required to table a discussion paper at 3 p.m. 
 today. Whilst she tabled the terms of reference of her reference group, she indicated that she was not willing to table the discussion paper. She indicated that it would be tabled in the Senate when she provides it to the reference group and that she was still preparing the discussion paper for the reference group.
I would like to indicate prior to giving notice of this motion that, given I moved for the return to order, it was very clear that a discussion paper was prepared prior to the minister's National Press Club speech, and that was what the return to order related to. We are usually provided with a number of reasons by ministers when they choose not to comply with returns to order—which does not happen that often—which relate to commercial-in-confidence, legal advice and matters such as those. None of those reasons were put forward by the minister. The only possible reason could be one of political management, which is maybe what the government is concerned about. But, from the point of view of the parliament, we are here to scrutinise the actions of the executive and we have made an order of the Senate requiring this paper to be tabled. We cannot accept a duck-and-weave approach to debate on an important issue such as this. That is the reason I am proceeding with giving notice of this motion. Therefore, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
(1)	 That the Senate:
	 (a)	 censures the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman) for her contempt of the Senate in failing to comply with an order made on 30 September 1999, that a document, namely the welfare reform discussion paper originally prepared for her Press Club speech on 29 September 1999, and now being provided to the Minister's newly-established reference group on welfare reform, be tabled by 3 pm on 12 October 1999; and
	 (b)	 resolves that:
		 (i)	 the Minister purge the contempt in which she has held the Senate by tabling the document on or before 3 pm on 18 October 1999, 

		 (ii)	 if the document is not tabled by this time, the question on any motion moved by the Minister for:
			 (a)	 the introduction of any bill,
			 (b)	 the consideration of any stage of any bill, or
			 (c)	 in committee of the whole, any amendment or any request for amendment to any bill,
				 not be put until the Minister has undertaken to lay the document on the table, and
		 (iii)	 the Minister not be heard on any other matter relating to her activities as a minister.
(2)	 That this resolution remain in force until either the document is tabled or until the last sitting day of 1999, whichever is earlier.
(3)	 That, as the first item of business on the Monday of each sitting week, the Minister be required to make a statement to the Senate outlining whether she is intending to comply with the order and, if not, outlining her reasons, and a motion may be moved without notice to take note of the Minister's statement.
Senator Calvert, at the request of Senator Tierney, to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes:
	 (i)	 that on 30 September 1999, BHP shut down its steel smelting operations in Newcastle and case-managed the affected workers through its Jobs Pathways Program, and
	 (ii)	 that, as the global `knowledge' economy moves from the smokestack age to the information technology age, the Hunter region is one of the regions in Australia to spearhead that change and is set for a brighter future;
(b)	 commends the Howard Government for its pro-active role in acting as a `change leader' through the Prime Minister's Hunter Structural Assistance Package, which has generated some 804 direct jobs, with some further 4 000 indirect jobs to follow; and
(c)	 expresses its appreciation to the Australia Council for the Arts, for sponsoring, and the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation (Mr McGauran) for opening, the `Ribbons of Steel' exhibition, which celebrated, through art, the 84 years of steel making at Newcastle.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-12,"—I am pleased that the government has got itself organised over that side of the chamber. Senator Ian Campbell, I am looking forward to your contribution on the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998 , which I know you have followed very closely.
The government has made a lot of claims about this bill, but it will not admit that it will weaken existing regulations on prudential and fiduciary responsibilities of those involved in the governance of corporations. The bill will undermine rules designed to promote transparency, accountability and equity. It compromises market integrity. The opposition have considered this bill with an open mind. In arriving at our position, we believe that we have asked the right questions, including: do the propositions encourage managers to be accountable to shareholders through consultation and disclosure in a timely manner, do the 
 propositions help to define the role of the board of directors as active participants in the governance of the corporation, and do the propositions help to define shareholders' rights and treat all shareholders of the same class equally?
No doubt there are positive elements to this bill, such as the fundraising proposals and the revamp of the takeover panel, but the negatives outweigh the positives. There are substantial shortcomings to this bill. The opposition are particularly concerned with the proposals on business judgment rule, the mandatory bid rule, compulsory acquisition and accounting standards. We will move amendments to the bill in an endeavour to correct these faults.
The government asserts that current regulation and case law have created uncertainty in directors' responsibilities and liabilities, particularly in the area of directors' duty of care and diligence. It further claims that this uncertainty has constrained directors from fulfilling their duties to the best of their abilities. To address this alleged shortcoming, the government is proposing to establish the business judgment rule and other liability protection provisions, including the reliance on expert advice to give directors absolute defence from liability, but it is unclear from the evidence presented by the government whether the current regime has really constrained directors from fulfilling their duties to the best of their abilities or whether the proposals would lead to improved performance by the directors and their companies.
The opposition strongly disagrees with the government's view that case law has been unclear in this subject area. Few could dispute the facts that the courts' judgments have been fair and consistent. The courts have, in the main, exercised restraint and have avoided second-guessing directors' decisions. I therefore expect that the government's attempt in this regard will not add value and it will not deliver clarity; rather, it will add complexity to the current arrangements. Moreover, the proposals on directors' duties would water down directors' standards of responsibility. The government's proposals encourage directors to be careless, reckless and deceitful, to 
 the detriment of a company and its shareholders. These proposals are totally irresponsible and are designed purely to placate vested interests. The majority of Australian company directors would not benefit from these proposals. Those who would benefit are the directors who lack skill, who are irresponsible or who are dishonest. The government is sending the wrong message to the directors and to the market. Shareholders' interests and good corporate governance have been forgotten.
Supposedly as a counterbalance to the business judgment rule, the government is proposing something called the statutory derivative action. Basically, the statutory derivative action is about allowing shareholders to take court proceedings on behalf of a company should the board of that company fail to take the initiative. How this initiative provides a balance to the free rein granted to directors is beyond me. Nevertheless, the opposition consider the statutory derivative action proposal to be a positive step and we are supportive of it. We would like to make a slight improvement to it by allowing ASIC to apply for leave from the court to take a statutory derivative action. We consider that the proposed rule would be too onerous for certain individual investors to proceed. It is doubtful whether many shareholders would be able to meet the onerous requirement of applying for leave from the court to take action. The ineligibility of ASIC to apply for leave from the court is difficult to fathom. As the government created consumer protector, ASIC should rightly have such power.
Under the current takeover rule, a party seeking to launch a takeover must do so when the holdings in the target company are less than 20 per cent. There are a number of ways a bidder might undertake a takeover of a company. All are through transparent arrangements. The government, however, now seeks to allow takeover bidders the option of crossing the 20 per cent threshold in control and ownership of securities in a company before declaring its takeover intentions to the market. The government would require the bidder to announce to the market a mandatory unconditional takeover offer for the securities of the target company once it crosses the 20 per cent 
 threshold and for the offer to be at an amount at least equivalent to the highest price paid by the bidder in cash or non-cash transactions in the previous four months.
Despite these requirements, the mandatory bid rule would encourage bidders to lock up key blocks of shares before launching their takeover bid. Consequently, the bidder gets effective control of a target company before revealing its intentions, leaving competitive bidders and directors of target companies with limited opportunity to appropriately respond to the takeover bid. Discovery of fair prices would be restricted as there would no longer be an auction process. This would seriously disadvantage shareholders in target companies.
Also disturbing is the obvious inconsistency of this proposal with the Eggleston principles, principles of good corporate governance. The Eggleston principles require:
(i) (one) shareholders of a takeover target company know the identity of any person that proposes to acquire a substantial interest in the company;
(ii) (two) the target shareholders and directors have sufficient time to consider the offer;
(iii) (three) sufficient material is provided to them to make proper assessment of the offer; and
(iv) (four) all shareholders have equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of the takeover offer.
The mandatory bid rule breaks at least the first three principles, and maybe even the fourth. The government knows that the mandatory bid rule would go against these principles, principles on which the takeover panel would operate or base their deliberations. That is why the government has put forward, in its own amendment to the bill, that it would exempt the mandatory bid rule from being deemed an unacceptable circumstance by the takeover panel. This proposed exemption to unacceptable circumstance is reflected in the government's amendment to the bill, item 5, `panel provisions', section 602.
The government partly justifies its mandatory bid rule proposal on the experience of the UK. But the government fails to take account of the fact that, while the practice is permitted in the UK, it is not often used over there. The mandatory bid rule is not a major contributor to the UK's high level of takeover 
 activity. In any case, it is facile to expect that simply transplanting such a rule will have the same outcome or effect in Australia. The dynamics of the Australian stock market and takeovers are very different from those of the UK. Here every bidder will try to lock out its opponents at the first opportunity, to the detriment of other shareholders.
The only real benefit from this proposal would accrue to the bidder in terms of a lower price for the takeover as compared to a bid where there was an auction process. Moreover, those who have argued that Australian takeover activity is significantly less than that in the US and UK tend to underplay the various influences involved and the cyclical nature of takeovers. There has been little change in the takeover regime since the 1980s, but we have seen different levels of takeover activity. Takeover activity achieved significant highs in the 1980s, and Australia is now experiencing record levels of takeover. In between these peaks was effectively a valley of takeover activity.
These different levels of activity demonstrate that takeovers tend to be cyclical in nature and that the current rule on ownership threshold has not impeded takeover activity from reaching new highs. The rule on ownership threshold is not a significant factor in takeover decisions. It is extremely doubtful that the change proposed would stimulate takeover activity to any worthwhile extent. Rather, it would encourage takeovers by stealth, affecting the transparency of the market.
I acknowledge that there are valid economic efficiency arguments for increased takeover activities, but the mandatory bid proposal is not the solution to increasing takeover activity in Australia. More appropriately, changes to capital gains tax treatment of scrip for scrip takeovers would encourage greater takeover activity.
Still on takeovers, the government is proposing to extend the compulsory acquisition provisions to allow a 90 per cent majority shareholder in a company to compulsorily acquire the remaining 10 per cent of shares at any time. All that would be required is a notice of acquisition accompanied by an 
 independent expert's report qualifying the value of the remaining securities. I know that the government intends to make some amendments in this area, but the effect would ultimately be the same. The rights of minority shareholders would be subverted.
The government claims that the proposition is designed to remove so-called `greenmailers', but this concern over greenmailers is dubious. Simply, this proposal is about scrapping the rights of minority shareholders. Some have even described it as allowing a legal means to expropriate another person's property. Since this government has been encouraging more and more mum and dad shareholders, it is surprising that it is not making the appropriate efforts to ensure that the rights of shareholders, particularly minority shareholders, are protected. This government wants to make Australia a country of shareholders, but if mum and dad investors get in the way of the interests of big business then the government wants mum and dad shareholders to move aside.
In the Australian Financial Review on 30 September 1999, Dr Elizabeth Boros, at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Corporate Law and Securities Regulation, confirms the unfairness of the proposed process. Dr Boros is an expert in this field, and an independent. She is not aligned with anybody; she is simply commenting on the proposition. Dr Boros said:
It is one thing to bind a dissenting minority to accept a price for their securities which has been affirmatively accepted by substantial majority of departing shareholders. It is quite another to expropriate them at a price determined by an independent expert's valuation.
I am extremely disappointed, as I am sure a lot of individual shareholders are, that the Democrats will not be supporting the opposition's move to oppose the relevant compulsory acquisition proposal. The Democrats have offered, as a concession, which the opposition will support, for the independent valuer to be truly independent by having it appointed by ASIC but paid for by the takeover bidder. I am hoping that the Democrats are still moving that amendment, and I am looking forward to Senator Murray's contribution. 
The CLERP bill also seeks to revamp the takeover panel, based on the UK model. While we are supportive of the principle that a body could act in arbitration to settle takeover disputes as an alternative to the courts, we have some doubts about our ability to emulate the success of the UK's panel. Australia has a somewhat different business culture from that of Britain. Based on evidence provided to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, British corporations are less adversarial and less inclined to pursue litigation compared to their Australian counterparts.
It is because of these concerns that the opposition would support the government's amendments to their own bill on the takeover panel. We hope that these changes will boost the relevance and authority of the takeover panel in considering debates arising during a takeover process.
The fundraising provisions are among the more positive aspects to this bill, which are primarily designed to reduce the costs involved with capital raising, especially by small and medium sized enterprises. To reduce the costs of capital raising, the government has targeted costs tied up with the preparation and lodging of prospectuses.
The opposition is supportive of all but one of the proposals. We agree, for instance, with the proposal that a disclosure document would not be required if a person makes an unlimited number of personal offers of securities that result in securities being issued to 20 or fewer persons in a rolling one-year period with no more than $2 million being raised. However, it would be irresponsible for us to agree with the proposal which would allow licensed securities dealers to judge who would be defined as sophisticated investors—investors not requiring to have access to prospectus or disclosure documents—and allow such investors to invest less than $500,000.
This provision is inconsistent with other criteria, which define a sophisticated investor as having the appropriate resources to undertake its own investigation of a venture. We are opposed to the authority to be granted to licensed securities dealers because it may be abused or brought on by commission pres 
 sures. Should licensed securities dealers define mum and dad investors as sophisticated, they would give up their rights on receiving appropriate disclosure documents. Others argue that sanctions would exist to deter licensed securities dealers from misbehaving. But such measures tend to address events after the fact. Once mum and dad investors lose their money, they usually lose it for good. We will, therefore, oppose this particular provision.
On accounting standards, Australia has attained a high-level benchmark relative to many other countries. However, we must ensure that future steps continue to be positive. The virtues of high accounting standards may seem obvious, but there are many that do not diligently follow them and, as evidenced by this bill, the government or the Democrats have little understanding of them either. What the government is saying with this bill is that it does not have confidence in the job that the Australian Accounting Standards Board has performed to date. So it proposes to establish a body that would oversee its activities, a body that would control its priorities and business plan. The government wants to establish the Financial Reporting Council.
The government has asserted in its defence that the development of accounting standards has lacked appropriate business input. The opposition disputes this. What the government really means is that there is not enough business control over the development of accounting standards. It will now give them a mechanism to do this through the FRC. My concerns about the structure proposed by the government on accounting standard setting do not in any way disparage the quality, skill and objectivity of the first-round members of the FRC. But the government's proposition in regard to the FRC's relationship to the AASB is inappropriate and will be corrupted over time.
The opposition will move an amendment that would preserve the independent role of the AASB in setting accounting standards. The AASB has proven to have the necessary expertise in developing accounting standards and has proven to be unaffected by vested interests. To date, the AASB has played a 
 critical role in ensuring integrity in the information disclosed by companies. The government's proposal undermines the AASB's independence and puts at risk the reliability of the information provided by companies and businesses. A less than appropriate level of accounting standards will hamper efforts to promote disclosure and transparency.
Under a weak accounting regime, there would be greater opportunity to overstate profit levels, understate losses or treat asset values to a desired tax outcome. The opposition is also concerned with the government's current drafting of the provisions on harmonisation of Australian accounting standards with international standards. Experts in the field of accounting standard setting consider that the wording effectively commits Australia to one international standard, which is that of the IASC—the International Accounting Standards Committee. For those less familiar with the world of accounting standard setting, the IASC standards have yet to be accepted by the financial centres of the world. Indeed, the IASC standards are only one among other so-called international standards, which include the US GAAP.
Rushing head-on to take up one body of standards over another, while key economic partners consider this body less rigorous, is not entirely prudent. We will therefore put forward amendments that would clarify the intent or meaning of the international harmonisation of Australian accounting standards so that it would not mean the automatic take-up of standards developed by the IASC. Rather, we would prefer Australia to take up accounting standards which have undergone considerable debate and which have been accepted by key financial centres as accounting standards of appropriate credibility and integrity. It is important that, when Australia adopts new international standards, the standards are of the same, if not better, level of rigour to that currently operating, and that authorities take account of the needs of Australian companies raising capital in key financial centres across the globe.
Finally, we are concerned with the proposal to introduce formal cost-benefit analyses by 
 the AASB for every accounting standard proposed. There are difficulties involved with such a proposition for the standard setter in terms of the compliance costs as well as the technical aspects of determining indirect costs and benefits to the wider community or economy of a proposed standard. There is also a risk that this proposition would simply give business with purely short-term perspective some form of ammunition to discredit a standard when the longer-term benefits may be quite significant. The government has sold this bill to the public as the cure to the ills of the corporate sector. It brags that it is doing something to help out. But sometimes the medicine or cure may be worse than the problem, which the opposition believes to be the case with this bill or, in particular, certain proposals in it. We find it astounding that the government has been encouraging more and more mum and dad investors and shareholders but will do little to protect their rights.
Perhaps more disturbing is that the Democrats mostly support the government's and big businesses' views on the issues that undermine good corporate governance practices and subvert shareholders' rights. Why are the Democrats so keen to impress the government and big business? Well, the public's guess would be as good as mine. What is certain is that mum and dad shareholders cannot rely on the Democrats to protect their interests. The government has constructed a bill which relaxes corporate law and regulation to stimulate further business activity, but it ignores the fact that it is likely to stimulate activity of questionable merit. It would be far more appropriate and prudent to maintain rigorous regulation to engender investor confidence and market integrity.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-12,"—As Senator Conroy has just told the Senate, the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998  is another step along the way of setting up the sorts of laws that will enable the corporate sector to do two things: firstly, to produce the goods and services that we want and Australia needs and to do that in a way that is consistent with the community we live in; and, secondly, to produce income for the shareholders who own the company. What 
 we are dealing with, therefore, is legislation that impacts upon an institution, that institution being a corporation, which affects the community in a very big way—economically and socially. Because of that, this will by no means be the last piece of legislation to come into this area. There will be legislation after this; there has been lots of legislation before it.
There have been many court decisions over the years which have attempted to flesh out that law which should properly guide corporations in their relationships with society and society in it relationships with corporations. It is interesting to see in the explanatory memorandum some abbreviations which are available for people reading the explanatory memorandum. I read out these abbreviations as a means of illustrating the sorts of things that the Corporations Law deals with and the sorts of things that people in the community will become used to more and more. They help explain why there can never be an end to this legislation. Corporations is the sort of field where there will always be legislation and decisions needed. In the end, we are dealing with a vibrant organic society and a vibrant organic instrument within that society, namely, the corporations world.
Looking at these abbreviations, there is the AASB, the Australian Accounting Standards Board. Senator Conroy was talking about that shortly before he finished his speech. The ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, is there to help apply the law that the community says ought to apply to corporations and to ensure that the corporate world works well in terms of producing and also works well in terms of its moral standing. The ASX is the Australian Stock Exchange. People here would know what that is about. CLERP is the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program in respect of which legislation has been made and which legislation we are now discussing. The FRC is the Financial Reporting Council.
The IASC is the International Accounting Standards Committee. Senator Conroy spoke at some length about the different standards of accounting and what would be appropriate for Australia. `Law' is the Corporations Law 
 itself, a very thick piece of legislation in more than one volume, which indicates just how essential and important legislation in this field is. The OIS, is the Offer Information Statements.
The `Panel' is the Corporations and Securities Panel. Under this proposed legislation, the Corporations and Securities Panel is going to take over much of the work that was formerly done by the courts. As Senator Conroy said, there are some problems with the panel—whether that institution, which works very well in England, will work as well in Australia and whether taking away the jurisdiction of the court in the sense of doing more of the work that the courts used to do and taking away from the courts the ability to advance law as it ought to be advanced—bit by bit—will be a good thing.
The SMEs are the small and medium sized enterprises. What has to be remembered as we talk about this legislation is that we are talking about not only the international corporations, the big public corporations, but also the small and medium sized enterprises. They of course have different issues attached to them than do big international corporations. And the UIG is the Urgent Issues Group.
As Senator Conroy has said, there are four main issues being dealt with in this legislation in respect of company law. The first is set out in the explanatory memorandum on page 11 as directors' duties and corporate governance. The next is takeovers, where one company proposes to take over another, either in a friendly fashion where everybody is more or less in agreement or in a hostile fashion where one company uses its resources to take over from a board of directors a company which does not want to be taken over at all.
Fundraising is a very important issue, that is, the issue of how money is raised from people who might initially be outside the company to ensure that the company operates well. In this context, it talks about small business fundraising where the concern may not be as great as where public money is committed from outside in the way it is with public companies. So that is a big issue. And the last issue is accounting standards, which I have talked about a little already.
The issue of companies is central, as I have said before, to this society. That is perhaps best borne out in a book that I have referred to on other occasions in this place—originally written well over 50 years ago. It is called The Modern Corporation and Private Property, and I am looking at the revised edition by Adolf A. Berle and Gardiner C. Means. The thrusting force behind the thinking here is Adolf A. Berle. The original publication was in 1932.
The book traces the conceptual basis behind the development of the modern corporation. It starts off with a simple company in Adam Smith's day. For example, you and I and a couple of other people might set up a company. We would do the work, we would do the management, we would sell the product or the service and we would get the money. It was a fairly simple concept because we would be doing all the duties. But as time went by, and companies got bigger and shareholders became more plentiful, you got a division between the control of the company and the ownership of the company. You would have lots of shareholders with shares in the company, but the people running the company did not necessarily have to be shareholders. That immediacy between the managers and the workers and the company, which I spoke about before, was stripped away more and more. You then had people who were controlling companies and people who were shareholders. Senator Conroy was speaking about the mum and dad shareholders that we see today, who really do not have any control over a company like Telstra but nevertheless have shares in it.
The problem became: what do you do in a situation where one group of people owns the company but other people control it? The people who control the company may also have shares in it, but the point is that the control is in the hands of very few, whereas the ownership is in the hands of very many. So then you had to get laws which made it fair for the shareholders and fair for the directors—the people who are running the company, the managers of the company—because they had to have the ability to make the company flourish, to make decisions so 
 that things could go round. At the same time, they could not so conduct themselves that all the profit went to them and none to the shareholders. So you started to get the growth of company law, not only in terms of acts of parliament such as those we are looking at today but in terms of the decisions made by the courts.
What happens when businesses grow to the point where they take up most of the economic life of the country? That, of course, is what has happened. If you look at the big corporations—I mentioned Telstra but there are other big companies like BHP—what happens to the community when they operate in a particular way? This involves not only the owners, the shareholders and the managers and directors but also the community in which the employees live. The question then becomes: should the company have responsibility beyond that to their shareholders? The courts have said for many years that they should have duties only to the shareholders. People talk about that issue in this place and legislation is passed. Indeed, in recent times we have considered legislation which says that the people who are managing companies ought to take into account environmental considerations when they go about their business—a concept that was quite revolutionary some time ago but is becoming more and more accepted as days go on.
We have often heard the quote from Adam Smith that we are driven by self-interest—I do not think that he used quite those words but that is the concept. No doubt self-interest drives people when they are buying shares, but there are other things that drive them besides that, such as the need to be secure and to look after children. Self-interest is not always selfishness—I am not using it in that sense. Managers of the companies who have shares will have self-interest in seeing those shares grow in value so that they make money. At the same time, they have a secondary motive of self-interest in that they are controlling, at times, vast sums of money, and there is no doubt that there is temptation. Unfortunately, several people in the 1980s could not resist that temptation. So you had the collapses of the 1980s, which are still 
 reverberating, where managers became so self-interested and selfish that they did not allow the sorts of resources that should have gone into making shares good shares but took the resources for their own use or just squandered them.
So we have laws like the legislation that is before us today, where we talk about director's duties and corporate governance, where the law understands the separation of ownership and control and where the community understands that something has to be done about it. In fact, many things have been done about it already, and this is the next step in a long line of attempts to make the life of directors reasonable but, at the same time, put such rules and regulations around them as would be appropriate—in the parliament's mind, in any event—to keep them properly responsible to the shareholders and to the wider community. The explanatory memorandum to the  Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998  says:
2.	 The key features of the new regulatory arrangements proposed by the Bill are:
.	Introducing a business judgment rule , which would offer directors a safe harbour  from personal liability for breaches of the duty of care and diligence in relation to honest, informed and rational business judgments.
This idea of directors having to act with care and diligence has been in the law for some considerable time now. It is always a very awkward one. The directors are loaded up with the responsibility of making a company of which they are directors successful and at the same time the managers of that company are also loaded up with the responsibility of making that company successful. They have that responsibility on them. At the same time they have got to use the at times vast capital and resources which are under their control in a responsible way in the interests of the company, in the interests of the shareholders and in the interests of the community generally. How to get that balance is a problem. There have been many books written about it. There have been court cases about it. There has been legislation about it, and we are here today to talk again about trying to strike that balance. This legislation suggests a particular way. Senator Conroy, who has preceded me, 
 has pointed out the opposition's position on that.
Then there are a number of dot points including `Rewriting the existing duty to exercise care and diligence' and `Delegation'. Directors must delegate otherwise the thing will not work, but if they do not delegate properly then disaster could occur. They are the problems. I have not touched on all of them by any means. But I hope to have given a feeling about the issues that will be discussed more when we go into committee.
In the book I referred to by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, Berle in particular talks about the need for the community to keep positioning itself as far as companies are concerned because of the matters that I spoke about before—that is, because of the way that the corporate world has concentrated economic power. It has a big impact on our lives: when we go to work we are employed by companies, a lot of the services that we get are provided by companies and most of the goods that we get are made, delivered and sold by companies. So they are a very big issue.
Berle and Means were talking about the idea of getting the law that affects companies or restrains them—I did not want to use the word `control' but perhaps that might be the right word—to exercise them in the right way so that they can be most productive for the community generally. In that context they spoke about how constitutional law had restrained the power of kings and how, when executive government as we know it today took over from kings, it was restrained by laws. The concept throughout that time was the attempt to balance the need for productive work against the need to protect those that that work might affect. They spoke about how the church in the Middle Ages had to be restrained in the way it was. The authors have brought in a very interesting concept here. I hope to have a few more words to say in the committee stage. For the reasons I have noted, this is a most essential bill.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-12,"—As I said to Senator Conroy, this bill is a bit like a baby: we have known it has been coming, we have been expecting it to 
 come and suddenly it has arrived with a rush. None of us expected it to come on this evening, but here we are. The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998  was conceived by the coalition in March 1997 to comprehensively improve Australia's corporate law as part of its drive to promote business and economic development. I know that intention was fully supported by the Labor Party and the Democrats because, on a cross-party basis, all parties believed that the Corporations Law needed to be modernised, improved and made much more efficient and effective. We, the Democrats, also believed it needed to take into account social values as well as economic values, and in this whole process we have paid a lot of attention to accountability aspects and aspects of fairness as well as aspects of economics and efficiency.
The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program process released discussion papers on six issues. Those were known as `Accounting standards', `Fundraising', `Directors' duties and corporate governance', `Takeovers', `Electronic commerce' and `Financial markets and investment products'. This Corporate Law Economic Reform Program is known as CLERP, which sounds pretty much like a troll. We are dealing here with trolls 1 to 4. Troll 5, `Electronic commerce', has disappeared somewhere. Troll 6, `Financial markets and investment products', is still to be dealt with.
In a previous speech I had said that, of the first four—accounting standards, fundraising, directors' duties and corporate governance, and takeovers—two, which were fundraising and takeovers, were fundamentally economic issues, and two, which were accounting standards and director's duties and corporate governance, were more about governance and administration. But of course accounting standards and directors' duties and corporate governance have immense economic consequences as well, because the way in which a company is governed and managed and the way in which directors conduct themselves make a huge difference to the economic performance of a company. Accounting standards have a great deal of meaning in 
 terms of how financial results are reported and what taxes are paid, so they have very considerable economic consequences as well.
On 9 April 1998, the Treasurer released draft legislation on those issues 1 to 4 to implement the proposals for reform contained in the discussion papers. Interested parties had until 21 May 1998 to make comments on the draft legislation. The bill was then referred to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities and was re-referred at the commencement of this parliament because the last election interrupted the process of review. The committee reported on 12 May 1999, having held hearings across Australia. It is important to note that the committee report had four reports within it, but it was not really a majority report and three minority reports; it was a majority and three supplementaries, because it was agreed by all those reporting on the bill that they thoroughly supported most of the intent of the bill but wished to look at ways and means of resolving issues which they felt were not resolved by the committee itself.
I have recounted this history to demonstrate the consultative process through which the government have gone to arrive at the bill before us today. I am not acquainted with all the consultation they do on all the bills that come before us, but I do know that, in this process, they have been at pains to consult as widely as possible with the professional, legal, academic and business communities and with other concerned bodies—and indeed with the political parties concerned—on these issues. That process, in my view, forms an excellent model to be followed. I have noted the thoughtfulness and consideration the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, has shown in responding to the corporations and securities committee's report and those supplementary reports attached to it and indeed to the representations made by my political party. I also commend the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer Senator Ian Campbell, who is responsible for the management of this bill through the Senate. I know that this was an area which he worked very hard in, had very 
 strong feelings about and has a lot of commitment to.
I now move to the substantive issues in the bill. The first point to be made is that this bill is not merely a simplification of the current provisions of the Corporations Law. Unlike the Labor government's Corporate Law Simplification Program, this bill does try to change the law and is an advancement on that process originated by Labor. It is a welcome advancement, and I say that after having had a number of discussions with Senator Conroy, the shadow minister responsible for this area. The approach of the Australian Democrats has been to assess each of the proposed policy changes on its merits, taking into account what we have heard during the committee inquiry process, the representations that have been made to us and our own understanding of the workings of corporations and capital markets. It has also been informed by our views on accountability, governance, standards, ethics, fairness and issues of advancing the boundaries of the Corporations Law.
I noticed in passing that Senator Conroy could not help but give us a little clout on the way through. As I have said, we have had numerous discussions with Senator Conroy which have been very productive and informative but, inevitably, as you do with policy matters, we have disagreed on some things. Of course, Senator Conroy, being the very strong politician that he is, will not resist taking political advantage from our differences of opinion. Senator Conroy, I think that, if you were an AFL player, you would be permanently on report because you can never resist going past another player without giving them a nudge, a knock or a tweak in some manner which would bring you to the attention of the video umpire. I understand both your method and your character; nevertheless, I want to put on record that I have appreciated the very informed discussion we have had with you and your adviser.
Having digressed a little, let me proceed. This bill contains a new provision in section 664A that will allow a person who owns 90 per cent or more of the shares in a company to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares in the company. The acquisition legislation 
 says that the acquisition must occur at a fair price and that the minority shareholders have the right to object and have the matter determined by a court if they believe that the price does not represent a fair price. For many people this particular issue of compulsory acquisition is probably the most contentious issue in the bill and is one of the areas on which I think there will be a fairly vigorous debate when we get to the committee stage. The Corporations Law does generate a great deal of passion, primarily because people's pockets are involved, but also on account of the issues as to whether minorities are being dealt with fairly. In this respect, some of the additional amendments the government have proposed may assist matters. I look forward to the debate because I think this is an area which needs to be properly ventilated and considered in committee.
The reason for the granting of the acquisitions power is that there are substantial benefits to wholly owning a company rather than merely owning 90 or 95 per cent of a company. With that in mind, it has been the case that minority shareholders have been able to extort unreasonably high prices from shareholders who wish to buy out the remaining shares in the company. However, I should make it clear in my remarks that that has not been a common practice; it has been an occasional practice. That occasional practice of demanding an unreasonably high price is referred to as `greenmailing'.
The Australian Democrats regard the ability of one person to compulsorily acquire the property of another person to be a far-reaching power which should be granted only in the clearest of circumstances, and that principle should be regarded whatever the context of the granting of the power. However, compulsory acquisition is a feature of law in many areas and it is not unusual for it to be present where there are circumstances which justify its inclusion. We recognise and acknowledge that greenmailing is a problem, if an occasional problem, and we understand that there are at least a small number of people whose business it is to place themselves in the position where they can take 
 advantage of being a minority shareholder by engaging in greenmailing.
Once it is accepted that a shareholder who owns 90 per cent or more of a company should be able to compulsorily acquire the balance, the first priority becomes ensuring that minority shareholders receive a fair price for their shares. Under the current provisions in this bill, the 90 per cent holder must obtain an expert's report as to the value of the shares and that report must accompany the notice of compulsory acquisition. It is envisaged that the 90 per cent holder would determine the expert and appoint that person to conduct the investigation. The Australian Democrats have been concerned about that process and the possibility for the perception to arise that, because the expert is appointed and paid by the 90 per cent holder, there may be bias on the part of the expert towards the interests of the 90 per cent holder. For our part, we do not necessarily agree that there would be a bias. We believe that, as a profession, valuers are very respected and have a reputation to protect and an ability, for many, to make a completely independent judgment regardless of who appoints them. But that is not true for every single one of them and, as you know, laws are, generally speaking, designed to ensure that a minority cannot do things which are against the interests of the majority.
To remove any concern, I foreshadow that we will be moving an amendment which will require the independent expert to be chosen by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The 90 per cent holder will still be required to pay for the provision of the expert's report but the expert will be a person or organisation chosen by ASIC who has appropriate expertise and independence. Unless that amendment is passed, we will have some difficulties with the acquisition process on its own. If, after having taken this process, the minority shareholders still believe they are not being given a fair price for their shares, it only takes 10 per cent of that minority to object and the matter is referred to a court, where all reasonable court costs would be paid by the 90 per cent holder. The Australian Democrats believe that the passage of our amendment, combined with the exist 
 ing objection procedure, will mean that minority shareholders will be paid a fair price for their shares.
The second policy change which I wish to discuss is the mandatory bid rule. At present a person may not acquire more shares in a company if that acquisition would result in their owning more than 20 per cent of the company's shares, unless they make a full takeover bid for the company—that is, they must offer to buy all outstanding shares in the company. The mandatory bid rule would have allowed a person to make a single acquisition taking them over the 20 per cent limit before then being required to offer to buy all outstanding shares. The rationale for the proposed rule is to allow persons to know that they have control of the company with, say, 21 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the shares before they are required to offer to purchase the balance.
There is the potential for the rule to make takeovers easier and to increase takeover activity, and it is a view that has been formed by the Labor Party and the Democrats that it is desirable in fact to improve and increase takeover activity in the interests of a more efficient and more vibrant economy. Under the present law, when a person who holds less than 20 per cent of the shares in the company announces that they are going to make a takeover offer, there is the potential for other substantial shareholders, or people who may not even be shareholders, to consider making a counteroffer so that the price of the shares is bid upward by two or more competing takeover predators. That is known as the auction process. However, the mandatory bid rule will allow one person or one company to obtain control of the company before the takeover bid is announced. On many occasions that may mean that other potential takeover bidders will not see any point in making a counteroffer because the initial purchaser already has control. The result is that the auction process under which bidders compete for control of the company does not occur and shareholders potentially receive less for their shares than otherwise would have been the case. Before I move on from there, we must also envisage the situation in which 
 shareholders might not wish to accept the mandatory bid and can in fact reject it.
The government's announcement in relation to capital gains tax rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeovers will remove a substantial impediment on takeover activity. I take the view that this will have a much greater impact on takeover activity than the introduction of a mandatory bid rule. The point I am making is that, if there are a large number of changes within the proposed bill which will in fact induce greater takeover activity, we might not need to go to this further step, certainly not at this stage. So at this stage the Australian Democrats will not support the introduction of the mandatory bid rule, but we may be prepared to revisit this issue at a future time if it becomes apparent that takeover activity is suffering as a result of the absence of the rule. I do see the government case. I do understand it, and I must say quite clearly on the record that I have had to weigh up the two and, on balance, I have gone for a cautious approach. But the government case is not without merit, and that should be clearly understood.
There are a number of other significant changes that have already been mentioned by Senator Conroy. I think it would be appropriate for me to comment on these issues in the committee stage, given that I understand that the Labor Party will be moving amendments in relation to them. I would like to flag that I will be moving an amendment in relation to appointments to both the new Financial Reporting Council and the Takeovers Panel. Those who are watchers of Democrat activity in the chamber will know that this is a chestnut of ours, and I am sure that, given the strong remarks of Senator Conroy with regard to accountability and looking after mums and dads and so on, in the committee stage he will show strong interest in and support for these amendments. I take the view that appointment to these bodies and to government boards in general should be governed by a code so as to enhance the transparency of these appointments and the accountability of the people making the appointments. At present, decisions relating to appointments to government boards, committees or authorities 
 are conducted behind closed doors and the parliament and the public are simply presented with a list of the names of appointees. Our amendment will require the establishment of a code which will need to be complied with when ministers are making appointments. I will discuss these issues further in detail when I come to move the amendment in the committee stage.
In closing, I must say to the parliamentary secretary that the Democrats welcome this bill. We support the measures contained in this bill. I am sure there will be amendments on which we will disagree—with the Labor Party, with you or with alliances of each other—but, by and large, the consultative process between the government, the Labor Party and us has resulted in a minimal number of amendments on which there is likely to be contention, and I think that is a very constructive way to approach this process. I want to thank the minister, the parliamentary secretary and Senator Conroy for their cooperation in the discussions we have had to date.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-12,"—Labor recognise the need for corporate reform. Labor have always been at the vanguard of positive and fair reform in the corporate sector. Our credentials are on the record. The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998  or CLERP Bill—strange acronym though it might be—comes on the back of six reports on accounting standards, fundraising, directors' duties and corporate governance, takeovers, electronic commerce, and financial markets and investment products.
Labor supports—and has demonstrated its ability to contribute positively to—appropriate reform of the Corporations Law to ensure the efficient and effective operation of financial markets. However, this does not mean that you have to embark on a process of financial deregulation without protecting the rights of people. There must be an appropriate regulatory regime to support a flexible market and improved flexibility for business as well. Government must not shrink from its responsibility. It must maintain a proper regulatory regime that keeps both international and domestic confidence in our market and par 
 ticularly the integrity of our financial and capital markets.
The CLERP Bill is some 500 pages long and has a body of government sponsored amendments with it. Labor firmly believes that many of the amendments are obviously necessary. However, it must be clearly stated that a balance must be maintained between all participants in the market. This bill does not provide that balance in toto. The CLERP Bill will not deliver a comprehensive, fair reform process. In truth, it will favour some quarters and their interests while leaving some out in the cold.
There are four main areas that I wish to comment on this evening: takeovers, accounting standards, fundraising, and directors' duties and corporate governance. Firstly, I will turn briefly to the history of the Corporations Law. The reform process that Labor commenced has continued. Labor started the reform process between the early part of 1989 and 1991 and built upon that reform process. The Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 followed. It dealt with directors' duties, in relation to financial benefits to public company directors; statutory duty of care and diligence; insolvent trading provisions; corporate insolvency, with the introduction of the voluntary administration regime; and reform legislation dealing with liquidations.
Labor followed that reform with the Corporate Law Reform Act 1994 and the first Corporation Law Simplification Act 1995. Amongst others, the aim was to bring small business under a regulatory regime. A small business guide was also introduced at that time. The Company Law Review Act 1998 followed. That act aimed to facilitate business and investment by improving the efficiency of corporate regulation and reducing the complexity, regulatory burdens and compliance costs imposed on business.
We come to the CLERP Bill before the Senate. This program commenced in early 1997 approximately and reflected the transfer of responsibilities of the Corporations Law from the Attorney-General to the Treasurer. As a consequence, corporate law reform has been developed in a wider economic framework, but one also has to take cognisance of 
 the need to ensure that social and welfare aspects are also taken into account in the proposed bill. It is disappointing to see that the objectives of the CLERP Bill do not include social, welfare and employment matters. Basically, they are to promote the operation of informed markets, encourage higher standards of corporate governance while encouraging directors to be more business focused, encourage the establishment of accounting standards, improve the market for corporate control and create incentives for greater corporate efficiency.
Firstly, in respect of the issue of takeovers that I wish to comment on this evening, a number of reforms are proposed. Amongst those is equal opportunity. Clearly, this principle should be retained within the takeover area. Then there is the mandatory bid rule. This would allow changes in corporate control and could be facilitated by allowing acquisitions which would exceed the statutory threshold, provided that the acquisition was immediately followed by the announcement of a full takeover bid. These two deserve special consideration, because they can clash. The promotion of the second can harm the first significantly. The equal opportunity principle is one of the principles enunciated by the Eggleston report of 1969. The principle basically protects the minority shareholders by giving them reasonable and equal opportunity to be part of any change in corporate control. The downside may be that, if small investors do not believe that there is sufficient protection of their interests, they may not invest directly in the market.
Secondly, one of the most difficult areas dealt with by the CLERP Bill is the mandatory bid rule. The primary objective of this rule is to facilitate takeover activity—a concept that will test severely the equal opportunity principle that I have mentioned earlier. There needs to be a balance struck between the two. This cannot be in the interests of the minority shareholder. The rule will provide an intending bidder with the opportunity to acquire a parcel of shares and exceed the threshold of 20 per cent of the voting power in the target before publicly announcing a takeover bid, provided certain condi 
 tions are met. The mandatory bid rule will have an adverse impact on the interests of the minority shareholder.
Clearly, the mandatory bid rule limits the opportunity for auctions for control, and thus reduces the competitive market for corporate control. It works something like this: the mandatory bid rule would permit control of the company passing before the making of a formal takeover bid. Rival bids and the opportunity for an auction would thus be eliminated. This government knows that an auction would facilitate price competition in the market if that is what it wants.
In the absence of this, competition bidders may well acquire targets at lower premiums and shareholders may well receive less than the competitive market rate for their interests. The government may no doubt say that in such circumstances these small shareholders could reject the inadequate bid. Such analysis does not cover the position where the bid results in a transfer of control of the company to the bidder. Where this occurs, the option to reject the bid has been lost. He or she as a consequence may become a minority shareholder, and compulsory acquisition may get them sooner or later. This situation allows the shareholder to be caught by arrangements offered by a bidder with limited prior knowledge of the events. The use of the mandatory bid rule will also provide a situation where there is a concern for oppression or unfairness to the minority shareholder.
Turning to corporate governance, two central issues fall under this heading that I wish to speak about this evening: the business judgment rule and the statutory derivative action. I will deal firstly with the business judgment rule. Page 9 of paper No. 3, Directors' duties and corporate governance: facilitating innovation and protecting investors, which I mentioned earlier, sets the scene for the introduction of the business judgment rule, and I quote:
In light of more recent judicial decisions which appear to increase the responsibility of directors and create a degree of uncertainty regarding their potential liability, concerns have been expressed that directors' attentions are increasingly being focussed on compliance issues rather than on wealth creation for shareholders. In particular, 
 concerns have been expressed that the Corporations Law contributes to risk-averse behaviour on the part of directors.
A few things need to be gleaned from that. Firstly, what does it mean when it talks about `which appear'? `In the light of more recent judicial decisions which appear' seems to have come to an assumption quite of its own merit. It does not have a hard and fast statement. It is not black and white. What it talks about is only `appear'. It then says `to increase the responsibility of directors and create a degree'. It does not say the level of degree that may exist or the degree of uncertainty in truth that may or may not in fact occur. It then goes on to talk about the `potential liability'. In other words, they are all `soft' words. They talk about `potential liability', not whether there is, in fact, a liability.
In the final area they say that it may turn them from `risk-averse behaviour on the part of directors' and, as a consequence, business confidence might be deflated or they may not, in fact, invest. There does not seem to be any hard evidence in respect of whether there is a deflation in business confidence. In respect of their attention being turned away, perhaps in certain incidences it should be turned away from greed—or should I say responsible profit maximising behaviour—to issues of compliance. If they did turn their minds to issues of compliance, it would not be such a bad idea.
It is not a justification for a safe harbour. Actually I think it is a ploy by Senator Vanstone to bring Skase home. He may very well be able to return and claim a safe harbour visa. I would want assurance that this would not occur. Certainly we want Skase home but not under a safe harbour visa. There is very little case history and even fewer successful prosecutions in this area against irresponsible directors to warrant this rule in this fashion. What is needed is corporate education, a code of behaviour or conduct and managerial expertise. I think in many quarters this is viewed as needing improvement in any event. They do not need a rule to save them. The majority are doing the right thing. The law in Daniels v. Anderson has stampeded the business community, or at least some of the business community, into wanting a safe 
 harbour and perhaps a safe harbour visa. I invite senators to have a look at the appalling behaviour of the so-called business people in that case. Clearly and appropriately the right result was obtained. There is no evidence to suggest that business is stifled and transfixed, certainly not contained within the paper Directors' duties and corporate governance, and certainly none that has been placed before this chamber.
There are probably, and no doubt, some shady directors who may be quaking in their boots. I would say it is high time. It is about time that someone took issue with them, and brought in proper compliance and a regulatory regime that took care of them. What is needed is to adopt effective corporate government practices that promote transparency, accountability and, consequently, investor confidence. The rules should encourage risk management techniques, not simply provide relief for incompetent but honest directors. Laws should be made that encourage risk management instead. There is little need to enact this section of legislation in this form. It could be tried as a code, or further discussion made, to see if it fulfils its purpose. Directors who make decisions with due care and diligence and in good faith will continue to work hard and make profits. There is certainly no evidence of them being stifled in that endeavour—certainly not if you believe what the government say in question time about how well they are doing.
I turn now to page 65 of the report on the  Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998 . The Australian Labor Party members' report also comments on the matter by saying that the evidence offered to the joint committee on this matter remains unconvincing. So even at that level, where there was the ability to bring submissions to the committee, the evidence was not of a convincing nature. The provision in statutory derivative action allows shareholders to take court action. It replaces the rule in Foss v. Hardbottle. It permits specific persons to bring an action if certain criteria are met. However, in that instance, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission is not included. 
Turning to section 241 of the proposed bill, this power allows the court to appoint an independent person to investigate and report to the court on the financial affairs of the company, amongst other things. If it is going to take on that responsibility, it is clear that certain protections, or at least commercial-in-confidence provisions, should be put in place. It is unclear, looking at the explanatory memorandum at 6.63, whether that is in fact the case. It is unclear whether a person would be in contempt of court by refusing to cooperate with an investigation. The word `effectively' is put in at 6.63. It does not say yes or no, for that matter. It is difficult to tell whether they would be or they would not.
In respect of fundraising, much of the direction of the bill in this regard is not opposed; however, caution should be exercised. If there is a true cost-benefit analysis placed on the bill in this area by the government, it will readily reveal that little real saving is made at the coalface. Measures are needed to ensure that there is an improvement to capital raising for small business and medium enterprises. That is obviously the case and it needs to be examined in detail. If there is new reform in that area then bring it in, but it is certainly not contained in that section.
In respect of accounting standards, the bill establishes the Financial Reporting Council—the FRC for short. Caution should be exercised here. In promoting the IASC standards, Australia should be careful in adopting the international accounting standard, especially where the United States has not, especially if the aim is global harmonisation.
In conclusion, this bill, although by and large an improvement and targeted at the areas of need, fails to address the critical concerns of small investors about security of shares and of small business about capital raising and reducing risks for mum and dad investors by ensuring good, workable corporate governance principles. It is skewed to big business—as unsurprising as that may be. This government should not embrace it, and the Democrats should likewise be a little more circumspect. 
In respect of other matters that may be drawn into it: if you are going to look more fully at corporate law reform, corporate law reform in the area of employee entitlements should also be embraced. If you are also going to look at duties of directors and corporate governance, there is perhaps a telling word from the people who previously held the corporate law economic reform area. The Australian Government Solicitor, in a legal briefing of 9 October 1997, came up with a view that supports the earlier submission that I made. The briefing states:
In Australia, courts have rarely found directors in breach of their duty except in the most extreme cases of neglect of their responsibilities or in cases involving fraud. In assessing whether the director has been sufficiently diligent, a court might expect the following:
.	 that the directors of a large company would ensure that among their number there should be one or more who are competent in the field of financial management
.	 that the directors of a large company should read, be able to understand and seek any necessary clarification of the key financial information put before the board, such as a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement
It goes on to set out some of the requirements that are embodied in principles of good corporate management. Those are the words of the previous department that looked after the area. You can glean from that that they did not see any need for major reform in that area, other than perhaps significant  encouragement by this government in this area.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-12,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, and how appropriate that you should be in the chair at this time. At the outset I thank you, as Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, for the diligent work that you, your committee and the secretariat of that committee did in its detailed consideration of this legislative package. I also thank each of the honourable senators who have contributed to the debate today on what is without doubt the most significant reform to Australia's Corporations Law in the history of this great nation.
As previous speakers have said, this government sought back in early 1997 to look at reforming the Corporations Law—and this is how it got its unusual acronym—for an economic purpose. Senator Ludwig referred to the motivations of the government as well as those of people who formerly visited the area of Corporations Law reform, and he referred to social and welfare outcomes of such a process.
I think it is fair to say that those of us who have had the privilege to work in this area of public policy find a couple of things. Firstly, it is a relatively dry area of pursuit. It is not an area that will generally land on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, the Sun-Herald or any of the Sunday papers. It is not what my good friend and colleague Senator Vanstone calls a `trolley stopper'. People do not stop in the aisles of supermarkets and say, `The government is reforming Corporations Law. Isn't that good? Isn't that exciting? We'd better vote for them.' But it is an area that does have the potential to impact—and I think Senator Ludwig would understand this—greatly upon the living standards of individual Australians. If you have a Corporations Law that constrains and makes it very hard to establish a business in Australia, to raise funds for that business in Australia, to conduct mergers and acquisitions, to run your accounts and so forth, you will stifle entrepreneurship, you will stifle business development, and you will therefore reduce the employment opportunities of Australians.
I think I should make it clear at the outset of this summing up that the government's proposals, in what have become known as CLERP papers 1 to 4 and now this package before the Senate, are to encourage economic activity for the benefit of all Australians. We know that if you do not have productive, successful, profitable, outward-looking growth in the private sector, the nation will not go forward and it will not provide the employment opportunities that people need and deserve—what should be seen as their birthright, but of course is nothing like that. It will only come from sensible actions of government and productive enterprise.
The provisions in the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill are therefore not designed to help the big end of town or big business—quite the contrary. If you look closely at the provisions, all of the reforms are designed to assist people who risk their own capital, particularly small investors—I do not like the use of the words `mums and dads' that is creeping into the vernacular lately—such as families, direct investors who have increased in number massively over the last three years, to risk their capital in a well-regulated and transparent corporate environment. It is to assist those people. That is why, when we turn to issues like the mandatory bid rule, the follow-on rule and the takeover reforms, if you ask the Australian Shareholders Association—the peak organisation representing shareholders; a very dynamic and successful organisation on behalf of shareholders when you look at the sort of success they have had at BHP meetings and in the reforms of some of Australia's corporate giants—you will find that even they support the takeover reforms that this government proposes. In fact, they support all of the CLERP proposals, with the exception of the compulsory acquisition provisions.
These proposals, which we designed during 1997 and 1998, are designed to assist small shareholders. This government recognises that, if you provide a sound regulatory environment, you will build businesses and you will build employment and shareholders will feel comfortable about investing their capital, their savings, in direct investment in Australian securities and other investments. So that is the driving philosophy behind the Corporations Law Economic Reform Program, which I am very proud to be a part of.
Before I go into the process and the policy, I will just quickly rebut some of the arguments made during the second reading debate so that we can move to the committee stage. I will say here, because I can see that the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate has entered the chamber, that, because the Senate has moved to this piece of legislation more quickly than anticipated—that does happen in the Senate from time to time—we intend to adjourn the debate at the end of the 
 second reading on this bill because some of the amendments are not available from some of the parties. We propose to resume the debate later tomorrow morning, when all the amendments will be before us.
Having said that, I want to thank some of the people who have been involved in the process that sees this legislation before Australia's parliament at the moment. These names are not in particular order of merit, but I want to thank special people who have made a special contribution to this process, and I will outline the size of that process very briefly. I particularly want to thank people who have been on my staff in the previous couple of years: most importantly, Claire Dalla Costa, who now works for ASIC in Brisbane; Julie Abramson, from the Treasurer's office, who had responsibility for this portfolio and who was a driving force behind these important policy changes—Julie now works at ASIC; and Jenifer Wells, another one of my departmental liaison officers from the business law division, who is now working at IFSA. I also want to particularly thank Jim Murphy, who was the head of the Business Law Division of Treasury throughout this process. He is a phenomenal public servant, a great Australian, whose drive and enthusiasm for this policy reform really assisted me in what was an incredibly complex and challenging task. There were many other people in the Business Law Division. Many of them are in the advisers' box here today, so I will not name them as they will probably go bright red. But it was a great pleasure and honour to actually work with that very focused group of Australian public servants in the Business Law Division. I am not sure how many are members of the CPSU, but I am sure that does not matter. They are great Australians, regardless.
—Are you suggesting that if they were, they wouldn't be?
—I am sure that many of them are and that many of them are great Australians in spite of that. I also thank some people from the private sector. There are probably thousands of people who were involved in the consultations on this legislation. It is a credit to their work that it looks 
 as though, at this stage, the legislation will move through the Senate relatively unscathed. I have already thanked the Australian Shareholders Association, or at least mentioned them, for their support for the great majority of the measures in this bill. I want to thank personally Ted Rofe, the Executive Director of the Australian Shareholders Association, who has given up an enormous amount of his own time to be involved in this process; Lyn Ralph, from IFSA, an organisation that was formed out of three disparate groups of people with an interest in this area; and Richard Gilbert, of course, who has taken a close interest in this process of CLERP. I also want to thank another group which ended up, like the policy itself, with an unfortunate acronym—BRAG. The Business Regulatory Advisory Group was established by the Treasurer and me to form a private sector sounding board for the policy proposals. They worked day after day, reviewing the policy proposals and the legislative proposals, doing a lot of work in their own time, to provide the government with quality private sector real-life practical experience for these measures. I want to name them personally. Having named all these people, I am sure I have missed people so, to the people I have missed, I apologise at the outset. They are: Bob Nottle, Leigh Hall, Peter Barnett, John Murray, Jeoffrey Lucy, Cathy Walter, who is the chairman of BRAG, Les Taylor, Rohan Jeffs and Malcolm Starr—I thank all of you for the work that you put in, and I know you continue to put in, to this process.
I will move quickly to the process. I am really not trying to delay this debate, because I think it is important that we move to the committee stage quickly. The process involved two years of significant policy development and consultation. We did three laps of Australia, going to all capital cities on at least three occasions, holding roundtables, seminars and one to one discussions with just about anyone who had any interest whatsoever in corporate law in Australia. That is why I think the body of this policy can be said to represent a consensus of opinion about how Australia's corporate law should be reviewed. You are never going to get unanimity in these matters, but we did seek to find some balan 
 ces. That brings the legislation, finally, to the Senate after a significant consultation process. I think it was a very useful process. If it was not, it was certainly hard work. I think it has produced very good policy. I guess the test of the pudding will be in the eating and in the implementation of it.
We have had some criticism from Labor about some of the policies. I find a bit of it not so much disturbing but surprising. Senator Conroy, who has been involved in this process not from day one but fairly soon after that, has generally been supportive of what we are doing. I have gone to great efforts to ensure that the relevant people in the opposition and the Democrats were involved, from the initial presentation of the policy discussion papers and the building of CLERP from the ground up. We have certainly had a very open and transparent consultative process. I tried to involve them because, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I thought that one day we would get here with a piece of legislation and it would be better if they were part of the process.
I am certainly a little disappointed and a little shocked, because the rhetoric from the Labor Party has been that they support CLERP and the aspirations of it in virtually all of the key areas of reform. With accounting standards, they do not really want an FRC to have control. They are worried about moving to international standards, which we do not define. We made a very clear policy decision to not define what sort of standards we want to go to. They say that they want to support fund raising reform, yet they oppose the sensible reforms to the sophisticated investor test. In the area of takeovers, they oppose the mandatory bid rule and the compulsory acquisition rule. It is good to see that they at least support the panel reforms. Their stance on directors' duties is incredibly surprising after the government took the lead from an excellent report presented to this parliament in November 1989 by a committee chaired by Senator Cooney, who basically supported a business judgment rule back in 1989.
The government relied on no less than four reports, two of them to this parliament. One 
 was a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1991. A CASAC report was commissioned by the then Labor government's Attorney-General. There were the reports of the Cooney committee and the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. There were four reports—most of them to Labor Attorneys-General, and certainly from committees chaired by Labor politicians—which recommended a business judgment rule, not to lower the standard of directors' duties and responsibilities but to ensure that if the director made a decision in good faith, had informed himself or herself, and had done it at arm's length so that there was no illegality or lack of good faith, then they would have a safe harbour. One of the problems with directors, clearly identified by both shareholders and directors, is that they become incredibly risk averse because of court decisions and litigation that try to second guess directors' decisions years, and potentially decades or more, after those decisions have been taken. So it is very hard in many parts of Australia to find directors who will take on the responsibility of directors because of the significant litigation risk.
This government looked at those reports and made a decision that we would proceed with a very cautious and conservative safe harbour proposal, based on many of the recommendations of Senator Cooney's excellent work, balanced with a new statutory power for shareholders to take action against the company and funded by the company. It is a classic demonstration of the balancing this government sought to bring into its deliberations. It was not something to please the big end of town; in fact, many of the things we are doing are not popular at the big end of town.
That brings me to the mandatory bid rule. The mandatory bid rule, contrary to the rhetoric that has been flying around this place and outside, is not designed to encourage takeover activity. That is not the policy goal, although it may possibly be a benefit of it. I think Senator Conroy said in his speech that the opposition agrees that there may be economic benefit in increased takeover activi 
 ty. It may be a pedantic point that I am about to make, but I will make it anyway. What we aim to do is to increase the market for corporate control. We want more competition and more pressure to be placed on directors, particularly at the big end of town. Senator Ludwig was looking for some evidence of why we are doing this. You need look only at international comparative tables of takeover activity. Compare the London market, the US market and the Canadian market with the Australian market and there is a massive difference between the level of takeover activity. Boards, or directors, are at much greater risk of takeover in those other jurisdictions because the takeover laws facilitate that.
In the city of London, arguably one of the best regulated corporate affairs markets in the world, the mandatory bid rule and the follow-on rule have been in place for three decades. They still have auctions—the mandatory bid rule does not get rid of an auction. The mandatory bid rule ensures that all shareholders get the benefit of a takeover made under that rule. The auction system stays in place. The person who is offered money for their shares has the right to say, `I'll ring around and see if I can get a better offer.' There are dopes out there who may say, `I have a potentially controlling interest in a company and I'll take the first offer that comes up.' There is nothing that senators can do to stop the dope from selling their car, their house or their shares too cheaply, but if a sensible person was made an offer on their house that they thought may not be the best offer, they would probably ring up a real estate agent and ask them if they could get a better price. I have to say that most people who are offered a price for their shares will ring up a merchant bank or a stockbroker and say, `This bloke has just offered me 30 cents for my shares. What do you think?' That stockbroker will quickly try to find someone who can do better, because he will get a commission out of it, so the concept that you get rid of the auction—that you get rid of a market for shares—is absolute baloney.
I believe that the mandatory bid, contrary to what its opponents have been saying, is in fact very much in the shareholders' interests, 
 because, with the reforms to the panel, ensuring that litigation is reduced and that the panel quickly resolves disputes and lets the takeovers move on, combined with the reforms to the capital gains tax treatment of scrip for scrip takeovers, you will find, with the mandatory bid, that small shareholders will have the benefit of far more offers for their shares. That is what we are aiming for.
That covers some of the areas. We will have to go into a lot more detail in the committee stage but I very sincerely thank all other senators for their contributions and commend this most excellent bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) agreed to:
That consideration of this bill in the committee of the whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-12,"—by leave—I am obliged to the Senate for granting leave for me to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999 . The second reading speech, which was incorporated, I believe was in terms of 1998 figures. Of course, it should be now couched in 1999 final figures to match the explanatory memorandum which was tabled. The $36.3 million in relation to literacy and numeracy should now be $38.3 million. The $26.4 million to extend funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy should now be $27.9 million. In relation to $10.1 million under the capital grants program, that should now be $10.3 million. And in relation to short-term emer 
 gency assistance, the $1.9 million should now be $2 million. I hope that assists the Senate accordingly.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-12,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
""but the Senate condemns the Government for:
	 (a)	 using the important issue of literacy in a cynical political fashion; and
	 (b)	 failing to provide government schools with additional resources in line with its increased expenditure for the non-government sector"".
The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  seeks to give effect to a number of budget measures which, as has just been indicated by the minister, actually changed from the time at which the bill was introduced. I note that the government is chopping and changing with its legislative program. While the opposition seeks to assist the government in the processing of legislation, it would serve the parliament a great deal if the government could actually provide a little bit of notice so that speakers could prepare to come on in the chamber. Notwithstanding the fact that the government has clearly mismanaged its program so completely—again—I think it is important to point out that this is a bill that seeks to provide $38 million for the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and for the literacy improvement strategies for the middle years of schooling, and $27.9 million for the year 2000 to extend funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy.
I think everyone now recognises that Dr Kemp's grand plan for self-promotion and self-aggrandisement via the literacy issue has run out of puff. He has been sidelined by the announcements in August this year by New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT that they were undertaking nationally comparable tests, with Queensland to participate next year. The fact that these states—and only one had a Labor government at the time—went out of their way to exclude the federal minister shows the contempt with which those who actually run schools view Dr 
 Kemp's political grandstanding on such an important issue.
The initiative shows the value of cooperation and bipartisanship over the bullying and headline grabbing strategies that Dr Kemp has been pursuing. Dr Kemp would have us believe that he invented concern about literacy, whereas basic skills testing has been happening in New South Wales since 1987 and in Victoria and South Australia since 1995, well before Dr Kemp actually became a minister. We never hear a single word from the federal minister about the Keating government's Early Literacy Program or the fact that it was Labor which set up the National Schools English Literacy Survey, whose results Dr Kemp manipulates so shamelessly.
On 14 September 1997, after locking the states into silence on the issue of the survey results until Monday, 15 September, Dr Kemp appeared on the Sixty Minutes program to pre-empt the states and put his own spin on the survey results and his interpretation of them. The education ministers from Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania—and I repeat that at the time all had conservative governments—co-authored a media release which said:
The ministers call on Dr Kemp to cease his cynical political stunts.
The then Minister for Education in the Kennett government, Mr Phil Gude, called Dr Kemp a `spin doctor'. As recently as 9 August this year, Mr Gude said on a Four Corners  program, and I hope the minister takes particular note of this advice:
Well, I think what he was clearly trying to do was to gain a profile on an issue, and I thought it was not cricket, if you like . . . to use the kids, use the teachers, use the profession in that way.
That is what Mr Gude said. He also said:
I've found in my life that honesty has never got me into any trouble.
What an extraordinary revelation. It is a pity Dr Kemp did not hear that message. I might say that it is a pity that a few others in the Victorian government did not hear that message before the election results in that state in recent weeks. The interviewer went on to say:
You accused him at the time of deliberately and mischievously manipulating data to portray literacy at a perilous level.
Mr Gude said:
Yes, I did . . . because I believe that's what was done.
The fact is that there is very little gloss left on this issue for the minister—or indeed on any other issue for this minister. He has been exposed on the literacy issue. His incompetent handling of the Job Network led to his demotion following the last election. He followed that with promises of a research green paper which was six months late and which turned out to be not worth waiting for. He has been prodded into action by the opposition on issues like the various vocational education and training rorts and, of course, on the various scandals which are being revealed in education for overseas students.
—One college.
—Thirty colleges, Minister. I look forward to you providing the same level of attention to those other colleges that have been named in this chamber that you have in terms of the National College of Australia. I note that it took you the better part of three months to find out about it—an extraordinary level of negligence by this government. On top of that, the minister has saddled this government with his disastrous—
—Six weeks.
—That is not quite the case. The college collapsed in June. My concerns to the government were registered well before I asked a question in this chamber. The Prime Minister, on 23 September, was so restrained in his praise of the education minister and he found the words that he did only by scrabbling for something positive to say about various members of his frontbench. Quite clearly, what has happened is that Dr Kemp has lost the confidence of the Prime Minister, and I believe he has lost the confidence of most people.
—That's why he's still the minister for education.
—Only just. We will wait and see just how long that lasts. I also suggest that the National Asian Languages and Stud 
 ies in Australian Schools program—or NALSAS—is another policy area where Dr Kemp would have us believe that history began on the day he was sworn in as minister. He is fulsome in his praise for this program and its value in developing cultural understanding and skills for participation in the global economy, but he never mentions that it was established under the Keating government, with the strong support of the Goss government in Queensland.
Other Labor initiatives which Dr Kemp has sought to claim credit for are the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation and the Jobs Pathway program. Regarding the latter, he actually said in parliament on 25 August that the Jobs Pathway program had been established by the coalition. Dr Kemp tries to take credit for good ideas. Given that he has so few of them himself, you can understand why he is so happy to steal those of others. His contribution to policy development has been zero. He is driven solely by an ideological obsession with privatisation, cost cutting and union bashing.
I now turn to the issue of teacher professional development, for which the budget included an announcement of $77.7 million over four years. The minister said in parliament on 2 September that the money was provided in Appropriation Bill (No. 1). However, that was not the case. Appropriation bills are for only one year at a time. So $15 million of the $78 million has been legislated for. I ask why we are not able to see the funds in the States Grants Act, through which the vast bulk of school funding is channelled and which legislates funds for four years. It is important for us to see where this money is legislated. It is appropriate that the minister, in his concluding remarks, explains to us exactly where that money is legislated. Is it because no descriptions of individual programs are now included in the appropriation bills, and this initiative could disappear next year or the year after, with very little evidence and before the promised $78 million has been delivered? I challenge the minister to deliver on the rest of the promises, to legislate for the remaining $62 million and to do so in an open and accountable way. Final 
 ly, I should point out that the funding of teacher professional development is yet another Labor initiative which the Howard government has now endorsed and adopted, having cut the program in previous budgets.
This bill deals with initiatives in school funding announced in this year's budget. On the subject of school funding and the budget, I have some quite serious issues that I would like to pursue. I note that the officers are present. I think it has become an annual event to go through some of these questions. It is obvious that, at major expense, the Howard government has sent to all schools—government and non-government—boxes and boxes of glossy brochures full of self-promotions, accompanied by a covering letter to parents which has sought to request the principals to distribute government propaganda. The minister should be able to tell us how much of the taxpayers' money was used in this outrageous exercise. I am sure that at the committee stage of the bill we will be able to pursue this question. I also ask whether he can tell us how many of the principals advised that they were not distributing the material. I turn to the content of the letters and brochures. The brochure accompanying the letter to the government school parents claims that—and I quote:
Direct Federal funding for government schools has risen between 1996 and 2000 by 25 per cent, or $382 million.
The reality, however, is very different. The fact is that costs in schooling have risen by 12 per cent since 1996 and enrolments have increased. The minister clearly wants parents to believe that government schools have more Commonwealth money to spend on more things than they need.
Let us see whether we can set the record straight. Once adjusted for cost increases, my calculations indicate that expenditure will increase by only one-hundredth of what Dr Kemp claims—that is, $3 million. That is about $1.50 for each student. The fact is that a dollar is only worth what it will buy. If someone had a dollar to cover the cost of a loaf of bread five years ago, they would now need $1.30 to buy the same item. When we give a person $1.30 that does not mean that 
 they are provided with a 30 per cent funding increase. In real terms, there has been no increase. Looking at the dollars in real terms, Commonwealth funding increases by about $3 million between 1996 and 2000. But what happens when we adjust for enrolment increases? For this I used the funded enrolments used by DETYA for each of the years, in order to maintain consistency.
My calculations indicate that, on a per student basis, direct Commonwealth funding has fallen from just over $606 in 1996 to less than $598 four years later. Let me repeat that: direct Commonwealth funding per government school student actually declines over the period 1996 to 2000. So much for this government's claims of increased funding.
The government seeks to defend itself by claiming that the bulk of funding for government schools is provided by the states and territories. It then goes on to claim that the pool of money from which states and territories provide funding for schools is growing in real terms. The Prime Minister told parliament on 13 May this year:
The major call on the budgets of most state governments—not the only call, of course, but one of the major calls—is government education. In the coming financial year, the financial assistance grants going to the Australian states will rise by something close to five per cent in real terms. It is therefore stark obvious that all of the governments of the Australian states will have more resources to fund government schools.
The claim that in 1999-2000 Commonwealth financial assistance grants to the states and territories will rise by almost five per cent in real terms was also repeated in answer to Senate estimates question No. E2, which I asked on 8 June this year. I can only presume that the same level of bodgie advice that has been provided to the Prime Minister has been provided to the Senate estimates committee. In Dr Kemp's open letter to parents, which I referred to earlier, he stated:
The 1999 Commonwealth Budget provided a 3 per cent real increase in Financial Assistance Grants to the States which they can use to further increase funding for governments schools.
So, is the increase five per cent or three per cent? The answer is: none of the above. Budget Paper No. 3 states that financial 
 assistance grants, or FAGs, have been maintained this year in real per capita terms; that is, they have been adjusted for price increases and population growth only. There is no additional, discretionary funding available for states to spend on schools or anything else. The same point has to be made again and again because it is quite clear that the departmental officials have not got the message. They keep repeating the same errors and the same advice to government. One can only presume that it is either the department providing bodgie advice to government or bodgie advice is being provided by government to the Australian people. We look forward to an explanation of which it is.
The second point is that this is the same government which told us repeatedly that its $1.6 billion cut to FAGs in 1996 would have no impact on state spending on government schools. So an increase means more money but a cut means no less money—an extraordinary jump in logic. This is the nature of the propaganda that we have seen coming out of this government. It is very interesting mathematics but meaningless in many ways because the claim of an increase in FAGs simply is wrong. However, the government has a second string to its bow in seeking to defend itself against government school funding critics, and the second string is just as flimsy as the first. The open letter to parents says:
The Government's New Tax System will also deliver to the States significant increases which can allow more funds to be directed to government schools.
Official government estimates are that GST revenue will not even match the current level of FAGs for at least three years. So the Commonwealth has had to give a written assurance to the states and territories that it will provide additional funds as necessary to top up any shortfall, which may well be on an indefinite basis.
There is no justification for the Commonwealth to reduce the proportion of its funding for government schools ahead of a demonstrable improvement in the position of the states and territories in terms of the available discretionary resources to make up such a shortfall. 
 Of course, that is exactly what is happening. The answer to Senate estimates question E3, which I asked on 8 June this year, shows that the proportion of direct Commonwealth funding going to government schools will fall to 35.3 per cent in 2003, down from 41.5 per cent in 1996, and that is before one extra cent of GST revenue—over and above what they would have received under the old system—will have been received by the states.
What we are seeing is a pattern of deceit being exercised by this government in so far as it makes claims of increasing moneys being made available to the states and claims about increased moneys being available for education in this country when, in fact, the opposite is the case. The government's defence on these issues has no substance. The people of Australia need to understand that the Howard government is actively working to undermine public education in this country.
The ALP, in contrast, is happy to support additional resources going to needy non-government schools, but there must be extra resources given to the government schools in line with those additional resources going to private sector schools, and funding initiatives must be presented in a balanced way. Dr Kemp tries to tell us that the government does not favour one school sector over another, but the fact is, as shadow minister—

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-10-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In speaking to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet 1989-99 annual report, it is probably no coincidence that I find some of the areas outlined in it most interesting, particularly the Office of the Status of Women, given the announcement by that office in the last week or so in regard to funding. This report provides quite an insight into what the Office of the Status of Women was like in the previous year. A number of elements are worth drawing the Senate's attention to. No doubt, with keen interest, I will be seeking to continue my remarks on this later.
In particular, the report mentions a total of 37 organisations applying for funding last year under the national women's non-government organisation funding programs and says that, of those 37 organisations, 13 applications were found to be ineligible. Obviously nine did not get any funding at all, but the interesting thing, in light of this week's decision and the debate which happened in the House of Representatives this afternoon, is that last year, of these remaining applicants, 13 organisations were considered to meet the criteria to a high degree and were funded to a total of $500,000. Of course, we know that, in light of this week's decision, those 13 organisations have now been reduced to only three and they will be sharing in $300,000.
I also notice in this report that last year's women's roundtable meeting held in Parliament House over two days in August was attended by 50 women's non-government organisations. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women also held five regional roundtable meetings. People should be aware that next week the Office of the Status of Women's roundtable is happening again, but what is notable about next week is those who have not been invited. Only 20 women's non-government organisations have been invited, so what happened to the other 30? They got a letter saying, `You're not coming', or `Don't bother to come next week.' In light of this annual report, it will be very interesting to see what next year's annual report produces for us. It provides a great area for further explanation during the Senate estimates round coming up in a couple of weeks.
This report also says, under the status of women, that responsibility for monitoring the implementation of Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women rests with the Office of the Status of Women. But it does not go on to say how they have done that; whether, in fact, they have done it; how comprehensively they have done it; or whether they have not done it all. It just states, as a matter of fact, that they have responsibility for it. We all know that, and I find that this annual report is fairly deficient in providing us with information about how they have gone about it.
They also say they are responsible for representing the government at relevant international forums. One will await the next estimates in December to hear how well the Office of the Status of Women was represented quite recently at the ILO, where the Australian government suggested that women in this country should be subjected to pregnancy tests prior to being employed. I notice that there is no mention of that sort of policy or that thought from the government in this annual report. There are a number of statements in this report that are not backed up by either evidence or claims about exactly what the Office of the Status of Women is doing. This is not surprising for those of us who have been following the path of the OSW in recent years.
In my remaining time, I think it is also worthy to note on page 41 a statement about the Alice Springs to Darwin Railway. In view of the limited time we have tonight, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-10-12,"—I rise this evening to make a few brief remarks on matters pertaining to the continuing humanitarian efforts in particular in East Timor. Senators would know—as I suspect I have been telling them ad nauseam since my return—that I was a member of the Australian Observer Delegation for the Popular Consultation in East Timor. Because much of the 
 post Popular Consultation preparation for humanitarian efforts was being carried out in Darwin in the Northern Territory, I undertook a visit to Darwin at the end of the last sitting week. There were large numbers of international aid workers based there at that stage doing an enormous amount of coordination and work on preparations for the full humanitarian effort in East Timor.
I undertook the visit to Darwin as the President of the UNICEF Parliamentary Association. I thought it would be a very valuable opportunity to see what UNICEF was doing and, although one cannot always do a great deal, to offer at least moral support in this context. I want to place on record my sincere appreciation and grateful thanks to Ms Mirna Yacoub, a UNICEF program officer usually based in Sydney, who was my guide and highly informative adviser for the visit. She had made an exceptional effort to set up the UNICEF presence in Darwin from effectively a blank sheet. In doing that, she had to establish some effective office operations and assist a number of international UNICEF officers in their efforts in East Timor.
She arranged a very valuable meeting for me with some of those people, including Mr Brian Clear, who is usually based in Pyongyang, Mr Buddy Tillet, usually based in New York, and Mr Mark Thomas, who I believe is usually based in Bangkok. We were able to discuss UNICEF's operations in this crisis context as it is playing out in East Timor. Mr Tillet had just spent 10 or 12 days in East Timor as part of the initial operations. He had seen the initial roll-out of aid. He described for me the fly-over of many of the western areas of East Timor. His particularly vivid descriptions of areas that our observer delegation had visited brought home to me in particular the extent of the destruction wrought in some areas.
I also, over an extended period, visited the area known as the `tent city', which had housed so many of the East Timorese refugees flown into Darwin out of the very difficult circumstances in Dili just after the Popular Consultation. The commander of the tent city was a Northern Territory police officer, Mick Heythuysen, a very impressive 
 person who had an excellent operation under way in the tent city. I was particularly impressed with the efforts of both government and non-government groups in that operation. At that stage, there were still more than 200 refugees there. There were many families with young children, and one can only imagine the trauma that that sort of experience causes. There was a significant number of Northern Territory government public servants supporting that process. There was a fantastic medical clinic very impressively set up within the tent city.
—A great bunch of things.
—I am supporting that sincerely, Senator Crossin. The registration and tracking of the refugees was undertaken with an excellent custom designed computer program for which, I understand, another young officer from the Northern Territory Police was responsible. The tents of the tent city were set up by the Army. There was a very impressive kitchen, which had entailed some very valuable East Timorese expert supervision of the caterers to ensure that the food was appropriate for the refugees and their families.
A very important component of this whole process was the operation of the local Catholic clergy in holding mass regularly and enabling the East Timorese to worship as they wished. The entertainment and amusements for the children were diverse and very valuable for them in terms of diverting their attention from a difficult circumstance and minimising, if at all possible, the trauma they had undergone. As part of that there was a very heavy involvement of the Northern Territory's East Timorese community, in ensuring that their country men and women and their families were well looked after. And of course there was involvement of Commonwealth agencies—in particular the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
One of the things that the commander in particular showed me in some detail was the map that they had placed in the registration area for the refugees, which very clearly showed them how close Darwin was to East Timor. The dislocation that one feels must be extraordinary, and to actually be able to 
 visualise that distance, they said, was very important to the refugees and very valuable for them.
Everybody to whom I spoke in Darwin, without exception, noted the extraordinary job, the extraordinary contribution, of both the Northern Territory government and the City of Darwin Council to this entire process. It was not just in relation to the tent city, but in relation to the whole effort of moving humanitarian aid into East Timor from Darwin. It was a ringing message. The internationals present in Darwin could not thank Australia enough—no matter where they came from, no matter what their involvement.
UNICEF also took me to visit the two particular warehouses where stores were located before transportation to East Timor. A UNAMET worker who had previously been in East Timor for three or four months was coordinating that process. You can imagine trying to do that for a diversity of agencies, a diversity of governments and with a diversity of methods of transportation. It was an enormous challenge for him and for those involved to do that—by air or sea, whether it was UNICEF, CARITAS, Medecins Sans Frontieres or the World Food Program. We are talking about food and emergency rations, particularly for babies, about water containers and about the practical basics of office infrastructure, like bits and pieces of photocopiers and faxes, which begged the question about the use of power. Those warehouses were well set up and well coordinated to achieve all of that.
I had the opportunity also to visit the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, again in space donated by the government of the Northern Territory, where there were dozens of people from all over the world and from every conceivable international agency operating in that area. I received a briefing from the World Food Program, and we have seen in recent days many of the pictures of the distribution of rice in East Timor. Its implementing partner, World Vision, was working on that. Just to give some perspective on that process, the World Food Program plans to feed over 600,000 people for six months. This is not two or 
 three weeks—or two or three months, for that matter. The World Food Program and its partners are coordinating to provide food for work, seed protection, small-scale infrastructure rehabilitation projects and general supporting guidance in the promotion of food security for the East Timorese.
At that level there was a very impressive level of coordination, of which I would like to make note. In the Senate references committee inquiry into East Timor, many witnesses were concerned about how and whether aid provision will be effectively coordinated. I left that particular day in Darwin with a very positive impression of the agencies working well together—both UN and non-UN. One imagines that there are always healthy tensions involved in this process when you bring together a group of people who have never worked together before, but it seemed to me that OCHA was doing a very good job at making sure people did work together. The day I was there, for example, I witnessed the establishment of a couple of meetings that were part of that whole process of making sure that—in colloquial terms—the left hand knew what the right hand was doing.
It was a particularly useful visit at the time, and I was very grateful for the time of the UNICEF people in particular. We have spoken again with UNICEF this week to see how matters have progressed. In terms of East Timor itself, UNICEF has now established a formal office in Dili. They have seven individuals working out of that office and they have started the distribution of the most important components of their programs, which, in an emergency situation like this, are obviously in support of, particularly, mothers and children. The goods that I saw in the warehouses in Darwin have been effectively transported and distributed, more importantly, throughout East Timor.
There are ongoing problems. In simple terms they are issues of security, which are affecting all operations in East Timor; issues of supplies—basic office supplies and the basic supplies of everyday life; and issues of accommodation—the more staff one has, the more difficult that becomes. Food is still being sent in for the UNICEF staff in East 
 Timor. The electricity and water situations are best described as variable. Most importantly, the efforts of UNICEF and other international organisations are beginning to bear fruit. They are very productive efforts, and Australia has made in its efforts through its preparatory work in Darwin and in more general terms an enormous and effective contribution to that entire process. I place again on record my thanks to UNICEF in the Northern Territory for assisting with my visit.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>East Timor: Humanitarian Aid</title>,Adjournment,16,1
