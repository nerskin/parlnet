Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (12:01):  by leave—I rise today to table the Treaty between Australia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the presence of Australian personnel in the Netherlands for the purpose of responding to the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The treaty is accompanied by a National Interest Analysis.


We live in an increasingly interconnected world where events far from home can have profound implications for us. On 17 July, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over separatist-held territory in eastern Ukraine killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. It was a civilian aircraft in civilian airspace, with the wreckage landing in a war zone. In a cruel twist of fate Australia was suddenly at the fulcrum of the Russia–Ukraine conflict. 


Among those killed were 38 passengers who called Australia home—and another three with close links to Australia. We have been profoundly saddened by the loss of so many Australians. Among them: a 25-year-old travelling in Europe, like so many young Australians do; a couple, both doctors in Toowoomba, at the end of a six-week holiday; three young Western Australian children travelling with their grandfather, returning home for the start of the school term. All innocent people for whom we continue to grieve.


In response to this horrific crime, the government launched Operation Bring Them Home—our contribution to international efforts to secure, identify and repatriate the remains of the victims, to investigate the cause of the incident and to hold those responsible to account. Australia authored UN Security Council Resolution 2166 which was endorsed unanimously on 21 July. It called for a ceasefire to access the crash site and a full, thorough and independent investigation into the downing of MH17. During that debate I said:


Our resolution demands that armed groups in control of the crash site provide safe access immediately to allow for the recovery of the bodies, and that these armed groups stop any actions that compromise the integrity of the crash site. This is imperative.


There must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site. The victims must be treated with dignity, brought back to their homes and laid to rest. All parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts. Russia must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this. Russia must also use its influence to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.


Our resolution also demands a full, thorough and independent international investigation into this act. We must have answers. We must have justice. We owe it to the victims and their families to determine what happened and who was responsible.


Over 500 Australian police, military, diplomatic and consular personnel were deployed to Ukraine and the Netherlands in support of these efforts. As of today, 251 victims have been identified by the Identification Commission in The Hague. We have representation on that commission and its work is assisted by a number of technical experts from Australia. 


Out of respect for the families involved, I will not confirm the number of Australian victims that have been identified to date, however it will be some time before the identification process is complete. I attended two memorial services at Eindhoven airbase in the Netherlands and I acknowledge again the outstanding efforts of the Netherlands in bringing dignity and respect to the retrieval process. 


In parallel to the process of recovering, identifying and repatriating remains, an investigation into the cause of the crash, as required by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, is underway. The investigation has broad international participation, drawing on experts from France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organisation. 


On 9 September, the preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board into the incident was released. Its purpose is to determine the cause of the incident from an aviation perspective, not to attribute blame or liability. I welcome the preliminary report as a clear step towards achieving the full, thorough and independent international investigation sought by Resolution 2166. The damage to the aircraft documented in this preliminary report is consistent with the Australian government's initial assessment - voiced as early as the morning of 18 July—that MH17 had been shot down by a surface-to-air missile from Ukrainian territory under the control of Russian-backed separatists. On 19 September I attended a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York on MH17. Members of the Security Council firmly rejected Russia's attempt to discredit the investigation into the downing of MH17 and reaffirmed their support for the International Dutch-led criminal investigation. 


At that meeting, I thanked the government of the Netherlands for its professional leadership of the investigation. I underlined Australia's commitment to return investigators to the crash site when it was safe to do so, in the company of our Dutch and Malaysian partners. 


The separate Dutch-led investigation into who was responsible for this crime is an ongoing process. Australia has been providing all possible assistance. We are under no illusions about the challenges involved in identifying the perpetrators but we are determined to do everything we can to deliver justice for the victims of MH17 and their families.


In order to deploy to and operate in the Netherlands the Department of Defence and the Australian Federal Police required certain rights and protections. The Netherlands advised that it was only able to grant such rights and protections under a treaty-status agreement enforceable before Dutch courts of law. This treaty defines the scope of permissible Australian activity in the Netherlands. It provides that Australians deployed to the Netherlands remain under Australia's command and control and that any necessary administrative or disciplinary action will be taken by Australia, not the Netherlands. The treaty extends privileges and immunities to Australian personnel and authorises them to carry weapons. It enables them to wear field uniforms and regulates information sharing and disclosure.


The treaty was signed and entered into force on 1 August this year. The government relied on the national interest exemption to take binding treaty action before the treaty was tabled in parliament. This was imperative to ensure that all necessary personnel and equipment could be deployed to the Netherlands without delay and to ensure that all personnel, including those present in the Netherlands before the treaty's entry into force, were accorded appropriate protections. 


Responding to crises such as the tragic downing of MH17 is the type of situation envisaged by the national interest exemption. From the moment we heard the news of this tragedy, Australia has played a critical role in the international response. 


I again pay tribute to the large number of dedicated Australians who worked tirelessly and are still working to retrieve and identify remains, liaise with family members and investigate the shooting down of MH17.


I commend the treaty to the parliament as a critical element of the legal framework that was necessary to ensure that representatives of our country have all of the rights and protections they need to continue to fulfil our commitment to bring our people home. I table a copy of the treaty between Australia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the presence of Australian personnel in the Netherlands for the purpose of responding to the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:10):  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for giving me the opportunity to respond to her statement. In this, as in all things related to MH17, the opposition supports the government. The opposition welcomes the tabling of the treaty between Australia and the Kingdom of Netherlands on the presence of Australian personnel in the Netherlands for the purpose of responding to the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.


There are dates that stick with us—the years of war and the days of loss. These include 11 September 2001, October 2005—the Bali bombing—and now 17 July. Each of us can no doubt remember exactly where we were and what we were doing when we first heard news of the tragic downing of MH17 on 17 July this year. We know that 298 people on board lost their lives and that 38 of those victims called Australia their home. Beyond the dates and numbers, we have come to know the personal stories of many of those who were on MH17—Emma Bell, the teacher working in the Northern Territory community of Maningrida where Aboriginal elders held a smoking ceremony last month to remember her; Gary and Mona Lee, who migrated to Australia in the 1970s; Sister Philomene Tiernan, a nun from Sydney; Perth resident Nick Norris and his three grandchildren, Evie, Mo and Otis Maslin; Johannes Van Den Hende, his wife, Shaliza Zain Dewa, and their children, Margaux, Marnix and Piers; researchers travelling to the 2014 AIDS conference in Melbourne, including the former president of the international AIDS society, Joep Lange.


We know so many of the names and stories but so little of the grief of their families. The Leader of the Opposition and I and many members of the parliament on both sides were pleased to join the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the government for a very moving memorial service in Melbourne. We attended a memorial service in Sydney too. Right around Australia families are grieving privately for the people they have lost. Much of the past two months has been about coming to terms with what we saw on that tragic day in July.


We have seen the efforts made by our investigators as part an international effort to bring to justice those responsible for this terrible crime—unexpected, unjust and unjustifiable. The shooting down of an unarmed passenger jet in civilian airspace demands answers. It also demands a reconnection of those grieving families with something of the people that they have lost. James and Vanessa Rizk lost their parents Albert and Maree. They held a memorial service in early August, with more than a thousand mourners, and were later able to hold a private family funeral for their parents. The family of Mary and Jerry Menke from Mallacoota said:


We look forward to receiving Mary and Gerry again soon in the place and the community they loved so much and which loved them.


The work of returning the remains of those who lost their lives to Australia is phenomenally important for their families—those last objects that their loved ones touched, the things that they were holding and handling on that flight home.


The efforts of the international team have been helping families around the world to both understand the source of this crime and have their loved ones returned to them. One of the pilots, Captain Eugene Choo Jin Leong, was returned to his family for a funeral service in Malaysia. His friend, another pilot, Azlan Abu Bakar, described flying home from the Netherlands, saying:


It was horrible bringing my very close friend. We used to fly together, and this time we fly together again but in difference situation.


And yet, as difficult as that journey was for that pilot, to be able to bring home the remains of his friend to rest in an urn in his family home and allow his family to grieve for him properly and to pay their respects of course is very important work.


The mission that the Australian personnel and their international partners have carried out has been done with distinction in extremely challenging circumstances. We heard reports of a team spending seven hours and, at times, avoiding arms fire to retrieve very small pieces of debris and a silver necklace. It is completely unacceptable that participants in this conflict on Ukrainian soil were not able to afford safe passage and security to the international team of experts working on the MH17 crash site. Of course, Russia must accept its share of responsibility for the ongoing instability in the Ukraine and must fully cooperate with efforts to understand the chain of events which led to this crash.


Australia has been an international leader in the discussion about the investigation following the moving of resolution 2166 in the UN Security Council. This is exactly the sort of use that we envisaged for Australia's representation on the Security Council when we argued so hard that a country of Australia's stature deserved its place on the Security Council.


Given the seriousness of the tragedy and the urgency of the efforts by Australian personnel overseas, the treaty being tabled today forms an important part of our national response. The treaty was signed and entered into force on 1 August this year and acknowledges the responsibilities of Australian personnel, including to respect the sovereignty and the laws of the Netherlands. The treaty also affords our personnel rights and protections during their important work, including allowing them to carry weapons and wear field uniform. The arrangements provide that Australian personnel will remain under Australia's command and any necessary administrative or disciplinary action will be taken by Australia. The opposition notes that the government relied on the national interest exemption to take binding treaty action before the treaty was tabled in the parliament. We accept that the time sensitivity of the situation at hand and the primacy of affording proper protection to Australian personnel from the Department of Defence and the Australian Federal Police have made this necessary. I welcome the tabling of this treaty and commend it to the parliament.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (12:18):  The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is a legislative safety net scheme to ensure that people who lose their job receive reasonable entitlements. It is a last resort that covers certain unpaid employment entitlements when employees lose their jobs through the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employer.


In 2012, Labor passed the Fair Entitlements Guarantee legislation, which delivered the strongest protections for workers' entitlements ever seen in this country and replaced the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, which the minister referred to in his second reading speech. It is important for the House to note that there was no legislative basis for GEERS. It was simply an administrative arrangement operated by the department in accordance with the GEERS's operating arrangements. Therefore, this would have made it fairly easy for the government that proposed it or, indeed, any future government to amend or dismantle the scheme. I note also that it may well have been the government's intention to do exactly that sometime after it was introduced. Indeed, it may well be the intention of the government now.


Labor, of course, legislated our scheme, and I think it is fortunate that we did, because the Fair Entitlements Guarantee is under assault by this government—by the Prime Minister, by the Minister for Employment and by other ministers, who support cutting away the safety net for thousands upon thousands of Australian workers who may lose their jobs through no fault of their own. We legislated because Labor are the party of jobs and Labor are the party for workers.


In this bill, among other things the government seeks to cut the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. It is important for context to note that this is a recommendation from the National Commission of Audit, an audit that was undertaken, effectively, by the Business Council of Australia—big business, making a decision on whether workers deserve an entitlement pursuant to an enterprise agreement that they bargained at the workplace. That audit and the Business Council of Australia, in a very self-interested and self-serving way, recommended the abolition of the legislation that would affect these workers.


The government's proposal, in effect, would change the maximum payment from four weeks per year of service to a maximum of 16 weeks, regardless of how many years a worker may have served—whether they have served 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or, in some cases, as we know, 40 years with a company. The government's proposal to change the maximum payment from four weeks per year of service is a problem. The changes to FEG spell disaster for workers in many sectors of our economy. Make no mistake, the intent of this bill is a simple proposition to undermine the safety net afforded to those workers pursuant to an industrial instrument that has been affirmed by the commission and agreed to by the employer.


If passed into law this cut will have a seriously detrimental effect on the lives and living standards of those Australians who lose their wages and entitlements although they are not the cause of that loss. Let's consider, therefore, exactly what the government's cut to the scheme will mean. One example is that of a number of workers from ACL in Launceston who lose their jobs in 2009 under the old GEERS scheme, which also capped redundancy entitlements at 16 weeks. There was one worker who had over 40 years of service who would have been owed in excess of $100,000; but, because of the limits of GEERS at the time, he received less than $30,000—a worker whose family missed out on over $80,000 in payments, a payment that would have seen this worker enjoy an adequate retirement. It would not be a rich retirement, not one that would allow him necessarily to do all sorts of things beyond what a decent hard worker deserves but an adequate retirement. It was a payment that would have given a respectful end to his years of commitment and hard work not only for that factory and community but for this country.


Another example is when Melbatex Pty Ltd went into liquidation in 2009. A longstanding collective agreement which included redundancy provisions was in place. However, the old GEERS, including the 16-week cap, was paid out to the employees. One 59-year-old male employee who had worked for more than 43 years at the time of termination was left with over $98,000 in unpaid severance because he was paid under GEERS and not paid pursuant to the entitlements within the enterprise bargaining agreement negotiated by his employer and the union. Again a great travesty resulted. A 63-year-old woman who had worked for just under 40 years also had about $100,000 severance unpaid.


These examples go to not insignificant amounts of money that these workers did not receive—money that could have made the difference between struggling to make ends meet after decades of work or doing okay and having a decent retirement, something that should be afforded to all Australians. I say that because many of these retrenched employees—and history will bear this out—when they are retrenched near the end of their retirement are not eligible for the pension, because they are too young. The way in which this government is proceeding, of course, they will have to be 70 in the future to receive any pension. And yet they are having grave difficulties finding work. People who have worked all their lives and who want to work cannot find sufficient work to provide them and their families sustenance and a reasonable standard of living. They will be in a position where they fall between the stools of public policy: not old enough to reach the pension; too old, it would appear, to be re-employed, because of a whole series of reasons which sometimes go to discrimination towards older workers, which for the life of me I do not understand, because they are equipped with experience, wisdom and a history of good work—we can see a situation where there are people who will be left adrift as a result, and that is the reason we have a problem with this proposed legislation.


On this side of the House we know that employees who lose their jobs through insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer have enough to worry about. They have to worry about paying the kids' school fees, buying their children's clothes, helping grown-up kids at university, making the mortgage payments or finding the money to cover unexpected bills or emergency situations. That is why we believe that these employees should not have to worry about being paid what they are entitled to under law and have now lost through no fault of their own.


The government's cuts to the scheme, the opposition argues, disproportionately affects older Australians. The government has overlooked or, worse still, deliberately neglected to consider the impact the changes will have on mature-age workers who are unemployed, as I referred to earlier. The outcome that will occur from the proposed changes should they be enacted are contrary to the government's other policy objectives, including, as I said earlier, the raising of the pension age to 70 and also the change of indexation for the rates of the pension, which will see the deterioration in real terms of the pension over coming years.


This contradiction in terms leads us to think about the rationale behind the change. In the end I can only conclude that this is an ideological assault on workers and their families. Employees who have significant redundancy entitlements have only accrued them through long-term employment at a particular workplace, and it is only payable once their employment has been terminated under certain circumstances.


Labor knows the difficulties older Australians have getting back into the workforce. I think the government, in their own small way, have sought to fix this problem—or at least mitigate against the problems that older workers have confronted. They did so with the introduction of the Restart program. Whilst I do not agree with all of the elements of the Restart program I think that that program is an effort to encourage employers to employ older Australians—I think it is Australians over the age of 50—to get into work if they are disconnected from the labour market. Whilst we will have to see whether it is an effective initiative, I think there is an intention behind it.


However, at the same time, we are going to have older workers losing jobs because our economy is in transition, with much structural change. Yet this bill will tear away entitlements for so many people. We will have to wait and see about the effectiveness of the Restart program—providing money to employers, effectively, to employ older Australians—but this bill, if enacted, would rip away elements of the safety net for people in particular industries where those industries are faced with major challenges at best. In some cases—for example, the car industry—under this government we have already seen a death notice.


Labor knows that the difficulties that workers confront in certain sectors of our economy are greater than in others, particularly in manufacturing, automotive, textile, timber and wood product industries. We are committed to finding ways to assist these people—not drag them down. The decision to cut the Fair Entitlements Guarantee is particularly galling given the government's dismantlement of the automotive sector of Australia. 


The sector will be hit, and hit hard. The cut to the FEG, as it is known, is compounded by cuts to the Automotive Transformation Scheme and other industry programs. The Labor scheme encouraged competitive investment and innovation in the Australian automotive industry to place it on an economically sustainable footing. Yet, in the budget papers, the budget states that it will save $618.5 million by terminating such a scheme from 1 January 2018. This includes $200 million in cuts over the next two years—long before the scheduled closures of manufacturing operations for Ford, Holden and Toyota. 


We can remember what happened in this place in December. The Treasurer of this nation stood up and goaded Holden to leave our shores. The next day, Holden decided to take the advice of the Treasurer. How do you keep companies like Holden in Australia when the federal government turns its back on the industry and that particular company? The consequence of that decision by Holden—followed by Toyota—is that there will be more workers who will be in exactly the position where they will be relying upon the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. The consequences will run through the automotive parts sector of our economy. Smaller medium enterprises are more likely to go into liquidation or be declared bankrupt. We will have thousands of workers affected. Areas affected will not be confined to South Australia and Melbourne and pockets around the country; the automotive parts sector of our economy runs right up the east coast, including in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and beyond—to the west.


I should add that this is a direct contradiction to what Assistant Minister Briggs said before the election, when he said:


The Coalition has committed to ongoing support for the auto industry and has agreed to continue funding the Automotive Transformation Scheme.


He is from South Australia so he would say that, but unfortunately that is not true. That has been cut. And, as I said, this comes on top of the Treasurer rising to his feet to speak about this in the parliament earlier. So you can imagine how workers are feeling when, on one hand, they see the government turning its back on a sector of our economy which is vital for manufacturing, and, on the other hand, they see legislation incidental to that decision—namely the underwriting and supporting of fair entitlements—being enacted by the government to take away what might be their only support when the sector suffers from the major car companies leaving and other effects on the sector more generally.


There are workers who have been in the automotive manufacturing and supply chain that have been there for many, many years. Under the current scheme they would be entitled to FEG based on their years of service. Under the government scheme, if it is enacted, they will be entitled to 16 weeks maximum, irrespective of their service. 


As I have said, the government has overseen the death of the automotive manufacturing sector, which I think has dire consequences for the rest of the supply chain. As I said earlier, the government should think about how this legislation will intersect with what is happening in the real economy—in certain sectors of the labour market. In consultations, Labor has heard from the automotive sector stakeholders, who are deeply concerned that the changes to the FEG may act as an incentive for vulnerable automotive component manufacturers to close their doors early, while their employees remain covered by the current FEG arrangements. 


In particular, if automotive component manufacturers close early this may deprive car makers of key components for the assembly of their vehicles, making continued production of specific models no longer possible. With a knock-on effect, this, in turn, make cause or precipitate the early closure of production at Ford, Toyota and Holden, which will in turn potentially result in the early closure of further automotive component producers that supply other car makers.


In this way, the closure of two or three small automotive component manufacturers may spark that mass closure of automotive manufacturing in a short period of time. Fifty thousand jobs directly depend on the automotive industry, and another 200,000 indirectly depend on it. I would strongly argue that the government's decision to cut the FEG could result in accelerating that transition or those closures, those changes and those job cuts.


These job cuts that will take place through to when car manufacturing ceases in Australia are a direct result of the government's actions. With the cut to the FEG, Prime Minister Abbott is rubbing salt into the wounds of the automotive sector workers and their families. Everything this government seems to do this about attacking workers, not supporting workers, not supporting conditions of employment, or taking conditions of employment away. It is not just the automotive sector that will be hit by these cuts; there are those in the textile-clothing sector, the childcare sector, nursing and manufacturing—the list goes on and on.


Given that Mr Abetz is charged with responsibility for this piece of legislation, perhaps the most unconscionable but, sadly, not surprising component of this cut to the FEG is that the government made no mention of it before the election. In fact, before the election the then shadow minister, the now Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, gave a concrete commitment not to change the FEG. He said, 'As far as I can see, it's as sound as a pound.' At least his words were; his deed clearly was not.


On 17 July 2013, in response to a letter from automotive car company worker Pierre Rault from Dandenong South, Minister Abetz, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and shadow minister for employment, wrote:


…you can be assured that the Coalition would not seek to do anything to water down these important protections for Australian workers. Some seven weeks ago or so, I released the Coalition's Workplace Relations policy with the Coalition leader, Mr Tony Abbott. We were explicit in the policy that but for the changes proposed in that document we would not make any other changes.


That letter is in direct defiance of this bill. However, here we are today in this House debating a bill that contains yet another broken promise. It may well be the tactic of the government that, if you break so many promises, people just will not notice; there are so many of them that you run out of puff just trying to get through them all. But cutting the entitlements for workers when you expressly send a letter to a worker who will be directly affected saying that there will not be such changes is unconscionable, reprehensible behaviour.


I would like to know—as would the opposition generally and, more importantly, thousands and thousands of Australian workers—why the minister broke the personal promise he made in his letter by reducing workers' entitlements under the FEG if this bill is enacted. I think it is a reasonable question to ask the minister. The Leader of the Senate put his signature to a statement prior to the election assuring the worker. He said: 'No problems, we won't hurt you, we're up front, we're going to do what we say, no excuses, no surprises.' How could it be that the sentiments in this letter are so starkly different from the provisions of this bill? Why was the minister assuring hardworking Australians that you can be 'satisfied there is no risk to your entitlements' before the election, only to break the promise after the election?


Despite telling voters before the election that they would not make changes to workers' pay and conditions the government is slowly eroding our industrial relations system. Again, this is an element of what was then Work Choices, and that is of grave concern to the opposition. The former Labor government stood up for workers. We supported ways to improve employment. In response to the global financial crisis, we responded quickly and sufficiently to support or even in some cases create, in total, approximately 200,000 jobs. In this area Labor was proud of the fact that we managed to ensure that unpaid entitlements were being provided in many instances to 70,000 employees who would have missed out.


Instead of demonising hardworking Australian workers, the government should be getting on with articulating a plan for jobs. As we know, unemployment has been rising. The unemployment rate is in excess of six per cent. I heard Minister Pyne say on some TV show last night that there was no crisis in youth unemployment. Youth unemployment is now at 13.4 per cent nationally—more than double the national average—and in some areas it is north of 20 per cent. In northern Tasmania it is 20 per cent. In northern Adelaide it is more than 20 per cent. At the same time that unemployment is rising among young people this government wants to rip away any support whatsoever for those workers by not giving them any support in the form of either Newstart or youth allowance. That is just another element of the cruelty of this government. 


Demonising the unemployed and going after everyone under the age of 30—even if they look for a job each day, each week, each month, for six months they do not receive one cent—the government is in breach of the principles of mutual obligation. On top of all of those things this bill will hurt workers who are most likely to be vulnerable to companies going into liquidation or bankruptcy. It could not be a worse time for this bill to come in. It is a perfect storm for workers in manufacturing. It is an outrage that the government would have the gall to introduce this bill even though it is in complete contradiction to the minister's own letter that he actually wrote and sent to a worker in Dandenong in Melbourne.


This is a bad bill. This will only hurt those workers who need the support from government the most. It is going to hurt older Australians who are going to struggle finding work in some instances. It is going to make it harder at a time when the government itself is suggesting that the pension should not even kick in until you are 70. If you are going to have car workers being made redundant at 50. They are not all going to find work under the Restart program. That program is not travelling particularly well at the moment. I hope it does get better results than it has done to date, but so far it is not doing the job that was intended. This is a recipe for disaster for so many workers and their families that the government should rethink its position.


I understand there is one government member to speak on this bill—to his credit, because he has to support the bill. The member for Hughes I think it is; is that right?




Mr Taylor:
  Hume.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Sorry, Hume; my apologies. Good on the member for Hume for being the only government member so far on the speakers list—




Mr Laming:
  Don't push it!




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Great. Now we are going to have his colleague from Queensland get up as well. I want as many government members speaking on this as possible. I want their comments and defence of this bill on the record so when the thousands of workers start losing their jobs as a result of Joe Hockey and this government turning their backs on the car industry we can say: 'If you want to understand why you are not receiving a decent benefit, even after working 40 years in a workplace, you can thank the Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, and all the other frontbenchers.' But who is here to defend them? A backbencher has decided to defend them. There are no frontbenchers defending this. I cannot wait to hear Minister Abetz's defence of this, because it is reprehensible. It is a breach of faith. It is contradicting the promises made before the election. It is attacking the needs of workers who are going to struggle if this legislation is passed.


I ask the government to rethink its position. The intersection between what is happening in the car industry and other industries because our economy is in transition—and we know that there are challenges—is the perfect storm and is going to mean that people will drown economically as a result. I assert that the government should rethink its position because the bill is harsh, it is in contradiction to the government's commitments before the election and it is going to hurt older Australians most of all—not just older Australians but many who have worked 40 years building the company, building the community and building this country. I seek leave to table the letter from Minister Abetz to Mr Rault confirming that there would be no changes to these entitlements.


Leave not granted.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-09-30,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (12:47):  I rise today to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014. I am pleased to do so because this bill is critical for the sustainability of an important program in a budget environment where every dollar must be targeted for maximum impact after the spendathon of the previous government. Under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, the FEG scheme, the government covers unpaid entitlements to eligible employees who lose their jobs due to liquidation or insolvency of their employer. We should note that the predecessor scheme—the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme or GEERS—was established by the Howard government in 2001. I know many members of this government in this parliament are proud of having established that incredibly important program that we continue to support today. 


These are intended to be safety net schemes of last resort covering some entitlements. That is how they were established and that is how they continue. Neither scheme was designed to cover all entitlements, despite what we heard from the member for Gorton. As it currently stands, FEG provides assistance for up to 13 weeks of unpaid wages, annual leave, long service leave, payment in lieu of notice to a maximum of five weeks and redundancy pay to a maximum of four weeks per full year of service. So there are caps in place and there will continue to be caps in place because this program must be sustainable given its importance.


The rationale for the scheme is very clear. We know that secured lenders and even large unsecured lenders have the resources and ability to make informed decisions when they take on credit risks. They are able to better manage those risks by diversifying and even avoiding the risks in the first place and they are able to absorb the risks if they come out the wrong way. In the case of employees the situation is much more difficult. They do not have the resources and skills to assess risks. It is much more difficult to manage those risks, even if they can assess them in the first place, and losses to most employees are more dire—often they will lose all of their income over an extended period of time. So for this reason we put the scheme in place. We continue to support the FEG scheme, but we need to make changes to ensure that it continues to operate.


In my electorate of Hume this program has been critical in recent times. The steel manufacturer National Engineering based in Young went into voluntary administration on 28 October last year, leaving some 38 employees without a job. Subsequently, the company moved into liquidation on 3 December in the same year. For a while it looked as though employees would not get their entitlements before Christmas, and it was a stressful time for staff and their families, but with excellent support from the office of the Minister for Employment and liaison between the Department of Employment and the insolvency practitioner over the period of administration we succeeded. More than $550,000 was approved under the FEG for unpaid wages, annual leave, long service leave, payment in lieu of notice and redundancy pay. Payments were received by Christmas for the employees who lodged claims. It is absolutely critical for my electorate and many others that this program be sustainable.


The bill in front of the House will give effect to the 2014-15 budget measure to protect the financial sustainability of the scheme. Instead of allowing a maximum of four weeks per full year of service, it will restore the previous cap on redundancy pay entitlements to 16 weeks of pay, which applied prior to 2012 and worked extremely well and extremely effectively for the 11 years it had already been in place under the previous Howard government and the Rudd and Gillard governments. The measure will save almost $80 million over the forward estimates by capping the redundancy payments. The FEG Amendment Bill impacts on the redundancy pay entitlement only. All other entitlements are absolutely untouched. It is important to note—and I will talk about this a little more later—capping the entitlement to 16 weeks will bring the redundancy entitlement in line with the National Employment Standards contained in the Fair Work Act and the rules that existed under GEERS prior to 2012, as I said a moment ago.


The bill also makes a series of technical amendments. The technical amendments are not controversial and can be considered housekeeping. I noticed that the member for Gorton did not raise any of these amendments in his speech. They are being introduced at the suggestion of the Department of Employment in order to clarify the operation of the act. They include establishing a funding source in the legislation for certain legal costs associated with the AAT appeals against FEG decisions; clarifying that the death of a person does not prevent the person being eligible for an advance—of course, the member for Gorton did not mention this one, which is of great benefit to employees in difficult situations—enabling the next of kin or the state to pursue a claim; clarifying that when a debt owed by claimant to his or her employee is greater than the entitlement, it can be offset against any of the claimants other employment entitlements under the scheme; and removing the eligibility requirement that a person who has owed debts prior to the insolvency event happening to their employer must have taken reasonable steps to be paid those debts. But, importantly, the legislation only allows the secretary to reduce a person's entitlement by the amount of any debts that he or she did not take reasonable steps to be paid. At the moment, if they do not take those steps, then in fact they lose all of their entitlements. So all of these are important amendments largely in favour of the employee or former employee.


Let me just spend a moment on why it is so important that we pass this bill. Of course, at the top of the list is the need for fiscal sustainability across all our programs, something that those on the other side of the House seem to still be in denial about, to still ignore in their claim that every bit of spending should remain. There are two critical but distinct parts of the government's focus on fiscal sustainability. Firstly, of course, is getting the budget back to surplus over the forward estimates, made more challenging by the serious economic headwinds we face—a falloff in the terms of trade and mining investment, falling company tax revenues, and the end of the consumption boom driving GST revenues, none of which those opposite seem to take into account in their thinking about how they would spend money if they were in government and how they spent money when they were in government.


Secondly, but as importantly, we need to ensure that we have a long-term sustainability in our budget. The Parliamentary Budget Office tells us that under the last government spending was rising at 3.8 per cent a year and yet we can expect revenue to only rise at something like three per cent. You do not have to be the world's greatest mathematician to work out that this is a serious problem. This is a fiscal cliff and we are going over it and if we do not deal with it one of two things must happen. One we have a massive tax hike—massive. Right now we have tax at about 23 per cent of GDP. If we were to allow this to continue, a simple two line spreadsheet will tell you that within a short period of time federal tax will have to rise to 30 per cent of GDP. Go tell that to your employees, your constituents, your taxpayers. Those on the other side of the House seemed to have no regard for the future taxpayers of this country.


Of course, one of the great disappointments about the way the PBO works at the moment is that it does not demand the opposition put its estimates, put its spending promises beyond the forward estimates, out for scrutiny. That is something that desperately needs to be changed. The spending promises of the last Labor government—and no doubt the opposition, as we move before the next election—beyond the forward estimates are not subject to scrutiny and absolutely should be, because we need to make it absolutely crystal clear which side of the parliament is ensuring that future taxpayers do not have to wear the profligate spending of those on the side of the House.


To keep the FEG scheme viable, it is clear that we need to make changes. It has grown absolutely dramatically, with demand increasing from 8,626 claimants being paid $73 million in 2006-07, a very sustainable number, to 16,019 claimants being paid $262 million, almost 3½ times what it was six years earlier, in 2012-13. This increase is absolutely unsustainable. It is exactly the sort of increase we see from those opposite in so many of the programs that they oversaw, and in this case they enshrined in legislation. From a budgetary point of view the current four weeks redundancy paid for each year is no longer sustainable and setting the entitlements to 16 weeks in total is fiscally responsible.


It is important to note that, as I mentioned earlier, capping the redundancy payment will bring the FEG in line with Labor's National Employment Standards and the Fair Work Act of 2009. The current redundancy benefit under FEG provides for four weeks' pay for every year of service. We know that that is well above the standard set in the National Employment Standards outlined in the Fair Work Act. In fact, Labor has told us that the National Employment Standards in that act got the balance right and sets a community standard. Yet they are not prepared to support it in this legislation. The hypocrisy we see continually from those opposite is awe inspiring, it is extraordinary. It is not good enough and that is why we are proposing this change, remembering that this is a scheme of last resort that should only cover redundancies that are in line with the community standard. It should be noted that the scheme already has a cap on maximum wages of $127,000 per annum. So there are caps everywhere already in this scheme. That reflects the intent of the scheme that more generous remuneration above community standards should not be covered by a safety net scheme.


We have heard many in the community supporting this cap. The AiG said:


The 16 week cap mirrors the entitlement to redundancy under the National Employment Standards and hence reflects community standards ... 


The Master Builders Association submitted similar things to the Senate inquiry on the issue and said that the general redundancy standard put in place by Labor was out of step with the general community standard and suggested that the proposed cap be brought in line with the community standard. Both the Ai Group and ACCI said that a publicly funded safety net scheme is necessary to protect workers as employers went bankrupt but they both stressed that it should offer an appropriate level of protection. It is also important to note this bill only impacts a small proportion of claimants. It turns out that historically, over the three-year period, there were 41,393 claimants on this scheme and this change will only affect 2,446, or six per cent. The vast majority of claimants would be totally unaffected and those claimants who are affected will only be affected in a relatively small way, in the vast majority of cases.


As I said earlier, the bill only affects the redundancy entitlement and all other entitlements are unchanged. It is important also to note the bill removes a moral hazard—the sort of moral hazard those opposite seem to like. The thing as it stands creates a moral hazard whereby unions, company directors, CEOs or business owners can inflate redundancy entitlements when companies are in trouble and the taxpayer will pick up the tab when the company goes broke. It is not the sort of moral hazard the Australian people would find acceptable. The Ai Group discussed this fact and said there are major moral hazards present in the current legislative provisions, because there is little protection against employers being coerced by unions into implementing extremely generous redundancy packages in the lead up to insolvency, leaving taxpayers picking up the tab. We had similar comments from ACCI, which said:


What I am saying is that the potential arises in the dynamic it introduces into negotiations. It is one thing for two parties to sit down and negotiate terms and conditions, but if they know at the back of their minds that ultimately the government will pick up this entitlement our proposition is that that will impact on the bargaining dynamic.


The sustainability of well-directed and high-quality government programs is the focus of this government and should be the focus of future governments of Australia. This bill is intended to do exactly that. This is an important program and losing it, and others like it, because of unsustainable growth in spending is totally unacceptable. I commend this bill to the House.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (13:01): I also rise to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014 but, unlike the previous speaker, I oppose this bill. I oppose the amendments to the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act of 2012 and what this bill seeks to do.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is a legislative safety net. It is there to protect workers who, through no fault of their own, lose their jobs through the bankruptcy or liquidation of companies. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is a scheme designed to ensure fairness for working people. One of the things I have a degree of understanding of, having an electorate with a very high degree of unemployment and also having family members who have lost their jobs principally through the liquidation of the company, is how this impacts on families. I know how a family member can go to work only to be told with no notice that there is no further job, that for financial reasons liquidation is necessary: 'Please remove all your belongings, files and any other personal effects and exit the premises.' That happened to my son. I know how devastating it was for him and his family. They had a mortgage and school fees to pay. It had an absolutely huge impact. If you multiply that impact electorate wide, it is easy to understand the importance of having safety-net legislation.


Members opposite, cast your minds back. We did not always have a safety net. Remember, back in the year 2000, there was the unfortunate and unexpected liquidation of a particular company called National Textiles. The then Prime Minister's brother happened to be on the board of directors of that company. As a consequence of this, and to the considerable embarrassment of the other side, the General Employee Entitlement Redundancy Scheme, the GEERS legislation, came into effect in 2001. Whether it was due to embarrassment or simply feeling it was the right thing to do, it was under the circumstances the right thing to do—not because it was the Prime Minister's brother's company, but because this was one company among many which took the soft way out and liquidated for corporate reasons. This is not something we should be shying away from. It is certainly not, as the previous speaker said, that sometimes these entitlements are so inflated that it amounts to significant corporate spending. This is about trying to do something for people's lives when their company goes into bankruptcy or, more than likely, into liquidation. That is certainly no fault of the employees.


This is an important bill the government is bringing forward because it seeks to undermine the very basis upon which we are trying to protect the entitlements of those employees. The bill will impose caps in terms of payments of entitlements; these will be capped at 16 weeks. The other significant part of this bill will ensure that, as opposed to getting paid at your rate of pay, you will be paid at the level of average weekly earnings. That is a vastly different figure. I understand the speaker opposite, the member for Hume, said it is possible for some people who are earning $100,000 to receive payment at that rate. Yes, it is. It is not a matter of whether they contributed by negligence to bringing down the company; they lost their jobs like anybody else. To simply use the figure of average weekly earnings as the maximum rate for this will have a huge impact on those people unfortunate enough to have to make a claim on this fund.


The bill will also progress three technical amendments that have already been spoken about. It will also amend provisions as to whether a person has reasonably pursued the debt off an employer. It has provisions allowing the cost of appeals to the AAT to be drawn from special appropriations. But I cannot get away from the fact that, like many other pieces of legislation we are seeing at the moment coming from the government benches, this legislation is actually going to undermine workers' entitlements. As I said, this is a legislative safety net, and what do they want to do? They want to wind it back. They want to make sure that you can only get a maximum of 16 weeks, as opposed to four weeks per year of service. They want to make sure that, as opposed to getting your real rate of pay, it is wound back to average weekly earnings.


It is extraordinary the lengths this government will go, I would not say to attack workers but certainly to undermine workers' conditions. I know that during the campaign leading up to the last election the government made it very clear that it was not their intention to move on Work Choices—at least not during the term of this government. But what we have seen is a never-ending pattern of going out and undermining workers' entitlements and workers' conditions. As the member for Hume said, people should not get used to being in an environment of spending. I agree with that. But is it only the workers who they are going to take the stick to when they want to curtail spending? 


I was reading over the weekend about what is happening in corporate taxation. Gee, that is a first. The government certainly does not want to get too close to this issue. I suspect that many of the companies that have been cited may be principal donors to the Liberal Party. This report, Who pays for our common wealth?, says that a third of Australia's largest companies pay less than 10c in the dollar in corporate tax. Ten cents in the dollar! That is a long way behind what they expect employees to pay. The report also found that 84 per cent of Australia's top 200 companies listed on the Australian stock exchange pay less than 30c in the dollar, which is the corporate tax rate.


On one hand, the government want to take every opportunity to wind back workers' conditions and to wind back protections that do nothing more than protect employees and their families—particularly in this case, where through no fault of their own a company goes into liquidation or bankruptcy. But, on the other hand, they certainly do not want to move with any great haste to do anything about corporate taxation. When you look at the top 200 companies, it works out that, if they paid the corporate taxation rate, the budget would gain $8.4 billion or more a year in revenue. That is almost the total savings that the government expects to make by slashing pensions, by bringing in the new GP tax and by cutting programs to Indigenous Australians. They certainly have their priorities very much skewed when it comes to this. I suspect there is a reason for it. They have a philosophical reason for winding back the entitlements for employees.


It is with regret that we find that we need to oppose this. I would have thought that those opposite would have had some regard for the whole concept emanating out of events such as the falling over of National Textiles, whether by embarrassment or otherwise. John Howard brought in the GEERS legislation back in 2001. Sure, that was a capped piece of legislation, but it was not restricted in terms of the earning rates. But they are simply winding back what we have now, what was provided under GEERS, to 16 weeks. They are also putting an extra imposition on, meaning that any worker who has not been able to gain their entitlements from a failed company going through liquidation or bankruptcy must make every attempt to pursue a company—which, unless workers have a trade union to go through, would be a very litigious route and would probably be pretty expensive. The government is also ensuring that those workers do not get payments based on their rate of pay but on average weekly earnings.


I will go back to where I started: this is going to impact on lots and lots of people. I have the experience of seeing my own family go through a liquidation and a forced redundancy, with no knowledge of it occurring other than the fact of being escorted to a gate and being locked out, along with every other employee who lost their job. This has a devastating impact on families and family welfare, and it allows no opportunity for people to plan.


This legislation is very, very retrograde. I am proud to be part of a party that saw fit in 2007 to bring about the fair entitlement guarantee legislation and I am proud of the fact that, since 2007, more than $852 million has been paid out of that scheme, to the benefit of 70,000 Australian workers and their families. I oppose this legislation. I think it is wrong in principle. I think it takes a stick to workers and their families at a time when what they need most is protection. This government has turned its back on them.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:14):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014. This matter is one that is a passion of mine, for reasons that I will set out in a moment. I also understand that industrial relations is a passion of members of the government. However, it must be said that in this particular debate that it is a private passion—a very private passion, because there has only been one member of the government willing to come to the chamber today and defend their legislation. Indeed, if there were a standing order that said a government bill had to have a minimum number of government speakers who were willing to stand and speak in defence of it then I am quite certain that this legislation would not get out the gate.


Legislation—the business that a government brings before the House—is a statement of its values and a statement of its priorities. I would like to address some of the priorities and the values that are resplendent within this legislation. As the member for Fowler has just told the House, we are debating this legislation in the very same week that one of the most important reports, that goes to the heart of who is paying tax and who is not paying tax in this country, was published.


Readers of the Sydney Morning Herald woke with quite some alarm when they picked up the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday and saw that almost one-third of the nation's top 200 companies are paying less tax—in fact, they are paying less than 10c in the dollar—and that if you put end-to-end the amount of tax that has been evaded as a result of these deliberate decisions by some of the largest companies in the country, you would have an additional $80 billion in government revenue.


I ask you think about that for a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we have a bill before the House today which finds its genesis in the Commission of Audit—the massive beat-up by the government to try to alarm the population that there was somehow a budget emergency. Hidden within the report was the proposition to wind back the provisions within the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act to a bare minimum because we had a budget emergency.


Nowhere in the Commission of Audit did we find the commissioners drawing attention to the tax avoidance and tax evasion which has led to over $80 billion not finding its way into government coffers and not finding its way out of those coffers again into important public spending programs—roads, infrastructure, education, hospitals and important employee protection schemes such as those before the House today. Again, I make the point that the legislation before the House today is a statement of values and priorities. Instead of pursuing measures which would help the government buttress the problem that we all know is the problem, and that is a problem of revenue, they are going after basic entitlements.


This matter is one that is very close to my heart because before coming into the parliament I spent more than a little bit of time working in the area of insolvency and helping workers to chase down their entitlements that had been lost once a business went into liquidation. It was more than a little bit of time on them and in some quite high-profile matters indeed. So it is an important scheme. It is one that I have more than a little bit of knowledge of and I wish that those members opposite informed themselves a little bit more about the legislation that they are all going to career in here to vote in favour of—without having read it and without having spoken in favour of it, because that might change their minds.


We know that there are around 7,000 businesses which fail every year. About half of those businesses cause their employees to lose entitlements—entitlements such as long service leave, holiday and sick pay and redundancy payments—things that provisions have not been made for. We know that there have been around 885 business related bankruptcies cases in the June quarter alone. Total debtors exceeded 1,100 for the same period and between 2001 and 2013 more than $260 million had been advanced under the FEG scheme and its antecedents, the GEER scheme, to over 16,000 Australian workers. So, it is an important scheme. It deserves to have more attention than the House is currently affording it today by the fact that only members of the opposition are speaking on the legislation.


The history of this scheme is well known to many. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that back in 2000 a company known as National Textiles—coincidentally, a company that was owned and operated by the then Prime Minister John Howard's brother, Stan Howard—went into liquidation owing around 340 employees accumulated entitlement, including redundancy pay. This group of employees were amongst the lucky ones. I should say that if anyone who is about to lose their job could be classified as 'lucky', here is a group of employees unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, but 100 per cent of their entitlements were paid eventually; not by the business but by the government moving in and underwriting the bills that were owed by the Prime Minister's brother. Many said at the time—many other employees who had lost their jobs—'If only we could have been so lucky as to have been working for a company that went bust and the owner of that company happened to be a Prime Minister's brother.'


Wind the clock forward to 2001 and to a company by the name of One.Tel. This time the collapse was not a relatively small textile company but probably the fourth-largest telecommunications company in the country at the time, stranding around two million customers and, importantly, owing something in the vicinity of $600 million to over 3,000 creditors. Included within those creditors were the 1,400 employees of One.Tel.


I know a lot about this because I was representing the employees at the time. I remember writing to the then minister for workplace relations, one Tony Abbott, and asking him to intercede on behalf of the workers in a matter that I had before the then Australian Industrial Relations Commission to get some justice for these workers. The then minister for workplace relations refused to do that. Of course a campaign then ensued, a campaign that was supported by the majority of right-thinking Australians, and the then minister for workplace relations got rolled by the then Prime Minister. It was the only occasion in my working life as a lawyer, practising in that particular practice, where I could say I was standing on the same side of the bar table as a member representing a coalition minister for workplace relations. It became clear to all that a general scheme was needed and, as the shadow minister for workplace relations has explained, an administrative scheme was set up, known as the GEER Scheme, and it paid a minimum entitlement to workers in the event that their company went bust and provision had not been made for their accumulated entitlements.


An important point to make, one which is lost on many, is that the payment of the minimum entitlements to the worker who has lost their job is not the end of the story. What happens is the right to pursue the assets of the company, the right to become a creditor of the company, is then assigned to the government. So the government, presumably through the auspices of the tax office or of the department of employment and workplace relations, is assigned the right to pursue those owed entitlements instead of the employee—a matter that is lost on many. And when you are looking to provide a revenue stream and you are looking to address issues such as moral hazard, I would argue that this is an important place to start looking—that is, putting more effort and more resources into the chasing of the assigned debt.


The scheme has been operating since then. It was improved under the former Labor government, to a point where the FEG Act now sets out maximum entitlements and how they are to be calculated. They include up to 13 weeks of unpaid wages, annual leave that has accrued but not been paid, long service leave, a maximum five weeks payment in lieu of notice, and redundancy pay of four weeks per year of service. It is important to make the point that these are not award or agreement rights themselves; these represent the caps or maximum entitlements that may be paid to an employee where they have been unable to recover those entitlements from a collapsed company. The wages were capped at a minimum weekly rate of $2,364 when the scheme began. It has been frozen at $2,451 until 30 June 2018.


You have to ask yourself who has benefited from this scheme. Because the courageous member for Hume has been willing to stand up and defend the scheme, has put his hand up, we know that at least 33 workers from the business National Engineering in his electorate benefited from the scheme. I congratulate the member for Hume for having the courage to come in here and stand up and defend his government's legislation. I warrant you that he would not have had the courage to give that same speech prior to the last election. He would not have been out there promising those 33 workers, 'If you vote for me, I can guarantee you that if your company goes bust you'll get less money under my government than you will under a Labor government.' He would not have given that speech. And I can also guarantee that of all the people that the member for Hume mails his courageous speech out to today, he will not be mailing it out to the 33 workers who had their benefits paid under the existing FEG scheme.


I happen to know a bit about the National Engineering company. It has been in existence for more than 120 years. It is a metalworking company, a blacksmithing company. And I know that its being a business, what was a reasonably good business, in a country town meant it was some of the best work going and that the people who got jobs there, if they were skilled tradesmen, hung on to those jobs; they would work there for a long, long time. So the member for Hume will not be mailing out his speech saying, 'If I had my chance, I would've been cutting your rights to get your wages recovered.' I guarantee he will not be doing that.


Who else has benefited from the scheme? If you have a look at the submission of the department to the Senate inquiry into this scheme you will see that more than 41 per cent of total redundancy payments made have been paid to employees in the manufacturing industry. But you have to ask yourself: why do the government hate workers in the manufacturing industry so much? What is it that they have got against workers in the manufacturing industry? I see the member for Wakefield in the chamber today. He has a keen interest in this issue. I see the member for Hotham in the chamber today; she also has a keen interest in this issue. They are members who have stood up in defence of the manufacturing industry in their electorates—as have the members for Blair and Hunter, who are also in the chamber today. They have been willing to stand up—in fact, one of the most passionate speeches I have heard by a member in this parliament, in the 44th Parliament, was the speech by the member for Wakefield imploring the government not to chase the automotive industry offshore.


So against that background, and knowing that the single biggest group of workers who have benefited under the FEG scheme—more than 41 per cent of workers have benefited—are workers in the manufacturing industry, you have to ask yourself: why does this government hate them so much? It chases their manufacturing jobs offshore and then, at the first opportunity it gets, it seeks to reduce their rights and entitlements and the benefits that could be payable to them under a scheme has worked for close to a decade. We should reject the bill. It is not fair, it is not right and we will be voting against it. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (12:18):  The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is a legislative safety net scheme to ensure that people who lose their job receive reasonable entitlements. It is a last resort that covers certain unpaid employment entitlements when employees lose their jobs through the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employer.


In 2012, Labor passed the Fair Entitlements Guarantee legislation, which delivered the strongest protections for workers' entitlements ever seen in this country and replaced the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, which the minister referred to in his second reading speech. It is important for the House to note that there was no legislative basis for GEERS. It was simply an administrative arrangement operated by the department in accordance with the GEERS's operating arrangements. Therefore, this would have made it fairly easy for the government that proposed it or, indeed, any future government to amend or dismantle the scheme. I note also that it may well have been the government's intention to do exactly that sometime after it was introduced. Indeed, it may well be the intention of the government now.


Labor, of course, legislated our scheme, and I think it is fortunate that we did, because the Fair Entitlements Guarantee is under assault by this government—by the Prime Minister, by the Minister for Employment and by other ministers, who support cutting away the safety net for thousands upon thousands of Australian workers who may lose their jobs through no fault of their own. We legislated because Labor are the party of jobs and Labor are the party for workers.


In this bill, among other things the government seeks to cut the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. It is important for context to note that this is a recommendation from the National Commission of Audit, an audit that was undertaken, effectively, by the Business Council of Australia—big business, making a decision on whether workers deserve an entitlement pursuant to an enterprise agreement that they bargained at the workplace. That audit and the Business Council of Australia, in a very self-interested and self-serving way, recommended the abolition of the legislation that would affect these workers.


The government's proposal, in effect, would change the maximum payment from four weeks per year of service to a maximum of 16 weeks, regardless of how many years a worker may have served—whether they have served 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or, in some cases, as we know, 40 years with a company. The government's proposal to change the maximum payment from four weeks per year of service is a problem. The changes to FEG spell disaster for workers in many sectors of our economy. Make no mistake, the intent of this bill is a simple proposition to undermine the safety net afforded to those workers pursuant to an industrial instrument that has been affirmed by the commission and agreed to by the employer.


If passed into law this cut will have a seriously detrimental effect on the lives and living standards of those Australians who lose their wages and entitlements although they are not the cause of that loss. Let's consider, therefore, exactly what the government's cut to the scheme will mean. One example is that of a number of workers from ACL in Launceston who lose their jobs in 2009 under the old GEERS scheme, which also capped redundancy entitlements at 16 weeks. There was one worker who had over 40 years of service who would have been owed in excess of $100,000; but, because of the limits of GEERS at the time, he received less than $30,000—a worker whose family missed out on over $80,000 in payments, a payment that would have seen this worker enjoy an adequate retirement. It would not be a rich retirement, not one that would allow him necessarily to do all sorts of things beyond what a decent hard worker deserves but an adequate retirement. It was a payment that would have given a respectful end to his years of commitment and hard work not only for that factory and community but for this country.


Another example is when Melbatex Pty Ltd went into liquidation in 2009. A longstanding collective agreement which included redundancy provisions was in place. However, the old GEERS, including the 16-week cap, was paid out to the employees. One 59-year-old male employee who had worked for more than 43 years at the time of termination was left with over $98,000 in unpaid severance because he was paid under GEERS and not paid pursuant to the entitlements within the enterprise bargaining agreement negotiated by his employer and the union. Again a great travesty resulted. A 63-year-old woman who had worked for just under 40 years also had about $100,000 severance unpaid.


These examples go to not insignificant amounts of money that these workers did not receive—money that could have made the difference between struggling to make ends meet after decades of work or doing okay and having a decent retirement, something that should be afforded to all Australians. I say that because many of these retrenched employees—and history will bear this out—when they are retrenched near the end of their retirement are not eligible for the pension, because they are too young. The way in which this government is proceeding, of course, they will have to be 70 in the future to receive any pension. And yet they are having grave difficulties finding work. People who have worked all their lives and who want to work cannot find sufficient work to provide them and their families sustenance and a reasonable standard of living. They will be in a position where they fall between the stools of public policy: not old enough to reach the pension; too old, it would appear, to be re-employed, because of a whole series of reasons which sometimes go to discrimination towards older workers, which for the life of me I do not understand, because they are equipped with experience, wisdom and a history of good work—we can see a situation where there are people who will be left adrift as a result, and that is the reason we have a problem with this proposed legislation.


On this side of the House we know that employees who lose their jobs through insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer have enough to worry about. They have to worry about paying the kids' school fees, buying their children's clothes, helping grown-up kids at university, making the mortgage payments or finding the money to cover unexpected bills or emergency situations. That is why we believe that these employees should not have to worry about being paid what they are entitled to under law and have now lost through no fault of their own.


The government's cuts to the scheme, the opposition argues, disproportionately affects older Australians. The government has overlooked or, worse still, deliberately neglected to consider the impact the changes will have on mature-age workers who are unemployed, as I referred to earlier. The outcome that will occur from the proposed changes should they be enacted are contrary to the government's other policy objectives, including, as I said earlier, the raising of the pension age to 70 and also the change of indexation for the rates of the pension, which will see the deterioration in real terms of the pension over coming years.


This contradiction in terms leads us to think about the rationale behind the change. In the end I can only conclude that this is an ideological assault on workers and their families. Employees who have significant redundancy entitlements have only accrued them through long-term employment at a particular workplace, and it is only payable once their employment has been terminated under certain circumstances.


Labor knows the difficulties older Australians have getting back into the workforce. I think the government, in their own small way, have sought to fix this problem—or at least mitigate against the problems that older workers have confronted. They did so with the introduction of the Restart program. Whilst I do not agree with all of the elements of the Restart program I think that that program is an effort to encourage employers to employ older Australians—I think it is Australians over the age of 50—to get into work if they are disconnected from the labour market. Whilst we will have to see whether it is an effective initiative, I think there is an intention behind it.


However, at the same time, we are going to have older workers losing jobs because our economy is in transition, with much structural change. Yet this bill will tear away entitlements for so many people. We will have to wait and see about the effectiveness of the Restart program—providing money to employers, effectively, to employ older Australians—but this bill, if enacted, would rip away elements of the safety net for people in particular industries where those industries are faced with major challenges at best. In some cases—for example, the car industry—under this government we have already seen a death notice.


Labor knows that the difficulties that workers confront in certain sectors of our economy are greater than in others, particularly in manufacturing, automotive, textile, timber and wood product industries. We are committed to finding ways to assist these people—not drag them down. The decision to cut the Fair Entitlements Guarantee is particularly galling given the government's dismantlement of the automotive sector of Australia. 


The sector will be hit, and hit hard. The cut to the FEG, as it is known, is compounded by cuts to the Automotive Transformation Scheme and other industry programs. The Labor scheme encouraged competitive investment and innovation in the Australian automotive industry to place it on an economically sustainable footing. Yet, in the budget papers, the budget states that it will save $618.5 million by terminating such a scheme from 1 January 2018. This includes $200 million in cuts over the next two years—long before the scheduled closures of manufacturing operations for Ford, Holden and Toyota. 


We can remember what happened in this place in December. The Treasurer of this nation stood up and goaded Holden to leave our shores. The next day, Holden decided to take the advice of the Treasurer. How do you keep companies like Holden in Australia when the federal government turns its back on the industry and that particular company? The consequence of that decision by Holden—followed by Toyota—is that there will be more workers who will be in exactly the position where they will be relying upon the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. The consequences will run through the automotive parts sector of our economy. Smaller medium enterprises are more likely to go into liquidation or be declared bankrupt. We will have thousands of workers affected. Areas affected will not be confined to South Australia and Melbourne and pockets around the country; the automotive parts sector of our economy runs right up the east coast, including in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and beyond—to the west.


I should add that this is a direct contradiction to what Assistant Minister Briggs said before the election, when he said:


The Coalition has committed to ongoing support for the auto industry and has agreed to continue funding the Automotive Transformation Scheme.


He is from South Australia so he would say that, but unfortunately that is not true. That has been cut. And, as I said, this comes on top of the Treasurer rising to his feet to speak about this in the parliament earlier. So you can imagine how workers are feeling when, on one hand, they see the government turning its back on a sector of our economy which is vital for manufacturing, and, on the other hand, they see legislation incidental to that decision—namely the underwriting and supporting of fair entitlements—being enacted by the government to take away what might be their only support when the sector suffers from the major car companies leaving and other effects on the sector more generally.


There are workers who have been in the automotive manufacturing and supply chain that have been there for many, many years. Under the current scheme they would be entitled to FEG based on their years of service. Under the government scheme, if it is enacted, they will be entitled to 16 weeks maximum, irrespective of their service. 


As I have said, the government has overseen the death of the automotive manufacturing sector, which I think has dire consequences for the rest of the supply chain. As I said earlier, the government should think about how this legislation will intersect with what is happening in the real economy—in certain sectors of the labour market. In consultations, Labor has heard from the automotive sector stakeholders, who are deeply concerned that the changes to the FEG may act as an incentive for vulnerable automotive component manufacturers to close their doors early, while their employees remain covered by the current FEG arrangements. 


In particular, if automotive component manufacturers close early this may deprive car makers of key components for the assembly of their vehicles, making continued production of specific models no longer possible. With a knock-on effect, this, in turn, make cause or precipitate the early closure of production at Ford, Toyota and Holden, which will in turn potentially result in the early closure of further automotive component producers that supply other car makers.


In this way, the closure of two or three small automotive component manufacturers may spark that mass closure of automotive manufacturing in a short period of time. Fifty thousand jobs directly depend on the automotive industry, and another 200,000 indirectly depend on it. I would strongly argue that the government's decision to cut the FEG could result in accelerating that transition or those closures, those changes and those job cuts.


These job cuts that will take place through to when car manufacturing ceases in Australia are a direct result of the government's actions. With the cut to the FEG, Prime Minister Abbott is rubbing salt into the wounds of the automotive sector workers and their families. Everything this government seems to do this about attacking workers, not supporting workers, not supporting conditions of employment, or taking conditions of employment away. It is not just the automotive sector that will be hit by these cuts; there are those in the textile-clothing sector, the childcare sector, nursing and manufacturing—the list goes on and on.


Given that Mr Abetz is charged with responsibility for this piece of legislation, perhaps the most unconscionable but, sadly, not surprising component of this cut to the FEG is that the government made no mention of it before the election. In fact, before the election the then shadow minister, the now Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, gave a concrete commitment not to change the FEG. He said, 'As far as I can see, it's as sound as a pound.' At least his words were; his deed clearly was not.


On 17 July 2013, in response to a letter from automotive car company worker Pierre Rault from Dandenong South, Minister Abetz, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and shadow minister for employment, wrote:


…you can be assured that the Coalition would not seek to do anything to water down these important protections for Australian workers. Some seven weeks ago or so, I released the Coalition's Workplace Relations policy with the Coalition leader, Mr Tony Abbott. We were explicit in the policy that but for the changes proposed in that document we would not make any other changes.


That letter is in direct defiance of this bill. However, here we are today in this House debating a bill that contains yet another broken promise. It may well be the tactic of the government that, if you break so many promises, people just will not notice; there are so many of them that you run out of puff just trying to get through them all. But cutting the entitlements for workers when you expressly send a letter to a worker who will be directly affected saying that there will not be such changes is unconscionable, reprehensible behaviour.


I would like to know—as would the opposition generally and, more importantly, thousands and thousands of Australian workers—why the minister broke the personal promise he made in his letter by reducing workers' entitlements under the FEG if this bill is enacted. I think it is a reasonable question to ask the minister. The Leader of the Senate put his signature to a statement prior to the election assuring the worker. He said: 'No problems, we won't hurt you, we're up front, we're going to do what we say, no excuses, no surprises.' How could it be that the sentiments in this letter are so starkly different from the provisions of this bill? Why was the minister assuring hardworking Australians that you can be 'satisfied there is no risk to your entitlements' before the election, only to break the promise after the election?


Despite telling voters before the election that they would not make changes to workers' pay and conditions the government is slowly eroding our industrial relations system. Again, this is an element of what was then Work Choices, and that is of grave concern to the opposition. The former Labor government stood up for workers. We supported ways to improve employment. In response to the global financial crisis, we responded quickly and sufficiently to support or even in some cases create, in total, approximately 200,000 jobs. In this area Labor was proud of the fact that we managed to ensure that unpaid entitlements were being provided in many instances to 70,000 employees who would have missed out.


Instead of demonising hardworking Australian workers, the government should be getting on with articulating a plan for jobs. As we know, unemployment has been rising. The unemployment rate is in excess of six per cent. I heard Minister Pyne say on some TV show last night that there was no crisis in youth unemployment. Youth unemployment is now at 13.4 per cent nationally—more than double the national average—and in some areas it is north of 20 per cent. In northern Tasmania it is 20 per cent. In northern Adelaide it is more than 20 per cent. At the same time that unemployment is rising among young people this government wants to rip away any support whatsoever for those workers by not giving them any support in the form of either Newstart or youth allowance. That is just another element of the cruelty of this government. 


Demonising the unemployed and going after everyone under the age of 30—even if they look for a job each day, each week, each month, for six months they do not receive one cent—the government is in breach of the principles of mutual obligation. On top of all of those things this bill will hurt workers who are most likely to be vulnerable to companies going into liquidation or bankruptcy. It could not be a worse time for this bill to come in. It is a perfect storm for workers in manufacturing. It is an outrage that the government would have the gall to introduce this bill even though it is in complete contradiction to the minister's own letter that he actually wrote and sent to a worker in Dandenong in Melbourne.


This is a bad bill. This will only hurt those workers who need the support from government the most. It is going to hurt older Australians who are going to struggle finding work in some instances. It is going to make it harder at a time when the government itself is suggesting that the pension should not even kick in until you are 70. If you are going to have car workers being made redundant at 50. They are not all going to find work under the Restart program. That program is not travelling particularly well at the moment. I hope it does get better results than it has done to date, but so far it is not doing the job that was intended. This is a recipe for disaster for so many workers and their families that the government should rethink its position.


I understand there is one government member to speak on this bill—to his credit, because he has to support the bill. The member for Hughes I think it is; is that right?




Mr Taylor:
  Hume.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Sorry, Hume; my apologies. Good on the member for Hume for being the only government member so far on the speakers list—




Mr Laming:
  Don't push it!




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Great. Now we are going to have his colleague from Queensland get up as well. I want as many government members speaking on this as possible. I want their comments and defence of this bill on the record so when the thousands of workers start losing their jobs as a result of Joe Hockey and this government turning their backs on the car industry we can say: 'If you want to understand why you are not receiving a decent benefit, even after working 40 years in a workplace, you can thank the Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, and all the other frontbenchers.' But who is here to defend them? A backbencher has decided to defend them. There are no frontbenchers defending this. I cannot wait to hear Minister Abetz's defence of this, because it is reprehensible. It is a breach of faith. It is contradicting the promises made before the election. It is attacking the needs of workers who are going to struggle if this legislation is passed.


I ask the government to rethink its position. The intersection between what is happening in the car industry and other industries because our economy is in transition—and we know that there are challenges—is the perfect storm and is going to mean that people will drown economically as a result. I assert that the government should rethink its position because the bill is harsh, it is in contradiction to the government's commitments before the election and it is going to hurt older Australians most of all—not just older Australians but many who have worked 40 years building the company, building the community and building this country. I seek leave to table the letter from Minister Abetz to Mr Rault confirming that there would be no changes to these entitlements.


Leave not granted.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-09-30,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (12:47):  I rise today to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014. I am pleased to do so because this bill is critical for the sustainability of an important program in a budget environment where every dollar must be targeted for maximum impact after the spendathon of the previous government. Under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, the FEG scheme, the government covers unpaid entitlements to eligible employees who lose their jobs due to liquidation or insolvency of their employer. We should note that the predecessor scheme—the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme or GEERS—was established by the Howard government in 2001. I know many members of this government in this parliament are proud of having established that incredibly important program that we continue to support today. 


These are intended to be safety net schemes of last resort covering some entitlements. That is how they were established and that is how they continue. Neither scheme was designed to cover all entitlements, despite what we heard from the member for Gorton. As it currently stands, FEG provides assistance for up to 13 weeks of unpaid wages, annual leave, long service leave, payment in lieu of notice to a maximum of five weeks and redundancy pay to a maximum of four weeks per full year of service. So there are caps in place and there will continue to be caps in place because this program must be sustainable given its importance.


The rationale for the scheme is very clear. We know that secured lenders and even large unsecured lenders have the resources and ability to make informed decisions when they take on credit risks. They are able to better manage those risks by diversifying and even avoiding the risks in the first place and they are able to absorb the risks if they come out the wrong way. In the case of employees the situation is much more difficult. They do not have the resources and skills to assess risks. It is much more difficult to manage those risks, even if they can assess them in the first place, and losses to most employees are more dire—often they will lose all of their income over an extended period of time. So for this reason we put the scheme in place. We continue to support the FEG scheme, but we need to make changes to ensure that it continues to operate.


In my electorate of Hume this program has been critical in recent times. The steel manufacturer National Engineering based in Young went into voluntary administration on 28 October last year, leaving some 38 employees without a job. Subsequently, the company moved into liquidation on 3 December in the same year. For a while it looked as though employees would not get their entitlements before Christmas, and it was a stressful time for staff and their families, but with excellent support from the office of the Minister for Employment and liaison between the Department of Employment and the insolvency practitioner over the period of administration we succeeded. More than $550,000 was approved under the FEG for unpaid wages, annual leave, long service leave, payment in lieu of notice and redundancy pay. Payments were received by Christmas for the employees who lodged claims. It is absolutely critical for my electorate and many others that this program be sustainable.


The bill in front of the House will give effect to the 2014-15 budget measure to protect the financial sustainability of the scheme. Instead of allowing a maximum of four weeks per full year of service, it will restore the previous cap on redundancy pay entitlements to 16 weeks of pay, which applied prior to 2012 and worked extremely well and extremely effectively for the 11 years it had already been in place under the previous Howard government and the Rudd and Gillard governments. The measure will save almost $80 million over the forward estimates by capping the redundancy payments. The FEG Amendment Bill impacts on the redundancy pay entitlement only. All other entitlements are absolutely untouched. It is important to note—and I will talk about this a little more later—capping the entitlement to 16 weeks will bring the redundancy entitlement in line with the National Employment Standards contained in the Fair Work Act and the rules that existed under GEERS prior to 2012, as I said a moment ago.


The bill also makes a series of technical amendments. The technical amendments are not controversial and can be considered housekeeping. I noticed that the member for Gorton did not raise any of these amendments in his speech. They are being introduced at the suggestion of the Department of Employment in order to clarify the operation of the act. They include establishing a funding source in the legislation for certain legal costs associated with the AAT appeals against FEG decisions; clarifying that the death of a person does not prevent the person being eligible for an advance—of course, the member for Gorton did not mention this one, which is of great benefit to employees in difficult situations—enabling the next of kin or the state to pursue a claim; clarifying that when a debt owed by claimant to his or her employee is greater than the entitlement, it can be offset against any of the claimants other employment entitlements under the scheme; and removing the eligibility requirement that a person who has owed debts prior to the insolvency event happening to their employer must have taken reasonable steps to be paid those debts. But, importantly, the legislation only allows the secretary to reduce a person's entitlement by the amount of any debts that he or she did not take reasonable steps to be paid. At the moment, if they do not take those steps, then in fact they lose all of their entitlements. So all of these are important amendments largely in favour of the employee or former employee.


Let me just spend a moment on why it is so important that we pass this bill. Of course, at the top of the list is the need for fiscal sustainability across all our programs, something that those on the other side of the House seem to still be in denial about, to still ignore in their claim that every bit of spending should remain. There are two critical but distinct parts of the government's focus on fiscal sustainability. Firstly, of course, is getting the budget back to surplus over the forward estimates, made more challenging by the serious economic headwinds we face—a falloff in the terms of trade and mining investment, falling company tax revenues, and the end of the consumption boom driving GST revenues, none of which those opposite seem to take into account in their thinking about how they would spend money if they were in government and how they spent money when they were in government.


Secondly, but as importantly, we need to ensure that we have a long-term sustainability in our budget. The Parliamentary Budget Office tells us that under the last government spending was rising at 3.8 per cent a year and yet we can expect revenue to only rise at something like three per cent. You do not have to be the world's greatest mathematician to work out that this is a serious problem. This is a fiscal cliff and we are going over it and if we do not deal with it one of two things must happen. One we have a massive tax hike—massive. Right now we have tax at about 23 per cent of GDP. If we were to allow this to continue, a simple two line spreadsheet will tell you that within a short period of time federal tax will have to rise to 30 per cent of GDP. Go tell that to your employees, your constituents, your taxpayers. Those on the other side of the House seemed to have no regard for the future taxpayers of this country.


Of course, one of the great disappointments about the way the PBO works at the moment is that it does not demand the opposition put its estimates, put its spending promises beyond the forward estimates, out for scrutiny. That is something that desperately needs to be changed. The spending promises of the last Labor government—and no doubt the opposition, as we move before the next election—beyond the forward estimates are not subject to scrutiny and absolutely should be, because we need to make it absolutely crystal clear which side of the parliament is ensuring that future taxpayers do not have to wear the profligate spending of those on the side of the House.


To keep the FEG scheme viable, it is clear that we need to make changes. It has grown absolutely dramatically, with demand increasing from 8,626 claimants being paid $73 million in 2006-07, a very sustainable number, to 16,019 claimants being paid $262 million, almost 3½ times what it was six years earlier, in 2012-13. This increase is absolutely unsustainable. It is exactly the sort of increase we see from those opposite in so many of the programs that they oversaw, and in this case they enshrined in legislation. From a budgetary point of view the current four weeks redundancy paid for each year is no longer sustainable and setting the entitlements to 16 weeks in total is fiscally responsible.


It is important to note that, as I mentioned earlier, capping the redundancy payment will bring the FEG in line with Labor's National Employment Standards and the Fair Work Act of 2009. The current redundancy benefit under FEG provides for four weeks' pay for every year of service. We know that that is well above the standard set in the National Employment Standards outlined in the Fair Work Act. In fact, Labor has told us that the National Employment Standards in that act got the balance right and sets a community standard. Yet they are not prepared to support it in this legislation. The hypocrisy we see continually from those opposite is awe inspiring, it is extraordinary. It is not good enough and that is why we are proposing this change, remembering that this is a scheme of last resort that should only cover redundancies that are in line with the community standard. It should be noted that the scheme already has a cap on maximum wages of $127,000 per annum. So there are caps everywhere already in this scheme. That reflects the intent of the scheme that more generous remuneration above community standards should not be covered by a safety net scheme.


We have heard many in the community supporting this cap. The AiG said:


The 16 week cap mirrors the entitlement to redundancy under the National Employment Standards and hence reflects community standards ... 


The Master Builders Association submitted similar things to the Senate inquiry on the issue and said that the general redundancy standard put in place by Labor was out of step with the general community standard and suggested that the proposed cap be brought in line with the community standard. Both the Ai Group and ACCI said that a publicly funded safety net scheme is necessary to protect workers as employers went bankrupt but they both stressed that it should offer an appropriate level of protection. It is also important to note this bill only impacts a small proportion of claimants. It turns out that historically, over the three-year period, there were 41,393 claimants on this scheme and this change will only affect 2,446, or six per cent. The vast majority of claimants would be totally unaffected and those claimants who are affected will only be affected in a relatively small way, in the vast majority of cases.


As I said earlier, the bill only affects the redundancy entitlement and all other entitlements are unchanged. It is important also to note the bill removes a moral hazard—the sort of moral hazard those opposite seem to like. The thing as it stands creates a moral hazard whereby unions, company directors, CEOs or business owners can inflate redundancy entitlements when companies are in trouble and the taxpayer will pick up the tab when the company goes broke. It is not the sort of moral hazard the Australian people would find acceptable. The Ai Group discussed this fact and said there are major moral hazards present in the current legislative provisions, because there is little protection against employers being coerced by unions into implementing extremely generous redundancy packages in the lead up to insolvency, leaving taxpayers picking up the tab. We had similar comments from ACCI, which said:


What I am saying is that the potential arises in the dynamic it introduces into negotiations. It is one thing for two parties to sit down and negotiate terms and conditions, but if they know at the back of their minds that ultimately the government will pick up this entitlement our proposition is that that will impact on the bargaining dynamic.


The sustainability of well-directed and high-quality government programs is the focus of this government and should be the focus of future governments of Australia. This bill is intended to do exactly that. This is an important program and losing it, and others like it, because of unsustainable growth in spending is totally unacceptable. I commend this bill to the House.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (13:01): I also rise to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014 but, unlike the previous speaker, I oppose this bill. I oppose the amendments to the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act of 2012 and what this bill seeks to do.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is a legislative safety net. It is there to protect workers who, through no fault of their own, lose their jobs through the bankruptcy or liquidation of companies. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is a scheme designed to ensure fairness for working people. One of the things I have a degree of understanding of, having an electorate with a very high degree of unemployment and also having family members who have lost their jobs principally through the liquidation of the company, is how this impacts on families. I know how a family member can go to work only to be told with no notice that there is no further job, that for financial reasons liquidation is necessary: 'Please remove all your belongings, files and any other personal effects and exit the premises.' That happened to my son. I know how devastating it was for him and his family. They had a mortgage and school fees to pay. It had an absolutely huge impact. If you multiply that impact electorate wide, it is easy to understand the importance of having safety-net legislation.


Members opposite, cast your minds back. We did not always have a safety net. Remember, back in the year 2000, there was the unfortunate and unexpected liquidation of a particular company called National Textiles. The then Prime Minister's brother happened to be on the board of directors of that company. As a consequence of this, and to the considerable embarrassment of the other side, the General Employee Entitlement Redundancy Scheme, the GEERS legislation, came into effect in 2001. Whether it was due to embarrassment or simply feeling it was the right thing to do, it was under the circumstances the right thing to do—not because it was the Prime Minister's brother's company, but because this was one company among many which took the soft way out and liquidated for corporate reasons. This is not something we should be shying away from. It is certainly not, as the previous speaker said, that sometimes these entitlements are so inflated that it amounts to significant corporate spending. This is about trying to do something for people's lives when their company goes into bankruptcy or, more than likely, into liquidation. That is certainly no fault of the employees.


This is an important bill the government is bringing forward because it seeks to undermine the very basis upon which we are trying to protect the entitlements of those employees. The bill will impose caps in terms of payments of entitlements; these will be capped at 16 weeks. The other significant part of this bill will ensure that, as opposed to getting paid at your rate of pay, you will be paid at the level of average weekly earnings. That is a vastly different figure. I understand the speaker opposite, the member for Hume, said it is possible for some people who are earning $100,000 to receive payment at that rate. Yes, it is. It is not a matter of whether they contributed by negligence to bringing down the company; they lost their jobs like anybody else. To simply use the figure of average weekly earnings as the maximum rate for this will have a huge impact on those people unfortunate enough to have to make a claim on this fund.


The bill will also progress three technical amendments that have already been spoken about. It will also amend provisions as to whether a person has reasonably pursued the debt off an employer. It has provisions allowing the cost of appeals to the AAT to be drawn from special appropriations. But I cannot get away from the fact that, like many other pieces of legislation we are seeing at the moment coming from the government benches, this legislation is actually going to undermine workers' entitlements. As I said, this is a legislative safety net, and what do they want to do? They want to wind it back. They want to make sure that you can only get a maximum of 16 weeks, as opposed to four weeks per year of service. They want to make sure that, as opposed to getting your real rate of pay, it is wound back to average weekly earnings.


It is extraordinary the lengths this government will go, I would not say to attack workers but certainly to undermine workers' conditions. I know that during the campaign leading up to the last election the government made it very clear that it was not their intention to move on Work Choices—at least not during the term of this government. But what we have seen is a never-ending pattern of going out and undermining workers' entitlements and workers' conditions. As the member for Hume said, people should not get used to being in an environment of spending. I agree with that. But is it only the workers who they are going to take the stick to when they want to curtail spending? 


I was reading over the weekend about what is happening in corporate taxation. Gee, that is a first. The government certainly does not want to get too close to this issue. I suspect that many of the companies that have been cited may be principal donors to the Liberal Party. This report, Who pays for our common wealth?, says that a third of Australia's largest companies pay less than 10c in the dollar in corporate tax. Ten cents in the dollar! That is a long way behind what they expect employees to pay. The report also found that 84 per cent of Australia's top 200 companies listed on the Australian stock exchange pay less than 30c in the dollar, which is the corporate tax rate.


On one hand, the government want to take every opportunity to wind back workers' conditions and to wind back protections that do nothing more than protect employees and their families—particularly in this case, where through no fault of their own a company goes into liquidation or bankruptcy. But, on the other hand, they certainly do not want to move with any great haste to do anything about corporate taxation. When you look at the top 200 companies, it works out that, if they paid the corporate taxation rate, the budget would gain $8.4 billion or more a year in revenue. That is almost the total savings that the government expects to make by slashing pensions, by bringing in the new GP tax and by cutting programs to Indigenous Australians. They certainly have their priorities very much skewed when it comes to this. I suspect there is a reason for it. They have a philosophical reason for winding back the entitlements for employees.


It is with regret that we find that we need to oppose this. I would have thought that those opposite would have had some regard for the whole concept emanating out of events such as the falling over of National Textiles, whether by embarrassment or otherwise. John Howard brought in the GEERS legislation back in 2001. Sure, that was a capped piece of legislation, but it was not restricted in terms of the earning rates. But they are simply winding back what we have now, what was provided under GEERS, to 16 weeks. They are also putting an extra imposition on, meaning that any worker who has not been able to gain their entitlements from a failed company going through liquidation or bankruptcy must make every attempt to pursue a company—which, unless workers have a trade union to go through, would be a very litigious route and would probably be pretty expensive. The government is also ensuring that those workers do not get payments based on their rate of pay but on average weekly earnings.


I will go back to where I started: this is going to impact on lots and lots of people. I have the experience of seeing my own family go through a liquidation and a forced redundancy, with no knowledge of it occurring other than the fact of being escorted to a gate and being locked out, along with every other employee who lost their job. This has a devastating impact on families and family welfare, and it allows no opportunity for people to plan.


This legislation is very, very retrograde. I am proud to be part of a party that saw fit in 2007 to bring about the fair entitlement guarantee legislation and I am proud of the fact that, since 2007, more than $852 million has been paid out of that scheme, to the benefit of 70,000 Australian workers and their families. I oppose this legislation. I think it is wrong in principle. I think it takes a stick to workers and their families at a time when what they need most is protection. This government has turned its back on them.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:14):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Amendment Bill 2014. This matter is one that is a passion of mine, for reasons that I will set out in a moment. I also understand that industrial relations is a passion of members of the government. However, it must be said that in this particular debate that it is a private passion—a very private passion, because there has only been one member of the government willing to come to the chamber today and defend their legislation. Indeed, if there were a standing order that said a government bill had to have a minimum number of government speakers who were willing to stand and speak in defence of it then I am quite certain that this legislation would not get out the gate.


Legislation—the business that a government brings before the House—is a statement of its values and a statement of its priorities. I would like to address some of the priorities and the values that are resplendent within this legislation. As the member for Fowler has just told the House, we are debating this legislation in the very same week that one of the most important reports, that goes to the heart of who is paying tax and who is not paying tax in this country, was published.


Readers of the Sydney Morning Herald woke with quite some alarm when they picked up the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday and saw that almost one-third of the nation's top 200 companies are paying less tax—in fact, they are paying less than 10c in the dollar—and that if you put end-to-end the amount of tax that has been evaded as a result of these deliberate decisions by some of the largest companies in the country, you would have an additional $80 billion in government revenue.


I ask you think about that for a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we have a bill before the House today which finds its genesis in the Commission of Audit—the massive beat-up by the government to try to alarm the population that there was somehow a budget emergency. Hidden within the report was the proposition to wind back the provisions within the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act to a bare minimum because we had a budget emergency.


Nowhere in the Commission of Audit did we find the commissioners drawing attention to the tax avoidance and tax evasion which has led to over $80 billion not finding its way into government coffers and not finding its way out of those coffers again into important public spending programs—roads, infrastructure, education, hospitals and important employee protection schemes such as those before the House today. Again, I make the point that the legislation before the House today is a statement of values and priorities. Instead of pursuing measures which would help the government buttress the problem that we all know is the problem, and that is a problem of revenue, they are going after basic entitlements.


This matter is one that is very close to my heart because before coming into the parliament I spent more than a little bit of time working in the area of insolvency and helping workers to chase down their entitlements that had been lost once a business went into liquidation. It was more than a little bit of time on them and in some quite high-profile matters indeed. So it is an important scheme. It is one that I have more than a little bit of knowledge of and I wish that those members opposite informed themselves a little bit more about the legislation that they are all going to career in here to vote in favour of—without having read it and without having spoken in favour of it, because that might change their minds.


We know that there are around 7,000 businesses which fail every year. About half of those businesses cause their employees to lose entitlements—entitlements such as long service leave, holiday and sick pay and redundancy payments—things that provisions have not been made for. We know that there have been around 885 business related bankruptcies cases in the June quarter alone. Total debtors exceeded 1,100 for the same period and between 2001 and 2013 more than $260 million had been advanced under the FEG scheme and its antecedents, the GEER scheme, to over 16,000 Australian workers. So, it is an important scheme. It deserves to have more attention than the House is currently affording it today by the fact that only members of the opposition are speaking on the legislation.


The history of this scheme is well known to many. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that back in 2000 a company known as National Textiles—coincidentally, a company that was owned and operated by the then Prime Minister John Howard's brother, Stan Howard—went into liquidation owing around 340 employees accumulated entitlement, including redundancy pay. This group of employees were amongst the lucky ones. I should say that if anyone who is about to lose their job could be classified as 'lucky', here is a group of employees unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, but 100 per cent of their entitlements were paid eventually; not by the business but by the government moving in and underwriting the bills that were owed by the Prime Minister's brother. Many said at the time—many other employees who had lost their jobs—'If only we could have been so lucky as to have been working for a company that went bust and the owner of that company happened to be a Prime Minister's brother.'


Wind the clock forward to 2001 and to a company by the name of One.Tel. This time the collapse was not a relatively small textile company but probably the fourth-largest telecommunications company in the country at the time, stranding around two million customers and, importantly, owing something in the vicinity of $600 million to over 3,000 creditors. Included within those creditors were the 1,400 employees of One.Tel.


I know a lot about this because I was representing the employees at the time. I remember writing to the then minister for workplace relations, one Tony Abbott, and asking him to intercede on behalf of the workers in a matter that I had before the then Australian Industrial Relations Commission to get some justice for these workers. The then minister for workplace relations refused to do that. Of course a campaign then ensued, a campaign that was supported by the majority of right-thinking Australians, and the then minister for workplace relations got rolled by the then Prime Minister. It was the only occasion in my working life as a lawyer, practising in that particular practice, where I could say I was standing on the same side of the bar table as a member representing a coalition minister for workplace relations. It became clear to all that a general scheme was needed and, as the shadow minister for workplace relations has explained, an administrative scheme was set up, known as the GEER Scheme, and it paid a minimum entitlement to workers in the event that their company went bust and provision had not been made for their accumulated entitlements.


An important point to make, one which is lost on many, is that the payment of the minimum entitlements to the worker who has lost their job is not the end of the story. What happens is the right to pursue the assets of the company, the right to become a creditor of the company, is then assigned to the government. So the government, presumably through the auspices of the tax office or of the department of employment and workplace relations, is assigned the right to pursue those owed entitlements instead of the employee—a matter that is lost on many. And when you are looking to provide a revenue stream and you are looking to address issues such as moral hazard, I would argue that this is an important place to start looking—that is, putting more effort and more resources into the chasing of the assigned debt.


The scheme has been operating since then. It was improved under the former Labor government, to a point where the FEG Act now sets out maximum entitlements and how they are to be calculated. They include up to 13 weeks of unpaid wages, annual leave that has accrued but not been paid, long service leave, a maximum five weeks payment in lieu of notice, and redundancy pay of four weeks per year of service. It is important to make the point that these are not award or agreement rights themselves; these represent the caps or maximum entitlements that may be paid to an employee where they have been unable to recover those entitlements from a collapsed company. The wages were capped at a minimum weekly rate of $2,364 when the scheme began. It has been frozen at $2,451 until 30 June 2018.


You have to ask yourself who has benefited from this scheme. Because the courageous member for Hume has been willing to stand up and defend the scheme, has put his hand up, we know that at least 33 workers from the business National Engineering in his electorate benefited from the scheme. I congratulate the member for Hume for having the courage to come in here and stand up and defend his government's legislation. I warrant you that he would not have had the courage to give that same speech prior to the last election. He would not have been out there promising those 33 workers, 'If you vote for me, I can guarantee you that if your company goes bust you'll get less money under my government than you will under a Labor government.' He would not have given that speech. And I can also guarantee that of all the people that the member for Hume mails his courageous speech out to today, he will not be mailing it out to the 33 workers who had their benefits paid under the existing FEG scheme.


I happen to know a bit about the National Engineering company. It has been in existence for more than 120 years. It is a metalworking company, a blacksmithing company. And I know that its being a business, what was a reasonably good business, in a country town meant it was some of the best work going and that the people who got jobs there, if they were skilled tradesmen, hung on to those jobs; they would work there for a long, long time. So the member for Hume will not be mailing out his speech saying, 'If I had my chance, I would've been cutting your rights to get your wages recovered.' I guarantee he will not be doing that.


Who else has benefited from the scheme? If you have a look at the submission of the department to the Senate inquiry into this scheme you will see that more than 41 per cent of total redundancy payments made have been paid to employees in the manufacturing industry. But you have to ask yourself: why do the government hate workers in the manufacturing industry so much? What is it that they have got against workers in the manufacturing industry? I see the member for Wakefield in the chamber today. He has a keen interest in this issue. I see the member for Hotham in the chamber today; she also has a keen interest in this issue. They are members who have stood up in defence of the manufacturing industry in their electorates—as have the members for Blair and Hunter, who are also in the chamber today. They have been willing to stand up—in fact, one of the most passionate speeches I have heard by a member in this parliament, in the 44th Parliament, was the speech by the member for Wakefield imploring the government not to chase the automotive industry offshore.


So against that background, and knowing that the single biggest group of workers who have benefited under the FEG scheme—more than 41 per cent of workers have benefited—are workers in the manufacturing industry, you have to ask yourself: why does this government hate them so much? It chases their manufacturing jobs offshore and then, at the first opportunity it gets, it seeks to reduce their rights and entitlements and the benefits that could be payable to them under a scheme has worked for close to a decade. We should reject the bill. It is not fair, it is not right and we will be voting against it. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (13:30):  Not content with voting against the funding to help Queensland recover after cyclones and floods, the LNP members from Queensland have not stood up in relation to the $5.8 billion cuts to higher education. I wonder whether the member for Capricornia who has a campus in Rockhampton, the member for Flynn who has a campus in Gladstone, or the member for Dawson who has a campus in Mackay, have actually gone to their campuses and spoken to their students there about the fact that they are going to see up to a 37 per cent decrease in funding for those campuses as a result of the higher education changes in this budget.


I also wonder whether the member for Lyons who has not been to Tagari Lia in Bridgewater, or the member for Durack who has not been to the children and family centre—two of 38 around the country—are going to do about those centres, because they were not funded in the budget. We see regional and rural members from Tasmania to New South Wales to Queensland sitting opposite in the government and not standing up to their city cousins, the Liberal Party. 


It is exactly the same in respect of the dementia supplement. Recently, I was at a wonderful aged-care facility in my electorate, Cabanda. We have got beds there—and it is the same in Alkira—with dementia patients. The coalition members from regional and rural areas have not stood up because the Abbott government has cut the dementia supplement. They should hold their heads in shame. (Time expired)

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (15:12):  When the government received this report about four weeks ago, I spoke briefly in this parliament and I indicated that I would have more to say by the end of the month. Thank you for indulgence to say a little more about this royal commission report. We did receive the report on 1 September, and the report from the royal commissioner, Ian Hanger AM QC, does provide victims' families with some long-awaited answers—answers that they desperately craved, given that four young men in the prime of life lost their lives as a consequence of this bungled program. In addition to the lives lost, homes were damaged or destroyed and many businesses were badly affected or ruined. So, Madam Speaker, we do owe it to Matthew Fuller, Reuben Barnes, Mitchell Sweeney and Marcus Wilson, and to their families, to ensure that this should never happen again. If we do not learn from the past, we tend to repeat it. So today I wish, briefly, to set out the government's interim measures as promised.


First, I have asked Minister Hunt to assume responsibility to oversee the Commonwealth response and to coordinate actions across departments and ministers. In this, he will be assisted by the Hon. Bob Baldwin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry. He will provide updates to me and will deliver the final comprehensive government response by the end of this year. Madam Speaker, as you would probably recall, the report of the royal commissioner makes a series of findings about occupational health and safety. This program was a failure of government and it cascaded into failures in the workplace. I have asked the Minister for Employment to examine these findings, particularly as they relate to the reliance of the Commonwealth on state and territory laws, and his work will inform the government's final response. I intend, also, to raise the commissioner's recommendations to improve safety in roof cavities at the next COAG meeting. 


Because the safety of people at work is, indeed, a national concern, it is a concern of everyone in this parliament and all governments should cooperate to ensure that people who go to work return safely home. Matthew Fuller, Ruben Barnes, Mitchell Sweeney and Marcus Wilson went to work and, tragically, they did never return home. The report makes it clear that their deaths could have been avoided had things been done differently. That is why Minister Hunt and the Minister for Finance have been asked to recommend options to compensate their next of kin. Although nothing can bring them back, the Barnes, Fuller, Sweeney and Wilson families should know that the government will not walk away; the government accepts responsibility and will do its best to make amends.


While nothing can compare to the pain of losing a child, there were other families who also suffered in serious ways. Pre-existing home insulation businesses large and small have suffered significant losses as a result of this program. They trusted government and were let down. So I have asked the Attorney-General, the Minister for Industry and the Minister for Finance to develop options for a scheme that will compensate those pre-existing businesses that were adversely affected.


The royal commissioner's report provides a sobering account of the role of government in developing and delivering policy and programs. It is a reminder of what can happen when there is a government-knows-best approach. I am confident that the processes of government have subsequently changed and improved but they can always be better. That is why I have asked Minister Hunt to recommend an external expert to examine and address the issues identified and the recommendations relating to the role of government in this tragic program. This expert will examine the role of ministers and officials in the development of policy and the delivery of programs to see what lessons can be learnt. An external report is necessary, rather than asking government or the public service to review objectively and comprehensively their own processes. The Minister for Employment, in this capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, has been asked to consider an appropriate way to assess the report's findings about public servants against the Australian Public Service's code of conduct.


I do wish to stress that this is not a witch hunt but we do need to recognise that the Home Insulation Program was a tragic failure, a failure of bureaucracy and a workplace failure as well as a political failure. All of us should learn from this failure because there will be times in the future when governments believe that urgent action is required—but even urgent action has to be prudent, cautious and wise. Just like the royal commission itself, this interim response is designed to work out what happened, what could have been done better and what is necessary to prevent it from happening again. All of us should work to ensure that wiser decisions and better government become the ultimate legacy of this tragic program.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:18):  On indulgence—I acknowledge the Prime Minister's initial responses to the royal commission and his statement about further investigations by ministers and others. Our thoughts are foremost with the families and the friends of the young men who died—the Fuller, Barnes, Sweeney and Wilson families. I acknowledge the further discussion about possible compensation.


I wish to put on record that I recognise that no amount of compensation ever balances people. I have never seen people receive compensation who would not rather they could turn back the clock. But having said that, I acknowledge that government is putting forward that proposition.


I also wish to acknowledge that every death in a workplace is a tragedy. Labor's attitude is that anything that improves workplace safety is worthwhile. There have been, even in the last 12 months, over 200 traumatic fatalities in workplaces. Taking the Prime Minister's words, that is a failure across our society in people going to work and not returning home.


Furthermore, there are hundreds if not thousands of people who have received exposure to industrial diseases who will die. So we await the responses of the ministers and I thank the government for their initial comments.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (15:20):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The question that all members on this side of the House are asking themselves today is why the government insists on punishing Australians who live in rural and regional Australia. Why are they so insistent on punishing people who live in the bush? The other question we are asking is: why is the National Party so eager to support them? The truth is this: the government's budget is a war on the poor—



The SPEAKER:  I remind the member that the Speaker is in the chair, not the Deputy Speaker.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker. The issue is this: the government's budget is a war on the poor; it is a war on the people who live in rural and regional Australia. The $7 GP tax will cost patients over $1.4 billion in communities outside of metropolitan centres.


The destruction of the PBS safety net is going to cost an additional $1.2 billion for people for their medicines. If you look at the top 12 electorates that will pay the greatest out-of-pocket expenses as a result of this rotten budget in the PBS, they are all in rural and regional Australia. And they are going to be wacked an additional $112 million over the next four years.


Where is the member for Gippsland? Where is the member for Hinkler? Where is the member for Murray? Where is the member for Gilmore? And where are the other members who claim to represent regional and rural Australia electorates? Why aren't they here today, standing up for their electorates?


The sad truth is this. If you live in the bush, you do not enjoy the same health outcomes as you would if you lived in the city, whether they be diabetes, the incidence of a melanoma or other cancers, injuries or, tragically, suicide. The sad fact is that, if you live in the bush, you do not enjoy the same sorts of health outcomes as you would if you lived in the city. Tragically, those on the other side are letting down their constituencies.


It is also true that, if you live in rural and regional Australia, you not only have the lowest incomes but are also paying more in out-of-pocket health expenses. The poorest people in the country are being whacked the hardest by those on the other side of the chamber.


Labor has a very proud record when it comes to health. Labor is the party that introduced Medicare 30 years ago and we are defending it here today, while those on the other side are attempting to attack it. From 2007 to 2013 we ensured that there were more doctors trained and more doctors sent to the bush to practise. We built over 29 new cancer centres and we put in place health and hospital funding which ensured that funding of hospitals around the country was more sustainable. 


Unsurprisingly, perhaps out of embarrassment at the success that the Labor Party had in looking after people in the bush and looking after people in rural Australia, before the last election the National Party published this policy document. When you look at this policy document you will see it has a fair few things to say about health and health policy. For instance, they made some very big promises about having a policy to ensure that no member on that side of the chamber would support policies which were going to lead to the closure of hospitals in rural and regional Australia. The $55 billion cut to health and hospital funding is going to have a devastating impact on hospitals in the bush and those on the other side know it. We demand that the National Party live good to their promises and stand up here and defend the things that they went to the last election on.


The coalition went to the last election promising, in this document here, that they would increase financial incentives and payments for doctors practising in rural and regional Australia. As soon as they got into government, what did they do? They cut Medicare rebates for doctors. So, instead of increasing funding, they have decreased funding for doctors practising in the bush. The best promise of all—and this is the one we love—was that they would have a full-time minister for regional and rural health, to ensure that the interests of regional and rural Australia were looked after when the big decisions were made. It is no surprise, but it is a Liberal Party health minister who is going to be standing there defending their record because The Nationals will not get up and defend it.




Mr McCormack:
  What about Fiona Nash?




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I am asked about Fiona Nash. Let us hear what she had to say about it. She was asked whether she did some modelling on the impact of the GP co-payment and whether she had consulted rural communities on the impact. What did she have to say? When the biggest decision by this parliament was made, impacting on rural and regional  health, the minister for rural and regional health was not even in the room, making it quite clear to everyone on this side of the chamber—and it should also make it quite clear to everyone in rural and regional Australia—that the Liberal Party has absolutely no regard for the promises that the National Party made to their electorates in the run-up to the last election.


Having been excluded from the big decisions, you would have to ask yourself: is there anything that the minister for rural and regional health will go into bat for when it comes to rural and regional Australia? We know that she was willing to go into bat for big food companies, to save them from the tyranny of a star-rating system. She was willing to stick up for the interests of 'big food,' but she will not stick up for her own policies. Two weeks ago in the Senate, when she was asked about these issues she had to this to say, 'You've got to understand that we have National Party policies but, when we get elected to government, they don't mean anything. They have absolutely no bearing on coalition policy, because they are only National Party policies.'


We know that the Liberal Party has no regard for National Party policies and no regard for people in the bush, but we also know that the National Party no longer has any regard for people in the bush. How quick they have been to disregard their own policies!


Some members were willing to stand up for people in rural and regional Australia. Even National Party members were willing to stick up for people in rural and regional Australia. I see that the member for Richmond is in the chamber today. She is willing to stick up for the interests of her electorate, unlike the previous member for Richmond, whom she defeated, who was not willing to stick up for the interests of people in rural and regional Australia. But his predecessor was. 


In the good old days there have been National Party members who have been willing to stand up to their own side and to the tyrants in the Liberal Party. I remember when Doug Anthony was willing to bring the National Party across the floor to vote against his own side to ensure that the interests of the bush were looked after. But not today! It is a pale imitation. They will not even stand up and defend their own policies. They are sending the Liberal minister in here to stand up for their own policies. Not one National Party member has been willing to stand up and defend their own policies. It is absolutely clear that they will not defend their own policies because, as the minister for rural and regional health has also made absolutely clear, the Liberal Party has no regard for their policies. They will not be able to stand in their electorates in the lead-up to the next election and make one single promise, because the people in the bush will understand that, when it comes to health and when it comes to anything else, National Party promises have absolutely no bearing on what a coalition government will do in practice. 


It is time for members of the National Party to stand up; if they will not stand up, they should stand down. They should tell the truth that they are no longer members for country Australia; they are no longer anything more than associate members of the Liberal Party. (Time expired)

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2014-09-30,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (15:30):  I have watched some MPIs in this parliament in my time. What normally happens is: the opposition builds up during question time to the MPI because they believe in the MPI. During question time today, I was waiting for the questions on this particular topic—around funding for health services within regional communities. There were 13 questions from the opposition today. But this member opposite could not get one question up—talk about those who are effective in this place—in tactics today to ask of the government on this particular topic. 


I will tell you why this shadow minister has been given this MPI: it is because he has no capacity to get questions up in question time. They have said to him: 'So ineffective are you that we will not allow you to ask a question in question time. We will give you the MPI, as some sort of sop.' That is what has happened here today. It has nothing to do with passion or interest in this particular topic. It is because we have a completely ineffective shadow minister in this area. 


He represents the great seat of Throsby. It is a good area—no question about that—but is it a patch on the area that is represented by members from the Nationals or from the LNP or from the Liberal Party on this side of parliament? No, not in terms of regional services and delivering to those on the land. When you compare the shadow minister for regional health with the Assistant Minister for Health in the other place, the Assistant Minister for Health in the other place would run rings around this shadow minister, and she does so on a regular basis. He has no capacity to carry this argument. He has no capacity to get a question up in question time, so he is given this second-rate opportunity on the MPI after question time. It says more about him than it does about anything else.


I will tell you what the Labor Party is dominated by. They are dominated by union thugs on the front bench from start to finish. They do not have any impact on regional services or in regional areas because they do not come from those areas. That is the reality in this place. They might say that they represent rural interests, but they do not; they represent capital city interests and, in particular, they represent the interests of the people who control them on a daily basis—that is, the union bosses. The union bosses do not have any interest in regional and rural areas, let alone rural and regional health in this place. These people demonstrate this incapacity on a daily basis. 


I will tell you what that means: it means that all of the Labor Party policies are concentrated on the bureaucracy in health, and that has been demonstrated at a state and territory level over the course of the last decade or so. Labor, to please the union bosses, pumps money into health bureaucracies and away from health services—not just in capital cities but, most importantly, in rural and regional areas. That is what happens in Labor governments. It happens at a state level, which is why we see monumental failure in NSW health under Labor governments. It is why we see huge problems in Queensland health with outrages like the Doctor Patel case; with money being diverted away from front-line services into IT systems. It is because the Labor Party has no interest outside of the union movement. That is why there is such a big divide between the modern Labor Party and people in outer metropolitan areas and people working hard in rural and regional areas.


We know it was demonstrated at a federal level over the course of the last six years, because the Labor Party built up the numbers in the health bureaucracy. Why? Not because they wanted to deliver additional services to regional areas or remote or Indigenous communities, but because they wanted to please union bosses in capital cities. That is what happened. Not only did they build up the numbers in the federal bureaucracy; they also built the number of agencies up to 21—that is, 21 outside agencies attached to the health department in addition to the additional bureaucrats. What did that do? It starved money from rural and regional areas. That is what happened under Labor's watch. So we are not going to sit here and be lectured to by some second-rate shadow minister who cannot get a question up in question time.


If you look at what we have done since we have come to government, we have increased money in this budget, in the health portfolio, each and every year. The Labor Party is running around trying to run some scare campaign—saying that we are taking money out of hospitals or we are taking it out of the MBS—but the opposite is the case. We are increasing the amount of money that we have put into public hospitals across the country. We are increasing the amount of money that we put into the MBS across services, and we are doing it in a sustainable way. That is the big difference between those opposite and those people on this side of the parliament. These people who are representing regional areas come from real backgrounds not from ivory towers in every union office across the country. They are people who have come from the land. They are people who have worked hard in small business. They are people who have employed other Australians and they have accessed those health services in regional areas. That is why they will always have more passion about rural communities than those people opposite, who pretend that they have interests in rural and regional areas. 


When you look at the facts of what we are doing in relation to rural and regional health, let me say to you: this government promised, as part of the election commitment, $40 million over four years to create additional intern training capacity in private hospitals—and rural and regional focus in particular—76 interns already trained in 2014. We have provided $13.4 million to an additional 500 scholarships for nursing and allied health professionals, targeting rural professionals. We have provided $238 million over four years to double the practice incentive payment for teaching and general practice. We have provided $52½ million for infrastructure grants to build on teaching and supervision, where? In the rural and regional medical workforce. That is the focus of this government. That is what makes Minister Nash in the other place a very effective Assistant Minister for Health. That is why we have put additional money including into the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Labor was building up bureaucracies in Canberra to please its Labor bosses and its puppet masters while it was taking money away from rural services. We have put $6 million into the Royal Flying Doctor Service to enable it to increase the services it provides to rural and remote locations. We have undertaken to have a look at the classification scheme so that, wherever possible, we can get more doctors and allied health professionals out of capital cities and into regional, rural and Indigenous communities. We are committed to those outcomes. What did the Labor Party do? It built up to 21 outside agencies—it is unbelievable when you contemplate it—all with separate administration and leasing, all with cars, all with PR people, all with accountants and with all their overheads. It was taking money away from the capacity of government to be able to make the sorts of investments that we announced in the budget and in the lead up to the last election.


They can be no choice for people in rural communities at the next election, because this government has demonstrated its commitment, which failed Labor over the course of its six years in government. People not just in the cities but in the bush know that this is a government that will get on with getting money back to frontline health services. We increase money going into hospitals in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, WA, South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory over the course of the forward estimates and we are very proud of that. We are very proud that that includes putting money into regional areas. In this year's budget we allocate $13.8 billion to hospitals across the states and territories. By 2017-18 that figure will have grown to $18.8 billion. That is an increase from 2013-14 to 2017-18 of just over $5 billion. That is a 36 per cent increase.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  That's a lot of money.




Mr DUTTON:
  My friend the member for Herbert says that it is a lot of money. Yes, it is. It is a lot of taxpayer's money. People have worked hard for it. We are not putting it into bureaucratic structures here in Canberra to please union bosses. We are putting it into practical programs on the ground that will help doctors, nurses and allied health professionals see patients. We are putting money into telehealth. We are putting money into stroke care. We are making sure that people in regional communities can see specialists through outreach programs. We can make sure that where specialists will not travel to regional communities we can provide those services via telehealth programs. That is what this government has done. That is what this government will continue to do through the wise investment of taxpayers' money. We will not be lectured by union bosses absolutely dominated day and night by those who sit outside this place, who pull the strings. We will get on with helping people in regional communities. The Labor Party failed for six years. (Time expired)

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (15:40):  I do have a degree of respect for the Minister for Health but that was one of the worst contributions to a matter of public importance that I have seen in my more than 18 years in this place. I grant him that he did not have much to work with, obviously having been so comprehensively rolled by the ERC and cabinet on so many occasions. Nothing else could explain his paltry contribution to this debate, if you can call it a debate. In a debate, no matter which side you sit on, you have to accept that others on the opposite side may have some points to make. The minister made no points whatsoever. He spent most of his time getting stuck into the trade union movement. What that has to do with this debate remains beyond me. When I think of the trade union movement within health services I think of ambos and nurses, who rely upon their unions to ensure their conditions and wages are maintained.


We do not have the speakers list from the other side. It will be interesting to see who comes to their feet. There are only two choices for people from rural and regional seats, seats like that of the member for Capricornia, who is in the chamber. I count the member for Bass in that category as well. Even the member for Macquarie I count in that category. Will they speak or will they run? They have two choices. They have to come in here and defend the indefensible or run. It will be interesting to see whether they run and it will be interesting to see whether all those other regional and rural National and Liberal party MPs—



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I did not see the member for Riverina sneaking across to the other side of the chamber. Of course I include him in that category, as I do the member for Lyne, who also is in the chamber. Let me tell them this: they will wear the abandonment of their seats around them like a crown of thorns all the way to the election. To paraphrase Paul Keating, there will be no early exit for any of them; we will pursue them slowly all the way to the next election. It will not be just the member for Bass and the member for Lyne but the member for Braddon, the member for Page, the member for Eden-Monaro and all those others in relatively marginal seats, who have completely abandoned their constituents.


Those on the opposite side, particularly the minister, do not seem to understand the difference between health in the capital cities and health in the bush. In the capital cities, of course, you have plenty of hospitals. You have plenty of GPs. That is why bulk-billing rates are so high, because GPs enter into competition for patients. You have plenty of nurses, although we can always have more. There are specialists galore. In the bush we go to Sydney too often—that is, if you live in New South Wales—to visit a specialist. Just as importantly as all of that is that we travel a long way to get to them. In the bush there are fewer GPs, fewer hospitals, fewer specialists and fewer nurses and it usually takes us a long time to access them. These things have always been taken into consideration by governments of all political persuasions when developing health policy.


Sadly, this government has abandoned those conventions. Not only has it cut the health budget generally but it has imposed a number of new savings initiatives which will fall disproportionately and adversely upon rural and regional Australians. The $7 GP tax of course does not apply just to GPs; it applies to a range of health services and is a perfect example of a savings measure which will fall disproportionately on those living in rural and regional Australia. The changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will fall more heavily on people living in rural and regional Australia. These are issues not canvassed by the minister in his contribution this afternoon. In fact at no point did he acknowledge that the way we deliver health services in rural and regional Australia is different from the way we deliver health services in the cities. They have taken the Medicare Locals, which in my area at least, have made an enormous contribution to closing that gap, enormously addressing GP to resident ratios. But I have got a very bad feeling: we will see no rural and regional member from that side contribute to this debate. (Time expired)

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2014-09-30,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (15:45):  In listening to this speech, we get a very clear idea of the opposition's motive here as we listened to a lot more about the National Party and nothing at all about regional health. With the indulgence of the House, I think I might speak on rural and regional health in this MPI. This looks like nothing more than a wedge. It is the sort of thing that Simon Crean used to specialise in.


But let us talk about regional health. Let us compare and contrast. The previous Howard government from the moment it was elected had a strong focus on rural and regional health. There were the John Flynn Scholarships to encourage people from regional backgrounds to go into medicine. There was looking at changing the way universities did their entry criteria so that more people from rural backgrounds would go into a course in medicine. There was the experience in my electorate, for example, of Flinders University which established in the mid-90s a parallel rural curriculum and showed with an evidence base that instead of a teaching hospital you could actually do your training in a rural general practice. This was built on by having university departments of rural health and then from 1998-1999 rural clinical schools. You just have to look at Townsville, and James Cook University where we now have a rurally based clinical school with a reputation for excellence in the area of tropical health where the students are coming, by and large, from a rural and regional background and looking towards a career in rural and regional health. That is the sort of transformation that we have seen. Look at the Prime Minister when he was Minister for Health. He realised that we did have a shortage, a workforce issue, in rural and regional areas. He doubled the numbers of medical students going through and doubled the numbers of nursing students. Then there is in the area of mental health. We expanded the access to mental health through Medicare. We also had a program, the ATAPS program, which meant that people in regional areas were able to access a fund and get access to psychologists and allied mental health services which previously had not been possible. 


Compare and contrast that with the approach the Rudd government took. We had a big National Health and Hospital Reform Commission and one of the recommendations that came out of that was activity based funding in public hospitals. Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister, grabbed it—a fantastic thought bubble—saying that we were going to have activity based funding in every public hospital in Australia. Wrong. Big problem. Anyone with any knowledge of health policy understands that activity based funding, while it is a great policy in metropolitan areas and metropolitan hospitals with high workloads, does not work in those rural hospitals which have seasonal fluctuations and much smaller caseloads. Thankfully, the Labor Party did see sense on that and realised that Kevin's thought bubble was not long-lasting.


So when we look at the state of play in Australia right now, we have 18 medical schools and a number of them were opened during the period of the Howard government in regional areas. We have seen the numbers of doctors graduating increase from 1,660 in 2000 to 3,469 in 2010. We see that spending on rural health workforce programs is more than $1 billion. The Abbott government has been in for one year and already they are looking at addressing all of the areas that we need to in rural health. They are looking at increasing the funding for general practitioners who do teaching, through the PIP, and there is a loading for people in rural areas and, instead of having the dopey GP Super Clinic program, actually encouraging in regional areas to increase their infrastructure for teaching with 500 additional scholarships for nursing and allied health students. They are also looking at expanding medical internships in non-traditional areas. We have expanded the numbers of GP training places by 300 for next year—from 1,200 to 1,500.


These are the real and tangible things that are happening. There is no doubt that the health of Australians in rural and regional areas is not as good as in the rest of Australia. There is no doubt that the workforce needs to be better. There is more to be done but we have got a good track record and we are continuing with the job.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (15:50):  It is with pleasure that I join my Labor colleagues to address this issue concerning the government's broken promises and their failures on rural and regional health. I welcome the contribution from the member for Boothby just a moment ago and I would like to return to the issue of some of the health workforce issues.


It is undeniable that the Abbott Liberal-National government is failing people in rural and regional Australia, and their supposed representatives in this government—in particular, the National Party—have gone into hiding. We have watched them hide from their budget plans as those plans went from bad to worse. But when it comes to health policy, the evidence is especially damning. It is not just Labor Party people saying this. In case members opposite want to chant their usual retort about 'scaremongering' and 'whipping up a storm', I would just like to share with the House a few comments from people working in this area, some experts. The CEO of Services for Australian Rural and Remote Allied Health, Rod Wellington, said:


This budget will exacerbate the key inequities in health coverage outside urban Australia …


He could not be more right. The Vice-President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Dr John Hall, had something to say too. He warned us:


The new arrangements will only make it much more difficult for rural Australians, who are among Australia's poorest people, to afford healthcare …


The real danger is that many of the poorest rural patients will choose not to see a doctor for preventative healthcare, and will then present in subsequent years with serious health issues that will cost the health system and hospitals significantly more to treat.


That is exactly what we are trying to avoid. This government has misunderstood the health needs of rural and regional Australians. Compared to people living in major cities, we know that people living in rural Australia are far more likely to be affected by chronic diseases and illnesses. We have already heard that they are more likely to have melanoma, serious injuries and obesity. And if you are a man, increased risk suicide is a really serious issue. But this government has nothing to say about the issues in this space. 


To make matters worse, we know that the out-of-pocket health costs in rural Australia are significantly more. We know that people are earning less money in regional Australia and access to any form of health care is more expensive and takes more time. Any additional obstacles that this government puts in the way of regional Australians just increase the difficulties and the inequities which already exist in our health system. The actions of this government—the ongoing broken promises—are just making it that much tougher for rural Australians. When we look at the budget cuts that have come down from this government we already know that the Hunter New England Health service in my electorate is set to lose more than $156 million in funding over the next five years.


This Prime Minister will remember well the leadership debates at Rooty Hill where he stood up and said:


We are not shutting any Medicare Locals.


He could not be clearer—no ambiguity whatsoever: 'We are not shutting any Medicare Locals.' I have got news for members opposite. There are 61 Medicare Locals all around Australia—a great Labor initiative—under threat of having their doors closed. Medicare Locals—there is one my electorate—have been the pioneers of GP access after hours. It is a model that this government should roll out across the nation. You want to shut the doors on that? There is not a single family or senior person in Newcastle who does not sing the praises of the after-hours GP access service provided by Hunter Medicare Local. But no. This government is going to shut those doors. They are going to rip out all of the infrastructure currently in place in regional Australia to deliver primary health care. Shame on you!

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-09-30,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (15:55):  The opposition appear to think they have a mortgage on doing anything good in the health portfolio. I would just like to remind the House of their track record. In the Treasury portfolio, they inherited a $20 billion surplus and $45 billion in the bank. At the end of the June quarter, there was $319.473 billion in government securities for the nation to pay back. Their legacy in health, apart from what they alluded to before, is a lot of ballooning bureaucracy and broken promises—an incredible waste.


The previous speaker mentioned the wonderful Medicare Locals. They inherited a $1.8 billion budget and managed to spend 40 per cent of it on bureaucrats and buildings. The Divisions of General Practice Network were just washed away and consumed into this overwhelming bureaucracy. At the opening of the Medicare Local in my electorate, when I was a practising doctor, the CEO walked in and said, 'We've got a $20 million budget. We'd like you to tell us what we should do with it.' Talk about too much money and no idea about what to do with it! That was just a classic Labor Party thought bubble. But the thought bubble grew so big that it became a $1.8 billion thought bubble. Not only did they increase that bureaucracy, but there were 11 other bureaucracies and a 27 per cent increase in bureaucrats. About 64 GP super clinics were promised. 


In my electorate, in the town of Port Macquarie, we have had a super clinic for over 20 years and there were no government grants involved in that. They made a promise and allocated $7.5 million for a super clinic in Port Macquarie in 2010. But two private ones were designed, built and have been operating for three years and that $7.5 million is still involved in turning an old hotel, which had been a nursing home, into a whole new super clinic. So four years later we have all that capital tied up. Imagine the drugs for rare diseases or for ground-breaking cancer treatments that we could have approved and paid for with $7 billion—let alone the $650 million program.


They attacked private health insurance at every opportunity—the trouble is that there are 11 million people in this country who depend on it—whether it be removing the indexation, introducing means-testing or removing the lifetime health cover rebate. They introduced the co-payment system for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. They have been supporting it for 25 years and now, when we are trying to keep it sustainable by increasing the cost by 80c for a pensioner and $5 for non concession card holders, they are opposing it. It is gross hypocrisy. The shadow minister for health walked out when this debate on a matter of public importance started. At least our Minister for Health stayed here. We have an Assistant Minister for Health, Fiona Nash, who resides in the other place—that is the only reason she could not be here: she is a senator—and she does a damn good job. She grew up in the regions. She knows what it is like.


So what are we doing? We are making the health budget sustainable. Health funding is being increased from $64 billion in 2013-$14 to $75 billion by the 2017-18 budget. In New South Wales, for instance, it will increase each year from $4.6 billion in 2014-15 to $5.9 billion in 2017-18. Look at the Medical Research Future Fund. That will be a great legacy for the country. The clever accountants in the Labor Party pulled a swiftie on the medical research community and withdrew $400 million in 2011 by funding things in arrears rather than prospectively. How sneaky can you get? You try to make out you have not cut anything, but you move things around in the budget and—bingo: you have saved yourself $400 million. They are all going quiet now, aren't they? We are trying to make Medicare sustainable. It has gone up 122 per cent and we have to make it sustainable. (Time expired)

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:01):  I would also like to highlight the appalling speech made by the Minister for Health in this debate. He attacked hardworking health professionals; he attacked our ambos; he attacked our nurses. I am not surprised that there is a Liberal in this place attacking our ambos, because they do it every day in Victoria. Their state government has failed to negotiate a decent agreement with decent working conditions for the Victorian ambos. Their Code Red campaign has been ongoing because the state Liberal government has failed. I am not surprised to hear the health minister not only attack this MPI but make a personal attack on people involved in the health sector. I am not surprised because, when he was the shadow health minister, he came to Bendigo but did not talk about health. He did not let people in Bendigo know that he would introduce a GP tax. He did not let people in Bendigo know—and here is a fact—that he would cut $25 million from Bendigo Health. He stood up in front of a Bendigo Health sign and talked about the carbon tax. He did not talk about health care of central Victorians; he spoke about the carbon tax.


When the then Leader of the Opposition, today the Prime Minister, went around talking to patients and tweeting a photo, he did not say that, when he became Prime Minister, he would oversee a budget that would rip millions of dollars out of health care in regional Victoria; he spoke about the carbon tax. That is the twisted priority of the government. They do not care about people in the bush and they continue to punish people in rural and regional Australia. That is why we have not seen many speakers opposite from country electorates, whether they be country Liberals or country Nationals, stand up and speak on this MPI about regional health.


On this side, we know that regional health is a big issue. People living in the regions are 1.3 times more likely to report with diabetes, they are 1.2 to 1.3 times more likely to get melanoma, they are 1.2 times more likely to suffer serious injury and they are 1.1 times more likely to be obese, particularly in regional Victoria and my part of the world. Funding which was going towards preventative healthcare programs has now been cut—another cut because of this government.


I know I am not alone in raising these facts because the member for Mallee himself, one National Party member who does occasionally speak up for his electorate, stood outside this place, not inside, and said that people in regional Victoria, in his part of the world, have a life expectancy 4.7 years lower than their city counterparts. Yet, rather than address that life expectancy issue, what we see from this government are more and more attacks on regional healthcare services. This government does not have a plan for regional healthcare services; all this government does is attack and cut. We have seen regional health professionals standing up and speaking out, and this government has no way to respond to them. The GPs of Castlemaine have spoken out several times and they have written to the Prime Minister asking him to reverse his plan for a GP tax. To this date they are still waiting for a response. The government not only does not have a decent plan for improving regional health care; it is also not responding to constituents and people working in the sector.


One of the main reasons these GPs are so concerned in regional Australia, particularly Victoria, is that these GPs are on call for urgency care units—not emergency care units, where the doctors are paid by the state government, but urgency care units, which are staffed by regional doctors. Some who work in private clinics, some who work in bulk-billing clinics and some who work in GP superclinics are on a roster and they staff these urgency care units. What this government is doing to those doctors is that, every time somebody presents at an urgency care unit, it is expecting these doctors to be the tax collector and collect $7. It will put these urgency care units at risk. For some of these patients, their urgency care unit is two hours away from another hospital. This government is forcing those families to make a choice: do they go to the urgency care unit, which may not be open because it has been closed due to this government's policies, or get in the car and drive for two hours? Let's remember: they do not have any ambos because of the state government's inability to train and invest in a workforce and establish fair rostering for our ambos.


This government should finally stand up for regional health. This government should have a plan for regional health. This government should stop attacking unions and attacking people standing up for regional health and do the right thing. (Time expired)

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (16:06):  It is with respect that I suggest that the member for Bendigo may need to have her hearing checked, because her claims with regard to what the Minister for Health said were absolutely false. I am astounded that Labor can rise to speak in this place about these apparent failures. They have short-term memories when it comes to how the coalition government left the economy in 2007 and how drastically the economy deteriorated under Labor's short tenure. The member for Throsby has been quite busy lately visiting the electorate of Macquarie, rallying the public on the issue of health again, sidetracking the public from the woes they left behind and interfering with what this government is required to do to fix them. Labor have been and will always continue to be out for the media grab or a deflection from their own broken promises and failures.


Firstly, let me remind the House of some—given I only have a few minutes—of Labor's broken promises. With superclinics Labor promised 64, but what did we get? Thirty-three. Labor promised no cutting of the private health insurance rebates. What did we get? Four billion dollars worth of cuts in that space. I would like the member for Throsby to explain that to the 56,000 people in the electorate of Macquarie who have private health insurance. What would you say to them who now struggle to pay their private health insurance? New medicines already referred to by the PBAC—what did we get under Labor? Deferred. Labor tried to take $400 million from medical research in 2011 and then reversed their stance at the last moment. One hundred and forty million dollars was taken out of medical research last year using tricky accounting, hiding it in a budget that paid the National Health and Medical Research Council funding monthly in arrears rather than quarterly in advance.


In contrast, in just one year the coalition has worked to act on what we committed to prior to the 2013 election. First, this government is committed to ensuring we spend precious health money in the most efficient way, ensuring each dollar is spent on improving patients' outcomes. This was not the case under Labor; they created more than 10 new health bureaucracies instead of putting more doctors and nurses in front of patients.


In relation to pharmaceuticals the previous government deferred already recommended PBS items. In contrast, since stepping into government the coalition has listed 221 and is listing medicines twice as fast as Labor. We are listing in excess of 20 medicines each month in contrast to Labor's average of eight. Back to medical research: instead of last-minute flips and tricky accounting, this government is taking measures that will see medical research taken seriously in Australia, with the recent announcement of a $20 billion medical research future fund.


Budget papers do not lie and, in spite of Labor's continuous scaremongering, including in the electorate of Macquarie, health and hospital funding is increasing each year over the forward estimates. In New South Wales hospital funding will increase each year, from $4.6 billion in 2014-15 to $5.9 billion in 2017-18. In rural health, where the member for Throsby says we have broken our promises, the coalition government is investing $40 million over four years to create additional intern training capacity, $52.5 million for infrastructure grants to build on the teaching and supervision of the rural and regional medical workforce, $13.4 million to provide 500 additional scholarships for nursing and allied health professionals and $238 million to double the practice incentives payment for teaching and general practice.


October is Mental Health Month I would like to finish by speaking on the coalition's investment in this area. With three-quarters of all mental illness manifested in people under the age of 25, the coalition government is supporting people experiencing mental health issues by expanding the highly successful headspace network by an additional 10 sites, taking total to 100 sites across Australia by 2015-16. We are also investing $80 million over four years to establish a national centre of excellence in youth mental health and are providing $5 million over three years in funding to the Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre. This government is focused on delivering real outcomes while ensuring sustainability for the future.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-09-30,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (16:10):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this MPI on the government's broken promises and failures in rural and regional health, because there are so many broken promises. It has been interesting listening to the contributions from the other side. I do not recall any of them talking about the GP tax. All of those speakers from the Minister for Health to all the backbenches. I particularly note the member for Lyne not once in his contribution mentioned the $7 doctor tax. I wonder what the good people of Lyne—the people who are severely impacted by his support for such an unfair, cruel and unjust tax—think of that. It is fascinating. None of them were prepared to defend any of their harsh and cruel actions. We will certainly outline some of them. You have heard some of the harsh actions outlined today by the speakers on our side.


The fact is this government has a trail of broken promises across a huge range of areas, and for regional areas those cuts to health are some of the very cruellest. The fact is that the Liberal-National Party is continuing to punish people in regional and rural Australia. In fact, it is the Nationals who are responsible for these cruel cuts to health. Indeed, the cruellest cut is probably the $7 doctor tax, which makes it so much harder for people in country areas to actually access health services. It is one of their many, many broken promises.


The fact is that in rural and regional Australia out-of-pocket health costs are higher, and they will only increase with this government's unfair policies. Indeed, another broken promise was about Medicare locals. We have spoken about that today as well. This will have a huge impact on regional areas because Medicare locals have been very effective particularly at coordinating a lot of different services in rural areas that did not have that before. They have been able to provide great services where there were gaps before. Of course it is another broken promise. I refer to this wonderful book about the Abbott government's broken election promises—there are so many. This book refers specifically to health, but there are many listed. We return to 28 August 2013, when the Prime Minister—the then Leader of the Opposition—said, 'We're not shutting any Medicare locals.' What happened? They broke that promise. All 61 Medicare locals will be axed. This is devastating for regional areas. Not many from the city electorates over there would understand, and we know the regional ones do not care. Medicare locals actually do an incredibly important job in our rural areas, so we certainly need to have them in place.


As we have heard other speakers say today, people living in rural and regional areas have some of the very poorest health outcomes. Incomes are low, and we know that chronic disease rates are much higher. There is also a higher proportion of Indigenous population with poorer health conditions. Access to health is more expensive, and there are also far greater distances in regional areas. That is why other broken promises like the petrol tax are devastating; people have to travel further in regional areas. So that is another broken promise that impacts people.


As I have said, people in regional areas have poorer health outcomes. Despite all of this, the Abbott government's first budget really declared war on Medicare. It really was horrendous. Introducing the doctor tax for all patients will cost over $1.4 billion to communities living outside metropolitan centres, and those rural and regional patients will be charged over and over again when they see the doctor, when they fill their prescriptions and when they get scans, X-rays and blood tests as well. That, on top of the increases to PBS medicines, will just mean that people from these regional areas will not access healthcare services. That is what your government has done. People from these areas just will not do it. That is what they are telling us. They simply cannot afford it.


But let's compare all of that—all that devastation, all of that harm, all of those hurtful policies—to what Labor did when we were in government and the great changes we made.


We have a very proud record when it comes to health reform. Firstly, we are the party that introduced Medicare 30 years go—and we are very proud to be defending it today. We also made great advances, when we were in government, getting GPs to rural and regional areas, and increasing bulk-billing rates to the highest level in history. That is a great achievement. Labor lifted the bulk-billing rates to over 82 per cent, on average.


When the now Prime Minister was health minister they were as low as 67 per cent. That is pretty low. We also heard some great achievements—like the GP superclinic in my electorate, which is fantastic. It was funded, built and delivered by Labor, and it provides a great variety of allied health services. So we will always fight to ensure that there are great health services in our regional areas. But the biggest attack on future health and hospital services in rural and regional areas comes from the National Party. It comes from the National Party because they are out there with cruel policies like the doctor tax. They are pursuing the funding cuts in hospitals and they are devastating regional areas.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:15):  This debate is about people living in the bush. It is about the practitioners and providers that deliver world-class health services to one of the most sparsely populated places on the planet. If you are in this chamber, on either side, I know that you fundamentally support the great work that they do. But I will tell you one thing about people from the bush—they know bulldust when they see it. They know talking-point ping-pong when they see it. And I will tell you what they want—they want us, down here in Canberra, fully focused and fully committed to better services in the bush. 


In the six years of Labor government there was plenty of money spent but not a lot of change on the ground. We have come to government with a very different focus, and that is to listen to the people on the ground. We will listen to the rural doctors; we will listen to the rural health agencies that were here even last week—the rural health networks that tell us what people in the bush want. 


As we have one of the truly sparse places on earth, with the finest health system in the world, we need to listen to the rural doctors and ask them how they do it, and we need to make their jobs easier. Nothing is achieved by screaming at each other down here in Canberra. The rural doctors have released Think rural, with 10 recommendations. I will run through them very quickly. The first of them is to sort out training for interns, registrars, house officers and medical students, and make sure that we provision for them. The coalition have put in $40 million over four years to get those internships funded, when the Labor government over the last six years simply dithered at the challenge. 


We need specific ways of identifying the truly committed and impassioned health clinicians who want to be rural docs. We need to identify them early and get them started. And we need an advanced rural training pathway, acknowledging that the job of a doctor in the bush is completely different to the job of an urban doctor. They do a completely different job, as many overseas trained doctors learn to their chagrin. We need to have a specific training pathway for them.


We need to know that overseas trained doctors, who have committed to this beautiful country and have moved to one of the most remote parts here and set up practice, can have their kids going to a state school, that they still get coverage under Medicare and that we will look after these new citizens and respect them as equals, as they have been adjudged by the Medical Council. Because they are just that—they are the backbone of rural health service provision in so many areas where we cannot get an Aussie trained doctor to work.


We need to have the infrastructure. The general practitioners in the bush will tell you that they have nowhere to accommodate the medical students. That is why we need to have practice incentives—$238 million over four years—that partners do that with the $52 million of coalition money matching, dollar for dollar, the commitments by rural practices. No, we are not having pop-up superclinics around the country right next door to existing general practice. We are doing it where general practices put in 50 per cent of the amount. 


Lastly, we want to see some recognition of incentives to go bush. If someone commits to working out in Camooweal they deserve a little bit more than someone who lives on the Queensland coast. We need to recognise those GPs who invest their lives in the bush.


I just want to say thank you to the docs who head out there and do that great work, and thank you to the nurses, who know their towns backwards. I want to say thank you to the allied health practitioners, who drive hundreds of kilometres every week delivering their expertise to communities that cannot support a single professional with their skills. I want to thank those who take out private health cover, who fund the system that builds the hospitals of the future. Thank you to the half of the Australian population, who, because they can pay for their private health, do just that. I want to say to CEO Gordon Gregory and Chair Tim Kelly from the National Rural Health Alliance: thank you for coming down here and giving us your views, not just on the future of Primary Health Networks, which you understand can do the job, but also on the importance of an adequate NBN so that these practices can do their job—they can work in telehealth so that the education reforms that we are proposing will release more, not fewer, highly qualified health providers to the bush.


I know that they are fully committed to dental services being delivered, and they are committed to seeing them delivered by private dentists. We know that 98 per cent of dentists work in the private sector, and no matter how much those on the other side of the chamber have an aversion to private services, if you do not have private dentists on board it ain't gonna happen. 


I thank the National Rural Health Alliance for putting their views so clearly. We could do far better spending this time in the chamber listening to those expert bodies, listening to Jenny Johnson and Dr Paul Mara from the Rural Doctors Association, because they are on the ground, looking after the local people. They know that those communities will support a small copayments to keep the health system running effectively. They know that the compassion of doctors is such that those who cannot afford to pay a copayment will never be asked to do so.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott

Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (21:00): I recently visited the CSIRO Clayton campus in my electorate of Chisholm. I have been there many times over the past 16 years but with each visit, briefing and demonstration from the leading scientists and researchers there, I manage to always come away more impressed and more amazed at the level of innovation and advancement being achieved. 


Sadly though, this visit was marred by the severe cuts in government funding that are being faced by the CSIRO Clayton researchers. This financial year, CSIRO has been hit with a $27 million cut and over the next five years $114 million will be stripped from CSIRO's research facilities nationwide. These figures are devastating. In the case of CSIRO, it translates into the loss of 500 jobs and the closure of eight research sites across the country. The cuts will also have major impacts on the collaborative research programs that CSIRO is actively pursuing with business interest. In my electorate CSIRO is working with local business networks such as the South East Melbourne Manufactures Alliance to bring the benefit of research directly into the commercial environment, placing research scientists directly into the businesses so that the research is done in real commercial spaces with results that can be applied quickly to improve production techniques, reduce costs and increase competitiveness. This is science helping to create jobs.


But the future of Australian science and the CSIRO work is at serious risk. Research by the Parliamentary Library shows our national investment in science and innovation has reached 25-year low of 0.56 per cent of GDP. This is just shocking. And the Prime Minister's unfair budget will cut that even more.


Investment in science and innovation is an investment in Australia's future. A 2012 study established that basic research investment leads to 30 times more economic growth, while investment in applied research leads to 10 times economic growth. Why then is this current government slashing support for science and research when investment in the field is clearly to the advantage of our nation's development? This is just nonsensical. Australia is ranked 18 out of 20 of OECD nations in science and research investment. We are losing the race and the government wants us to fall back to dead last. This is an environment where we are seeing manufacturing jobs being diminished every day. What are they going to be replaced with unless we are looking at science, innovation and research to create the jobs of the future?


An estimated $420 million is to be snatched from five key science and research agencies, while approximately $845 million will be taken from science specific industry support and innovation programs over the next five years. The Prime Minister loves to make the claim, 'If we don't make the necessary decisions now, it will only become tougher in the years ahead,' But cutting funding to science does not strengthen our position for the future. Without government funding to organisations such as CSIRO, we would not enjoy the technological breakthroughs such as polymer banknotes and Wi-Fi that we do on a daily basis—and the money and jobs these innovations have generated. 


The cuts will also affect the coming generation. Without support for a broad range of innovative projects, jobs will become limited to a few areas of science. But these areas and research create jobs across the board and across the spectrum through all manufacturing and all areas of life. With limited funds, we will lose leading researchers to countries that do invest in research. As it stands, science workers face short-term contracts and yearly funding uncertainty, resulting in many trained scientists leaving the lab to retrain for other fields. Moreover, the science community faces high levels of employment uncertainty resulting in the loss of valuable talent to other countries who present better opportunities and security. In the words of Dr Tim Nielsen, the cuts to science and research funding are incalculable. As he aptly summarises:


Faced with a thankless 40-year battle for career survival, and little material reward or public recognition, it is not difficult to understand why so many young scientists are hanging up their labcoats and taking their extraordinary intellects and years of training elsewhere.


Science and research is an investment from which our nation has received valuable returns. CSIRO's Wi-Fi patent to date has earned $230 million dollars in revenue. Research is not an expense to be cut. It requires nurturing, which means long-term meaningful investment.


The Prime Minister must restore the funding to science and not sacrifice our future for a short-term saving today, a saving that will not help but actually be a cut that will reverberate down the generations. This is another short-sighted cut that should be reversed.
