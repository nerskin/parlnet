"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2003-12-01,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, I present the committee's report entitled Regional aviation and island transport services: making ends meet, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—Although the phrase `making ends meet' might seem an unusual choice for the title of a report on regional aviation and alternative sea services, let me assure you it is not. Symbolically and literally, the title is wholly relevant. Symbolically, there is a need for the ends or outposts of Australia to be engaged with the major capital and provincial cities; nationally, there is a need for the regions to be connected to major population centres to guarantee economic and social development; literally, there are many areas of Australia that are quite simply unable to make ends meet in providing air and sea transport services to their local communities; and practically, regional airlines are having difficulties making ends meet as their costs rise and their markets erode.
Some of these added costs are due to increases in taxes, aviation safety regulation and the cost recovery activities of the three tiers of government. On some airline tickets there are as many as 11 taxes, charges and levies. Others estimate the three tiers of government between them add between 20 per cent and 45 per cent to the cost of a regional airline ticket. Regional travellers want cheap, efficient transport and are increasingly turning to motor vehicles, with implications for timeliness, safety and economics. Competition policy can only be successful where the market is well developed and industry structures are sound. Evidence indicates that, while competition delivers savings to larger communities and their air routes, smaller communities cannot sustain a competitive market. This report identifies strategic areas of improvement and intervention to offset this policy conflict.
At a time of many significant challenges to the aviation industry—and to regional and island communities themselves—this report recommends a number of new and innovative policy developments, as well as adjustments to some current policy settings. I will outline some highlights from the report's 28 recommendations. In the field of airport maintenance and upgrade, we recommend only special one-off grants to communities with populations over 30,000, but Commonwealth subsidies of 50 per cent to smaller communities providing regular RPT services to their airports and 33 per cent subsidies for country airports providing less regular RPT services, charter and aerial ambulance facilitation.
The committee also recommends improving the sea transport services or infrastructure for Flinders Island, Kangaroo Island, the Tiwi Islands, Norfolk Island and other external territories; and extending a number of existing measures to assist regional and remote communities. To improve the environment in which regional airlines operate, the committee recommends certain improvements to the administration of aviation safety regulation. Central to this is the establishment of an independent aviation ombudsman to deal with industry specific complaints. The committee has also identified a need for taxation assistance for the replacement of small ageing aircraft. To build the capacity of the operators, the committee recommends training assistance to improve the management skills of smaller regional airline operators in particular. 
The issues identified in this report cannot be neglected any longer. To put these issues on the backburner will guarantee that in four or five years time regional Australia, its airports and its air services will be facing an even greater crisis, if not a terminal one. I repeat: action must be taken now. All Australians have a basic right of engagement with the wider Australian community. Improving regional aviation and island services is a matter of equity, a matter of efficiency and economic development and a matter of genuine social engagement. In commending Ian Beckingham and his team, as well as the secretariat itself under Ian Dundas and Anna Dacre, we believe this report can really deliver to regional Australia.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Transport and Regional Services Committee</title>,Committees,0,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I would like to support the comments made by the committee chair and thank all members of the committee for their participation. I also extend the committee's thanks to all witnesses and all those who provided a submission to the inquiry. On 18 June 2002, the minister asked the committee to inquire into commercial regional aviation services in Australia and transport links to major populated islands. The committee received 191 submissions and conducted hearings in Wagga Wagga, Adelaide, Kangaroo Island, Melbourne, Flinders Island, Launceston and Canberra.
The report contains a number of recommendations that I will present to the House, but before I do I must note the importance regional communities place on local airports. Regional airports are critical to economic and social infrastructure. To the business community, the airport facilitates quick access to markets for time sensitive and perishable produce. Indeed, regional aviation services are integral to Australia's supply chains—a point that cities often forget. The local airport has a significant social impact. Having the local aerodrome and knowing that there is easy access in and out of regional areas is an important comfort and is highly valued by isolated communities. The demise of our regional aviation services has the potential to set this country back 50 years.
The inquiry centred on a number of key issues affecting regional aviation services, the operating environment, government policies and the regulator. Regional aviation has been through a tough time. These tough times demand a higher level of management expertise to separate the emotional pull from the reality of making hard commercial decisions. Evidence provided to the committee suggests that the difficulties of some regional airlines arose from poor commercial decision making.
The committee recommends that both an awareness program and a program to improve business management skills be developed and implemented to encourage greater management. Whilst management training programs are available, there is very poor uptake. There appears to be a growing divide between larger regional centres with adequate and well patronised services and small centres with struggling or non-existent services. The committee heard evidence that inadequate air services can impede the development of a range of industries in regional Australia and that maintenance of safe and efficient airport infrastructure has been a challenge. The committee recommends either a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance or that the government resume ownership and funding of all essential airports in communities with populations of less than 30,000. 
The committee also recommends that funding for the remote air service subsidy scheme be maintained at least at the 2003-04 level. The challenges faced by island and remote communities in providing viable, safe, and efficient airports are made greater by the very nature of their physical location and population base. The government has a responsibility to ensure appropriate transport services are provided. Highways cater for fast passenger movement and fast freight movement, but for island communities air services are the only way to get time sensitive produce to markets.
The committee heard evidence that government policy has placed additional costs on the regional aviation industry, with a series of hidden taxes that are embedded in the cost of each ticket. It noted that where competition is not effective in delivering consumer benefits because of market failure, government intervention is justified to achieve economic and social objectives. The committee recommended that the government:
	Strengthen the public interest test of the National Competition Policy by specifically requiring regional aviation and island transport policies to be assessed against the interests of rural and regional communities.
The committee also recommended that:
... the Department of Transport and Regional Services:
	Verify the adequacy of regulation impact statements for amending aviation safety regulations prepared by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority; and
	Assess that the cost impacts calculated are reasonable and justified, taking into account the importance of regional aviation to regional, rural and remote communities.
In addition to the cost of dealing with the introduction of new regulations, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth establish an aviation ombudsman. The duties of the ombudsman would include examining operational complaints, conducting independent surveys of industry and maintaining the confidentiality of respondents. These surveys would assess the effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's measures to improve the consistency of its interpretation of aviation regulations. I highly recommend to members of the House that they read the committee report and that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services embrace the committee's recommendations.

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Latvia from 24 to 28 September 2003 and to the 109th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Geneva, 30 September to 3 October 2003, and seek leave to make a statement.
Leave granted.
—The report that I have just tabled records the result of a parliamentary bilateral visit to Latvia and the work of the Australian delegation at the 109th assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Geneva. I had the honour of being deputy leader of the Australian delegation that also comprised Senator Chapman, who led our group, Senator Ferris and the member for Calwell, Maria Vamvakinou.
The Australian delegation participated fully in the IPU Assembly with delegates attending the meetings of the IPU Council, the IPU Assembly, the 12 Plus Geopolitical Group and the Asia-Pacific Geopolitical Group. The delegation also participated in the work of the three standing committees. Indeed, the member for Calwell was elected to the drafting committee of the First committee and Senator Chapman was elected Chair of the Third committee's drafting committee.
The council adopted several resolutions. These are set out in detail in the delegation's report and I commend them to honourable members. I also draw members' attention to the important work of the IPU Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, details of which are included in the delegation's report.
This year's meeting of the IPU in Geneva was not without some controversy and I think it appropriate to record in this House the views and actions of the delegation on the matter of the venue for the 110th assembly next year. In Geneva, the British delegation which was to host the 110th assembly in London in 2004 informed the IPU that the British government would not issue visas to certain nominated parliamentarians from Zimbabwe in conformity with European Union and other international travel bans imposed on these individuals because of human rights abuses. 
The executive committee of the IPU concluded that the 110th assembly could not be held in London and would need to be transferred to another venue. This was based on the view that the IPU functions on the premise that meetings of the organisation can only take place when all delegates freely designated by member parliaments are assured of receiving the required visa for participation. The Australian delegation took the view that: parliamentarians from Zimbabwe who were not subject to international travel bans imposed because of human rights abuses would be able to attend the assembly in London; the IPU is an organisation founded on the principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law; and the British delegation had already spent over 1 million preparing for the conference and in the circumstances it would be unfair and inappropriate to take the event from them.
Accordingly, on behalf of the Australian delegation I moved:
That the Governing Council affirms the decision taken in Santiago de Chile that the 110th Assembly of the IPU be held in London in 2004. 
The motion was seconded by the delegation from Ireland. I spoke to the motion, as did delegates from Egypt, Ireland, Namibia, South Africa, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. I remember the Zimbabweans going quite over the top. In fact one of the guys who wanted a visa but was not going to get one started accusing us of doing all manner of things to our own Indigenous population et cetera and did not do his cause any good. Anyway, that was another matter. The matter was put to a rollcall vote. Unfortunately, the motion was defeated by 132 votes in favour and 87 against, with 27 abstentions. Therefore London will not host the 110th assembly and I understand that alternative venues are presently being looked at.
There are always many people who assist this parliament's delegations in their work and we recognise the valuable efforts of these good people in the report. In particular, on behalf of past and present IPU delegates I would like to place on record our sincere appreciation of the work of Mr Phillip Allars, who has provided sound advice and unfailing assistance to many IPU delegations. He is off to a new posting and we wish him all the very best in his new position. He is a terrific fellow and I think a lot of people who are part of this parliament know what he does. We hope that we can catch up with him in his new posting in the Pacific Islands—Samoa, I think.
In the lead-up to the IPU conference, the delegation participated in a bilateral visit to Latvia. The visit was very successful and I am confident that, as a result, relations between our two countries, and particularly between the two parliaments, have been enhanced and strengthened. The delegation had a very busy and comprehensive program. I would like to share with members three highlights of the visit. They say a lot about the new country of Latvia, its past, its current situation and its future. The first relates to the delegation's visit to the Museum of the Occupation housed in a building near the old city of Riga, the capital of Latvia. Latvia's tragic legacy of occupation under Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia is not well known outside of the country. The museum contains tragic and painful reminders of this occupation, including historical documents, artefacts and pictures. Particularly poignant was a broken violin made from thin boards and soup bones by exiled Latvian inmates in a Russian detention camp.  
The second significant visit was to Ventspils, an ice free port on the Baltic Sea about 200 kilometres from Riga. As the delegation's report records, Ventspils is very much a reflection of what Latvia is today. It is a city that is progressive and focused on actively addressing economic, social and environmental challenges. In the decade since Latvia gained independence in 1991, Ventspils has been through a period of rebirth and renewal, becoming one of the cleanest, safest and best-kept urban centres in Latvia. As our report records, Ventspils has undergone sweeping environmental clean-up programs which have transformed it from what was described as an `ecological disaster area' into a well-kept and environmentally conscious city.
The free port of Ventspils plays a crucial role in the economic and commercial life of Latvia. The delegation was given a tour of Ventspils Nafta, the leading company for transshipment of oil and oil products in the Baltic Sea region; the Ventspils Olympic Centre, which is one of the most modern sports complexes in the Baltic region; and the Ventspils Museum, which is a modern high-tech museum housed in an impressively restored 13th century castle of the Livonian order. These visits left the delegation in no doubt that the future for Latvia is very positive. 
We also met with the Deputy Speaker of the Latvian parliament—a very interesting man in his own right, being a priest and a martial arts expert. At this meeting the Deputy Speaker discussed with the delegation the previous weekend's referendum in which 67 per cent of Latvians voted in favour of joining the European Union in 2004. This momentous decision obviously dominated just about every meeting of the delegation in Latvia, as it has implications for every sector of Latvian society. The Deputy Speaker recognised that joining the European Union will have significant economic and financial implications but he emphasised that joining the EU was also about Latvia's vision for the future, based on the values of liberty, freedom, human rights and dignity.
During the delegation's visit it became obvious that Latvia, with its fast-growing but stable economy, also faces significant challenges and certainly will be extending and strengthening relations with Russia. The delegation has made four recommendations that it hopes will enhance parliamentary, intergovernmental and commercial relations.
Finally, I want to place on record our grateful thanks to the Australian Ambassador in Latvia, Mr Richard Rowe. He is doing an excellent job for Australia in Latvia and the other Baltic countries, Estonia and Lithuania. I am confident that our visit has assisted him in his work.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 56—Treaties tabled on 8 October 2003: Economic and commercial cooperation—Kazakhstan; ILO convention No. 182—elimination of worst forms of child labour, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Report 56 contains the findings of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into two proposed treaty actions tabled in the parliament on 8 October 2003, relating to the matters identified in the title of the report. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The bilateral Agreement on Economic and Commercial Cooperation with Kazakhstan, once in force, will facilitate trade and economic cooperation between ourselves and Kazakhstan. The agreement prescribes that each country grant the other most favoured nation treatment with respect to duties, taxes or charges imposed in connection with the import or export of goods. It also provides a formal framework within which any future commercial dispute can be managed. The committee understands that the text of the agreement is similar to that of similar agreements between Australia and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
This is the second time that this agreement has come under the scrutiny of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It was first reviewed by the committee in 1997. During that review the committee discovered, among other things, that Telstra had experienced severe difficulties in the operation of a joint venture in Kazakhstan, resulting in legal complications and financial losses, the details of which are set out in the committee's 11th report. In light of those findings, the committee considered that ratification of the proposed agreement by Australia would demonstrate Australia's endorsement of a standard of commercial relations which the committee considered unacceptable, and therefore recommended against it. The government response to the committee's 11th report, which was tabled in 2001, reported that Telstra's difficulties had been resolved and that a new national interest analysis would be prepared. It is this new analysis, tabled in October this year, that has provided the basis of the committee's current review, the findings of which are contained in the report that I am tabling today.
In this recent review, the committee found recent trade levels with Kazakhstan to be disappointing. Nonetheless, the ongoing stability and economic growth in Kazakhstan are favourable in the re-evaluation of the proposed agreement. The committee also acknowledges the potential that Kazakhstan holds as it is rich in resources and is experiencing significant economic growth. The agreement may help position Australian traders in the future. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did acknowledge that Kazakhstan is a risky environment and that commercial enterprises enter at their own risk. Notwithstanding this, the committee accepts the department's advice that Kazakhstan has made progress towards a favourable investment climate. While business opportunities are currently limited, the committee also understands that the agreement will assist businesses seeking trade with Kazakhstan in the future.
Whilst, in its 11th report, the committee has commented extensively on flaws in the consultation process, on this occasion the committee was generally satisfied with the way in which the department had engaged in consultation. However, the committee continues to doubt the tangible effects of entering into this treaty and is not convinced that the economic and political situation in Kazakhstan can be predicted with any confidence, and therefore the benefits of the proposed agreement may be difficult to define. The committee acknowledges that the agreement is one of encouragement, and that it is not an enforceable treaty. The committee finds on balance that it is in the national interest to proceed with binding treaty action.
The International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182, which concerns the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, is designed to ensure that the ratifying ILO member states take immediate and effective measures to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency. Ratifying states also commit to rehabilitating victims and preventing other children from becoming victims. Convention No. 182 is one of the ILO's eight fundamental conventions. It has been ratified at an exceptionally rapid rate, with 144 of the 177 ILO member states having ratified the convention. 
The government has taken the unusual step of tabling the convention in parliament prior to all Australian jurisdictions having compliant legislation in place. It is hoped that the early tabling will speed up the ratification process. All state and territory governments support the convention, have provided formal agreements to ratification and have expressed their commitment to achieve compliance where appropriate. The committee was concerned that the early tabling of the convention has led to incomplete or inaccurate evidence being presented to it. In the course of preparing this report, the committee discovered that more jurisdictions than was advised at the public hearing already have compliant legislation. The committee therefore recommends that, under such circumstances, it is provided with updated evidence, as it becomes available, up until the committee's report is tabled. In conclusion, it is the view of the committee that it is in the interests of Australia for the two treaties considered in report 56 to be ratified, and the committee has made its recommendations accordingly. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The two treaties to come before the parliament today are the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on economic and commercial cooperation, which was done at Almety on 7 May 1997, and the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition of and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which was done in Geneva on 17 June 1999.
The first agreement is considered to be one of encouragement, and it is not an enforceable treaty. It was initiated at a time when it was considered to be in the national interest to raise Australia's profile in these newly emerging nations. The agreement endeavours to require the two countries to grant each other most favoured nation treatment in respect of duties, taxes or charges imposed in connection with the import or export of goods. It also helps to provide a context within which future commercial disputes can be managed.
This is the second time that the proposed treaty has come under scrutiny; the first time was in 1997, when it was decided not to ratify it, as an Australian company that was attempting to develop a joint venture there ran into huge difficulties. I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties at the time and we were concerned that there were flaws in the consultation process and that ratification should not occur until there were demonstrations by Kazakhstan of good faith in its trade and investment relations with Australia. We are only talking about a very modest trade flow, but some of the companies involved have been burnt and they were very wary of establishing trade relations at the time.
This time, the committee has considered the department of trade's view that reforms are occurring in Kazakhstan and economic growth is continuing, which means that it is becoming a more attractive country with which to trade. It is also thought that the agreement will support Australia's broader foreign policy goal of integrating this country into the world economy by strengthening the legal and commercial framework. It is, after all, an agreement of encouragement, and it is not enforceable. On balance, it would be in Australia's interests to proceed with binding treaty action. 
The second treaty in this report is to ratify International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182 on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. This convention entered into force generally on 19 November 2000 and it is the fastest ratified convention in the ILO's 82-year history. It has been ratified by 144 of the 177 ILO member states, indicating its global support.
The worst forms of child labour applying to children under 18 are described as: the use of children in all forms of slavery, or similar, including the sale and trafficking of children; the procuring or offering of children for prostitution or for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances; the procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs, as defined by the relevant international treaties; and work which is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.
It was coincidental that an article written by Ethan Kapstein entitled `The baby trade' appeared in the Australian Financial Review on Friday, 28 November 2003. Judging by the article, this ILO treaty is more than timely. It says:
Children are the most precious resource—and, like most precious resources, they are traded across borders.
This trade is not confined to developing countries; it also occurs in adoption. The article states:
Unscrupulous go-betweens buy or abduct infants from needy biological parents and sell them to eager adoptive families.
But sometimes this is not the only purpose to which these adoptions go, and this is the part of the ILO convention that is being targeted under this treaty.
I also note a copy of a letter received by the Treaties Committee from the Uniting Church of Australia. The letter points out that section 128 of the Tasmanian criminal code does not cover older children—those between 16 and 18—and that it provides for procuration but may not cover a situation where the employer has not recruited the child. It is because of these sorts of details that it is important that all states and territories review their legislation in order to comply with the ILO convention in full. 
There was quite extensive consultation by the committee and all parties were keen to ensure that this convention was implemented in the fastest possible way. It is recommended that, subject to all legislation being in place for Australia to meet the required obligations, binding treaty action be taken.

Report 56 contains the findings of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into two proposed treaty actions tabled in the parliament on 8 October 2003, relating to the matters identified in the title of the report. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The bilateral Agreement on Economic and Commercial Cooperation with Kazakhstan, once in force, will facilitate trade and economic cooperation between ourselves and Kazakhstan. The agreement prescribes that each country grant the other most favoured nation treatment with respect to duties, taxes or charges imposed in connection with the import or export of goods. It also provides a formal framework within which any future commercial dispute can be managed. The committee understands that the text of the agreement is similar to that of similar agreements between Australia and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
This is the second time that this agreement has come under the scrutiny of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It was first reviewed by the committee in 1997. During that review the committee discovered, among other things, that Telstra had experienced severe difficulties in the operation of a joint venture in Kazakhstan, resulting in legal complications and financial losses, the details of which are set out in the committee's 11th report. In light of those findings, the committee considered that ratification of the proposed agreement by Australia would demonstrate Australia's endorsement of a standard of commercial relations which the committee considered unacceptable, and therefore recommended against it. The government response to the committee's 11th report, which was tabled in 2001, reported that Telstra's difficulties had been resolved and that a new national interest analysis would be prepared. It is this new analysis, tabled in October this year, that has provided the basis of the committee's current review, the findings of which are contained in the report that I am tabling today.
In this recent review, the committee found recent trade levels with Kazakhstan to be disappointing. Nonetheless, the ongoing stability and economic growth in Kazakhstan are favourable in the re-evaluation of the proposed agreement. The committee also acknowledges the potential that Kazakhstan holds as it is rich in resources and is experiencing significant economic growth. The agreement may help position Australian traders in the future. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did acknowledge that Kazakhstan is a risky environment and that commercial enterprises enter at their own risk. Notwithstanding this, the committee accepts the department's advice that Kazakhstan has made progress towards a favourable investment climate. While business opportunities are currently limited, the committee also understands that the agreement will assist businesses seeking trade with Kazakhstan in the future.
Whilst, in its 11th report, the committee has commented extensively on flaws in the consultation process, on this occasion the committee was generally satisfied with the way in which the department had engaged in consultation. However, the committee continues to doubt the tangible effects of entering into this treaty and is not convinced that the economic and political situation in Kazakhstan can be predicted with any confidence, and therefore the benefits of the proposed agreement may be difficult to define. The committee acknowledges that the agreement is one of encouragement, and that it is not an enforceable treaty. The committee finds on balance that it is in the national interest to proceed with binding treaty action.
The International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182, which concerns the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, is designed to ensure that the ratifying ILO member states take immediate and effective measures to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency. Ratifying states also commit to rehabilitating victims and preventing other children from becoming victims. Convention No. 182 is one of the ILO's eight fundamental conventions. It has been ratified at an exceptionally rapid rate, with 144 of the 177 ILO member states having ratified the convention. 
The government has taken the unusual step of tabling the convention in parliament prior to all Australian jurisdictions having compliant legislation in place. It is hoped that the early tabling will speed up the ratification process. All state and territory governments support the convention, have provided formal agreements to ratification and have expressed their commitment to achieve compliance where appropriate. The committee was concerned that the early tabling of the convention has led to incomplete or inaccurate evidence being presented to it. In the course of preparing this report, the committee discovered that more jurisdictions than was advised at the public hearing already have compliant legislation. The committee therefore recommends that, under such circumstances, it is provided with updated evidence, as it becomes available, up until the committee's report is tabled. In conclusion, it is the view of the committee that it is in the interests of Australia for the two treaties considered in report 56 to be ratified, and the committee has made its recommendations accordingly. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The two treaties to come before the parliament today are the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on economic and commercial cooperation, which was done at Almety on 7 May 1997, and the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition of and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which was done in Geneva on 17 June 1999.
The first agreement is considered to be one of encouragement, and it is not an enforceable treaty. It was initiated at a time when it was considered to be in the national interest to raise Australia's profile in these newly emerging nations. The agreement endeavours to require the two countries to grant each other most favoured nation treatment in respect of duties, taxes or charges imposed in connection with the import or export of goods. It also helps to provide a context within which future commercial disputes can be managed.
This is the second time that the proposed treaty has come under scrutiny; the first time was in 1997, when it was decided not to ratify it, as an Australian company that was attempting to develop a joint venture there ran into huge difficulties. I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties at the time and we were concerned that there were flaws in the consultation process and that ratification should not occur until there were demonstrations by Kazakhstan of good faith in its trade and investment relations with Australia. We are only talking about a very modest trade flow, but some of the companies involved have been burnt and they were very wary of establishing trade relations at the time.
This time, the committee has considered the department of trade's view that reforms are occurring in Kazakhstan and economic growth is continuing, which means that it is becoming a more attractive country with which to trade. It is also thought that the agreement will support Australia's broader foreign policy goal of integrating this country into the world economy by strengthening the legal and commercial framework. It is, after all, an agreement of encouragement, and it is not enforceable. On balance, it would be in Australia's interests to proceed with binding treaty action. 
The second treaty in this report is to ratify International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182 on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. This convention entered into force generally on 19 November 2000 and it is the fastest ratified convention in the ILO's 82-year history. It has been ratified by 144 of the 177 ILO member states, indicating its global support.
The worst forms of child labour applying to children under 18 are described as: the use of children in all forms of slavery, or similar, including the sale and trafficking of children; the procuring or offering of children for prostitution or for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances; the procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs, as defined by the relevant international treaties; and work which is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.
It was coincidental that an article written by Ethan Kapstein entitled `The baby trade' appeared in the Australian Financial Review on Friday, 28 November 2003. Judging by the article, this ILO treaty is more than timely. It says:
Children are the most precious resource—and, like most precious resources, they are traded across borders.
This trade is not confined to developing countries; it also occurs in adoption. The article states:
Unscrupulous go-betweens buy or abduct infants from needy biological parents and sell them to eager adoptive families.
But sometimes this is not the only purpose to which these adoptions go, and this is the part of the ILO convention that is being targeted under this treaty.
I also note a copy of a letter received by the Treaties Committee from the Uniting Church of Australia. The letter points out that section 128 of the Tasmanian criminal code does not cover older children—those between 16 and 18—and that it provides for procuration but may not cover a situation where the employer has not recruited the child. It is because of these sorts of details that it is important that all states and territories review their legislation in order to comply with the ILO convention in full. 
There was quite extensive consultation by the committee and all parties were keen to ensure that this convention was implemented in the fastest possible way. It is recommended that, subject to all legislation being in place for Australia to meet the required obligations, binding treaty action be taken.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka and to the 49th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference, held in Bangladesh from 1 to 12 October 2003.
—The visit to Sri Lanka was very important and very well timed for events that followed. It has been eight years since there was an Australian parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka. Our group included senators Ray and Bishop, as well as the delegation leader, Senator Watson, me and the delegation secretary, Ms Robyn McClelland. During our visit the committee met with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wikremesinghe, from the UNF coalition. We met a range of ministers in a country that, while in population is the same size as Australia—19.7 million people—has a diverse ethnic content. Seventy-four per cent are Sinhalese, 18 per cent are Tamil and seven per cent are Muslim.
There has been a civil war since 1983. The war involves the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, led by Prabhakaran. That group now controls the eastern part of the island from Trincomalee to Batticaloa. The LTTE has engaged suicide bombers and child soldiers to undertake a range of attacks across the island of Sri Lanka, culminating in the 2001 attack on the main airport at Colombo. A cease-fire has been in place since 22 February 2002. It seemed apparent to all members of the delegation that what is important now is that there be a concerted effort to deliver to the population a peace dividend.
During our time in Sri Lanka we visited Jaffna, an area formerly very troubled and still in a lot of difficulty, with a million landmines in place. I note that the Sri Lankan army has given up its maps of landmine locations to the United Nations, but the whole country is walking on a knife edge. Subsequent events in which the President of the country, Mrs Kumaratunga, withdrew the commissions of various ministers and intervened in a fairly spectacular fashion in the activities of the government really underlined the very serious nature of things. I note that the cease-fire continues to hold. Not only is it important that the community and the government deliver that peace dividend to help drive forward the good situation there in Sri Lanka; external actions can also have an impact there. For example, the declaration of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation in the wake of September 11 has helped reduce the flow of funds to that organisation.
I now turn to our visit to Bangladesh. We were attending the 49th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference between 4 and 12 October. Amongst our numbers, Senators Ray and Watson led discussion during the various workshops. Those workshops included a consideration of antiterror legislation, a review of the Doha Round, the human rights versus cultural diversity debate, the Millennium Development Goals and where they are headed, peacekeeping mechanisms, and the idea of a stronger partnership between parliament and the executive in democratic regimes. These were all canvassed at some length. There were also three plenary sessions. We were joined in our debates by various representatives of state parliaments from across the Commonwealth of Australia. As an aside, I should point out that an incident in which various flags, including the Australian flag, were hoisted upside down was rectified by members of our delegation. It was a most informative gathering and a good outcome for all concerned. 
—Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I want to bring to the attention of the House a very important issue in my electorate; namely, the need for the construction of the Deer Park bypass. I mailed out a petition to 10,000 of the households in my electorate and I am very happy that there has been such a significant return—just under 3,000 have been returned so far and more are coming in. I would like to table these 2,811 petitions reflecting the concerns in the community about the lack of government support for the construction of the Deer Park bypass and impressing upon the government that they should do whatever they can to ensure that the Deer Park bypass is built as quickly as possible. I table the petitions.
The petition read as follows—
To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the dangerous and congested condition of the Western Highway between the suburbs of Ardeer, Deer Park, Burnside, Rockbank and Caroline Springs.
We call on the House to:
(1)	Recognise that the Western Highway is the major route for traffic between Melbourne and Adelaide, and that its full funding is the responsibility of the Howard Government;
(2)	Acknowledge that the Western Highway is in desperate need of upgrading;
(3)	Guarantee funding for the construction f the Deer Park Bypass; and
(4)	Support general improvements to the Western Highway.

"Mr HOWARD,MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The Prime Minister may proceed.
—The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about a tax deduction claimed by a heroin dealer. My recollection was correct. There has been an application for special leave filed with the High Court of Australia. We are in the hands of the court and are waiting for that to be disposed of. I have further been informed by the Treasurer that he has already indicated that, if the appeal is unsuccessful, we will take steps to amend the law.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Proceeds of Crime</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The Local Community Input into Renewable Energy Developments Bill 2003 addresses an issue which is incredibly important to the people who live in the South Gippsland district. It is something which is affecting us right now and has a great capacity to affect us fundamentally over the course of the next two years. An article that appeared in the Age on 1 September stated that the Australian Wind Energy Association indicated that:
... 62 wind turbines are dotted along the Victorian coast, but plans have been lodged for about 1,000 to be operating between 2005 and 2006.
Mr Speaker, I am sure it would not have been lost on you that 2003 is drawing very quickly to an end. This means that, over the course of 2004-05, some 900 wind turbines are likely to be constructed in Victoria—most likely along the Victorian coastline. This represents a massive rate of development and it has great potential to damage a number of important industries associated with those coastal parts of Victoria.
I want to mention one of the things which Gippsland Tourism have been promoting over the course of the past seven or eight years. They have produced a brochure—and I have a copy here—which is headed, `Gippsland Tourism: clean, green and scenic'. It states, `Gippsland is known as one of the major ecotourism destinations of Australia—unspoiled, beautiful and well serviced for the most fastidious tourist. Gippsland offers a range of key attractions which are unparalleled in Australia.' It says that our coastline is `famous for its unspoiled features.' Our coastline will not be famous for its unspoiled features if we have wind turbines dotted along the Gippsland coast. It is important that we in the Commonwealth parliament act in relation to this type of development so that we can control where it takes place. The cost of electricity produced from places like the Latrobe Valley is about $18 per megawatt hour. The cost of electricity produced from wind generation is between $60 and $90 per megawatt hour. 
The only reason that these developments are taking place right now on the south Gippsland coast is that a piece of legislation was passed by all of us in the Commonwealth parliament called the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. The way to understand this is to consider what the Commonwealth do in providing these financial incentives in the same way as we do when we consider giving grants to local communities. We have put a number of conditions on those grants. My private member's bill provides for adding a condition for wind power station developers before they are able to issue renewable energy certificates, which is how they are able to get around the massive price difference between the cost of renewable energy and the cost of other energy sources. So my private member's bill includes a simple amendment to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act which would have the effect of allowing only those wind power stations that have been approved by local councils to issue renewable energy certificates. This would, in effect, return control in relation to these developments to local communities. It is fundamental that local communities which would bear the effect of these wind power stations being erected in their district should have a say as to whether or not the Commonwealth government grant—the ability to issue the renewable energy certificates—is provided.
By supporting this bill, we recognise that some outcomes have taken place since we all passed the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, and the Commonwealth parliament should be mature enough to recognise that we now need to fix the problem and protect sensitive coastal districts like the south Gippsland coastal area. For the benefit of the House, I want to mention what some people in the electorate of McMillan have said about my private member's bill. The Mayor of South Gippsland Shire said:
Christian Zahra's bill is excellent on two points. Firstly, it takes away the subsidy unless council approves the installation, and it offers simplicity in dealing with the issue of wind farm application. Complexity and planning is the enemy of progress.
I also want to advise the House that the Baw Baw Shire Council in west Gippsland—not a coastal area but an area where some wind farms have been proposed—fully supported my bill when it considered it on 22 November. (Time expired)

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The Flags Amendment (Eureka Flag) Bill 2003 amends the Flags Act 1953 to include the Eureka flag. I want to begin by saying what this bill is not about. The bill is not about paving the way for the Eureka flag to replace our national flag. The inclusion of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags in the Flags Act did not do this; nor is it the intention of this bill to do so. This bill is also not about flying the flag from the main flagpole over Parliament House. This bill, if passed, means that the Eureka flag can be flown from an appropriate flagpole within the parliamentary precinct on the commemoration of the Eureka rebellion and at other times deemed appropriate by the Presiding Officers. 
This bill has come about because, on the 148th anniversary of the battle of the Eureka Stockade, I wrote to the Presiding Officers requesting that the flag be flown from a suitable flagpole within the parliamentary precinct. I thought it would be a simple request. I was advised that, as the Eureka flag was not proclaimed under the Flags Act, it could not be flown. I have since been advised by a past member of this House that it was actually flown in the 1970s at Old Parliament House. I subsequently wrote to the Prime Minster, asking that he write to the Governor-General requesting that the Eureka flag be proclaimed under the Flags Act 1953. The response, whilst understanding the importance of the flag, unfortunately did not agree to have the flag recognised.
There is a lot of misconception and hysteria about the Eureka flag—much of it, I have to say, coming from people who have not studied or read much about the history of Eureka. I strongly recommend that people interested in this debate read Professor John Molony's book Eureka. The flag has a unique and important place in our history and should be recognised as such. Much of the hysteria and fear about the flag comes from a perception that it has been appropriated by the trade union movement. It is true that some unions use the flag to symbolise the labour movement's struggle for better working conditions, but it is also true that many other groups across the political spectrum utilise the flag. Many of my South Australian colleagues see the flag not as representing trade unions but as representing National Action, a right-wing anti-immigration organisation. The private sector have utilised the flag as well to promote their business. Currently we have Grocon building the Eureka Tower in Melbourne, and Ballarat itself has a proud array of businesses with Eureka and the flag in their title.
We live in a democracy, and an organisation's or individual's use of the Eurkea flag is not for me or anyone of us to dictate. However, to have the Eureka flag recognised in its correct historical context, it is important for the parliament to recognise it. It is a bipartisan issue, and I want to remind members on the other side of this House that even Menzies himself said that Eureka was an earnest attempt at democratic government.
I want to put into Hansard a little of the history of Eureka. In 1854, anyone wishing to mine on the goldfields in Victoria was required to pay a licence fee of 2 every three months. Many miners queued up in the early days to pay the fee, expecting improvements to roads and health and education facilities. These improvements were not forthcoming. The licence fee was considered by many as unfair as it fell upon everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. The issue of taxation without the basic democratic right of representation led to a number of meetings of miners, where concerns were expressed about licence fees and the policing of the licence fees. The most significant of these meetings was the meeting of the Ballarat Reform League on 11 November and the `monster meeting' at Bakery Hill on 29 November 1854, when 10,000 people gathered—about one-third of the then Ballarat population. The diggers then marched from Bakery Hill to the area chosen to establish the Eureka stockade. Tensions came to a head in a pre-dawn raid on 3 December 1854, with police and soldiers joining forces. At least 16 nations were represented at Eureka, with 28 people dying and a number more being unaccounted for.
A century ago, Mark Twain visited Australia and said of Eureka: 
It was a revolution—small in size, but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. It was the Barons and John, over again; it was Hampden and Ship-Money; it was Concord and Lexington; small beginnings, all of them, but all of them great in political results, all of them epoch-making. It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle. 
With the 150th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion next year, I want people to look at the Eureka flag and think about our history, about our democracy and the fragile nature of it. I want them to look at the flag with pride about our achievements and recognition that in 2004 we have come a long way from the struggles on the goldfields in 1854, that our history is something to be proud of and that our Eureka flag is something to be proud of. I commend the bill to the House.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The Racial and Religious Hatred Bill 2003 addresses an issue which has no place in Australian society. The deliberate incitement of racial and religious hatred is a clear threat to Australia's social stability. Such threats force many of our fellow Australians to live in fear and insecurity and are often the precursors to racial or religious violence. All Australians have seen this vividly in the terrorist attacks sponsored by al-Qaeda and associated groups before and since September 2001, which had their origins in a fanatical religious hatred. Those attacks and the reactions they have provoked among some citizens and communities in Western nations have highlighted that no group is immune from the consequences of racial or religious incitement. It has long been the conviction of the Australian Labor Party that incitement or threats based on racial or religious hatred should incur the strongest possible legal sanction. While our federal and state criminal laws address acts of violence, including terrorism, a gap remains under federal law when it comes to behaviour that is often a precursor to violence, including terrorist activity that is motivated by racial or religious hatred.
The bill I present today seeks to close that gap. The bill would create three new offences under the Commonwealth Crimes Act: firstly, threatening to cause physical harm to another person or group because of their race, colour, religion or national or ethnic origin; secondly, threatening to destroy or damage property of a person or group because of their race, colour, religion or national or ethnic origin; and, thirdly, engaging in public acts that have the intention or likely effect of inciting racial or religious hatred against a person or group of persons. Each of these offences would carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment as a potential deterrent. The bill makes clear that it is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any state or territory law. 
Substantially the same offences were proposed as part of the Racial Hatred Act of 1995 but were opposed by the Greens and the opposition in the Senate. Comparable offences were also proposed as part of the original Racial Discrimination Act 1975 but were blocked by the opposition in the Senate on that occasion as well. Equivalent offences exist in almost every state and territory, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and a number of states in the United States of America, yet, almost 30 years after the Racial Discrimination Act was passed, they are still absent from federal law in Australia. The bill would implement one of Australia's obligations under article 4(a) of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which says that states parties: 
Shall declare an offence punishable by law ... all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin ... 
It is always important to consider the effect of legislation of this kind on Australians' freedom of political communication, which is implied in our Constitution. We are confident that this legislation is constitutional. The High Court has held that a law cannot restrict freedom of political communication unless it is enacted to fulfil a legitimate purpose of Australia's constitutional system and the restriction is appropriate and adapted to the fulfilment of that purpose. In most cases the type of conduct targeted by this bill will be devoid of political content and will not constitute political communication for the purposes of the Constitution. Even if the incitement is combined with criticism of government or other comment on political matters so as to amount to political communication, I believe these offences are appropriate and are adapted to protect Australians from violence and other serious harm flowing from incitement and threats based on racial or religious hatred. 
By way of comparison, equivalent offences in the Criminal Code of Canada were upheld by the Supreme Court of that country in 1990 in the case of R. against Keegstra, on the basis that, while they infringe the right of freedom of expression in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, they were `demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society'. Similarly, this bill is an appropriate and balanced response to an identified gap in legal protection of all Australians from threats based on racial or religious hatred. It targets threats which are a precursor to violence and sends a clear warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance that all Australians cherish. I commend the bill to the House.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-12-01,"—My Royal Commission (House of Representatives Elections) Bill 2003 provides for the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry to determine an appropriate model and method of implementation of a system of proportional representation in elections for the House of Representatives, pursuant to section 29 of the Constitution. Besides being a clear application of Australian Greens policy, this bill is timely because it responds in part to the government's latest attempts at weakening the power of the Senate and diminishing the truly representative nature of our liberal democracy. 
The Prime Minister's recent paper Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution proposes that the Senate be stripped of its power to review government legislation—legislation that, in the term of this government, is more often than not regressive. I remind the House that the Senate's powers are applied on behalf of the entire Australian community, because the election of senators is conducted using a system of proportional representation—a system which is fairer than the preferential voting system employed for the House of Representatives. This is a point often forgotten. One of those with short-term memory loss in this regard is our own current Prime Minister, who, on 8 October 1987, referred to the Australian Senate as: 
... one of the most democratically elected chambers in the world—a body which at present more faithfully represents the popular will of the total Australian people at the last election than does the House of Representatives; that is a fact in terms of the proportional representation system ...
My, how things have changed, and how the member for Bennelong has changed from being a defender of proportional representation and the Senate to now seeking the latter's disempowerment. The idea behind this bill is to clean up the voting system applied to the House of Representatives. Instead of going through a process of removing powers from the Senate, we should be looking at making this House more truly represent the will of the people as expressed at the ballot boxes on election day.
This bill is necessary for a number of critical reasons. First and foremost, the current electoral system in Australia is skewed so that the will of the majority of electors does not always equate to the party which assumes government. In fact, we have a voting system where, more often than not, the party holding government does not hold an electoral majority or, worse still, the party gaining an electoral majority—that is, the party with more than 50 per cent of the votes of the Australian people—does not win government.
This state of affairs is not an occasional blip in the statistical line. It has been happening for decades now. For instance, back in 1954 the ALP won 50.4 per cent of the first preference votes, yet it held only 57 of the 121 seats in the House and so remained in opposition. Consider the last five elections and compare the government's primary vote. In 1990, the ALP won 39.4 per cent and held government. In 1993, the ALP won 44.9 per cent. In 1996, the coalition obtained 47.3 per cent and won government. In 1998, the coalition won 39.2 per cent of the vote. In 2001, the coalition won 42.7 per cent.
That state of affairs clearly perverts our democracy. Going on recent trends, it is likely that the government of the day will not be supported by the majority of the Australian population, yet prime ministers are happy to claim a so-called mandate to do all manner of things on behalf of the Australian people, including invade other countries, destroy Medicare and privatise education et cetera. The claim of a mandate is not based upon the clear expression of the will of the majority of the electorate. This proposed royal commission into proportional representation is needed to give the people of Australia a truly representative voice in this parliament.
Secondly, the winner-takes-all system which the major parties have enjoyed to date is outmoded, redundant and, in fact, disappearing as voters turn to minor parties and independents. It is also undemocratic. For a party or group of parties to win 42.7 per cent of the vote and hold 52 per cent of the seats in this House is undemocratic. For parties such as the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation to poll from five to eight per cent of the vote nationwide and not win a single seat in this House is undemocratic. The absurdity of the situation was best put by the member for Calare in his most recent tome, The Andren Report—An Independent Way in Australian Politics. I would like to quickly quote from that work. He says:
There is a democratic deficit in our voting system that I believe only proportional representation can redress.
Across the nation in the 1998 election the National Party received 5.6 per cent of the vote in the House of Representatives and finished up with 16 seats and six ministers.
The Democrats received 5.3 per cent of primary vote and won no seats, whilst One Nation received 8.4 per cent and also had no-one elected.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Children and Families) Bill 2003 seeks to get kids out of detention before Christmas 2003. The Labor Party are determined to take all steps necessary to persuade this government that it is not appropriate for nearly 200 children to spend this Christmas in detention centres. Labor have been calling on the government to get children and their families out of detention urgently for nearly two years now. This bill is a further attempt of ours to force the government and this parliament to take this issue seriously.
When I was first appointed as Labor's immigration spokesperson, I said that getting kids out of detention was going to be one of my first priorities. Unfortunately, we still have nearly 200 children who are likely to spend this Christmas behind barbed wire, courtesy of the Howard government's immigration policy. Some of these children are held in detention centres in Australia and some of them are in Nauru. Most of them have been in detention for more than two years.
This campaign of ours, which calls on the government to get kids out of detention by Christmas, is not just a matter of the bill that I am introducing into parliament today. It is also harnessing a lot of community anger about the way children are being treated by this government. It is Labor's hope that this will engage politicians on both sides of the parliament, because we are aware that there are people in the government who are unhappy about the current circumstances of keeping children in detention. We hope that it will engage churches, schools and others in the community who have been advocating strongly for the government to do something about this. We believe that, since there has been a new minister appointed to the immigration portfolio, this is a chance for the government to reassess what it is doing and change its course of action.
Labor's bill to get kids out of detention by Christmas would compel the government to release all children from high-security detention in the following way: where children are unaccompanied, they should be placed immediately with foster families in the community; where children are accompanied by their parents, the children and their families should be placed in appropriate housing—and the bill sets out three options—in the community, in hostel accommodation or in alternate accommodation which has the security and amenity standards of the Port Augusta housing project. We specifically make clear in the bill that parents who pose any security or health risk should not be released, but we believe the government needs to show that parents would be such a risk. The current system makes an assumption that people are a risk, even though there is no evidence.
One specific issue which I know people will raise is the situation of the nearly 100 children that are held in Nauru. Clearly we in this parliament do not have sovereignty over the laws of Nauru. We cannot seek in any way through a parliamentary process to impose our wishes on Nauru, but it is Labor's intention that all children should be out of detention and, as many in this House would know, to end the Pacific solution, and therefore people would not be held in Nauru in any case. But we do note that the government rather than the parliament have the power to negotiate terms of agreement with Nauru; in fact, they did this very hastily when they asked Nauru to agree to detain people and to process their claims offshore. We urge the government to consider, in line with the proposal in this bill, amending the terms of their agreement with Nauru to ensure that children and their families in Nauru are treated appropriately. 
Labor is very concerned at the growing evidence of the harm that is being caused to children who are being held in detention. This is ongoing harm which may damage their lives forever in the future. Whether or not their claims are successful, Australia should not be contributing to the damage that could be caused to these children. Labor has previously tried in parliament to amend the migration legislation to release children. I am ashamed to say that every government member, including the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, voted against it. Labor hopes that this time around some government members will put pressure on their own government to take account of the suggestions in this bill. Parents around the country want to be able to sit at the dinner table at Christmas and tell their own children that this is a lucky country to live in. The government needs to take the opportunity to act and to help get other children out of detention before Christmas. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—I move:
That this House calls on the Government to fund a national study to determine the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the Australia community and that:
(1)	the study determine the number of suffers, the range of symptoms experienced by suffers, the length of time taken to reach diagnoses of sufferers, the extent of the load on carers, and quantify the real cost of Parkinson's Disease in Australia;
(2)	on presentation of the study to the Parl-iament, sufficient resources be applied to improve the diagnoses, treatment and quality of life for sufferers and their carers, in both the short and long-term; and
(3)	included in any action subsequent to the presentation of the results of the study, further resources be made available to better educate current and future doctors, nurses and paramedics in the range of symptoms identified as pertaining to Parkinson's Disease, how to diagnose the disease and how to advise the sufferers and carers involved.
Today I have before the House a motion calling for a national study to determine the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in Australia. Faced with the reality of the significance of Parkinson's disease that a population study is likely to demonstrate, the government will need to act to redress the current inequities experienced by Parkinson's sufferers. In terms of the process of diagnosis, treatment and quality of life, Parkinson's falls behind when compared with the available resources for other better-known conditions. Unlike MS and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's is a sadly neglected disease with no specific programs of assistance, even though it is second only in prevalence to Alzheimer's in neurological disorders. 
My first encounter with Parkinson's was at a luncheon where the caterers were a group of people with the disease. I felt very awkward being served by people who were shaking. My natural reaction was to say, `Here, let me help.' The situation was confronting, and it challenged me to address my own inhibitions. For a moment, I want you to imagine you are in this situation: you are aged between 25 and 45; you have had worrying symptoms for the last eight to 10 years; you have been back to your own doctor on a number of occasions; eventually you make the decision to get a second opinion, then a third, then another; and so it goes on. One doctor tells you, `Don't be silly. It's just menopausal,' while another says, `Women don't get it.'
After 13 years of sitting in doctors' surgeries and being called everything from a hypochondriac to a drunk, Pat Barkley's diagnosis eventually found her. For years the 60-year-old Parkinson's sufferer from Sussex Inlet in my electorate of Gilmore had noticed unusual symptoms including a heavy arm and shaking legs, but numerous visits to GPs and neurologists proved fruitless. One neurologist even said to Mrs Barkley, `There's always the grog.' Mrs Barkley was in shock—he had already asked if she drank, and she did not. Pat Barkley thought she was going mad.
For a man, the doctor might describe your symptoms as simply a frozen shoulder. For those that live in rural or regional Australia, the likelihood of being diagnosed at all narrows considerably. You have increasing difficulty getting out of a chair, your writing gets smaller, your voice gets softer, your feet appear to freeze solid to the floor and will not obey your instructions to walk, the small tremor in your right thumb or some other limb increases, and so it goes on. You eventually find after all these years a doctor who has a vague recollection of a single hour of education in their medical studies that was devoted to Parkinson's. This doctor sends you to a neurologist who finally confirms the diagnosis.
Like most Parkinson's sufferers, Mrs Barkley is now heavily reliant on medication to lead a functional life. Just as important is the other medicine: a healthy dose of laughter combined with the love and support of friends and family. There is no blood test for Parkinson's disease and no other simple diagnostic test. Sufferers are not included in any government survey, because they do not fall within the geriatric age group. They are not included in the burden of disease study, because they are not dead or in a hospital or nursing home. They are not classified in a particular group with special needs and are invisible to health authorities and government, resulting in a lack of access to services.
Parkinson's sufferers must have the right to be counted so that they will eventually receive the right assistance that will ease the burden on government, the health system, carers and families, allowing them to stay at home for longer—the place many want to be. This scenario is not uncommon for undiagnosed Parkinson's sufferers in Australia. Misdiagnosis of the disease is also quite common. This motion not only seeks to redress the systemic inequity of Parkinson's sufferers; it also sets a direction for improving their quality of life. It is a sad indictment of our society that there is a tendency for people with Parkinson's to withdraw from public view.
Each of us needs to consider how a person copes with the effects of a debilitating condition. We need to be seeing less of what is and imagining more of what could be—not just giving people hope, but invigorating them with a vision for a better world. I call on my colleagues from all sides of politics to join the parliamentary friends of Parkinson's so that we have a united force. Today is our opportunity to support this motion, thereby giving our support to many thousands of Australians, diagnosed or otherwise, dealing with the effects of this cruel disease. Finally, I recognise the work presently being done by the friends of Parkinson's in Nowra and the southern highlands, and thank them for keeping me informed of their ongoing battle to have their group recognised and for the friendships that they have shown me. It has certainly made me realise that there but for the grace of God go I.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I support this motion and the efforts by parliamentary friends in the fight against Parkinson's, a disease which afflicts too many Australians. It afflicts too many people in my home state of Queensland and it afflicts my own mum.
Many of our engagements in the debate about the health system in this country and the diseases which our health system is required to confront are shaped deeply by our own families' experiences of them, whether it is cancer, dementia—as has been discussed today in the context of well-known Australians—or Parkinson's and other diseases.
My own mum was a very good and active septuagenarian. She had been very active on the hospital auxiliary at the Nambour public hospital for some 20 years as a hospital worker on a purely charitable basis. It was only when she was in her mid-70s that she became aware she had Parkinson's. It is always more difficult for those who are trained in the medical profession—as is my mother, who was trained as a nurse—when they begin to experience the symptoms which they know clinically point to that particular disease.
That was six or seven years ago. My mum, together with the 11,000 other Parkinsonians in Queensland, continues to fight the good fight, as do the many tens of thousands of Parkinsonians across Australia and the families that support them. It is not an easy road but were it not for the assistance of organisations such as Parkinson's Queensland it would be a much harder road. Parkinson's Queensland employs two full-time staff: one in administration and one in the area of education. This is supposed to cover the whole state of Queensland.
When we look at the resources of peak bodies like that we as a community and a country need to reappraise our priorities because, if these peak bodies which provide valuable information to Parkinson's sufferers across the state and their parallel bodies across the country—my colleague from Nowra just referred to her local body in that part of Australia—were not there performing their current function, it would make life even harder for the families of Parkinson's sufferers. The provision of new information on medical treatments, how best to access the newest and best drugs on the market, and the risks associated with them is very important for families to make informed decisions.
Support from organisations like Parkinson's Queensland is one thing, and I commend them formally in this parliament for the work that they do. But, beyond that, there is the work done at the hard edge of the scientific coalface—that is, the research which is being done not only worldwide but also here in Australia in the whole field of neurological diseases. In Queensland we are blessed with the likes of Dr Peter Silburn, who practises at Wickham Terrace in Brisbane. He is one of the world's leading analysts in this area and has pioneered new treatments for people who suffer from this and related neurological diseases. 
It is important for the parliament to recognise not just the contribution of such individuals but the basic need for more research dollars. Parkinsonians feel as if they are often the poor cousins when it comes to the delivery of the research dollars to this particular medical ailment. I think they are right. Cancer sufferers legitimately command a large proportion of the medical research budget, and we all have direct experience through our families and friends of the ravages of that disease. One does not faintly suggest any diminution of effort.
We argue for an increase in our collective national research effort so that people like Peter Silburn, who are pioneers in the field of new surgical interventions and in the application of new drugs and therapies, can be given the resources with which to work. I commend this motion to the parliament and the member for Gilmore for having moved it. We are all moved by a spirit of common humanity and personal and family experience in wanting to see more done for the tens of thousands of Parkinson's sufferers across Australia today.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Health: Parkinson's Disease</title>,Private Members' Business,14,1
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—I also wish to support previous speakers in the debate on Parkinson's disease and the fine contribution made by the member for Griffith. I, too, am in a family situation where I am acutely aware of the effects of Parkinson's. The member for Griffith spoke about his mother, which is not a very easy thing to do in this place. Sometimes it hits very close to the core. We come in here and speak about other people's problems but it is difficult when we have to get up and speak about our own families.
One could say that it is a bit self-serving but these things happen for a reason. They happen because we as legislators are in a position to do something about the many hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from Parkinson's. This is a terrible disease which affects many in their own homes. I place on record that my dad was also a successful business person with a brilliant mind and loads of energy. A couple of years ago he was struck down by this terrible disease. The effect that it has on families and on carers is paramount. It is a disease that no-one has a great deal of understanding about.
I also want to place on record my deep respect for Dr Peter Silburn and the wonderful work that is being done in Queensland, particularly on adult stem cells. We really need to get behind this wonderful work. There is also groundbreaking work being done in a number of states. The most important thing is the work that Parkinson's Queensland do with very few staff, which the member for Griffith spoke about earlier. They are to be commended, as should Judy Rawlins for her own personal courage in getting the message out and for giving out much of her time voluntarily.
One of the shameful things about Parkinson's is that we are not making the advances in this country that are being made for sufferers in other countries, such as in Spain and the Netherlands, and we really do need to find out more about it. Only last week in the House, I spoke about the pioneering role that Australia played in the mass immunisation of its population against tetanus, particularly maternal tetanus. Only belatedly have we begun to recognise this disease as Australia's silent epidemic. The Medical Journal of Australia has estimated that the incidence of Parkinson's disease in this country has risen by 100 per cent since the year 2000, and it now stands at almost 80,000 people. Parkinson's sufferers themselves have, in the absence of a national prevalence study, built up their own highly efficient monitoring network, which puts the rate much higher. When you look at the work that researchers are doing, the figure may actually be double the AMA figure of 80,000. 
One of the things that is very clear is the lack of training among Australian doctors, which makes it very difficult to recognise Parkinson's. The member for Gilmore mentioned the difficulty of diagnosing Parkinson's. If doctors cannot diagnose this illness, how can members of the general public? Parkinson's sufferers often face the terrible humiliation of being mistaken for drunks because of their shuffling, stumbling gait, shaking hands and slurring speech. I do agree with the member for Gilmore that it is a terrible social disease: because of those symptoms, many of the sufferers do not want to go out in public any more, and it takes a terrible toll on their families and also on their friends and those carers who are there to look after them.
One of the people I have had contact with said to me that it was very difficult for her and it was taking her so long to do simple things. She said, `I've had to make a point of explaining why my hands are shaking. I'm not an alcoholic and I'm not hung over; it's Parkinson's.' Probably the worst thing that has happened in this woman's experience with the disease has been the advice given by her own doctor not to join a Parkinson's support group. He said to her that if she went to a Parkinson's support group and met people further advanced than her she would be more depressed than ever about what lay ahead for her.
That advice—stick your head in the sand and try not to think about it—might seem very strange, but what are we doing at a clinical and social level as a country? We need to devote money to a prevalence study. I have been asking for this for more than a year, and I think that this is the way to go. Similar studies have been done in the United States and Spain. A national prevalence study is vital if we are to know the real extent of Parkinson's and allocate funds and resources to combat it. With a national prevalence study we would be able to determine the impact of Parkinson's on the health and aged care budgets, given its impact on people aged 65 years and over. We really need to commit more integrated funding to Parkinson's, and we have to ensure that we understand a lot more about the disease. I want to commend the great work being done in Queensland, particularly by Dr Silburn at the Queensland University of Technology. Many people are involved in this fight, and I believe that we really need to continue the fight to ensure that Parkinson's gets the support it needs.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I am pleased to speak in support of the member for Gilmore's private member's motion on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the Australian community. Parkinson's disease is unlike some other ailments in that it is difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms are not uniform and will vary from patient to patient. The disease usually affects people over the age of 40, but the symptoms are more obvious with people aged over 60. In my family's case, the change in body movements and other symptoms were firstly attributed to arthritis and advancing years. It is possible that even the family doctor, because he only sees the patient in his surgery, may take some time—even a year—to discover and diagnose the disease. It is therefore more likely that a neighbour or a non-regular acquaintance, such as a churchgoer, may be the first to suspect that a major medical condition is involved. Even a local dentist's comments that his patient had difficulty getting out of the dentist's chair could be the first sign of Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, the point contained in (1) in the private member's motion in relation to the length of time taken to reach a diagnosis is most important, as Parkinson's disease is not a life-threatening disease and early diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment can lead to a significant improvement in the quality of life. There are now many Parkinson's disease support groups, and information is available on the Internet to reassure patients and their families. One publication that would be of use to Parkinson's disease sufferers and their families has been written by Dr Roger C. Duvoisin MD and published by Raven Press.
The cause of Parkinson's disease is not known, although the disease was first reported as far back as 1817 by James Parkinson in his essay on shaking palsy. The medical advice is that the most important element in making a medical diagnosis is the patient's own account or an account from the patient's partner, which may reveal a significant event or incident that was out of character with the person's previous behaviour. While the complaint is more common in older people, it is not uncommon for people in their 40s to be affected, so early diagnosis, appropriate treatment and a better community understanding of the complaint is important, to allow younger Parkinson's disease sufferers to continue in normal employment.
The disease presents itself in much the same way in young people as among people in the older age group. People with what is called younger onset Parkinson's disease will have special concerns, because they will be dealing with the disease at a younger age and for a longer period. These concerns may involve making career adjustments and family arrangements. Some sufferers may be reluctant to tell their employer or work colleagues of their condition, in the fear that it might affect their career opportunities. Dr Duvoisin wrote in his book that some professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, who are Parkinson's disease sufferers, are aware that their patients or clients seem to lose confidence in them after noticing the tremor. On the other hand, many patients who work in their own businesses or retail shops have continued to work successfully through to retirement age. For example, Janet Reno, the former Attorney-General of the United States was a Parkinson's sufferer and continued quite competently in her position. 
However, there is good news for people with young-onset Parkinson's disease, because this disease in younger people progresses a lot more slowly and associated problems, such as memory loss, confusion and balance difficulties, are also less frequent in younger people with the disease. Therefore, there is a need to better educate the general public regarding Parkinson's disease. Dr Duvoisin is reasonably confident about the long-term outcome for Parkinson's disease sufferers, and that is why the points in this motion are so important. While there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, it can be effectively treated. He claims that, as the complaint progresses slowly, successful treatment can control the symptoms for many years and allow the patient to lead an active and independent life. With research, as suggested in this motion, there will be discoveries that improve means of treatment, which hopefully will make it possible to keep the symptoms reasonably under control for the remainder of a patient's life. For these reasons, I commend the motion to the House.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I thank government members for coming into the chamber to make up the quorum. It is the only thing they have done to assist the Vietnamese community in Australia with regard to SBS Television broadcasting VTV4's propagandistic news into the home of every Vietnamese family in Australia utilising SBS.
There are people in my electorate who have family who were tortured or died in Vietnam or who were themselves imprisoned by the communists in Vietnam. These people escaped by boat and became the first significant group of refugees in Australia. Given the fact that the Fraser government allowed in these people in very large numbers, if you were to take an ideological or propagandist approach to this, you would expect them to think that a Liberal or coalition government—what they would think of as a conservative government—would take direct action against any government entity that they hold sway over (and against SBS Television as such an entity) when that organisation decided to introduce a Vietnamese language news program into the homes of every member of the Vietnamese community in Australia—all 200,000 of them. Although this crowd on the other side of the chamber accepted the head of the communist government of the People's Republic of China into this chamber, after all their decades of anticommunist rhetoric you could have expected them to have acted to stop this broadcast, but they have not done that. That is entirely reprehensible.
The people who put their lives at risk during the Vietnam War to fight for the south, the people who were imprisoned or suffered damage during that war, who escaped or whose families escaped to places like Malaysia and who then came to Australia—the people who survived—could have expected a modicum of intelligence in the government's approach and that of its entities, such as the broadcasting entities, and a modicum of respect for the experiences of those people. They could have expected a modicum of respect for the drama, torture and rending apart of their lives and those of their families.
Instead of that, what did they get? I spoke to a person from Cabramatta who attended the last rally, where 4,000 or more people stood outside the SBS Television headquarters for more than three hours. I was the only federal politician to address that rally. That guy from Cabramatta told me why he was there. He said he owned a restaurant in Cabramatta. He said: `I want to explain to you the fundamental reason why I am here. I drop my children off at school in the morning and then I go to work to run my restaurant. I don't see them until the next morning. My children can read and understand both languages. When my children come home from school and watch a Vietnamese language program produced by the government of Vietnam and deliberately structured to be a propaganda arm of Vietnam, poison is poured into the ears and eyes of my children. I can do virtually nothing about it. They haven't had my experience in Vietnam or that of my relatives. They haven't been directly tortured or imprisoned. They haven't put their lives at risk. But all of us who had that experience in Vietnam and who fled a communist controlled government that occupied the country in 1975 want our children to live in a free and democratic land. That is what we are working for. This coalition government, this Howard government, the government that professes to be anticommunist, is allowing SBS TV to let the Vietnamese propaganda go straight into our lounge rooms, and I can't do anything to protect my children from it.' He is worried that some of the children might be naive in terms of the insidious nature of that propaganda. 
There is no more grievous issue for the Vietnamese community in Australia than this. It is paralleled only by the situation in 1993, which I remember well, when Do Muoi came to Australia and was accepted by the Australian government. It burned very deeply. It burns deeply for every one of my constituents in the electorate of Blaxland. I am happy to be their voice inside and outside this parliament and to join with them in saying, `Da dao Vietcong News.' They chanted that three times and more during the day. They want an end to this propaganda which has been put upon them by this government because it will not take action against SBS and will not absolutely demand an end to this corruption of the values of the Vietnamese communities and families in Australia.
On behalf of the ALP and as the member for Blaxland, I pledge my continuing efforts to get rid of this pernicious program which is doing so much to damage those people, and I will support them here and elsewhere. I cannot be at the rally tomorrow, because of the leadership ballot here, but my support is pledged here to work now and into the future to stop that insidious poison being poured directly into them against the wishes of 200,000 Australian Vietnamese.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Communications: Special Broadcasting Service</title>,Grievance Debate,15,1
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—I move:
That the amendment be agreed to.
The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. The measures in this bill will strengthen Australia's arrangements for the protection of nuclear facilities and material and related information. The bill will enable Australia to bring into force legislation banning nuclear weapon tests ahead of entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The bill implements changes to the machinery of government which will improve the effectiveness of each of the acts affected.
The government is pleased the Senate has passed the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. The government supported the amendment proposed by the opposition and welcomes its constructive engagement in the bill. This bill implements a range of Australian policies and treaty commitments which promote effectively the non-proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons. It ensures that we meet international obligations and expectations to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, whether by rogue states or by terrorists. This bill does so without impinging on the reasonable rights of all Australians to freedom of expression and legal protest. The bill is entirely consistent with the government's stance of taking strong but reasonable measures to protect the interests and wellbeing of Australian citizens. I commend the bill to the House.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—It is my pleasure this evening to indicate to the House Labor's support for these amendments to the Maritime Transport Security Bill 2003. These amendments follow extensive negotiations with the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the maritime unions. Perhaps this evening's debate is a lesson to the media. All too often a lot of work is done in this House which is not properly reported in the media. We only ever get reports about divisions in the House. The truth is that, with respect to many bills, there is a desire by both sides of the House to reach some accommodation in the nation's best interests. This bill, going to maritime transport and security and the threat of terrorism, is a prime example of our success as a parliament on that front.
We all know that there has been widespread concern that the government had not adopted the spirit and word of the ISPS Code with respect to labour rights. It was very clear in the new international security treaty, to which Australia is correctly a party, that the labour and welfare rights of seafarers were not to be affected by the new code—and rightly so. The opposition and the maritime workers and their representatives were therefore concerned that the bill did not clearly reflect the intent of the ISPS Code with respect to labour rights. To the credit of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, we were able, after discussion, to reach agreement to amend the bill to make it absolutely clear that the industrial and welfare rights of seafarers and other maritime workers would not be affected by this bill. These amendments make it clear in two places—in both the purpose of the act and the definition of `unlawful interference with maritime transport'—that that is to be the case. The opposition, following consultation with the maritime unions and their members, agreed to the format in terms of the government's draft amendments. Those amendments have been agreed to in the Senate and are supported by the opposition today. 
Having dealt with those important amendments, I wish to raise a few other issues with respect to the nature of this bill. During the course of the negotiations on the definition of `unlawful interference', the opposition was also—I am delighted to report—able to resolve other matters of concern to industry. I seek leave of the House to table a letter from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, dated 27 November, going to these matters.  
Leave granted.
—That letter covers two significant issues: recognition of the unions' role in maritime security, and the register of training and qualifications for maritime workers. I will firstly go to the role of workers' representatives—the role of the unions. The issue regarding the unions' role stemmed from initial concerns that the unions were not adequately consulted on the development of the bill. Perhaps there is a lesson for all of us with respect to this issue. In developing sensible legislation which is of major concern to the nation's best interests we should go out of our way to consult not only the workers but also their representatives, in this case the unions, to ensure that we lock in absolute support—in this case, for issues going to security with respect to the maritime industry in Australia.
As we all appreciate, the maritime unions represent workers who are on the front line in terms of defending the maritime industry against the threat of terrorism and difficulties with security. In the unfortunate event that Australia is subjected to a terrorist attack using the maritime industry, it is highly likely that the dead or injured will be MUA or AIMPE members. The opposition therefore accepts that the unions have an important role—which, I am pleased to report, is now acknowledged by the government—to play in the development and implementation of the maritime security regime. (Extension of time granted)
The unions were eager to be formally defined as a maritime industry participant. The minister was of the view that this was not appropriate, as the unions were not being regulated as such. Therefore, there was a requirement to find another way around the problem to achieve a solution. The compromise arrived at—as reported this evening—addresses the fundamental concern that unions have previously been excluded from consultation processes. At the local level, the minister confirmed the union's role as employee representatives during the security planning and implementation processes. This has now been, appropriately, codified in the regulations.
Maritime industry participants, such as ship operators, port owners and stevedoring companies, are required to demonstrate in their plans a mechanism for ongoing consultation with workers. I personally believe that not only is that important in terms of maritime security but also, as part and parcel of any workplace in a civilised world, there should be a proper process of consultation, understanding and acceptance of one's responsibility with a view to making businesses not only secure but also able to achieve the best possible outcomes with regard to their method of operation. In turn, as a result of that compromise, the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services will consider the adequacy of the consultation in the plan's going through the approval process. At the national level, the minister has confirmed that unions are a key stakeholder in the ongoing implementation of the maritime security framework—and I thank the minister for that recognition. The minister also confirmed in the letter I tabled this evening that there will be an ongoing industry consultative committee which will involve unions.
I now move to the register of maritime workers. Again, this was a maritime unions initiative to improve security on our docks and onboard ships in Australian waters. Put simply, the unions requested the government to closely regulate the security training of everyone in the industry by maintaining and monitoring a formal register. The government did not agree to this positive proposal, but again a compromise has been reached that not only satisfies the government but, importantly, also satisfies the opposition and maritime unions. 
Under the compromise, the regulations will require that the security plan detail the training and knowledge required by staff with security responsibilities. Maritime industry participants will also be required to demonstrate how they will ensure adequate training for all their employees, whether they are casual or permanent. All aspects of the maritime security plan will be subject to audit by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Interestingly, the industry participants will also be required to keep records of the training provided. These records must appropriately be made available for audit by the department—and, hopefully, on a regular basis. The department will encourage the industry to ensure that provision is made for the portability of this training to other industry employers.
The government believes this is an adequate response to the call for a national register that will deliver the same outcomes and be cheaper for government. The opposition still submits its very firm belief that a national register would be a more effective way of delivering those outcomes, but, in the spirit of the commitment we gave to the government to ensure that this bill is passed prior to Christmas because of requirements to have it operative from 1 July next year, we have appropriately agreed to the compromise.
I note that the letter of 29 November that I tabled this evening reflects the outcome of extensive negotiations on this bill. I would like to personally thank the minister and his staff—and department officials in particular—who have patiently worked hard over an extended period to get this bill to this point. I also note that the security regulation framework of the maritime industry is coming from a base that is much lower than that of the aviation industry. (Extension of time granted) The industry has had the additional hurdles of multiple jurisdictions, and I commend the eight state and territory governments for their decision to work in the nation's best interest in a cooperative way with the Commonwealth government to support a national regulatory framework. The security of ports and many vessels operating in Australian waters has historically been a state responsibility. I am delighted that my state and territory colleagues appreciated that this issue is too important to permit an inconsistent approach across Australia. They are to be commended for this decision and for their ongoing support of the federal government's coordination of the bill's development.
However, I must also indicate that, unfortunately, not everyone is happy with this bill. Obviously, this is a highly competitive industry. The opposition retain significant concerns that the Howard government has walked away from any fiscal responsibility for the additional infrastructure and cost of security required at ports. As I clearly stated in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill in this House, I contend that this puts Australian operators at yet another competitive disadvantage. Our major trading partners, as we all appreciate, are pouring billions of dollars into port infrastructure, but the Howard government will shift the cost to operators and, in turn, to exporters. In the first year for ports this will amount to about $300 million, and the ongoing annual cost is suggested to be $90 million. For Australian regulated ships the cost in the first year is estimated to be $13 million, with annual ongoing additional costs of $6 million. I consider this to be a very big slug. Alternatively, and also unfortunately, our competitors are being helped with this by their nation states—but our operators are not being helped by our own Australian government. 
I also report to the House that port owners have serious reservations about many parts of this bill and the regulations. They are not fully appreciated or understood by industry. Timing, as I have indicated, was agreed and critically accepted by all. It is now the responsibility of all to work in a cooperative way to overcome those concerns at a port level and to make sure that the full intent and operation of the bill and the regulations are understood. We appreciate that there was pressure on all to make sure that the bill went through prior to Christmas. If those security plans are not agreed to by 1 July 2004, then Australian trade is placed at a disadvantage. Therefore, we clearly support the bill. We also call on the government to agree to conduct a post-implementation review of this bill 12 months after it commences. That will ensure that any difficulties can be ironed out and that industry will be guaranteed an opportunity to have its views heard by the parliament.
In conclusion, I simply reaffirm my appreciation of all those in industry at state and territory level, representatives of the maritime industry unions and employers and, appropriately, the department and the minister and his staff, who worked in association with my transport adviser, Denise Spinks. Thank you all for your assistance in coming down this difficult trail to finish this hard job before Christmas. I consider that it is a job well done by all involved.",REPS,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NATS,2003-12-01,"—I would like to thank the opposition, and particularly the shadow minister, for their valuable contribution to the development of the Maritime Transport Security Bill 2003 and the facilitation of the swift passage of this bill through parliament before Christmas. Three of the government amendments presented today represent the outcome of negotiations with the opposition and the government on issues relating to the welfare of seafarers and the rights of employees.
Similar issues were also highlighted in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's report on the provisions of the Maritime Transport Security Bill, which was tabled on 27 November 2003. In particular, in paragraph 1.25 the Senate committee comments that employee representatives should be involved in discussions on security matters. The regulations will prescribe that maritime industry participants are required to demonstrate in their maritime security plans that they have an ongoing mechanism for consultation with their employees and that employee representatives be involved in security planning and the implementation process.
The government amendment to the definition of `unlawful interference with maritime transport' clarifies that industrial action is exempt from this term which resolves the Senate committee's concern in paragraph 1.39. Similarly, the government amendment to the purpose of the bill clarifies that the bill is not intended to impact on the rights, freedoms and welfare of seafarers as referred to in the International Maritime Organisation's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Once again, I thank all for their involvement in the process of developing the bill and ensuring its prompt passage through parliament.
Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-12-01,"—When I commented on this legislation late last week, I drew the attention of the House to the proposed merger of the news service and some other services of 2UE and 2GB and the way it breaks at least the spirit of existing legislation, let alone the cross-media ownership dilution that we are talking about in this Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. So if this legislation is to be consistent in promoting diversity, an amendment is required to insist that all licensees in any given licensed area should be required to maintain editorial separation. Therefore I give notice of intent to move two amendments in the detailed stages of consideration of this bill that would require all commercial radio and television broadcasting licensees to deliver that editorial separation. I must say for the benefit of the member for Hinkler, who is in the House, that Bundaberg is one of 18 radio markets of two commercial licences where the 2UE/2GB exercise could be repeated if not blocked by my amendments. I would urge him and all other members, particularly the minister, to consider them.
I will not again cover the concerns on the impact of this legislation in regional markets that I outlined in my speech to the earlier legislation, for those comments are already on the record and still apply. I notice the member for Lowe has also reiterated my personal experiences, which are also on the Hansard record over several years, of the direct interference of city media operators in news programming that I was involved in. However, I repeat that from personal experience also over two decades in regional radio and television, it is a nonsense to suggest that owners of say, print and television or print and radio in a regional market would not use that editorial and commercial advantage to merge their resources and content.
Organisational charts, separate editorial policies and independent news management are a figment of the imagination of the government. It just will not happen. As we see with the 2UE/2GB proposal, the existing laws are not tough enough to prevent two major media organisations making a mockery of the very provisions the government plans to put in place with these mandatory tests. To make matters worse, according to the current issues document prepared by Dr Kim Jackson of the Parliamentary Library, the impact of these relaxed cross-media rules will reduce from five to three the minimum possible media owners in places like Bathurst, Orange and Tamworth and major regional centres, which is a 40 per cent reduction in minimum possible ownership, diversity of control and possible opinion further exacerbated by the likely converging of editorial management and content under such reduced ownership.
We have already seen, I know the member for Hinkler has, the impact of the hubbing and spoking—or the hubbing, I am confusing it with the transport aviation report—of services by regional radio operators, some of whom are not only controlled from outside the area that they have the licences for but also are foreign controlled with absolutely no commitment to the market beyond the force of pressure that has brought about some minor changes. If they had their way there would be no commitment to localism, unless it is forced upon them. I hear the free marketeers saying, `A new operator could start up or new media could provide alternative voices.' The fact is the laws do not allow it at the moment, at least in free-to-air media. There is little chance of independent newspapers breaking the stranglehold, say, that the rural press group has on the country market, and new media is years away from making a significant impact. 
The minister argues in his second reading speech that reform of the cross-media rules will clear the way for renewed market interest in Australian media assets. The minister says this will allow media companies to take greater advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. This is all very well for the media company shareholders and owners, but I remind the House of the words of the then Postmaster-General, Mr Davidson, in 1956 when he said:
Television stations are in a position to exercise a constant and cumulative effect on public taste and standards of conduct, and, because of the influence they can bring to bear on the community, the business interests of licensees must at all times be subordinated to the overriding principle that the possession of a licence is a ... public trust for the benefit of all members of our society.
Those words should be as applicable today as they were then, almost half a century ago. A broadcast licence is a privilege and not a commercial right, but this bill comes down on the side of commercial right as opposed to public good. Indeed, the Productivity Commissioner is on the record in more recent times as saying that diversity of opinion and information is more likely to be encouraged by greater rather than less diversity in the ownership and control of the main media—and I would include the major regional operators in the definition of `main media'.
While the government has picked up on some of the important amendments recommended by the Senate for the first bill, which was laid aside, the crucial Packer-Murdoch amendment of Senator Harradine is absent, no doubt to be reinserted—I would hope—by the good senator when this bill is read in the other chamber, because it certainly will not be inserted or passed here. This is the amendment from hell for this government. This is the amendment that flushed out the true intent of this legislation—to smooth the way for an even greater control of our media by two large players, cheered on by the Fairfax group.
The Harradine amendment prevents a media owner from owning a television station and newspaper in the same mainland capital city. If that were passed, the government would have failed to deliver the cross-media laws demanded by the government's media masters. The only way this legislation would be passed is at a joint sitting of parliament, no doubt with the full sale of Telstra bill included. If that turned out to be the case, it would represent one of the greatest ever betrayals of ordinary Australians by a government intent on delivering power, influence and assets to big business, particularly in the politically crucial and public opinion swaying mass media.
I have drafted a press release regarding my proposed amendments to block the 2UE/2GB news merger, part of which I want to record in Hansard. It goes something along the lines of:
This attempt by two major competing Sydney radio licensees not only circumvents the spirit of broadcasting laws, but highlights the dangers of the relaxed cross-media ownership regime the government is promoting.
The 2UE/2GB news merger makes a mockery of the so-called mandatory tests the government is planning to impose on media operators to separate editorial controls when a newspaper, television or radio operator buys other media in the same town.
The Macquarie and Southern Cross organisations, who operate 2GB/2CH and 2UE, are planning a joint venture company to provide news and other services to the competing stations.
To argue that this will ensure independent news analysis and comment is a nonsense.
My amendments require each commercial radio and television licence holder to have separate editorial news management, separate news compilation processes, and separate news gathering and interpretation capabilities. 
While the share market and shareholders might get excited about the cost-cutting potential of the 2UE/2GB move, such an arrangement would enable any media organisation such as a major newspaper group to manufacture a common news supply to any radio or television station.
If the 2UE/2GB proposal gets the nod then regional licensees could also form a joint service supply company for news and sales, thus reducing not only news variety but competitive local advertising rates.
I hope I do not get to use the last two paragraphs that I drafted. I hope that the government will at least accept the need for these amendments to the existing broadcasting laws because, if they do not, they are exposing the sort of nonsense that will be the case if these cross-media rules are relaxed, because it will be delivering editorial control, comment and news diversity to fewer and fewer people. If the government does not see the sense of inserting into the existing legislation the amendments needed to block this circumvention of the broadcasting act, then I believe its hypocrisy will be exposed, and I will certainly seek to have the amendments introduced by independent senators elsewhere.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2003-12-01,"—When I previously spoke to the Broadcast Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 I made it clear that, although I had some reservation about aspects of the bill, I believed on balance that it should be supported. I might say by way of preamble that I have some sympathy with the views, or at least the spirit of the views, of the member for Calare—that the recent proposed merger in Sydney would really, if applied universally across Australia, test this particular bill. It is a matter that weighs heavily on my mind and one which I will pursue within the normal processes of being a government member.
At the last federal election, in the interests of allowing our media sector to prosper in a global environment, the government committed to the reform of the cross-media ownership and foreign ownership restrictions. With this legislation we are fulfilling that commitment. We are giving our media organisations the tools to expand in the face of foreign competition. However, we are keeping a tight hold on the reins when it comes to the concentration of ownership and control over the number of media outlets within the market and over the diversity of editorial content. We are shepherding through these changes to the media ownership rules, but we are doing it responsibly.
The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] has run the gamut of the legislative process. It has been debated, referred to a committee, reported on and amended. We finally see it back as a bill in this House, and I am confident that the amended bill is a workable and effective piece of legislation. The bill is the same as that passed by the House last year, but it incorporates some Senate amendments which, on the whole, bolster my argument about preserving the diversity of opinion and information in the interests of the Australian market. The bill removes the regulatory barriers to foreign investment in the Australian media sector which are contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Those responsibilities will now be covered by the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 along the same lines as the foreign ownership of commercial radio and newspapers. Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 remains applicable to the proposed mergers and acquisition of media outlets, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will still be responsible for scrutinising existing and future arrangements which may impact on competition. 
A number of other amendments passed by the Senate are included in the bill, and their inclusion points to the government's willingness to work with the Senate to provide the best possible media environment for both consumers and media organisations. Those amendments include the stipulation that commercial and television broadcasters must supply mainland state capitals with a set minimum amount of material of local significance. We have also seen the inclusion of a sensible `minimum commercial media groups' test. This guarantees, after a merger, a minimum of five separate commercial media groups in major metropolitan markets and four in regional markets. The bill retains the `two out of three' rule, which stops some local demagogue controlling all three traditional forms of media—newspaper, radio and television stations—in the one market. The government has also incorporated a `one newspaper per market' limit for holders of a cross-media exemption certificate, which does not apply to operators who do not hold such a certificate.
When I spoke to this bill previously, I told the House of my reluctance to meddle with the principle of freedom of the press. My ideas on cross-media ownership are on the record for all to see, but I believe strongly in the fundamental principle of freedom and diversity of media, which perhaps is best summed up by Thomas Jefferson's famous words to John Jay in 1786:
... our liberty, which cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it.
In guaranteeing the freedom of the press, it is also our duty to guard against interference in editorial freedom, and we must ensure that the audience—the general public—has access to different news sources. At present there are three major commercial television networks, three pay television providers, half a dozen major commercial radio network owners and five major newspaper proprietors operating in Australia. There are many smaller scale, independently owned media players in the Australian market, but all the main outlets have a presence in our major population centres as well as our regional, rural and remote Australian areas.
The end goal of our media policies should be the fostering of our own domestic operators while ensuring that every Australian, whether they live in Double Bay or Dajarra, has access to a varied media content. In the interests of news diversity, the reflection of our own culture and the provision of a lively, fresh news service for residents of a particular region, none of our media outlets should come under the influence of a single media operator. The relevance of this statement comes to light when we look at the key characteristics of the Australian population spread and the demographic changes that are taking place in this country.
The majority of Australia's population is concentrated in the capital cities—at June 2002, 64 per cent—and this is expected to increase to 67 per cent by 2051. The vast majority of our remaining population lives in satellite suburbs and major regional centres along the coastline or in country and remote areas. So, if we want our nation to have access to a variety of media and opinion, we must ensure separate media outlets have editorial independence from one another, particularly if they are members of the same media stable. Without a vigorous licensing regime, it would be all too easy for our major media players to consolidate their news and program operations in the interests of cost saving and conceivably provide a generic news service of little value—and that was my concern when I agreed in principle with some of the comments of the member for Calare. 
Some provincial media operators advised the previous communications minister of their interest in hubbing and networking and that they could potentially consider some form of merger between their news services. I am not in agreement with this. I find this idea, on face value, wholly unacceptable without appropriate safeguards being put in place to ensure that editorial independence exists between various news services. I am one of the strongest advocates of editorial independence. I believe that a key feature of Australian news services must be the independent sourcing, compilation and presentation of news reports.
When previously speaking on the bill, I mentioned my concern about the tendency towards a Sydney-centric influence, particularly in the electronic media sector. In radio, taking the ABC as an example, current affairs programs like AM, PM and The World At Noon come from Sydney. The commercial stations, with their four leading shock jocks, come from Sydney and Melbourne; and hub news services come from Sydney or the hubs of the major networks. In provincial TV, such as in my electorate of Hinkler, any news service outside the prime time bracket—that includes bulletins generated locally and at the state capitals; in other words, those outside of the 6.00 to 7.30 p.m. time slot—generally comes from Sydney. The only exceptions that I am aware of are short news breaks, the ABC's Stateline on Fridays and WIN's late regional news. I am in no way criticising the individual programs or their presenters; rather I use these facts as an illustration of how easily opinion can be concentrated, which is a phenomenon we should all guard against.
An extreme example of the concentration of opinion within the media was presented to me by a delegation of Vietnamese-born Australians which I met in my office last week. This meeting was spontaneous and not contrived. These gentlemen raised their concern that a particular Australian network is broadcasting—in an unedited and unbalanced way—material produced by the current Vietnamese government, and that its presence on our domestic television services was unsettling to them in the extreme. Whilst this may be a case of balance rather than media ownership, I believe it serves to illustrate a point: if you take a program direct from a foreign news service unedited and unbalanced, you get media being dominated simply by one opinion—and that is what these people rail against. 
I feel a tremendous sympathy for members of Australia's Vietnamese community who came to Australia in order to avoid such overt media content only to find it on their television screens and in their homes. Like all Australians, they want to see a balanced view of news from their homeland. Although this is an extreme illustration and something of a rarity in our nation, I go so far as to say it is proof that we cannot and should not allow opinion to become one-dimensional. By making editorial separation a condition of being granted an exemption certificate for cross-media ownership—that is, insisting upon separate and distinct editorial policies, organisational charts, editorial management, news compilation processes, news gathering and capabilities to interpret that news—we are safeguarding the diversity of our news services.
To back up the relevance of this policy, in its April 2000 report into broadcasting the Productivity Commission found there was no vital connection between diversity of media ownership and diversity of views. The report said:
Diversity of sources of information and opinion is a keystone in a democratic society ... the Commission accepts that diversity of information and opinion may not be inconsistent with a concentrated media sector ...  
I can accept that, but I can only accept it if the safeguards are in place to ensure general editorial diversity and independence. I think we must also be cognisant of the fact that media technology and presentation formats are changing rapidly. Once upon a time it was possible to strictly define news as daily bulletins or the content of a newspaper, but information now flows freely in all manner of programming formats—everything from light entertainment shows to documentaries, from television hosts and shock jocks on radio to journalists who compile news stories. All of those factors come into play when we interact with the media to glean information, and it is vital that a multi-dimensional media sector is maintained, particularly with new and emerging technologies.
More and more Australians are accessing new mediums for entertainment and information. An ACNielsen survey indicated that, as at July 2001, 20.7 per cent of homes, or 1.4 million households, had pay TV subscriptions. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by September 2001 there were 3.7 million household Internet subscribers. We need to be careful that, as notional diversity increases, the services available and the presentation of information reflect that diversity and do not become a downstream take of another news source; that is, we must guard against exactly the same information being presented in another guise. That is not to say that a television or radio station may not have an Internet service that reflects its day-to-day broadcasting—nor is it to say that it should not expand its information on the Internet or run a chat room discussion following a major interview or program—but it is important that the Internet become multi-dimensional, with various players espousing their views through their own formats and not just using other peoples' formats.
More importantly, I believe that every encouragement should be given to independent regional Internet services. In many regional areas today, country newspapers are producing major stories of only seven or eight paragraphs. That gives the reader no opportunity to understand the background, the details or the nuances that may colour a particular story. The episode of the sheep on the Cormo Express is a typical case in point. The simplistic grabs of the shock jocks on metropolitan radio and the abridged stories carried in provincial newspapers did not go any way towards outlining the complexity of the situation or doing justice to the facts. When I give constituents, or groups of constituents, the full facts of this case from start to finish they are invariably stunned by the complexity of the options that Australia was faced with, and they invariably give the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, resounding accolades—something that did not come from the shock jocks or provincial media. We must guarantee that there is always a place for such information within our media sector, whether it be in print, electronic or online format. The spirit of this legislation—especially as it applies to electronic media—is to ensure that independent newsrooms are flourishing in regional television and radio stations. This should be even further enhanced by independent Internet services.
I am a great lover of Australian radio. I think that, to a large extent, the ownership of Australian radio has become too concentrated. We have one network with over 90 stations and another with over 30. What has been happening in many parts of Australia is that these networks have come to a town and bought, say, the third licence in that town. At a later date, they buy the AM licence and the section 39 station associated with that AM station—generally a rock-and-roll station—which is normally an FM station. They do that to get around the `two radio stations in a market' rule. They do that under what is called the section 67 exemption—which, quite frankly, I would like to see amended in the Broadcasting Services Act; there are some three pages in the act which tell people how to get around the act. 
Quite apart from that, what then happens is that the network flogs off the AM station—possibly to a TAB service or to some non-competitive entity—and the community is forced to listen to one of two FM stations. There is nothing wrong with FM stations as such, but in that exercise we have lost diversity, we have lost competition and we have lost localism—and that must not be allowed to happen. There is a section in the bill that addresses that matter. Ultimately, it gives the minister the authority to grant another licence in that area where he thinks diversity and competition have been removed. That is something that I very strongly support. In fact, I would even like to see it written into the legislation. I think it is terribly important.
In speaking to this bill, I have made it clear that my main area of interest is the requirement that we preserve diversity of opinion and information relevant to the Australian public. I am also adamant that media outlets should declare their interests and broadcast material related to any other interests that they might hold. Under the bill, this will be achieved by making it a condition of licensing that television and radio operators who are holders of cross-media ownership exemption certificates must declare their interests when they broadcast or publish a particular story that has a relationship to one or other of their interests. The condition also extends to the print media, even though they are not subject to the licensing conditions under the Broadcasting Services Act. Instead, their responsibility will be to disclose their link to another interest—and that will be enforced by way of legislation that carries with it a criminal offence.
Previous speakers from the opposition have aired their views on this bill. If it is passed, they say it will be the beginning of the end of the Australian media sector, if not of Australian democracy. I would like to remind them that perhaps the most eloquent comment ever made in Australian politics on this matter was that made by John Button. During an angry cabinet meeting he said to Bob Hawke, `Bob, why don't you tell us which of your media mates you want to help so that we can end the meeting?' We must make sure that this never happens under this government. So let us get this issue onto a mature and balanced plane. We must allow our media sector to grow in the global economy but balance this against diversity of opinion, and we must ensure that the diversity of ownership does not allow one dominant player in the market.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I rise to speak against the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I was pleased to hear the member for Hinkler's contribution to this debate. I think it was a very genuine one. But I want to say to the member for Hinkler that the issue of editorial separation is very much a myth: no matter how many safeguards you have in place, it is just not going to happen. If you look at the changes that we have had across the course of the last decade, the reality is that most Australians are still getting their news content from a small number of sources—through the news media and our newspapers.
Today really does feel a bit like Groundhog Day. Here we are in this chamber, yet again, debating the Howard government's attempt to repeal Australia's cross-media ownership laws. Here I am, again, following a contribution by the member for Calare, who has a great deal of experience in these matters, trying to defend this country's media ownership laws. Yet again, we are debating the Howard government's determination to undermine media diversity in this country. 
The previous bill travelled the full length of the parliamentary corridors, and we now find this new version in the House, after the government could not support amendments to the previous bill passed in the other place. The initial purpose of this bill was to water down the cross-media ownership rules. It was aimed at providing the two big media players in Australia with an opportunity to tighten their stranglehold on Australia's media outlets—a stranglehold that continues to use its influence in making and shaping opinion in the way that we as a community view aspects of local, national and world events.
The re-introduction of this legislation is not about reflecting the changing patterns of media broadcasting in Australia, as the government would have us believe. It is not about stronger local news content in rural areas, and nor is it about creating greater diversity in news and content in Australia's already tightly controlled media. It is about stifling views and opinions and it is about the government, in my view, giving a Christmas present to the major media owners on the cusp of a federal election campaign. If this government were committed to local media content it would look to protect current media diversity, not water it down.
There are currently five media outlets in my electorate that provide a daily broadcast of local content news and current affairs: the Ballarat Courier,owned and operated by Rural Press; 3BA and Power FM, owned by Grant Broadcasters—an independent broadcaster; WIN TV; and ABC radio. All five media provide different opinions and reflections on our local community and what is occurring in our area. All five have different editorial comment and content and provide a range of opinion about local, state, national and international affairs.
My concern is the potential impact that this bill will have on the diversity of views in electorates such as mine, through the repealing of existing cross-media ownership rules. The diversity of media ownership in my community means that people in my electorate have access to a wide range of news, information and opinion—and not just about local issues. Local media ensures that state, national and international events are reported with a local element.
The submission by Grant Broadcasters to the Senate inquiry on the first bill clearly spelt out their fears in regional Australia, and I again want to highlight their concerns. They stated:
We are vehemently opposed to the Bill for the following reasons:—
There is no demonstrated public benefit in the amendments.
There will be a decrease in competition for advertising.
There are unlikely to be any independent broadcasters left as they will be at a competitive disadvantage.
The long-term effect is that Australian media is likely to be owned and controlled by foreign companies.
There is currently insufficient diversity in ownership in Australia.
Local news and service to the community in regional Australia will decrease further and there could be a general lessening in the provision of all services.
It is doubtful the Australian Broadcasting Authority will be able to effectively police the amendments.
Grant Broadcasters specifically cited their experience in Wollongong, where grandfathering of the current cross-media ownership laws sees the WAVE FM station, owned by Grant Broadcasters, up against the jointly owned WIN TV and i98. With the TV and radio stations commonly owned—exactly the circumstances the government is proposing in this legislation—Grant Broadcasters state that competing in this environment for limited advertising revenue is extremely difficult. Grant Broadcasters are concerned that the media concentration allowed by this bill will lead to larger media companies having more control over advertising rates and placement, leading to decreased competition and the loss of smaller, local independent operators such as themselves. The government's new bill does not address this issue.  
The media outlets in regional areas are major generators of jobs. With daily news services from all three major types of media in the Ballarat city area, we have in effect become a training ground for some of the major metropolitan media outlets. Local regional media contributes significantly to community events through sponsorship, community service announcements, promotions, fundraising and participation in local community organisations. It is not just about ensuring that major metropolitan broadcasters have local content in what they broadcast into country areas; it is also about ensuring that we have broadcasters in country areas and that we have media that are owned in country areas. Concentration of local media ownership could see a constriction in the employment offered through local media jobs and a reduction in the spread of community support activity undertaken. Regional media companies and small independent broadcasters, such as Grant Broadcasters, will be the first to disappear should this bill be passed.
The cross-media ownership rules were introduced in 1987 and 1988 to ensure that media owners could not have any more than one television station, newspaper or radio station at the same time in the same area. This bill is trying to remove these provisions. In the original bill the government wanted to completely remove all cross-media ownership provisions. It tried to claim that, by including a provision for so-called `editorial separation', there was no need to continue with cross-media ownership rules. We have heard in submission after submission and from the member for Calare's own experience just what nonsense the notion of editorial separation is. The editorial separation provisions still exist in this bill. They totally ignore the fact that media owners do determine and have determined the content of the media that they own—and despite all the will in the world it is impossible to guarantee that this will not continue to be the case.
In the last bill we saw the government acknowledge that the editorial separation provisions were nothing but a fig leaf when they agreed to amend their legislation to retain a version of cross-media ownership in regional areas. If they were so confident that editorial separation would work, why amend the legislation to protect the diversity of regional media? The reality is that they know that editorial separation will not work, and their own amendments to the previous bill were a tacit agreement that cross-media ownership rules are important in ensuring media diversity. Retaining a version of the cross-media ownership laws exposed the hypocrisy of the government's argument that they are not important for ensuring media diversity. Cross-media ownership laws do matter if you want to retain media diversity in this country.
The bill, as the government now wants it, will allow the joint ownership of newspapers and television in our major cities. The Senate attempted to prohibit this in the previous bill but the government was never going to agree because this is the very thing that the big media proprietors want and what the government is oh so willing to provide. The bill, as it now stands, would allow the two largest media owners to become even more influential and would stifle the diversity of news and opinion in this country. Time and time again we have seen this government attempt to stifle diversity of views, whether it be through attacks on the ABC, attempts to interfere in the management of our universities, attacks on the judiciary or the watering down of democratic institutions. This is just one more attempt by the government to cosy up to its mates at the big end of town. We do not want media dominated by a handful of large media owners. We want and need a diversity of media owners in this country, as that is the only way you can ensure that there is a diversity of views and a healthy democracy. I again oppose this bill.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I was not going to speak on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] but the dramatic political events of the last few days have caused me to decide that I ought to speak up and tell a few home truths to that small, hardy political band out there who listen to the broadcasts of parliament. Generally, most of us remain silent about the issue of media concentration in this country. I think those of us in politics do so sometimes out of fear or out of the hope of political advancement but, from my point of view, it is time that I stated some of the things that I have learnt in my 15 years in state and federal parliaments about this issue of media ownership and concentration.
Australia has a very healthy democracy. We have one of the best functioning democracies, if not the best functioning democracy, in the world. The biggest blot on that democracy is the state of our media concentration: the fact that we have only a handful of news outlets who present news to us ordinary Australians from which we can get our understanding of news and current affairs and make our political assessments. This is very unhealthy, and the way in which it operates for our democracy is not healthy.
I can remember back in the eighties the electoral success of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. It has been the case over the years that the commercial media have tended to be anti Labor and have played a major role in securing the defeat of the Labor Party at elections. There is no doubt in my mind that the Hawke and Keating governments were very effective Labor governments. Bob Hawke was a terrific and inspiring political leader. Indeed, I have had occasion to hear him in the last couple of years speaking on issues of public policy and it seems to me that perhaps we in the Labor Party—and in the broader Australian community—are a bit ageist because, if we are talking about leaders, Bob Hawke is someone who continues to display a great grasp of what is going on in the country and an ability to communicate that vision. There is no doubt that during the eighties his government received some political comfort from the large media proprietors, which was unusual for the Labor Party, and that came at a time when they delivered commercial advantages to those large media proprietors in the shape of reducing restrictions on media ownership, particularly as they applied to owning and operating more than one newspaper across a range of cities. During that period the Labor Party enjoyed a good, and even sometimes a cosy, relationship with some of those media proprietors, but those people ultimately were not satisfied with those media ownership changes. Indeed, they are never going to be satisfied: it is always in the nature of commercial organisations that they want new decisions made which will enhance their opportunities to build profit.
In around 1995 there was a well-known falling-out between then Prime Minister Paul Keating and the Packer group over the question of what amounted to offering a regional monopoly for Optus. The message from the Packer camp to Paul Keating was: if you do not do as we suggest, we will get you. Some would think that they did, because a very strong campaign came from that commercial media network against Paul Keating and in favour of John Howard, who was indeed successful in the 1996 federal election. 
The significance of that to this debate is that the commercial media in this country have it in for federal Labor because we will not support the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. We will not support it, because it reduces the cross-media ownership rules and it allows large media organisations—such as the Murdoch organisation, the Packer organisation and the Fairfax organisation—to grow in size and to expand both their political power and their commercial power to make money from that change. We do not think that this is in Australia's public interest, and we oppose it. As a result, those major commercial media enterprises have it in for us.
That is what this bill is all about. It is the backdrop to federal political discourse in this country. This bill is about Prime Minister Howard and the Howard government delivering to the Packer organisation, the Murdoch organisation and the Fairfax organisation what they want by way of commercial objective. As a result of our opposition to that, media throughout the past few years have been relentlessly anti federal Labor. They are frequently—almost always—anti Labor, but they now have a specific grievance: our failure to support this bill. That is why this bill underpins all current federal political discourse. This is not usually made plain, but let me quote what Mr Bruce Wolpe of Fairfax indicated to the journalist in relation to this bill when he was interviewed on The World Today on Thursday 6 November, less than a month ago. Mr Wolpe said:
You also discuss the consequences of people not coming to the table, engaging with the Government and those of us who support the bill on the legislation, because there are consequences that flow from rejection.
The questions, of course, are: who might those people be and who might these consequences be for? Later on in the interview, Mr Wolpe gave a clear answer to those questions when he said:
We keep talking to everyone who has not taken themselves off the table in this debate. Labor has taken themselves off the table in this debate, it's not interested in a serious debate on this.
The Fairfax lobbyist made plain in that interview that Fairfax are dissatisfied with Labor's position on this bill and that there are consequences which flow from that. So the message from those large commercial media chains—Packer, Murdoch and Fairfax—to us is: `We will hammer you. We will hammer the Labor Party until you pass this bill.'
When it comes to how this is worked out in practice, you need only look at the recent events in relation to Simon Crean's leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. There have been incessant editorials and commentaries in those papers saying that we must change our leader. But will they support us afterwards? No. Indeed, there is a reasonable prospect that they will complain that the Labor Party got rid of Simon Crean and talk about what a decent leader he was. I do not want to suggest that there were not some people who were engaging in undermining him, but there is no question that the media organisations picked this up with relish and enthusiasm. My personal experience, having put out what must amount to hundreds of press releases during the past couple of years in my environment portfolio, has been that the commercial media take no interest in these press releases at all, yet I field any number of calls and requests for interview on the question of leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. The media has used that question as a means of undermining and attacking the federal Labor Party. 
We have taken a position of principle on this bill. Occasionally people say that the Labor Party fail to take positions of principle. That is not correct; we have taken a position of principle on this bill—and, indeed, we are paying a price for it. I will talk a little further about the sort of price you pay in these circumstances. In my own portfolio area, we release policies but none of the commercial media take the slightest interest in them. Given that polling frequently shows that the environment rates in third place in issues of public concern behind only health and education—that is, it is the third-largest issue of public concern—you would think that perhaps the views of the federal parliamentary Labor Party were worth mentioning. We have been putting those views forward. Whether it is on land clearing, climate change, water for the Murray River or protecting the Great Barrier Reef, we have been putting policies forward. But the commercial TV stations and newspapers never touch federal Labor's positions.
We have an environment reporter for the Australian, Amanda Hodge, who would sooner die than publish anything concerning federal Labor's position on these issues. The Age is about the same: Point Nepean is an issue that the Age has pursued with some vigour but there was not a word about things like the visit by Simon Crean to Point Nepean and his declaration that federal Labor would hand over that land to Victoria to be incorporated in the national park. There was not a word about the private member's bill which I introduced into the House to transfer Point Nepean to the Victorian government to be used as a national park.
Even worse than failing to mention our position, there have been fluff pieces by Susan Brown in the Australian and Louise Dodson in the Age pretending that this government has a good record on the environment. This is laughable for anyone who has seriously followed the debate about land clearing or about climate change and this government's failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol, for anyone who seriously followed the debate about the health of the Murray-Darling and the need to restore environmental flows to that river system, or for anyone who has seriously followed the debate about the Great Barrier Reef. There was no coverage of the opposition's response or position in those articles, which places me in the situation of putting out numerous press releases on these issues, unsullied by any commercial reporting of them, the issues they raise or what they say about Labor policy. We have a commercial media whose intention is to keep marginalising Labor until we capitulate on this bill. They want this bill through because it means more power to them and more money in the bank.
I do not know how to solve the problem of the way the commercial media uses its political power to seek commercial objectives but I do know that we cannot capitulate. We cannot support this bill. It would be a betrayal of political principle for political expediency, and we cannot expect our supporters to support us on that basis. Furthermore, if we say yes now, the media barons will just get even more powerful and it will become even harder to say no to them the next time around. I just hope that maybe there are a few ordinary Australians out there who are interested in and thinking about this issue and who will demand that the Howard government withdraws this bill and backs off—some people out there who will demand that we keep some media concentration laws in place and that we make an effort to protect media diversity. Ultimately the health of our democracy depends on it. 
Before I conclude, I would like to briefly refer to some of the debate conducted in the Senate when this bill was first introduced, which makes clear precisely what the bill is all about. When this bill entered the Senate, Senator Harradine moved an amendment which stipulated that operators were not allowed to own both a newspaper and a TV station. The opposition supported that amendment and it was carried. The net effect of the bill that passed the Senate was to take radio out of cross-media ownership altogether so that anybody could own a radio station. It also eliminated the restrictions on foreign ownership of Australian media.
The bulk of the government's original package—what it describes as `a reform package'—was accepted by the Senate, but one crucial point was not: the capacity of a media proprietor to own both a newspaper and a television station in a metropolitan market. What happened then? The government chose not to proceed with the bill even though it had got through three-quarters of its agenda. Why did the government decide that the bill was no longer of any value? The answer was simple: the key media proprietors—in particular PBL and News Ltd—did not support a bill like that. As the bill was amended in a form that precluded News Ltd from buying a TV network and PBL from buying a newspaper, particularly Fairfax, it is no longer of any interest to them.
We have a situation where the government abandoned in the Senate the opportunity to get three-quarters of its agenda through—to get substantial deregulation and liberalisation of our media ownership rules through—and they abandoned that. Therefore their real agenda and their real reasons for putting this legislation to the parliament in the first place were completely exposed. The Prime Minister stands exposed on this matter. He is simply seeking to deliver to Packer, to PBL, to Murdoch via News Ltd and to Fairfax something they regard as in their commercial interests; not something which is in the public interests of ordinary Australians. I hope that enough ordinary Australians become concerned enough about what this issue says for the health of our democracy and the need we have for media diversity that they will demand the Howard government abandons this legislation and supports cross-media ownership rules which encourage diversity of opinion and a range of places from which we can draw our political and current affairs news.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-12-01,"—I will speak reasonably briefly to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] as there has been discussion on it before in the House and quite possibly will be again. I would like to publicly state that I will be opposing this legislation and supporting the amendments that will be proposed in the House by the member for Calare. Hopefully they will be successful in this chamber but, if not, I believe they will be moved in the Senate and hopefully they will be successful there. My opposition to this legislation is essentially that I believe we need as much diversity of expression within Australia as possible.
We seem, over the last decade or so, to have been preoccupied with the concentration of power—the concentration of control—at a whole range of levels, and we are using commercial imperatives to attempt to drive those sorts of movements. Whether it be Coles and Woolworths in the shopping centres and the control that they have over the produce that they sell and the implications that that has on the farming community within Australia, or whether it be the major players in the media across Australia, there is a propensity to suggest that it is only the big that will survive and they will be able to deliver a far better service. 
The very existence of ABC radio and television is obviously an argument against that sort of rationale, particularly in regional areas—and I compliment the ABC on the work it does in regional Australia, and also the government for the additional staff for and recognition of the ABC, especially regional ABC, that took place last year. I understand that it has financial problems from time to time, but regional ABC is a very important voice for many people in country Australia, as are commercial radio stations. Any threat to the diversity of those voices, any diminution of those voices' ability to make different statements about a certain issue, is something that I believe we should oppose. For those reasons and others, I will be opposing this piece of legislation.
I heard the member for Hinkler say earlier that one of the reasons he is supportive of this legislation—now; he obviously was not back in 1995, when he was in opposition—is that we must allow the media within Australia to grow in the global community. That sort of line has been run out quite a lot by people of different political persuasions for some years now, and it almost seems to be a pitch to people who really do not understand what is happening within our own boundaries so that they think it is okay: `It's all global stuff; it'll be something that we should participate in.' We heard similar views on the full privatisation of Telstra. When we look at Telstra's global participation, we find that it was not necessarily a good thing for the Australian community; in fact, there was over $1 billion lost in one of Telstra's attempts to become a global player.
I think we are seeing a similar thing with media diversity. We are developing what I have referred to a couple of times in this parliament as a feedlot mentality—the best way of delivering the highest number of services to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible cost is to put them in a feedlot. One of the reasons I am interested in the federal arena is that it frightens me, in a nation of this size, that we could even start thinking along those lines, because if you think that a feedlot is the best way to run Australia you are marginalising those who live in the smaller and remote areas and the medium sized communities of Australia.
If we allow the diversity of media expression to be given into the control of a few voices, obviously, as with Telstra, the smaller players will not be as economically productive in their balance sheets, and—although I am not saying they will all disappear—they are less likely to be supported in terms of having their own voice. Again, that is one of the reasons that governments over the years have kept regional ABC in place, and I see this bill being a threat to those sorts of things.
The member for Hinkler, a man whom I have personal regard for, stated today that he had some degree of concern with parts of the legislation but that on balance he was prepared to support it. He believes that the controls that are in place can overcome some of the problems that many of us foresee, particularly in regional areas. But back in 1995 the member for Hinkler said in this place:
Somewhere, some time, the Australian community must take a stand on the centralising of media control.
	...	...	...
A quick scan of the Australian media landscape should put a decided chill through the veins of all lovers of freedom, cultural diversity and a well informed society, as bulwarks against oppression.
I do not think I could have put it any better. I think what he was saying then was a very appropriate statement. That was in 1995, when the Liberal-National coalition was in opposition and there were attempts to modify the diversity of the voices within the media in Australia. I think his statement then was quite appropriate. I do ask him, though: what has changed? Why isn't that sort of statement appropriate today? Maybe the minister will be able to elaborate on what has changed in that period. There are a number of other current members of the government who made comments on this, back in those days, but I will not start quoting them. 
But I do believe that there is a role for government in safeguarding diversity of opinion and that that role has to be particularly strong in regional areas. If we leave everything up to commercial imperatives, almost by definition the regional areas will suffer—and, as I said, Telstra is a good example of that, where the majority in the Senate at least believe it is important that the government maintain some degree of interest in what is happening and in the regulatory functions. Even though it was promised by the previous Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I think most people believe and understand that one government cannot guarantee any service delivery by subsequent governments—and neither should they. That is a good reason why we should not risk those sorts of things happening, and I think the same logic applies to media ownership.
I have been very supportive of my parliamentary colleague the Independent member for Calare, Mr Andren. I would like to read some comments that he made. As all members would know, Mr Andren was a radio news editor before becoming a parliamentarian and has some degree of knowledge in relation to the delivery of news and current affairs and a diversity of view in a regional context. The member for Calare made these comments on radioinfo.com.au on 27 November 2003:
While the joint venture—
he is talking about the 2UE-2GB newsroom merger, which demonstrates some of the great concerns that a lot of us have—
... might be presented as a stand-alone and doesn't contravene ABA ownership limits or regulation, the spirit of the act is certainly broken.
It is interesting to note that 2UE and Sydney radio services will be co-located in Pyrmont. This is a very cosy arrangement for a supposedly independent company providing services, including news, to two competing companies—
that is, 2UE and 2GB—
I believe it compromises the editorial independence of all three licensees, makes a mockery of competition in news (and I would suggest other more commercial activities like advertising etc). It also narrows the variety of voices, stories, opinions etc available to the three audiences.
It is a cynical interpretation of the act which requires a licensee to “contribute to the provision of an adequate and comprehensive range of broadcasting services in that licence area”. The “contribution” here becomes a collegiate product by a supply company jointly owned by the licensees.
I have argued that the pre-1992 Broadcasting Laws requiring each licensee to provide “adequate and comprehensive” news and other services should be restored. In the absence of that, the licensees should be required to run stand-alone news rooms. How would the public react if Murdoch and Fairfax established a joint company to provide copy and stories to their papers?
I do not think the provisions within the act fully safeguard the community against those sorts of things happening. We can all stand up here and make speeches about what we think will happen, but the interpretation of the law may well be different further down the track. The mere fact that 2UE and 2GB are doing this under the existing rules suggests that the smarties who are out there would, under fewer controls, be able to dream up a whole range of schemes that could avoid some of the supposed regulations that the government believes—and, I guess, quite rightly—would be sufficient. 
I would also like to read into the Hansard some comments that were made in an article in the Australian of Wednesday last written by Jane Schulze. It relates again to the 2UE-2GB sharing of news services and other services. If that sort of process were applied across all the areas that have two radio stations, that could apply to something like 18 areas across Australia where you could see what were traditionally competitive radio stations working through a third organisation—a subcontractor, in a sense—to provide news and editorial and other services. That could relate to the competitive nature of advertising as well. You could end up completely contravening the message that has been out there for quite some time: that we do need some degree of competition in relation to some of those services. The article written by Jane Schulze is headed, `Radio sharing shocks jocks.' It reads:
Plans by rival Sydney radio stations 2UE and 2GB to share resources have outraged 2UE stars John Laws and Mike Carlton and put the stations' owners in the radio regulator's spotlight.
Laws, whose program is syndicated to more than 60 stations in every state, said it was “a pretty strange way to do business”.
2UE owner Southern Cross Broadcasting and 2GB owner Macquarie Radio Network will create a jointly owned company to provide news, sales, technical support and production services to those stations, and 2GB's sister station 2CH. Southern Cross's interstate network, including Melbourne's 3AW and Brisbane's 4BC, are not not affected by the deal.
The cost-saving moves have also aroused the interest of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The Broadcasting Services Act states one group cannot control more than two radio stations in the same market, and John Singleton's Macquarie Radio Network already owns 2GB and 2CH.
Laws said the news being presented on 2UE, 2GB and 2CH could be identical, and he feared jobs would be lost.
“It all comes down to the mighty dollar, and I know they want to keep shareholders happy, but I would prefer to keep staff happy.”
Breakfast host Carlton was also concerned about merging newsrooms: “It means jobs lost and a lack of competition.”
Southern Cross managing director Tony Bell expected the changes to be approved by the ABA. Mr Bell said Southern Cross already had a similar operation in Perth, where its 6PR and 96FM stations shared resources with 6IX.
Station operators in other states are expected to closely watch the ABA's response, but industry observers said there were few opportunities for similar deals.
National operators, such as FM radio giant Austereo, already own two stations in each market. Others, such as the British-backed DMG, which owns the Nova radio stations, also have national reach.
As I said, I will be supporting the amendments that the member for Calare will be bringing to the parliament a bit later tonight. I reiterate in conclusion that I will be opposing the legislation as it stands now.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—in reply—The government is committed to reforming Australia's media ownership laws. With the introduction of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2], the government seeks to give effect to this commitment. Reform of media ownership restrictions will enhance diversity and competition by increasing the potential pool of media owners while allowing greater flexibility in business structures. This in turn will encourage the delivery of innovative services and a more internationally competitive media sector. This has been the rationale for similar reforms initiated in the United Kingdom and in the United States. In particular, the repeal of foreign ownership restrictions will allow new players to enter the media market. 
The member for Melbourne has indicated that Labor supports the government's aim in removing foreign investment limits on media. Indeed, Labor has previously suggested it would support their removal without cross-media reform. The government is firmly of the view that the two must happen together; otherwise, our own firms would be put at a severe disadvantage, as foreign firms, unconstrained in relation to their overseas media holdings, could acquire Australian media groups while Australian firms would be unable to respond due to their existing Australian holdings.
The member for Melbourne also suggested that, in relation to foreign investment reform, further safeguards are required to protect local jobs and activity. Surprisingly, the Labor Party has not seen fit to bring forward amendments which reflect this concern. The member for Melbourne, nevertheless, praised CanWest—the Canadian owner of Network 10—suggesting that it demonstrated that foreign investment could be positive. I share the member for Melbourne's high regard for the manner in which CanWest has overseen the recovery of Network 10. Interestingly, CanWest is not subject to the safeguards that the member for Melbourne apparently thinks are necessary.
The bill provides for a transparent and effective test in relation to maintaining separate editorial decision-making responsibilities in cross-media controlled organisations. The objective of editorial separation requires that media outlets operating under an exemption certificate retain the ability to have separate voices. The member for Ballarat suggested that the editorial separation regime would have no effect. The member for Melbourne suggested that the editorial separation regime in the bill is a fig leaf because it is a once-off test and there is no provision to revisit the test once the certificate has been issued. This is not the case. It will be a licence condition on holders of an exemption certificate that editorial separation is ongoing. This requires the licensee to ensure that the objective of editorial separation is continuously met.
The holder of an exemption certificate will be subject to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's complaints and investigation process. If the ABA determines that a licensee has failed to comply with the editorial separation condition, it may issue a notice requiring the licensee to address the contravention within a specified time frame. Failure to comply with the ABA notice is a criminal offence which can result in a large fine being imposed. The ABA is also able to suspend or cancel a licence if a licence condition is breached.
When the government first introduced this legislation, it invited debate on its proposed reforms. As a result of negotiations with senators and other relevant stakeholders, a number of significant enhancements to the bill were developed. In combination, these enhancements further address public interest concerns and provide additional safeguards to protect diversity of news and opinion as well as to prevent market dominance by any media group. These safeguards include a requirement that a cross-media merger cannot be approved unless five independently owned commercial media outlets across radio, television and associated newspapers in metropolitan markets—and four in regional markets—remain in the market after the cross-media acquisition occurs. 
A two-out-of-three rule restricts media ownership to only two of the three types of regulated media. A restriction on newspaper ownership also applies, with only one associated newspaper permitted per market, where the person also holds a cross-media exemption certificate for that market. The member for Melbourne has suggested that the current five or six media groups will rapidly fall to three under the government's proposals. His analysis does not take into account these new safeguards against media concentration or the role of potential new entrants with the removal of foreign investment restrictions. The member for Melbourne has also ignored the existing reach rules for television networks—a limit of 75 per cent of the national audience—and the control limits of one television and two radio licences in any licence area. 
The member for Calare used the example of Bundaberg and suggested that the number of media groups would fall to three as a result of the passing of this bill. In fact, in all regional markets, no cross-media mergers would be permitted unless there were always four media groups remaining after any merger. Cross-media reform would also offer significant opportunities for growth to the second-tier media groups: in radio, Austereo, the Australian Radio Network, DMG, the Macquarie Radio Network and RG Capital; and, in regional television, WIN Corporation, Prime Television and Southern Cross Broadcasting, which is also in radio. Taken together, these rules will ensure a continuation of the substantial diversity that Australia currently has in its media ownership.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 will continue to apply to proposed media mergers and acquisitions. The TPA prohibits acquisitions that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially reducing competition in a market. Competition effects of potential major media mergers or acquisitions of major operators, even those that relate to business which operate across media platforms, will generally attract the scrutiny of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
A number of speakers asked why the government did not support the so-called Harradine amendment. Senator Harradine proposed an absolute restriction on mergers between television and newspapers in the same market. The intention appeared to be to prevent mergers between the largest media companies, but it also placed the same limitation on small to medium sized players and new entrants who want the freedom to expand and reposition themselves within the industry.
The member for Melbourne asked why we did not limit cross-media merger to radio. Commercial radio is certainly an important voice both in the capital cities and in regional Australia. It is also a sector with a significant foreign presence, including major media groups such as Clear Channel, DMG, and Independent News and Media. Earlier in this debate, the member for Melbourne suggested that radio was of minor significance to the major media groups. This may well be true. The commercial radio operators are small by comparison to the major newspaper or television groups. The radio sector is generally characterised by more, but smaller, players. It logically follows that a cross-media reform package that limits cross-media mergers to radio only would significantly limit potential scale and scope benefits from cross-media mergers. Denying Australian media proprietors the opportunity to achieve cross-media efficiencies in the larger media sectors means that the economic benefit from improved international competitiveness will be significantly reduced. A radio-only approach would also leave our largest media groups unable to respond to the overseas entrants that would accompany removal of the foreign investment limits.
The bill requires that regional commercial radio broadcasters, subject to a cross-media exemption certificate, comply with prescribed minimum levels of local news and information services or retain existing levels of local news and information, where these are higher. The ABA must also impose licence conditions requiring the broadcast of a minimum amount of material of local significance on all commercial television broadcasters in the mainland state capital cities as well as in Tasmania and the regional aggregated television markets. 
The government recognises that this bill proposes significant reform to the existing regime. Given the rapid commercial and technological changes in the media and wider communications sector, a statutory review before 31 December 2006 will enable an assessment of the extent to which the proposed changes continue to safeguard the public interest and provide access to diverse and relevant sources of information.
In conclusion, the government is confident the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] will reform the regulatory framework for ownership and control of media assets in Australia to the benefit of both the industry and consumers. Importantly, it will provide for a more vibrant, open and internationally competitive media sector—a sector focused on competing for audiences rather than on cost cutting. These reforms will also ensure that Australia retains a diversified and high-quality media sector. I commend the bill to the House.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order! The question is that the bill be now read a second time. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 193 the division is deferred until after 8 p.m.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to.
The government appreciates that the parties in this matter have invested some significant effort in attempting to develop constructive amendments to the Spam Bill 2003 and the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. The government has carefully and seriously considered the amendments that have been put forward to see what improvements they might offer for these bills. Unfortunately, after careful examination, we have concluded that the amendments put forward cannot be supported, for a number of reasons. The amendments undermine the fundamental policies guiding the legislation, provide the potential for adverse consequences or abuse, substantially duplicate existing provisions or are simply unnecessary. In their original form, the Spam Bill and the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill provide an effective and coherent approach to the problem of spam, providing a strong, consent based regime with narrow, closely defined exemptions. If these amendments were to pass, they would change the legislation into something which is at best inconsistent and they would dilute the core principle of the Spam Bill—the principle of consent.
The amendment that states that commercial electronic messages can be sent without consent provided the recipient would have a commercial interest in it would make enforcement of the legislation much more difficult and provide a potential loophole for spammers to exploit. The conspicuous publication provisions in the Spam Bill are a better and more selective way of meeting the same intent—to allow messages to be sent that are relevant to the recipient without their express consent. But this approach is restricted to circumstances where the recipient has chosen to publish their work related electronic address. In moving these amendments, Senator Lundy indicated that Labor's focus was on individuals in their homes, as opposed to what she claimed was the government's focus on commercial or business scenarios. I can reassure Senator Lundy, and this House, that the government has not focussed on any one scenario, or any one group, to the detriment of others.
As I have previously stated, the development of this bill has been a balancing act, and in finding the balance we have consulted widely and listened hard. We have finetuned the package as we received feedback, and that has helped produce the very workable package of measures that we brought to parliament. We appreciate that there are a range of issues which other parties and groups have regarding the provisions of the bills currently before the House. There may be some issues worthy of further exploration but there are none that need to be immediately resolved. If any issues make themselves apparent in the first years of the legislation's operation, these can be considered in the scheduled review. This will allow an appropriate opportunity for further consultation on these issues and allow the passage of time to help sort the hype and hysteria that has arisen from some quarters from the reality of seeing the legislation in action.
I understand that Senator Lundy has indicated that the bills will ultimately pass the Senate with the Labor Party's support, and I thank her for that. The bills indeed deserve that support. The public are entitled to the best protection we can provide them from this menace as soon as we can provide it. It is appropriate at this point to temper the expectation with a dose of reality. The legislation represents only one element in one country's package of measures in dealing with the problem. Dealing effectively with spam is going to require time and a great deal of effort, both nationally and internationally. While not the be-all and end-all in the fight against spam, this legislation is a good first step and provides an excellent model for the rest of the world to consider. I commend these bills to the House, but I do not commend the amendments. ",REPS,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,21,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—I am pleased to say that I believe the Spam Bill 2003 and the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 are returning to this place much improved, after the Senate saw the very good sense in providing Labor's refinements to this legislation. The amendments that the Senate made to these bills are workable and constructive and respond to several issues raised in the Senate inquiry into spam bills. Rather than go into the detail of these bills once more, I will simply outline to the House the nature of Labor's amendments and urge the House to support them and this improved bill.
In the Senate inquiry several submissions expressed concern about the search and seizure regime contained in the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. In particular, there was concern that in some circumstances individuals may have their computers searched without a warrant and without their knowledge or permission. This could occur thanks to the wording of this bill, which would allow Australian Communications Authority inspectors to ask the permission of the owner or occupier—for example, a landlord or flatmate—to search a premises as an alternative to getting a search warrant. This could occur even if the property owner or occupier is not the person whose property is to be searched.
Under the original legislation the dean or warden of a university college could have allowed ACA inspectors, which could include police officers, to search a student's residence and the student's belongings without the knowledge or permission of that student and without a warrant. The wording of the bill also could have held spam victims to be subject to ACA searches. The government argued that this might be unlikely to occur but the Senate has agreed with Labor's argument that, if such a power is not intended to be used, why include it? Labor's amendments improve the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 so that these and other concerns are addressed, and that is why a majority of the Senate supported them.
Labor's amendments also removed the inconsistency in schedule 1, clause 3 of the Spam Bill 2003 so that exemptions for charities, government bodies, political parties and religious organisations apply to political groups more fairly. It was unfair and inconsistent that, on the grounds of protecting political speech, some political groups were protected but not others. Labor agreed with the government's point listed in the explanatory memorandum, which says that the reason for exempting these organisations is to avoid any:
 ... unintended restriction on government to citizen, or government to business communication, nor any restriction on religious or political speech.
This is a sensible approach. Even if free religious and political expression were not inherently desirable, this exemption would be necessary to ensure that this legislation is consistent with the Constitution: both the expressed right to freedom of religion and the limited, implied right to freedom of political expression.
The groups listed all make vital contributions to religious and political discourse amongst their members and throughout the entire community. In this context these exemptions, if applied consistently across all not-for-profit political groups, are an appropriate way to protect free political and religious expression. However, the government chose to apply this reasoning in a very limited fashion. The free speech of some classes of political, religious and charitable organisations was protected and that of others not. To improve the clause, Labor sought to include trade unions and not-for-profit political lobby groups in schedule l, clause 3. These include groups like the Australian Republican Movement, Ausflag and Amnesty International, all of which play very important roles in our nation's political development. 
This amendment also provides extra protection for charities. The Treasurer has already foreshadowed moves to exclude from the definition of `charity' those charitable organisations which also engage in political lobbying. Therefore it was possible that charities would only be exempted if they did not engage in political lobbying. Labor's amendment means that the bill now protects political expression across the board, not just for some groups.
During the Senate inquiry there was some concern raised that, because the Spam Bill 2003 makes no distinction between single and bulk commercial emails, it would prohibit some unsolicited commercial electronic messages sent by individuals or organisations with a genuine belief an intended recipient would want to receive it. Labor addressed this concern by introducing amendments to allow some leeway in these bona fide cases without opening up a loophole for spammers. Under the amendments the onus is clearly on the shoulders of the sender to prove that they had a bona fide belief that their email was specifically related to an interest known to be held by the recipient. This provision could not be used by a spammer indiscriminately firing off emails. In the Senate inquiry, the highly regarded information technology legal expert Philip Argy said:
When one has received four or five copies of an email ... about how to enhance the size of a part of one's anatomy, it is a bit hard, particularly when you have never met the person, to imagine how they are going to demonstrate a reasonably held belief that you would be interested in the content of such an email.
(Extension of time granted)This is an onerous enough test to separate well-meaning users of email from the type of person that this legislation is intended to target. In any case, under the amendments made by Labor, as I will go on to discuss, it is always possible for an Internet user to opt out from such specifically targeted emails if they do not wish to continue receiving them.
Another major concern raised during the Senate inquiry was that emails sent by exempted organisations—those described as `designated commercial electronic messages'—were not required to have a functional unsubscribe facility. Labor introduced an amendment to address this issue and, quite sensibly, the Senate has supported it. As a result, Australians can voluntarily opt out from receiving all commercial emails, and such emails must provide a simple mechanism for doing this. This is even in situations where the sending body would otherwise be exempt, such as government bodies or religious organisations. Labor saw no good reasons why Australians should be unable to object to receiving commercial emails from religious organisations, charities, political parties and such, and have altered the bill to ensure that this cannot occur. Obviously there is no intention that any of these provisions can be used by recipients to knock back emails which they are legally obliged to receive—for example, by contract or by legislation.
I have stated previously that Labor believes that some emails should be exempt from the Spam Bill. However, it was simply unacceptable that these emails could continue to be sent in the face of direct opposition from recipients. Labor's amendments have ensured that an unsubscribe facility is included in all emails and that, once received, an unsubscribe request is acted upon. 
Labor's approach to these bills has been to look at some of the concerns raised about them by members of the Internet community and others. These include the Australian Consumers Association, Electronic Frontiers Australia, the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Internet Society of Australia, amongst many others. Then we developed constructive measures to address these concerns and therefore to improve the legislation. We were not alone. The Democrats, and indeed the whole Senate, supported these changes. As a result, appearing here before us from the Senate this evening is a vastly improved set of bills. These bills nonetheless still embody the original intent of the drafters. Unfortunately, the Howard government has indicated that it will reject the views of the Senate and those participants in the Senate inquiry. I find this very disappointing, and I hope that the Howard government and the minister will take these amendments in the spirit in which they were intended and support this much improved legislation.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 proposes amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908, the Imported Food Control Act 1992, the Pig Industry Act 2001 and the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000. The amendments are unrelated, except that the legislation subject to amendment falls within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This omnibus bill was first introduced into the House on 29 May last year, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry delivered his second reading speech on the same day. The fact that the government has had this bill sitting on the program for over 12 months says a great deal about the way it manages its legislative program. It also says a great deal about the priority this government assigns to agricultural matters. I propose to address the bill's noncontroversial measures before commenting on what we regard as its rotten heart—and that is the outsourcing of Australia's quarantine function. 
The proposed amendments to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 give effect to some of the recommendations of the national competition policy review of the act. Changes include the introduction of compliance agreements in the imported food inspection regime and amended rules relating to the labelling of imported food. I know how seriously Australia's food industry takes the protection of public health standards and am confident that the co-regulatory approach will be successful. The industry supports these changes, and it appears that this is a rare instance where the government has listened to industry's views and acted accordingly. Members will be aware that this is most unusual behaviour, certainly in the instance of this minister. The government did not listen to anyone, let alone the food industry, when it implemented its goods and services tax—an important step in its path to becoming the highest taxing government in Australian history. It certainly did not listen to the food industry when it imposed a sugar tax on Australia's food processors.
The very long delay between the completion of the national competition policy review and the implementation of these changes is quite telling. It was a long delay when the bill was introduced, and it is massively longer today. The review was completed in November 1998—more than four years ago. Issues like reform of the imported food inspection and labelling regime have slipped off the government's agenda in preference to the introduction of additional tax imposts on the sector. Labor will support the amendments to the Imported Food Control Act. Nevertheless, we will monitor the operation of these changes to ensure that they have no negative impact on the integrity of our imported food inspection and labelling regime.
The amendments to the Pig Industry Act 2001 and Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000 sensibly bring the legislation underpinning research efforts in the pork and wool industries into line with that of other rural industries. The provisions correct an anomaly that currently prevents Australian Pork Ltd and Australian Wool Innovation Ltd from carrying forward research and development expenditure from one year to the next, thus denying these important industries full matching funding in some years. Labor supports the amendments but again questions why the minister has sat on his hands for so long in relation to this matter.
The amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908 do three things: extend the quarantine act to Christmas Island; change the quarantine fee regime; and permit state quarantine officers and private contract staff to be appointed as `quarantine officers' within the meaning of the act. With respect to the extension of the act to Christmas Island, Labor has received some representations from residents concerned about the potential impact of this bill on their cost of living. Whilst not disposed to oppose the extension of the Quarantine Act to Christmas Island, the opposition seeks some assurance from the government that the residents of Christmas Island will not be adversely affected by the provisions of this bill. 
As has been so effectively highlighted by my colleagues the member for Banks and the member for Lingiari, the Howard government generally has scant regard for the interests of the residents of Australia's external territories—except, I might add, to excise them. I trust that the minister can give the opposition and also the residents of Christmas Island an assurance that the extension of the Quarantine Act proposed in the bill will act to the benefit and not the detriment of the affected community. The changes to the fee regime provide for the collection of quarantine fees from agents, and reflect current practice. The minister advises that a legislative change will reduce bad debts, and this has the support of the opposition.
Changes to the categories of persons able to exercise quarantine functions are the key provisions of this amendment bill. It is disappointing that amendments that impact on the integrity of our quarantine system have been bundled together with a raft of other administrative amendments to the Quarantine Act and three unrelated bills. Some naive souls might attribute the inclusion of such important provisions to an oversight or disorganisation on the part of the minister; but it is neither. More reprehensibly, it represents an attempt by the government to bury the privatisation of Australia's quarantine service within an omnibus bill. Let me repeat: this is no more than an attempt to privatise Australia's quarantine service—an attempt to privatise one of the most important front-line defences of our national security. This is headline material buried in what looks like an innocuous omnibus bill related to matters agricultural.
The bill makes two particular changes to the law governing the appointment of quarantine officers. First, it provides for the appointment of state quarantine officers to perform quarantine functions within the meaning of the Quarantine Act. The opposition is satisfied that quarantine officers employed by state governments operate under an appropriate accountability framework and the provisions in the bill related to these officers will, indeed, improve the efficacy of the existing system.
The second change is the extension of quarantine powers to contract pool staff, and it is this matter that this side of the House will fight tooth and nail to avoid. The bill would give the Director of Quarantine the power to appoint a person who is not a Commonwealth, state or territory employee to be a quarantine officer. Specifically, the bill provides for the Director of Quarantine to enter into an arrangement to create a contract pool and then appoint a person from that pool to perform quarantine functions. Buried in the minister's second reading speech to the House on 29 May last year is the supposed rationale for these provisions. The minister said that AQIS needs `increased flexibility to deal with the new and growing demands the government is making on the organisation'—I have to add cynically, not enough flexibility to necessitate bringing on the debate within 18 months, but flexibility nonetheless. Presumably the government would say that these demands are a consequence of the new security environment in which Australia now finds itself and reflect the community's demand for increased border protection.
So what is the government's answer to these new demands? It is the outsourcing of our quarantine function to the lowest bidder—indeed, the outsourcing of border protection to private, contracted labour. When the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquired into the provisions of the bill 13 months ago, it found that AQIS has engaged between 150 and 200 contractors to perform routine manual tasks at airports and ports under the direction of quarantine officers. These contractors continue to undertake tasks such as loading and unloading and X-raying goods, cleaning shoes and assisting to remove dirt from shipping containers. These staff would be the potential initial beneficiaries of the new powers. However, these powers do not just relate to the positioning of bags on conveyor belts and the cleaning of shipping containers. With this bill, contractors could be appointed to perform all existing quarantine functions with some limited exceptions. For example, under section 66AB of the Quarantine Act, contract staff would have the power to enter and search premises; under section 66AD of the act, they could seize material without a warrant. These extraordinary powers would be accompanied by a host of others not excluded by the government in the drafting of this amendment bill. 
The fact is that the powers are not required to assist the existing staff, those carrying out manual functions, in the performance of their duties. These provisions represent an insidious attempt by the government to outsource by stealth key quarantine functions to the private sector. It is an attempt completely at odds with the government's stated commitment to a world-class quarantine regime. Clearly this government is strong on the rhetoric of protecting our borders but weak on the actual practice. In this case, it is privatising a central plank in our border protection platform; that is, quarantine.
The minister's recent proposal to return the sheep stranded aboard the Cormo Express was the clearest possible example of his lack of understanding that quarantine does matter. The fact that the plan to return the sheep to Australia went to an advanced stage without the release of an import risk analysis points to the recklessness with which the minister treats our quarantine barrier. I know that plenty of members on the opposite side share that view. They do no more than reflect the truth of the matter, and what the industry and the National Farmers Federation believe. Unfortunately, in the wake of the Cormo Express fiasco, the current minister maintains stewardship of our quarantine system.
Our quarantine system is our first and last line of protection against a disaster imposed on our agricultural industries, our environment and the health and safety of the Australian population by the incursion of a foreign disease or contagion. My constituents, residents of Australia's natural state, Tasmania—which is now regarded as `the flavour isle'—particularly residents of the north-west coast and King Island, demand that this parliament take quarantine matters very seriously. The provisions of the bill relating to contract staff are completely out of step with the expectations of the electors in my electorate of Braddon and the wider Australian community. It is noteworthy that the move to provide contractors with powers under the Quarantine Act has attracted staunch opposition from the dedicated men and women currently providing this nation with its quarantine function. These are the professional officers most concerned about ensuring the integrity of our border protection. Hundreds of quarantine officers have signed a petition opposing the outsourcing of their responsibilities to contractors. This petition says in part:
We the undersigned strongly oppose outsourcing quarantine officer powers and functions. We believe that any step in this direction will inevitably compromise the integrity and the accountability of AQIS, its officers, and the vital service it provides. 
This petition has been signed by over 1,750 quarantine, Customs and immigration officers, none of whom are fooled by the government's claim that all the provisions do is lend AQIS the requisite flexibility it requires. Experience dictates that, in practice, for this government `flexibility' is no more than code for extensive outsourcing and then privatisation.
On this point, I want to turn to evidence given by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to the Senate inquiry into the provisions of the bill last November. The department expanded on the minister's rationale for provisions in the bill, saying that the extension of quarantine powers to a private contract pool is necessary to uphold the legality of the existing contract arrangements. In other words, it was contended that the job being performed by the current contract pool is under some legal doubt. One might think it extraordinary that a Commonwealth department would embark on the engagement of contractors without inquiring as to the legality of those contract arrangements. The department does, after all, engage up to 200 contractors to perform manual work at airports and seaports around the country. It seems, though, that anything is possible under this minister. If the department is to be believed, up to 200 staff have been engaged to perform duties they have no legal standing to perform. The minister has let this situation drag on and on.
Last year, Labor's shadow minister for primary industries, Senator Kerry O'Brien, sought advice from the minister about the basis for his department's contention that current manual functions were being performed illegally. In response, the minister provided advice from AQIS lawyers Minter Ellison. Unfortunately for the minister, that advice does no more than point to the fact that the Quarantine Act does not permit non-quarantine officers to perform statutory quarantine functions. The other argument in favour of the contract provisions is, of course, that AQIS needs more `flexibility' in the management of its quarantine staff function. Again, I cannot but help refer to the 18 months it has taken the government to bring this bill on for debate. If flexibility was needed in May 2002, it clearly was not needed very badly. Rather unfortunately for the minister, his department's own legal advice says that the existing act provides a range of options for flexible employment, including the appointment of temporary and fixed-task quarantine officers. The existing act also provides authorisation, in respect of certain tasks, for those assisting quarantine officers in the performance of their duties. Part-time ongoing, full-time non-ongoing and part-time non-ongoing employment is allowed under the Public Service Act and is a feature of the department's current employment profile.
On the issue of the legal advice that the government has been so ill-advised to rely on for its argument, the House will be interested to know that this advice has not come cheap. In fact, the contract list for the minister's department released around the time that this bill was first introduced discloses the contract value of legal advice at $5.7 million. I know that, when the people of Braddon have the unfortunate need to consult a lawyer, they make sure they listen to the advice they receive. Clearly, the minister lacks the good sense of my electors, a matter of no surprise to his colleagues on the other side of the chamber or to most rural and regional Australians—particularly of late.
Even if one accepted that the government was presenting this argument in good faith, the next hurdle for it to overcome concerns the range of powers it proposes to award contractors under the provisions of the bill. The department told the Senate inquiry that it does not see the role of the contractors extending much beyond putting bags on conveyor belts and scraping mud from shipping containers. But the provisions of the amendment bill give these contractors almost all the statutory quarantine enforcement powers, including the right to enter and search premises, seize material without a warrant and search goods. 
An associated concern is that of the complete absence of accountability for this proposed new category of quarantine officers. The bill provides that, before a contractor can be appointed to the contract pool, the appointee must agree to comply with the Australian Public Service code of conduct. The minister, in his second reading speech delivered on 29 May last year, said:
The requirement regarding the APS code of conduct has been included because persons from a contract pool exercising quarantine powers should have the same level of accountability as government employees exercising those powers.
The provisions of the bill and those words from the minister are well and good, but they do not provide one ounce of accountability. The fact is that the APS code of conduct will not apply to contract quarantine officers because they will not be Commonwealth employees. The minister's department has conceded that the Public Service Commissioner and the Merit Protection Commissioner would have no role with respect to the contract quarantine pool. Whistleblower protection has not been contemplated. Indeed, the contention that the only mechanism to deal with individual breaches of the code would be the application of common law has not been seriously challenged. 
It is our view that the proposed extension of quarantine powers to private contract staff poses a direct threat to the integrity of Australia's quarantine regime. Subsequent to the Senate inquiry, Senator O'Brien's office spoke to the minister's office about the opposition's concerns about the bill. The opposition understood the minister was taking another look at the bill, but that has not come to pass. All the minister has done is sit on his hands again—in this instance, for 18 months since the bill was introduced, for 13 months since the Senate inquiry into the bill was reported and for 12 months since the bill was last listed for debate in this chamber.
In expectation of the government's inevitable disregard for the legitimate concerns expressed by the opposition in this matter, I advise it is the opposition's intention to move amendments in the other place to remove the offending provisions from this bill. As noted earlier, it is regrettable that the government has chosen to bundle up contract quarantine provisions with other, largely administrative, matters related to quarantine, industry research and development, and the inspection and labelling of imported food. The opposition will simply not permit Australia's quarantine barrier to be threatened by the ideological obsession of the current government with the privatisation of its core functions. To bury such an important amendment, especially given its connection to border protection—in this case, quarantine—in an omnibus bill is simply unforgivable, and the opposition will not stand for it. ",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2003-12-01,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 enables largely technical amendments to four pieces of agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation. It extends the Quarantine Act to include Christmas Island and amends that act to change the arrangements for the payment of fees; it amends the Imported Food Control Act to provide legislative support for compliance agreements between food importers and AQIS; and it amends the Pig Industry Act 2001 and the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000 to enable the R&D bodies—Australian Pork Ltd and Australian Wool Innovation Ltd—to carry forward claims for R&D expenditure that are eligible for matching Commonwealth contributions from one financial year to the next. 
I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the issues facing the wool and pig industries in Australia and to comment on their importance to my electorate of Farrer. Rural R&D bodies are financed partly by industry and partly by the taxpayer. Generally, the Commonwealth provides payments to these bodies that match the amount they raise in levies. This legislation allows claims for matching government expenditure to be rolled over from one financial year to the next so that all possible corresponding government funds can be accessed.
Australia's pork industry has undergone massive changes in the past decade. A globalised model of production has seen a reduction in the number of growers, from more than 10,000 to fewer than 2,500. Many of these farmers do contract growing for other farmers, thus minimising the riskiness of their business and ensuring a more certain cash flow. One of the main factors impacting on profitability in the industry is the price of grain. In an intensive industry such as the pork industry, high levels of grain are an essential, relentless and very large input. 
During the drought, feed prices soared. Over 12 months, grain feed prices rose by more than 70 per cent. I think it is fair to say that the current system for providing exceptional circumstances relief has tended to favour broadacre farmers at the expense of more intensive industries, such as the pig meat industry. I am confident that Minister Truss's drought review task force will examine this issue and address it for the future. Certainly, producers of pork are just as severely affected by drought as are producers of milk, wool or beef, so I do encourage the pork industry to make a comprehensive submission to the drought review task force.
The story of Australian pork is a story of many successes. Since we have been forced to compete globally, Australia has become the biggest supplier of fresh pork to Singapore—roughly 30,000 tonnes a year. We also supply the Japanese market, which is the world's largest, with 800,000 tonnes—one per cent of its market only, however—each year. However, Australia does import 45,000 tonnes of pig meat a year and many of these cuts are up to $2 a kilogram cheaper than the Australian product. Clearly, other countries—certainly the US, in the context of any negotiated free trade agreement—would like to get access to our domestic pork market. I am sure the pork industry and rural members in this place will be giving the message that we must be extremely careful not to trade away that access.
I know that producers here feel somewhat exposed when they compare their situation with farms in Europe. Denmark is able to export without barriers or tariffs, whereas if we want to export to Europe we immediately have barriers in place. But I do not believe the answer is for us to erect barriers. Clearly, it is not, and there are many well-documented reasons for this. The necessary approach is the one we are taking through the World Trade Organisation. But it is important for us to realise our competitive advantage: our disease-free status and our quarantine barriers. These make us a low-risk supplier to the rest of the world and really give us something that no other country has. I know that the rest of the world will try very hard to unravel and discredit our quarantine restrictions. I would like to think that they are non negotiable because our status as a country free of exotic disease is precious and must be maintained.
Our pork producers currently pay a slaughter levy of about $2.40 on every pig they sell, which funds Australian Pork Ltd's marketing and promotion and funds television advertising campaigns with which many of us are familiar. Of course, this in turn lifts the consumer's general level of awareness about pork, which may benefit importers, not just domestic producers selling on the domestic market. Producers therefore believe that there should be an equivalent levy on product coming into this country. I understand that this has been suggested to importers and processors of imported meats and that they are willing to come on board with a voluntary levy. The government have let it be known that we are concerned about free riders in this area and that we are prepared to back this concern with the necessary government regulation. 
There is definitely a way to go in increasing sales of fresh pork. Domestic consumption is eight kilos per person, compared with 37 kilos for beef. However, I congratulate Australian Pork Ltd on a consumer campaign that for the June 2003 quarter saw pork become the fastest growing share of meat on Australian plates, with sales 13.3 per cent higher than for the previous year. This is an important trend because pork consumption had not changed much in the previous 10 years. People tended to see it as old fashioned and difficult to cook.
I would like to see supermarkets improve their labelling and identification of imported pork products so that consumers can make informed choices about what they buy. Woolworths and Coles sell a great quantity of smallgoods and these would contain imported pork in varying degrees. However, they are not obliged to identify how much Canadian or Danish meat is in the smallgoods, they sell. I am not suggesting that we would categorise imported product as inferior or try to tarnish its image in any way, but consumers should have a choice. If I want to support my local pork industry, I should be able to find out if the ham or bacon I am buying is Australian or not. It is a question of the consumer being able to make up their own mind. I urge the major supermarket chains to make the changes necessary to label smallgoods accordingly. I remember a dispute arising over imported oranges from California and then seeing them clearly labelled in the fruit and vegetable section of my supermarket as imported navels. Shoppers were therefore able to make an informed choice about which oranges they bought.
Getting back to pork, bacon is a good example. If it is purchased prewrapped in the cold section of the supermarket, we can read the label and find out where it comes from. But, if we purchase it at the deli section unwrapped, we have no idea. In fact, I often ask the attendant at the deli counter what is the country of origin of the bacon they are selling, only to be confronted by a blank look; it might be all Australian, it might be partly Australian or it might be all imported. The rising exchange rate is certainly tough on all of our commodity producers, and pork would be no exception. Producers receive between about $2 and $2.60 per kilo of pork sold. Supermarkets sell it—on my last observation—for between $8 and $18 a kilo. It remains a mystery to me in this case—as in other instances where our supermarkets are selling fresh produce—how that level of value adding takes place: the producer gets between $2 and $2.60 and it costs an average of $10 to $14 on the supermarket shelves.
I commend the industry for its determination and resolve in the face of these difficulties, particularly after the drought. I know Australian Pork Ltd is having its annual general meeting in Canberra tomorrow and the next day, and I wish all the delegates well as they work on behalf of the entire pork industry—an important, worthwhile and highly regarded industry for Australia. It is well represented in my electorate of Farrer by QAF, Australia's leading producer and exporter of quality pork, having 20 per cent of the nation's sales. QAF have eight farming sites, producing nearly one million pigs per year, with the Corowa site, in the Farrer electorate, producing almost half of the market pigs. Total sales revenue for 2002 amounted to a quarter of a million dollars. Forty per cent of production is sold as fresh pork into the retail sector, 30 per cent goes to manufacturers for further processing and 30 per cent is exported. QAF account for 30 per cent of all pork exports from Australia and are a prominent member of the Confederation of Australian Pork Exporters. Ten per cent of their sales goes directly to supermarkets. I visited one of their sites. They have a commendable environmental management plan, which they revise annually. This plan details their current environmental practices, defines the potential risks and outlines methods of assessing and improving long-term environmental sustainability. 
This brings me to Australian Wool Innovation, the rural R&D body for the wool industry. I mentioned the hard time that the rising dollar is giving the pork industry. It is no less the case for the wool industry, and the price of wool has dropped by almost a third over the last six months. The stores are chock-a-block as sale prices are not reaching the reserve and people are choosing to hang onto their clip or part of their clip. But there is much news in innovation in the wool industry. For example, a non-woven wool product is soon to be released commercially, which will help thousands of people protect their homes from bushfires. In my electorate, Macquarie Textiles has teamed up with AWI in a venture to produce a non-woven wool fabric that is used in high-fashion garments.
With low returns for wool and with the western part of New South Wales slipping back into drought, I really feel for the farmers of the western division that I represent. I have spoken many times in this place about their courage and commitment to the land and the life they love. That is why I was so angry with the recent contamination of the shipload of live sheep due to be exported from Portland. The point needs to be made that, without a live sheep industry, we deal a real kick in the guts to the wool industry in Australia. That point may not be readily appreciated. Wool producers get their returns from wool sales and also from sales of older sheep. Boat wethers may make as much as $40 to $60 a head and give the farmer the opportunity to restock with younger sheep, thus keeping the enterprise going. Where there is no live sheep industry, farmers are forced to sell to domestic processors for much less than this—maybe $10 a head, maybe only $5 a head.
Imagine the effect this has on the bottom line. Imagine the hardship in today's environment: recovering—or not recovering—from a drought, wool prices depressed and no genuine market for older sheep. The actions of these animal liberationists on the wharf at Portland were an absolute disgrace. I wonder how sections of the community have become so disconnected from the land that sustains us all and the primary production industries, such as the wool industry, that mean so much to this country's past, present and future that they could carry out such a monstrous act.
I would like to end on a positive note and mention some more innovations in the wool industry of interest to people in this place. I am sure machine washable suits would fit into that category. For just three months there has been a premium quality machine washable suit on the market. That will save on everybody's dry cleaning bills. I mentioned the important partnership taking place between AWI and Macquarie Textiles, which has realised the development of Australia's only commercial non-woven wool plant in Albury. It has provoked widespread interest from companies wanting to test the new fabric for a variety of uses, ranging from surf wear to protective clothing. A Drizabone vest using non-woven wool has sold so well that a second run of the product has now been ordered. 
AWI recently opened an office in Beijing, which will build further presence in a market which is very important to Australia, because China takes 40 per cent of our wool exports and they are worth $1.3 billion. Current research activities involving the Chinese wool textile industry will be strengthened and expanded, with AWI creating new relationships and building on existing ones with the Chinese government and industry representatives. I commend this bill to the House, and I look forward to good times ahead for our wool and pork producers.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2003-12-01,"—In the few minutes I have tonight I wish to concentrate on the latter part of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which deals with compliance under the AQIS rules and laws. It refers to the national competition policy review. I spent most of the week before last making press releases saying that AQIS was in fact not a defender of the biosecurity of this country but in fact worked as a sort of enforcement arm for the free market zealots in this place. I was quite amazed to find that a briefing paper from the library says just that—that this is a result of the national competition policy review. I would have thought that they would have at least had the decency to try and hide it.
I do not know whether people in this place fully realise what we are talking about here. I cannot remember the figures now, but footandmouth disease is a very hardy pathogen. If my memory serves me correctly, it can lay dormant and stay alive for up to nearly a year. I think the beef industry is currently worth about $5,000 million to the economy of Australia. Certainly the exports are worth around $3,000 million. If this pathogen arrives in Australia not only will we lose the $3,000 million in exports but we will also see a tremendous diminution in the value of the properties and the beef herd of Australia and we will see the beef herd of Australia rapidly decimated, just as we have seen happen to the wool industry. What they are talking about here is compliance. Earlier in this debate this evening my honourable colleague from Tasmania, the member for Braddon, was talking about the privatisation of AQIS, and it most certainly goes a long way in that direction. But it is my personal belief, reading all this, that it goes much further than that.
Let me move from the extreme dangers of footandmouth disease in the beef industry to the grape industry. One of the most amazing things that I have witnessed in recent years in politics is the decision by AQIS to allow grapes to come in from California in the same threemonth period that the Bulletin, a national magazine, did a twopage spread saying that California had lost one-tenth of its entire grape production because of a very exotically named vector—that is something that carries a disease—called a glassy-winged sharpshooter. Whilst we may reflect upon the fact that only the Americans could have thought of a name like the glassy-winged sharpshooter, this little critter—to continue with the American language—carries a disease called Pierce's disease. This disease is so virulent that it wiped out one-tenth of the entire grape production of California—the biggest grape producing state on earth.
It does not matter what argument you put up. This is like allowing some beef product to come in from a footandmouth disease country. No matter what argument you put up, you know that somehow or other this terrible disease will arrive on our shores. Other countries say that Australia does not allow things to come into this country, that we use our phytosanitary arrangements to prevent it. It is a sort of nondeclared tariff. It is a damn awful one if it is. I am told that the second chief person in AQIS, while addressing a meeting in Innisfail, was asked how many applications have been rejected in the last three years. The person waffled and the question was asked again. To cut a long story short, the question was asked four times. Eventually, the person asking the question said, `It is quite obvious that you have not rejected a single application in the last three years.' These countries say they believe that we are stopping them from coming in. I only wish to heaven that were true. But instead of having the mindset that they are here to protect and defend this country—that they are the centurion standing at the palace gates—AQIS believe they are some sort of officer of the free trade implementation bureau of Australia, which may well be referred to as the Australian government, given the way the Australian government has acted for the last 15 years now.
—Unfortunately it is true. It predates the current government. However, it has been continued by the current government and most certainly under the regime of the current minister for agricultural affairs. Going back to the grapes, it was argued by AQIS that we would have them treated with methyl bromide in the United States and that this would ensure that the disease would be killed before that product left the United States. I have my doubts as to how effective that treatment would be and that the disease would be killed. However, having agreed to that, we are now informed that they will be allowed to do the methyl bromiding in Australia. I hope someone tells the glassy-winged sharpshooter that he must not leave the grape case before it has been bombed by the methyl bromide. He might just happen to fly out of the box before he is methyl bromided. If ever there were a classic case of closing the door after the horse has bolted it would have to be this.
More worrying still, it seems that what is being done here is an enabling of AQIS, Biosecurity Australia or whoever it is—one of these bodies—to certify officers so long as a person moves into a compliance agreement. So I envisage that exporters from overseas sending product to Australia will enter into a compliance agreement. We will trust that Thailand, when they send their durians to Australia, will voluntarily cut open every hundredth or thousandth durian and waste this extremely valuable product to meet the compliance regulations of Australia. They will do this even though we are not watching and even though we have no way of being able to verify this compliance, but we will trust them. I do not in any way wish to single out Thailand, but look at the world history of trade. If countries in days past had said that they would just trust those people coming into their country or exporting product to their country, then I think there would be some more very poor and poverty stricken countries around now.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2003-12-01,"—The government proposes to close two Centrelink offices in my electorate, one situated in Richmond and the other in Fitzroy. In their place, the government proposes to open a single office over in the very eastern part of my electorate, close to the leafy suburbs of Kew and well out of the way of the clientele that the two existing Centrelink offices serve at the moment. This is an outrageous proposal and it will have a very negative effect on a very large number of disadvantaged people in my electorate. 
The current Centrelink offices in Richmond and Fitzroy serve a very large number of people, particularly those in the high-rise Victorian housing division estates and others who are very seriously disadvantaged. Many of these people have significant problems with mobility and, as a result of this decision to close these two Centrelink offices and create a new one in the out of the way area of the very eastern part of Richmond, they will encounter very serious problems in accessing Centrelink. It will also mean substantially increased travelling times for many Centrelink clients, which will increase the stress on families and, amongst other things, reduce the amount of time and money that people will have for things like job search activities. It will impose additional barriers for people with language difficulties who seek to use Centrelink's services, who often bring with them a family member who has better English skills. 
It will impose difficulties on families who sometimes need to take children with them on visits to Centrelink because of difficulties in having them minded. The long journeys will be particularly stressful for single mothers with young children; they will have to make journeys that are quite substantial and that will sometimes involve two separate means of transport as well as a substantial amount of walking. Refugees on temporary protection visas, who do not have concession cards, will be forced to pay the full fare for the additional trips to Centrelink. Also, if this proposal goes ahead, particular minority groups in my electorate will face difficulties in adjusting to the travel arrangements that will prevail. 
This proposal is due to take effect in March 2005. There has been substantial community dissent, demonstrations have been held and a very large number of community organisations in my electorate, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence, are organising to try and persuade the government to change its position on this issue. Because of the additional travel associated with this proposal, people on very low incomes will be faced with substantial extra costs. It will also mean a substantial cost in people's time. It will mean that a significant extra burden will fall on many community agencies in my electorate because people who are currently going to Centrelink will be in greater difficulties; some of them will fall off the Centrelink process and inevitably end up in the care of those voluntary community agencies—and this will impose an increase in the already very substantial workload being experienced by these agencies.
I do not believe the outreach of Centrelink services to those community organisations—which in some way is supposed to alleviate these problems—will be successful. There will be a whole range of associated difficulties such as security issues and problems with clients who will not be able to access the same range of services at outreach centres that can be accessed at genuine Centrelink offices. There will be a lot of frustration, anger and distress as a result of this change, and I call on the government to reconsider it. 
Although a relatively limited geographical area is involved, a very large number of people in my electorate, particularly those in the housing estates, are Centrelink clients. Many of them are extremely disadvantaged, being on very low incomes and having a range of problems including psychiatric disabilities, lack of English skills and many other issues that mean they are disadvantaged in accessing Centrelink services. Many of these people will suffer significant further disadvantage if this proposal is implemented as a result of not being able to access Centrelink with the same ease as they can currently.
People in North Carlton will be forced to go further north and possibly have to take two separate public transport trips. This will add substantially to their costs of just going to the Centrelink office to comply with their obligations. This will apply even more so to people in North Fitzroy who seek to access the new centre over in the very east of Richmond. It will impose a lot of difficulty on many people in my electorate—people in our society who are most vulnerable, most in need and require the most assistance. This is a very retrograde step, and the government should abandon this proposal. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Centrelink: Office Closures</title>,Adjournment,27,1
