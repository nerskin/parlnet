Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Budgets are a vital part of our democracy, ensuring governments are open and accountable to the community that elects them. 


Transparency on costings must apply both to governments and to those who seek to govern, so the community has the proper opportunity to scrutinise policies and their budget impact well before an election. 


The Gillard government established the Parliamentary Budget Office to promote greater scrutiny on costings and to ensure budget transparency from all sides of politics.


Today I introduce the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2013 to amend the governing arrangements for the Parliamentary Budget Office.


The bill requires the PBO to publish a postelection report on election commitments of all political parties, including the full impact of those commitments on the budget bottom line. 


This bill will enhance transparency of the financial impacts of policy proposals by providing an independent assessment of the tax and spending promises that political parties make. 


Through these reforms, the Australian community will have more information about alternative approaches to fiscal policy. 


These reforms will allow a more accurate and informed debate on economic policy in this country.


The bill will impose discipline on the promises of political parties and incentivise all political parties to be up front and honest about the cost of their promises. 


It has long been accepted that Australian companies must keep their books in good order or face the risk of being exposed by an end-of-year audit. 


If we are right to demand this of private companies on behalf of their shareholders and lenders, then we are most certainly right to apply this standard to political parties on behalf of taxpayers. 


This reform will help to ensure that all political parties are straight with the Australian people before the election because they know that their costings will be revealed by the PBO post the election. 


Politicians of all political persuasions have a responsibility to be open and accountable to those who put us in this place.


We are proud to have established the PBO as a vital institution in our fiscal and budgetary framework, and we are prouder still to be expanding its role to add this very important function. 


With the support of the parliament, these reforms will remove the capacity of any political party to try to mislead the Australian people and will punish those that attempt to do so. 




Postelection report



During an election campaign, political parties can have their commitments officially costed by the PBO or the departments of Treasury and finance. 


However, this is not mandatory, and there is currently no legislative mechanism for all the commitments of all the political parties to be compiled and assessed in a consistent manner. 


The Australian community therefore relies on the honesty of political parties to submit their policies for costing in good time so they can be released for the public to see.


This bill will make it a statutory function of the PBO to publish a report with policy costings of the full suite of a party's election commitments. 


It will also require the PBO to indicate the combined total financial impact of these commitments 30 days after a government forms following a general election. 


This means that, even if a party does not properly take advantage of the costing options available under the PBO legislation or under the Charter of Budget Honesty, the rigour of an independent analysis will still be brought to bear on that party's promises.


This bill will sharpen the focus on all the commitments made during an election campaign and ensure these promises are assessed through the independent and nonpartisan lens of the PBO. 




Election commitments



In order for the PBO to produce this report, it will need a clear, defined and agreed list of election commitments from all of the political parties. 


To achieve this, the bill will require parliamentary parties to provide the PBO with a list of election commitments of these political parties. 


As well as allowing the PBO to produce its postelection report, this will also ensure that it is abundantly clear what each party has promised. 


These lists will be there in black and white for all to see.




Information 
g
athering 



Given the PBO’s statutory deadline to deliver the report within 30 days, it is important that the PBO has timely access to information from Commonwealth bodies to assist in delivering the report. 


Accordingly, the bill includes arrangements for the request and provision of information from Commonwealth bodies. 


The proposed arrangements are similar to the arrangements that apply to assist the Treasury and finance secretaries prepare the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO). 


PEFO actually has to be prepared within just 10 days of the issue of a writ for a general election, whereas the PBO has 30 days to deliver its postelection report. 


So giving the PBO comparable information-gathering arrangements to those that apply for PEFO will be more than sufficient. 


Further, the PBO is under similar time constraints when preparing policy costings for parliamentarians during the caretaker period. 


Therefore, this new information-gathering process will apply when the PBO is preparing caretaker costings. 


There are also existing arrangements in place for the PBO to request and receive information from Commonwealth bodies via a memorandum of understanding. 


These arrangements will continue to apply more generally, supporting the flow of information to the PBO. 


Of course, in compiling the postelection report, the PBO may also require further information from political parties themselves, and from any third parties involved in preparing the parties’ costings. 


This means that if a political party tries to avoid proper scrutiny by using a private accountant without budget expertise, all of this information can still be obtained by the PBO. 




Size of a 
parliamentary p
arty 



The bill provides that the postelection report will include the policies of parliamentary parties with five or more members or senators in the Commonwealth parliament immediately prior to the commencement of the relevant caretaker period. 


This approach strikes a balance between the efficient and effective delivery of the report within the statutory timeframe and ensuring that the vast bulk of election commitments across the political spectrum are exposed to rigorous scrutiny. 




Due p
rocess 



Of course, for reasons of due process, it is important that political parties have a chance to review the PBO’s assessment of their election commitments. 


This is needed to ensure that the policies of these parties are fairly and fully considered in the PBO’s report. 


To achieve this, the bill includes a requirement for the PBO to consult with the political parties regarding their respective election commitments. 




Taxpayer 
i
nformation 



Finally, this bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to provide confidential taxpayer data to the PBO for the purposes of the PBO’s carrying out its statutory functions. 


This will allow the PBO’s work to be more accurate, complete and fully informed. 


As with all exceptions to the taxpayer confidentiality provisions, the information provided to the PBO must be kept confidential and be used only for the strict purposes provided for in the enabling legislation. 




Conclusion 



The PBO has performed exceptionally well in the short time since its establishment and has taken up an important place in Australia’s fiscal policy framework. 


I know that many members and senators have taken advantage of the PBO’s services. 


This bill makes the PBO all the more important by making it an independent assessor of the fiscal responsibility of political parties at election time. 


This will impose necessary discipline on the costly promises often made in the lead up to and during election campaigns, which will be particularly important in this election year. 


This will ensure that our public debate is informed by properly costed and properly funded policies, and that our focus is on the policies that will make Australia, stronger, smarter and fairer.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:35):  by leave—I wish to update the House on the first interim report to the Attorney-General and the Minister of Defence by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce.




Introduction



The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on its response to allegations of sexual or other forms of abuse in defence, including to the parliament.


On 26 November last year I also announced the government’s response to the report of the DLA Piper review into allegations of sexual or other forms of abuse in defence.


Today I will provide an update on the government’s response to the DLA Piper review.




DLA Piper Review



The DLA Piper review into allegations of sexual or other forms of abuse in defence received allegations from over 1,000 people.


The review identified a range of allegations from 775 people which fell within the review’s terms of reference, the overwhelming majority of which are said to be plausible allegations of abuse.


These involve allegations across every decade from the 1950s. The earliest date of alleged abuse is 1951.


The government’s response to the review has been guided by the recommendations in the review and will ensure that people who have alleged past abuse in Defence receive a response which is tailored to their individual circumstances and the nature of their experiences. The response includes:


A historic general apology to members of the Australian Defence Force or Defence employees who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse in the course of their employment.


The establishment of an independent task force to assess the individual complaints and any wider systemic issues to be headed by the Honourable Len Roberts-Smith QC.


access to a capped compensation or reparation scheme; and


a free telephone hotline so that complainants can access information about the government’s response.




Apology



On 26 November last year, I delivered in this House an historic general apology to members of the Australian Defence Force or Defence employees who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse in the course of their employment. In my apology, I said that the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, past, currently serving and future, are entitled to be and deserve to be treated with the highest standards of admiration and respect. To those men and women in the Australian Defence Force or the Department of Defence who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse, on behalf of the government I said sorry.


On the same day, the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, also made an apology to those who have suffered sexual, physical or mental abuse while serving in the ADF.




Independent 
t
ask
 f
orce



The independent Defence Abuse Response Taskforce has responsibility for liaising with those who have made allegations of abuse to determine an appropriate response in individual allegations, which can include:


restorative justice or conciliation processes where a victim and alleged perpetrator are brought together in a facilitated process;


referral to counselling (with the task force being funded to provide counselling services beyond those generally available to Defence personnel or veterans) and health and other existing services;


reparation to a maximum of $50,000;


referral of appropriate matters to police for formal criminal investigation and assessment for prosecution; and


referral of appropriate matters for disposition by the military justice system or other Defence processes (for example, considered under the Public Service Act).


All communications made to DLA Piper, including those that were assessed as outside the scope of the review or were referred to an external body, are intended to be reassessed by the task force. The task force will also assess new allegations and complaints received since its establishment where those allegations refer to abuse that is alleged to have occurred prior to 11 April 2011.


Today, I table the task force’s first interim report to me and the Attorney-General.




Task


force 
f
irst 
interim r
eport



The task force is comprised of a leadership group appointed by the Attorney-General and me and staff who have been engaged by the task force since its establishment. The leadership group chair, the Honourable Len Roberts-Smith QC is assisted in his role by three other leadership group members: the deputy chair, Robert Cornall; member consultant, Susan Halliday; and ex-officio member, Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Rudi Lammers. I am very pleased to acknowledge the presence in the advisers box of the chair of the leadership group and the task force, Len Roberts-Smith QC.


The number of cases before the task force is building steadily. In addition to the more than 1,000 DLA Piper cases, the taskforce is receiving approximately 15 new matters per week through the hotline. The task force is now preparing its transition into its operational phase, in which the assessment of allegations and complaints will be considered in accordance with the task force’s protocols. In its operational phase, the task force will consider whether the matter is:


appropriate to be considered and assessed under the task force terms of reference;


suitable for referral to existing counselling services should the complainant need additional counselling;


suitable for consideration under the Defence Abuse Reparation Payment Scheme;


suitable for restorative justice or conciliation processes, including apologies from appropriate Defence officers;


suitable to be referred to police for assessment and possible formal criminal investigation and prosecution;


suitable to be referred for disposition by the military justice system or other Defence processes;


suitable to be referred to another external entity, such as the Defence Force Ombudsman; or


in a category of allegations that merits further inquiry by a royal commission.




Systemic issues



All information assessed and analysed will be considered to ascertain whether there are any implications for Defence in the work it is undertaking in its Pathway to Change or arising from other cultural reviews. This includes any systematic issues identified in the DLA Piper review report, which has been provided to the task force for consideration and advice to me.


In accordance with its terms of reference, the task force will bring any such matters to the attention of the Minister for Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force, and the Secretary of the Department of Defence to ensure Pathway to Change addresses, or is updated to address, the concerns of systemic issues.


The task force is expressly considering if further investigation through a royal commission is required into particular matters identified in the report of the DLA Piper review, in particular in relation to ADFA, as previously outlined, and in relation to alleged events at HMAS Leeuwin in the 1960s and 1970s.


Based on an analysis of the material currently available to it about the events which are alleged to have taken place at HMAS Leeuwin in the 1960s and 1970s, the task force has noted that:


there is a consistency between material available on the public record regarding events at HMAS Leeuwin in the 1960s and 1970s and the substance of the individual complaints made to the task force;


it appears that bullying and violence of a widespread and serious nature occurred at HMAS Leeuwin during the 1960s and 1970s;


much of the alleged bullying and violence appears to have been unreported; and


many of those who allege that they suffered abuse at HMAS Leeuwin during this time period also describe significant detrimental long-term impacts such as post-traumatic stress disorder or serious depression, which they attribute to their experiences at HMAS Leeuwin.




Reparation 
s
cheme



The government has today announced that it has approved the operation of the Defence Abuse Reparation Payment Scheme. The purpose of the Defence Abuse Reparation Payment Scheme is to recognise that abuse in Defence is unacceptable and wrong. Individuals who suffered sexual or other forms of abuse in Defence should be afforded some form of financial reparation as part of a broader acknowledgment that such abuse should never have occurred. Recognition will be made in the form of a reparation payment to persons who have made plausible allegations of being subjected to sexual or other forms of abuse in Defence. The scheme also seeks to recognise individuals who reported abuse and whose cases were then mishandled by Defence management.


Reparation payments are not intended as compensation per se. They are a way of enabling people to move forward. Payments to individuals will be capped at $50,000, with the amount provided to each complainant determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the individual circumstances of each case. The making of a reparation payment to a person under the scheme is not intended to affect the statutory, common law or other legal rights of the person. However, a court or tribunal may, if it sees fit, take the making of a reparation payment into account in assessing the amount of any damages or compensation otherwise payable to a person under the common law or a Commonwealth, state or territory statute.




Period of operation



The task force was originally intended to operate for a year until December of this year and at its conclusion report to parliament through the Minister for Defence. However, I have received advice from the task force chair that he considers an extension of this deadline is necessary as there is no realistic prospect the work required by the terms of reference could be completed within the present 12-month timetable, noting the substantial workload before it and the large number of new cases. The Attorney-General and I have therefore agreed to his request that the duration of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce be extended from 12 to 18 months. The task force is now due to complete its work at the end of May 2014.


The Attorney-General and I also agree that the cut-off for the task force accepting new allegations of abuse that are alleged to have occurred prior to 11 April 2011 will be 31 May this year, giving the task force a full year in which to assess those allegations and conclude its work. This announcement will ensure that people who have experienced abuse prior to 11 April 2011 but who have not yet brought their case forward have the time to consider doing so.




Parliamentary 
o
versight



The serious nature of the matters being considered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce requires the highest level of oversight. This is why I support parliamentary oversight in the ongoing management of these matters. This has already commenced with the establishment of the Senate Standing Committees on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into the report of the review of allegations of sexual and other abuse in Defence, conducted by DLA Piper, and the response of the government to the review.


Today, that committee will hold hearings at which the Chair of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, Mr Len Roberts-Smith QC, the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force will appear. I propose to discuss with members of the committee how parliamentary oversight of the management of allegations of abuse in Defence and parliamentary oversight of implementation of cultural change measures in Defence can be effected. This parliamentary oversight will be in addition to the first annual report to the Parliament on Defence’s implementation of the cultural reform program, which as previously indicated I propose to put forward in the House before the end of June.


I table a copy of the first interim report to the Attorney-General and Minister for Defence by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce in conjunction with my ministerial statement. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for 12 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr STEPHEN SMITH:
  I move: 


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Robert speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 12 minutes.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:48):  First let me thank the minister for continuing to keep the parliament and the nation up to date on this important issue. I join the minister in acknowledging the chair of the organisation overseeing this, the Hon. Len Roberts-Smith RFD QC, and his senior leadership executive.


I reiterate the coalition's strong and complete bipartisan support for what is occurring to address the issues of the past. We are satisfied that we have been kept informed. We are satisfied that the processes and procedures that have been put in place are appropriate and are working to the fullest extent possible. I note the issues raised on access to documentation. I also note the work that has been done to overcome these. I, like everyone in this place, would fully expect DLA Piper to cooperate, and I am sure that will be the case going forward.


It is also our very strong expectation that the Department of Defence will make every resource and every document available to the group providing the oversight and will provide assistance to that task force so they can discharge their duty. I note the overwhelming support for the senior leadership team within Defence from the minister through to the CDF, the secretary and down. But it is important to note that the coalition will not tolerate any departmental obfuscation. Everything must be made fully available to the task force upon request without delay.


I think we all acknowledge that it is important the task force be able to operate completely and utterly unencumbered, as much to expedite the process as to ensure that those who were failed in the past receive the recognition and reparations they are entitled to. We may well be beholden to our past, but it is now our responsibility to ensure the wrongs inflicted on those fine men and women of the ADF over the last six decades are addressed and, importantly, that those egregious acts and wrongs are addressed to the satisfaction of those aggrieved, whether through counselling, reparation payments, apologies, restorative justice or all of the above. To that extent, the coalition is extremely satisfied with the process being undertaken by the task force.


In terms of the initiatives, we welcome the free hotline service that has provided an avenue to many who previously did not know there was a place to turn to have issues addressed. The coalition fully supports the minister in his decision to extend the time frame in which the task force can operate from 12 months to 18 months to enable the task force to work through until May 2014. We also put on record that if the task force requires extra time it should, of course, be given to it.


We also fully support the extension necessary for the task force to completely address and assess claims made, but we also support the idea that there needs to be a finite time for potential claimants to actually lodge their claims. The minister has stated that allegations of abuse that occurred prior to April 2011 must be made by 31 May this year. We agree with the minister that this is a sensible measure that will allow the task force the time they need to ensure everything is appropriately addressed. Importantly, it gives those aggrieved time to decide whether or not they wish to make a formal allegation to the task force. That gives eight or nine weeks for the Australian people to consider their position, and that is appropriate. I note, Minister, from our discussion yesterday, that you will be looking for some degree of advertising to ensure that as many people as possible are aware of the time frame and the time required to lodge a claim, and again you receive the coalition's strong support.


Minister, thank you for your update to the House on this very important measure. Thank you for providing the necessary parliamentary oversight. I believe that the Senate committee is meeting today and the chair of the task force will be addressing the Senate committee to provide that necessary parliamentary oversight. The key thing is that we move forward—that we move forward with grace, that we move forward with determination to right the wrongs of the past and to set a new standard. I believe that the Pathway to change document that the CDF and the senior leadership team have embarked on is addressing that adequately.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (09:53):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Having a safe, efficient and well-functioning insurance market is vital for all Australians. Insurance enables people and organisations to participate in social and economic activities that they otherwise would not be able to engage in, as they are able to price and transfer risks associated with those activities and with other aspects of their lives.


The important role that insurance plays in Australian society has become even more evident in the past few years with the devastating impact of natural disasters on so many lives.


In recognising the critical role insurance plays and the impact that insurance has on families and businesses the government has taken and continues to take a number of steps to improve the insurance market in Australia.


In this regard, on 23 November 2011 the government introduced the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 into parliament. The bill received royal assent on 15 April 2012. The 2012 act introduced the framework for a standard definition of flood for home building, home contents, small business and strata title body corporate insurance contracts and for the provision of a key facts sheet for home building and home contents insurance policies.


During 2012, regulations to give effect to these two measures were made and I am pleased to say that a significant number of insurers have adopted the standard definition early. This measure in particular ensures that Australians can rely on a common understanding of what flood actually means in these type of insurance contracts.


This bill, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013, is yet another example of how the Gillard government is improving the insurance market in Australia. The law governing contracts of insurance has a direct influence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the insurance market.


This bill has been developed over a long period. Its history began back in September 2003, when a review panel comprising Mr Alan Cameron AM and Ms Nancy Milne was established to embark on a comprehensive review of the act.


The review panel’s final report was released in 2004. The report noted that the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, which is the primary source of laws regulating the rights and obligations of insurers, insureds and relevant third parties, had generally been operating satisfactorily to the benefit of insurers and insureds. However, the review panel found that some changes would be beneficial given the passage of time from the act's original enactment. Consequently, the review panel made some recommendations to give effect to the beneficial changes that they had identified in the review. The review panel also recommended that further consultations should be undertaken on the details of any proposed amendments to give effect to their recommendations.


In 2010 after extended consultation with industry and consumer groups, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2010 was introduced into parliament. While the 2010 bill passed the House of Representatives, due to the calling of the 2010 federal election the bill lapsed. 


On the government’s return, it was decided that it was appropriate to consult further with key stakeholders to ensure that the amendments to the act struck an appropriate balance between providing certainty for insurers and ensuring that insureds are able to obtain appropriate outcomes under the act. Through this engagement, some additional refinements have been made to the proposed amendments to the act. These refinements further add to the beneficial nature of the amendments to the act. 


The government appreciates the constructive and thoughtful way that consumer representatives and industry have worked closely together throughout the development of the amendments to the act. 


The bill includes measures that will:


remove impediments to the use of electronic communication for statutory notices and documents;


make the duty of disclosure easier for consumers to understand and comply with, especially at renewal of household/domestic insurance contracts; 


make the remedies in respect of life insurance contracts more flexible and suited to modern life insurance products; 


clarify the rights and obligations of persons named in contracts as having the benefit of cover, but who are not parties themselves; and


clarify what types of contracts are exempt from its operation.


Although many of the amendments are technical adjustments to the act rather than significant changes to the framework of the act, as a package they will operate to streamline and clarify requirements while maintaining appropriate consumer protections.


The government is also in the process of developing draft legislation to extend the unfair contract terms laws to general insurance. This will ensure that the protections against unfair contract terms that are enshrined in Australia's consumer protection legislation will also apply to general insurance contracts, which have until now been excluded.


In conclusion, this bill is yet another significant step made by the Gillard government in improving the insurance market in Australia. This bill provides for a package of improvements and efficiencies to how the act operates, while maintaining the right balance that the act aims to strike between the interests of insurers, insureds and the wider public. This bill will help ensure a better functioning, more efficient insurance market that will ultimately benefit the entire Australian community.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (12:24):  It is rare for us to oppose a bill such as this, the Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013, because it is meant to be a matter that goes to the integrity of the tax system. However, if we were to be in a position where we could witness the dying days of the Whitlam government prior to its dismissal, but without the dismissal, then we would be witnessing it now because this government is lurching from announcement to announcement, completely disregarding process along the way. It is a real test for the Independents as to whether they are going to agree to a process where Australians face a more aggressive and empowered Taxation Office without having any public hearing into the Taxation Office or holding any public servant to account for the additional powers that are going to be given to them by this parliament. I find it extraordinary. I do not know what the government's motivation is—I seriously do not. 


The House Standing Committee on Economics was not afforded the opportunity to have a public hearing into this legislation. The government used its own numbers on the committee, including the vote of the now independent member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, to prevent a feasible hearing date from being set. I thought, when the deal was done between the Independents and the  Labor Party, that we were going to have this grand era of transparency and accountability, that the sunshine was going to come in, so that everyone could see what was happening in the bowels of this chamber and in the bowels of this parliament. Yet the government—I suppose the Independents will vote with this; I would hope they do not, but I suppose they will—will try to roll this massive additional power for the tax office through the parliament without any scrutiny, treating the House of Representatives with utter contempt. 


If the government and the Independents choose to do that, so be it. But, if there is a change of government, let's not have them come whingeing to us about the treatment they may get in the future or have them lecture us about how the parliament was treated in the past. I do not want to hear them whinge about it—because this will be one of the signature examples used. I am not really interested in the denial of democracy by the Labor Party, because it is a consistent theme, but denying a parliamentary committee from simply having a hearing on what was previously a noncontroversial bill makes it a controversial bill. 


So the coalition are going to oppose this bill and we call on the Independents to join with us in opposing this bill until such time as this House has the opportunity to see whether there is justification for the Australian Taxation Office to have a massive increase in its powers and to see how the Australian Taxation Office justifies claiming that, with these additional powers, it will achieve a billion dollars of extra revenue. A billion dollars of extra revenue: that is what they are claiming. 'No problem. Give us these extra enormous powers and don't worry; we'll claim an extra billion dollars of revenue.'


With all the integrity measures over previous years, where did that revenue come from? You ask for a tightening up of this law, you ask for new prosecutorial powers, you ask for all this additional influence, so prove to us—whether it was under the Liberal Party or under Labor—that with the additional powers you actually did improve the integrity of the system and increase revenue.


Schedule 1 to the bill seeks to amend the general anti-avoidance provisions in the 1936 Income Tax Act—provisions that are commonly referred to as part IVA. Former Treasurer John Howard was responsible for inserting part IVA into the tax act. Part IVA applied to schemes that were entered into after 27 May 1981. When introducing part IVA, John Howard said:


The proposed provisions seek to give effect to a policy that such measures ought to strike down blatant, artificial or contrived arrangements, but not cast unnecessary inhibitions on normal commercial transactions by which taxpayers legitimately take advantage of opportunities available for the arrangement of their affairs.


In 2000, when introducing the GST, the coalition included division 165 in the legislation, a general anti-avoidance rule. Division 165 resembles part IVA in many aspects, although of course it is dealing with a transaction based tax, rather than a tax on a profit or income earned over a period. 


We have consistently demonstrated that we are firmly opposed to tax avoidance behaviour. We firmly support the need for a strong set of provisions that deter abusive tax arrangements. The legislature—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  If the Assistant Treasurer wants to intervene again, he can get up here and explain how his good mate Eddie Obeid got away with shuffling money between trusts. Is that what you want to do, keep interrupting me, Sunshine? We know how close you were to Eddie Obeid.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Cheeseman
):  Order! If the member for North Sydney has imputations of the nature that he has just made that he wishes to make, there is an appropriate avenue available to him under the standing orders. He should use that.




Mr HOCKEY:
  It is okay, mate. If you give me a lecture across the table on integrity, I will give you a lecture about your relationship with Eddie Obeid. We must not countenance a change—




Mr Bradbury:
  I rise on a point of order on relevance.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The matter being raised is of no relevance to the debate. I draw your attention to the fact that the bill that we have before us relates to countering tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting. The member should direct his attention and his comments to that.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  On that point of order, there was no real point of order raised by the minister across the table. The fact of the matter is that this bill is about tax avoidance and Mr Obeid is involved in some of those issues. It is very relevant.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I believe that these matters are before relevant tribunals. I will get advice from the clerk as to whether these matters ought to be left before those tribunals as opposed to being raised in this chamber. I have sought advice from the clerk. It is my intention to ask all members participating in this debate to remain relevant to the particular bill before us. If we could have cooperation on that, that would be appreciated.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I would ask you, Deputy Speaker, to support me in that regard. We are focused on the concerns expressed by a number of individuals and corporations about whether the ATO is properly using its powers in relation to deterring abusive tax arrangements. In the Australian Financial Review this year, an article said that draft change to part IVA, on which the amendments in this bill are closely based, would 'determine whether a company is guilty of avoiding tax by looking at how else it could have done a deal if tax implications were not considered'. There is an extraordinarily large disconnect between the way in which business is properly conducted and the way in which the government, the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office would require business to be conducted.


To taxpayers, profit after tax is a crucial metric. Suggesting otherwise introduces a sense of artificiality, even unreality. This point was made by the Corporate Tax Association, which said:


The reality is that business and individuals operate in an after-tax world, and from a practical and corporate governance perspective, it would be highly problematical to ask board members to put their minds to what the company would have done in the highly artificial world where tax is assumed not to matter.


Similarly, the Law Council of Australia observed 'Ordinary taxpayers, small business and large corporations will be required to assess their tax obligations by reference to the tax which would have been paid if they had done something that in reality they never would have done.' This bill is going to overlay complexity and compliance costs onto normal commercial transactions, whether business transactions, new investments or corporate restructures.


We really must start this debate by asking whether these amendments are required at all. Submissions to the Economics Committee from pre-eminent professional and industry groups whose members have deep expertise in taxation law argue that these amendments are just not necessary. For example, the Corporate Tax Association states:


… we have consistently maintained that the proposed changes represent an over-reaction to the Taxation Office losing a number of court decisions that have quite limited application.


CPA Australia made a related submission:


… we believe that the proposed amendments to Part IVA contained in Schedule 1 of the Bill are confusing and deficient and do not result in an anti-avoidance regime which is comprehensible to tax practitioners let alone the broader community.


From the Tax Institute:


The Courts have applied the current rules appropriately to find that a tax benefit exists in only those cases where the taxpayer's actions have resulted in a loss to revenue. Recent cases have not resulted in the effectiveness of Part IVA being compromised and as such the amendments in the Bill are an unnecessary overreaction.


I repeat: an unnecessary overreaction. More red tape for business—when is it ever going to stop? More compliance costs for business—when is it ever going to stop? I only wish the Labor Party would have the same tough structure for itself that it is trying to apply to people who work hard and earn a buck—the same corporate government procedure in itself and within the Labor Party, particularly New South Wales and particularly the New South Wales Right. I wish they would do that instead of just applying to everyone else a higher standard than they are prepared to apply to themselves.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Whilst the member for North Sydney is making some devastating points, which I would probably agree with in another forum, I fail to see how they are relevant to the legislation before the chair. I would be quite happy to join with the member for North Sydney in this discussion somewhere else, but not on this legislation before this parliament at this point in time.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Cheeseman
):  Order! I would ask the member for North Sydney to remain relevant to the bill.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I do wonder how Treasury determined that schedule 1 to this bill 'is expected to prevent the loss of over $1 billion a year'. It is a nice round number: a billion dollars. It has a whiff of convenience to it, don't you think? We were of course denied an opportunity to ask Treasury officials for an explanation. The government controlled committee did not hold a hearing. The Treasury later put in an undated submission just before the bill came into this place. So it looks as though a government that does not want to be held to public hearings in relation to one of its bills has something to hide. They are doing it on the media, they are doing it on so many things, just like in the dying days of the Whitlam government. It is just a repeat. Everything has a political agenda.


I welcome integrity measures, especially when it comes to taxation. The fact that they do not want to have hearings suggests to me that there is another agenda. The coalition will vigorously pursue these matters in the Senate committee inquiry into the bill. So we are going to try in the Senate, and if the Greens are true to their word they will support a full inquiry in the Senate.


Building up the jurisprudence around fundamental parts of a taxation system can take many years. It was 13 years before the High Court delivered its first judgement on part IVA, in the Peabody case. If the amendments to be made by schedule 1 are passed then there will be a period, probably extending over a number of years, before there is a settled judicial view as to their correct application. Uncertainty is the enemy of investor confidence, of business confidence and of consumer confidence.


Even for the experts these amendments are not easy to interpret, and their application is not predictable. Last year the Inspector General of Taxation reviewed the ATO's management of litigation and found that the ATO's success rate before the courts was 56 per cent in 2009-10, 47 per cent the year after and 45 per cent to May the year after that.


The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit also had questions for the ATO regarding their litigation success rate—that is, the actual litigation. I do not think that includes all the assessments the ATO issues and then intimidates people into settling. The commissioner acknowledged—the previous commissioner, I would imagine—to the JCPAA that the ATO success rate was still very positive in terms of numbers. But he had concerns about the court's approach to the general anti-avoidance provisions. So it was all the fault of the courts.


The inspector general went on to note that some industry stakeholders held the view that the reason for the ATO's losses on general anti-avoidance-rule cases may be due to the ATO's poor case selection of matters they considered appropriate to litigate. Stakeholders also informed the inspector general that they had concerns about whether officers internal to the organisation could objectively review the facts and evidence in a case to determine, independently of the compliance section, whether the matter should be settled, defended or appealed.


This is a matter that I have raised on previous occasions, and I sense that a lack of objectivity in decision making inside the ATO is starting to have a significant impact on tax policy. The poor decisions about which cases to litigate, which have led to losses in court, are now driving the government's legislative agenda. And unfortunately there will be a cost imposed on a large number of taxpayers who must comply with a new general anti-avoidance rule.


I cannot fathom how the Treasurer can possibly justify the statement in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that the compliance-cost impact of the amendment will be low. Where do they get this from? The Law Council do not agree. They see the schedule as thrusting additional costs onto taxpayers—red tape:


The consequence of legislating this Bill will be to create significant difficulties, for ordinary taxpayers, small businesses and large corporations (both Australian and foreign) in understanding their tax obligations.


Who says it is low? On what basis do they say that the regulatory impact is low? Who writes this? And where is their accountability? How much have they consulted with businesses big and small, who are drowning under red tape? Yet the suggestion is that the regulatory impact is low.


Justice Pagone of the Supreme Court of Victoria, an author of a leading work about part IVA, has explained how onerous a new approach to the general anti-avoidance rule would be for taxpayers, since the onus of proof rests on them:


The question about what needs to be established arises in the context of the legal burden of proof falling upon the taxpayer to disprove what would have happened or might reasonably have been expected if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out. …


The ability of the Commissioner to rely upon something which did not happen, would not have happened, but which nonetheless might reasonably be expected to happen, may be difficult for taxpayers to disprove.


Do you reckon? Does the Assistant Treasurer understand this legislation? Can he get his mind around it? This is saying that business needs to start to model every alternative use, every alternative tax scenario, before it actually goes down this path—don't just get on with the job of doing your business but consider this impact on your business if you went down a different path, and prepare yourself. And the advice is that the regulatory impact is low.


Finally, the amendments' proposed starting date of 16 November 2012 must be changed. Where did they get 16 November from? This bill is different from the draft version that was released on 16 November last year. The changes made by the bill should not begin before royal assent. This is typical of Labor. They want to regulate yesterday; they introduce the bill now. And they say, 'All this is applying.' What is applying? 'Oh, well, the bill.' What bill? We haven't got a bill. It is like media; the process is no different. You guys are a shambles. But the problem is that the taxpayers are paying the price. This is not the way to govern a country; it is just not. How could anyone plan anything on a bill that has not been passed, has not even been debated and yet is meant to apply from 16 November last year?


I do not know what is going on here. If there is a change of government in September, the mountain of hard work will just get higher and higher to try and get back some certainty, stability and predictability into government. For crying out loud! I have never seen anything like it. I said that this is like the dying days of the Whitlam government. If Gough Whitlam had not been sacked, this is what it would have looked like—exactly this: a shemozzle appealing to every union official; a shemozzle all about protecting the leader. There is no good policy here. It is bad policy. What is more, it is incompetent and malicious.


Schedule 2 of this bill inserts new subdivisions into the Income Tax Assessment Act as well as the Tax Administration Act that the government says will modernise transfer pricing rules. Our transfer pricing rules have been rarely amended and they have largely stood the test of time. Last year, the government sought to make retrospective changes to the transfer pricing law that took effect from 1 July 2004. Typical. The bill sought to retrospectively amend legislation to include transfer pricing articles within Australian tax treaties. It also sought to clarify the interaction between transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules, which had previously only been dealt with through administrative arrangements.


The coalition opposes retrospective tax changes as a matter of principle. That is why we oppose the bill. How can anyone get on with the job of living their daily life, complying with the law as it stands, when along will come Labor in the future to introduce laws that say they broke the law today? That is why the Liberal Party is, in principle, always going to oppose retrospective changes. We understand that retrospective legislation can change the substance of transactions struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law at the time of the agreement. It can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances in which taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at the earlier time to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. It may change a taxpayer's tax profile, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and, of course, the pricing of those decisions.


Most importantly, the retrospective application of the change will heighten Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. 'We have trashed everything else so let's give sovereign risk a go,' says Labor. At the time, the government refused to answer questions around the quantity of revenue at stake. It was only after questioning at Senate budget estimates last year and a subsequent response to a question on notice that the ATO advised that there was $1.9 billion of primary tax in dispute in relation to transfer pricing issues for audits current at the time.


We find ourselves in a very similar position today. We have a bill before the House dealing with significant changes to important legislation that has not been given due process in this parliament and has not been given proper scrutiny. But Labor wants to ram it through. It does not have any regard or respect for taxpayers. That is why we are going to pursue it in the Senate.


The bill before the House seeks to replace the existing transfer pricing rules in division 13 by inserting these into three subdivisions in the Income Tax Act 1997—companies, branches of companies, and trusts and partnerships. It also inserts a subdivision into the Tax Administration Act in relation to record keeping and penalties that may be applied by the commissioner. The amendments within this schedule align with the internationally consistent transfer pricing approaches as set out by the OECD. These amendments apply to both tax treaty and non tax treaty cases. These amendments also contain specific rules relating to transfer pricing documentation.


These new rules are self-executing—that is, taxpayers will now apply the new transfer pricing laws on a self-assessment basis. The commissioner may challenge a taxpayer's calculated tax result, to which the taxpayer may then respond. To the extent that taxpayers may apply these complex rules when they did not previously, an increase in compliance costs is likely.


The complex and costly compliance rules impose a much greater requirement to keep contemporaneous documentation on small and medium business impacted by the de minimis thresholds that apply to the bill—more red tape. The de minimis threshold at which entities need to apply these complex and costly compliance rules at face value appear to be too low relative to the revenue risk. My colleague the member for Dunkley has raised this issue as well. I am not sure if he is speaking on this bill.




Mr Billson:
  I am.




Mr HOCKEY:
  There is no-one in the Labor Party who has ever worked in a small business, is there?




Mr Billson:
  No-one.




Mr HOCKEY:
  And they have had quite a few small business ministers in the last five years.




Mr Billson:
  Five.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Five small business ministers in five years.




Mr Billson:
  Four in the last 15 months.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Labor has had four small business ministers in the last 15 months.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  I rise on a point of order. While like any member here I enjoy banter between the member for North Sydney and the member for Dunkley, I would ask you to direct the speaker to make his contributions through the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask that the minister direct his comments through the chair and ask him to remain relevant.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am directing my comments through the chair and I am directly relevant. That is why I just talked about the red tape impact on small business. I cannot see how that is not relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am mindful of the fact that the government has made such a mess of this bill and maybe one of the reasons is that it has had five small business ministers in five years and four small business ministers in the last 15 months. That might be related to the fact that hardly anyone in the parliamentary Labor Party has ever worked in small business—hardly anyone. Has anyone in the Labor Party worked in small business? I cannot hear a word. No. They would not know what the red tape burden is. I can tell you what the red tape burden is: it costs money; it costs jobs. Many submissions to the House economics committee inquiry argued that the de minimis threshold should be raised and that doing so would not put revenue at risk. It would result in large savings in compliance cost and reduce complexity, especially for small- to medium-sized enterprises.


We are just asking why the government is so committed to this bill. Why is it so rushed? We are concerned that the design and drafting of this schedule may have been rushed. It requires further testing. That is consistent with the submissions from the Corporate Tax Association, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and the Tax Institute. For example, on page 7 of its submission to the committee, the Tax Institute said: 'We are concerned that the bill as currently drafted would not yield many of the lauded simplicity and certainty benefits and will increase the compliance burden, especially and disproportionately on small to medium enterprises.' Is anyone listening? These are submissions that are saying that this will mean more red tape for small- and medium-sized business and that you have got it wrong.


We find it difficult to fathom how the financial impact of this schedule is estimated at zero extra tax dollars per year whereas the financial impact of schedule 1, relating to general anti-avoidance provisions, is expected to prevent the loss of over a billion dollars per year. Where does that number come from? It has been plucked out of the air. We have an impressive record in relation to tax simplification. We have an impressive record in relation to tax reduction. But it is the Labor Party that is introducing bills while refusing to facilitate proper scrutiny, and they just keep getting it wrong: exhibit A, the mining tax; exhibit B, the carbon tax; exhibit C, the 27 new or increased taxes Labor has introduced. We will oppose this bill because it is bad legislation and the format in the House is a disaster.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:54):  The role of government is to provide security and services that are needed by the citizens of the country. It is the responsibility of citizens, including corporate citizens, to make a contribution to the provision of those services. Over the last several decades we have seen an increase in demand for local, state and federal governments to provide more services and new areas of services such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which every speaker on the legislation in this House has stood up and said they applaud. They said that this Labor government initiative is an important initiative, but they have all expressed concerns about the capacity of successive governments to foot the bill for this to provide education, research and development, and infrastructure and also meet the increasing costs of traditional services in the area of health. Indeed, we have had a raging debate on the funding of health services in this country. It is known that the system we have had in place until recently is unsustainable because the significant increase in health funding costs will far outweigh—in fact, they will swamp—the capacity of any state or territory government to meet those costs under pre-existing arrangements.


So, what we know is that we have to get the revenue side of things right. If the public's demand for the provision of these services remains unabated, we need to get the revenue side of things right. We also need to ensure that we do it in a way that creates the right environment for businesses to invest. And I note that the member for North Sydney, the man who wants to be Treasurer of this country, in his devastating contribution to this debate, dragged out the old chestnut of sovereign risk. What he should have done before raising issues of concern about sovereign risk is pick up a copy of the 2013 World Bank report. These are the sorts of reports one should be looking at in relation to business confidence about investing in this country—the reports of authoritative institutions, such as the 2013 World Bank report on the best countries to do business in. You will note, Mr Deputy Speaker Cheeseman, because I know you are on top of this issue, that the World Bank, in its 2013 report, rated Australia as in the top 10 countries to do business in, out of 185 countries. So, when they wheel out this nonsense week after week about sovereign risk, the only ones who are listening are the Liberal Party cheer squad—certainly not the authoritative reporters on this matter such as the World Bank.


These bills are aimed at ensuring that we close down tax loopholes, and there are two schedules aimed at doing that. It is not surprising—and I make no criticism whatsoever—that there are those organisations who see this as a threat to their tax avoidance mechanisms and regimes. It is quite natural that if an organisation or an individual has profited by minimising their tax through tax avoidance schemes they are going to make a bit of noise when the government and the parliament see it fit to try to close down some of these avoidance mechanisms. That is normal. They will make some noise, they will make some complaints—there is nothing abnormal about that. But it is abnormal to have the man who would be Treasurer of this country, the man dealing with his own fiscal problems at the moment—a $70 billion black hole in his budget costings—get up in this parliament, not five minutes ago, to defend those rules. That is abnormal. You would think that a man who has some fiscal problems of his own would want to look at each and every measure he could to try to close some of these tax loopholes.


Schedule 1 of the bill is aimed at closing those tax loopholes that have been addressed by the minister. Schedule 2, which I would like to address in some detail, goes to transfer pricing. But before I do that I want to address some of the points that the member for North Sydney raised in his devastating address. The crux of his contribution to this debate is that there has not been any consultation and somehow this legislation would have been improved by a public hearing. I want to address both of these issues. First, on the issue of consultation, particularly as it goes to schedule 2 of this bill, there has been extensive consultation on those matters. A discussion paper was released in November 2011. That is nearly 18 months ago. There was a series of large stakeholder meetings to discuss the principles that would form the basis of the legislative framework throughout 2012. There was a month of public consultation after that around draft provisions in November 2012. In December 2012 there was an additional large stakeholder meeting to discuss the details of the draft. The bill has benefited significantly from this consultation process.


I sit on the House Standing Committee on Economics, which this bill was referred to for a public inquiry. We set down a date for a public inquiry, 4 March. All the government members were able to make themselves available to hear evidence from concerned members of the public on 4 March. But where was the member for Moncrieff? Where was the member for Higgins? Where was the member for Wright? They were not available. In a devastating criticism, the shadow Treasurer said the government should have had a public inquiry into this bill and that government members of the economics committee should have made themselves available. He should have picked up the phone and talked to the member for Moncrieff, the member for Higgins and the member for Wright. I presume he has their phone numbers. If there is any blame in this, it should be directed to his own members of the economics committee. We were ready, willing and available to hear evidence in a public inquiry but it was his own side that closed it down. They made themselves unavailable.


This contribution from the member for North Sydney was nothing more than a ginormous bubble of fluff. We hear a lot of contributions like this from the member for North Sydney. He should be directing his devastating critique of this bill to members of his own back bench, because if there was not a public inquiry then the blame lies fairly and squarely on the coalition members of the economics committee; that is where the blame lies.


In his 30-minute tirade we heard nothing from the member for North Sydney on the issue of transfer pricing. This is a very important part of this bill. What is transfer pricing? Transfer pricing is where a transnational corporation has operations in one country, in this case Australia, and operations in another country, and they use their global network as a means of minimising tax by transferring costs and profits from one part of their operation, which may have a tax impost on them, to another part of their operation in another country purely for the purpose of avoiding a tax. It became quite famous over the last 12 months.


There was a lot of public debate about transfer pricing when that global IT company that is familiar to all of us in this place, Google—a company that set itself up with the motto 'do no evil'—was exposed as having engaged in extensive transfer-pricing operations to avoid taxation, including avoiding taxation in this country. They quite rightly were rounded on by leaders right around the world saying that a company that is dedicated to 'doing no evil' really wanted to look at some of its corporate practices.


This bill is addressed at cracking down on transfer pricing. Transfer pricing has sometimes been described as something which is just part and parcel of doing business if you are a transnational corporation. Indeed, the global CEO of Google, Mr Eric Schmidt, said on 13 December, 'Transfer pricing is just a part of capitalism.' I reject that and I call on all members in this place to reject that. It may in some countries be legal but it is certainly not moral. It is not a practice that is without victims. In this country, the victims are the taxpayers who are at threat of having to bear a greater burden of the tax take because companies like Google and other large transnational organisations are avoiding tax in this space, avoiding their responsibility to make contributions towards infrastructure and vital services that are needed in any advanced democratic country such as ours. Through their tax avoidance processes they are effectively shifting the burden of taxation onto other taxpayers. In this respect, I would say states and territories are also victims of this—because if there is less money available through corporate taxation arrangements from these transnational corporations then there is less money available for the Commonwealth to disburse to the states and other entities for the provision of health and education services.


But it is not just taxpayers who bear the burden of this and lose out from transfer pricing; it is also some of our domestic companies who are penalised. If they are not a part of a transnational corporation, there is not a level playing field. They are penalised because they do not have access to transfer pricing loopholes. That means they are paying a proper rate of tax while somebody down the road, a transnational corporation, is cheating. They are getting an unfair advantage in a similar market, so you do not have a level playing field. Costs are imposed, but not borne, by the domestic competitors. So they have an interest. There are many, many Australian companies who are going to welcome this legislation because it will go a long way to addressing some of the loopholes that are available to transnational corporations to transfer costs out of this jurisdiction so the domestic companies are bearing a disproportionate burden of the tax take.


It may not be of interest to everybody in this place, but I know that a lot of people also share the concern, not just as citizens of Australia but as global citizens, that transfer pricing arrangements are also used as a way of denuding treasury coffers, typically those of developing nations, of the vital revenue that is needed to ensure that they can build the health systems, education systems, transport systems and all those robust institutions that are needed for a thriving democracy and a thriving economy in developing countries. Where transnational corporations use these sorts of loopholes to avoid those taxes they are harming everybody. This is not a victimless crime. This is something that affects everybody.


So, instead of hearing long-winded, misguided and, in some cases, downright untrue contributions from the shadow Treasurer, these are the sorts of things we would expect members of the opposition to be focusing their attention on. How can we ensure that we have a level playing field for countries paying tax in this country to ensure that we are not disproportionately levying a tax burden upon wage and salary earners and other taxpayers to the advantage of transnational corporations and to the disadvantage of domestic taxpayers who do not have these sorts of loopholes available to them? These are the sorts of things we should be talking about.


If the member for North Sydney is truly aggrieved about the fact that the economics committee did not hold a public inquiry then he should be hauling the member for Higgins, the member for Wright and the member for Moncrieff into his office right now and saying: 'Where were you? I have just come into the House and embarrassed myself by saying there should've been an economics committee public inquiry into this. I have made a complete and utter goose of myself in the parliament by calling for a public inquiry. I've now discovered that the government members of the economics committee were ready, willing and able to have that inquiry and the only reason that it did not occur is that my own backbenchers were not available, were not doing their job, and would not turn up.' They have severely embarrassed the shadow Treasurer—and they are probably delivering their apology to him right now. I would also call on the shadow Treasurer to come to the House and issue an apology to all members on this side of the House for misleading us.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (13:09):  Well, there you have it; there was the defence of this extraordinarily poorly handled legislative process. The member for Throsby has come up with 'the diary defence': the fact that the government has proven itself to be unwilling or incapable of engaging with the many organisations that have made considered and thoughtful submissions on this bill and the fact that it chose one date that did not happen to work for some of the committee members. That's it—the diary defence. It is Labor's only defence to an appalling abuse of parliamentary process, to an uncosted and untested impact on the enterprising Australians who create wealth and opportunity. All we get from the member for Throsby is the diary defence: 'Oh, we would like to have had this conversation, but we chose a date and some people couldn't make it so we abandoned the hearing.' What utter nonsense.


This kind of shambolic, dysfunctional poor excuse for governance that we see under this pathetic Labor government has just been demonstrated writ large here. Here we have substantial changes to tax laws that will impact not just, as the member for Throsby would have you believe, on the evil big end of town involved in all sorts of rorts and the like. This impacts much wider than that. It impacts on SMEs across the country. It is a range of provisions that have not been tested for their justification in terms of the problem they seek to solve, nor for their construct in terms of whether they are effective at all, nor for their calibration. The question is whether this is nothing more than a last-minute election grab for power by a government desperate to look like it is doing something at a time that it presides over the most appalling deterioration in the Commonwealth's finances. It is hard to draw any other conclusion.


I listened carefully and courteously to the member for Throsby. His attack on the very valid points and criticisms and measured remarks of the shadow Treasurer was to say that somehow the coalition is defending rorts. Is everything so base politic to you guys? Does it not matter to you that the public policy formation process should be more inclusive and should value the input of those who live and work with this every day? Or do you just want the headline of the title of this bill? I think that is really what this is about. I do not think government members have turned their mind to any of the actual content of this legislation. No, they are just happy that they have a piece of legislation before the parliament talking about countering tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting and they have not bothered to apprise themselves as to what the actual mechanisms are, or their consequences for enterprises in this country. When will you guys get tired of your constant assault on small business? It is quite remarkable.


I hear a government member interjecting that it is all about multinationals, but perhaps if he could quote himself he might have then recognised the merit of the argument. The submissions provided by tax authorities, by accounting firms and by business advisers one after another pointed to the deficiencies in these provisions as they have been drafted. The fact is that the government has refused to allow an engaging hearing process. The word 'hearing' has as much meaning as question time: you do not get any answers and you do not even get a hearing to be heard and have your concerns addressed and have the arguments weighed against what is being asserted in the documents foisted on this parliament. No, under this Gillard Labor government we do not have that.


It is the same with the government's media reforms. They just jam it through and any tactic will do. And we see this again with this legislation. There have been no opportunities for people who have taken the time to work through this process and engage themselves in this formulation of widely reaching laws. For a start, they just deserve basic courtesies. The Australian business community gets enough of it when the tax office is telling it how it should run its business. It is not that they have done something wrong. It is just a little inconvenient that you are an independent contractor. We insist that you are an employee, because that is easier for us, and we will refuse to give you an ABN because we reckon you are not really an independent contractor. Yet the law is clear. They should apply the law—a novel idea—but no, they have to go the jihad on SMEs.


Here is another example of it. The tax office has not had a great record on some of its cases on anti-avoidance measures. The shadow Treasurer outlined that there is a one-in-two diminishing rate of success. The member for Fraser, having a learned mind, would turn his thinking to just why that success rate is the way it is. Would he immediately think the law is not up to the task or might he actually look at the cases? Might he actually feel that the interpretations being imposed by the tax office are inconsistent with the way the law is drafted? Maybe there was not any anti-avoidance at all. They could have looked at those internal case selections and had some external people look at them, to reality check the cases that they have pursued, rather than self-support each other's assessment within the ATO. If you got a dispassionate assessment of it, then you might get a different outcome. But they say, 'No, we're in and we're going to change the law. Let's change the law.'


This change of the law actually contemplates posing a retrospective tax question: what if this transaction had been done another way? If the tax office want to get into that business, they should go into business and make those judgments. But, in the meantime, they should apply the law—I know that is a novel idea! We have seen how this works in other examples. We saw how this worked under the sober and thoughtful warning of the Inspector-General of Taxation. The member for Fraser might recall that the Inspector-General of Taxation himself was concerned about the way the tax office went about its business.


There was the example of some whistleblowing from a former ATO staff member about formal targets to punch through objections to audit decisions and wave other ones through irrespective of their merits. It was widely reported, but what was of more concern was that late last year the Inspector-General of Taxation's report found that more than 5,800 small businesses had been targeted by the ATO. They were forced into simply paying default tax assessments because they could not afford to fight or correct the ATO's false assertions. There was the institution designed to be fair and consistent in applying the law going after these little guys because they could not push back.


We saw a more of it in MYEFO. Do you know what was extraordinary in MYEFO, Mr Deputy Speaker? I looked through that document to see whether the government would maybe finally get the idea that, after reducing the number of people employed in small business by a quarter of a million over the last five years—despite population growth and your Treasurer saying there has been trend economic growth—there has been a substantial contraction in SMEs. I am hearing all these stories that the information you give only has to be slightly off and the ATO will go after you and how they were so active in insolvencies that they ran out of administrative filing fees and that is why insolvency rates were at record highs.


I looked in MYEFO to see whether there was a little bit of encouragement or support for small businesses. Do you know that the only small-business positive comment in that document was about what the Chinese government was doing to support Chinese small businesses? In MYEFO, the government was comforting itself that the slowdown in the economy in China would not be as great as some had predicted because the Chinese government was doing things to support small business. That was the only positive comment. Do you know what the other mention of small business was in MYEFO? It was the announcement of another $380 million to continue this jihad on small business, knowing that small businesses have no capacity to fight back. The tax office is after you, there is a behemoth in the room and the small businesses—as found by the Inspector-General of Taxation—too often have to pay go-away money.


We see this here in these measures. In schedule 1, under the anti-avoidance provisions, it is quite remarkable because there is a nice round $1 billion dropped on the table. That is what the effect is going to be: a nice, sweet $1 billion. There has been concern raised by any number of eminent organisations, including Certified Practising Accountants Australia, who do terrific analytical, evidence based work on these concerns, the Tax Institute, the Corporate Tax Association of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. All of these organisations have said there are some problems with the way in which these provisions operate, because they assume some alternative theory about commercial transactions that are then imputed into the tax thinking and therefore might produce a different outcome.


That is not to say that someone has been behaving motivated by tax mischief or tax opportunity. This is actually: 'Maybe, we could reconstruct this process and see if the transaction could be executed in another way.' That might spit out a different tax outcome. There might be a perfectly legitimate business justification about why the transaction went the way it did. But does that then leave people open to further action of a retrospective nature under these expanded general anti-avoidance provisions? There are has been no effort to calibrate how they deal with anti-avoidance, but they look all the world like they are just dealing with a poor success rate on litigation.


When these bodies seek to get guidance on that and to interact, as happens in a hearing, on the calibration and justification, they get nowhere. There is no opportunity to do that. It was interesting, wasn't it, that even in that truncated, poor excuse for a committee hearing exercise—which has brought great shame onto this parliament—the Treasury's submission was a belated attachment. It was an afterthought. They tried to get behind the policy justification, which should come out of Treasury, to see how the particular instruments are being advocated and crafted in the interests of the tax office's conduct. There is no chance to have that conversation at all. That is what is the great shame about this process.


You then move onto schedule 2, which was quite interesting. You heard the member for Throsby talking about the evils of transfer pricing and what that can do to the tax take in Australia. Do you know that, in the explanatory memorandum, schedule 2 does not raise a dime? Do you not find it the slightest bit interesting that we have got a nice, round $1 billion figure for anti-avoidance but, when it comes to this horrendous evil and the reaching over to the OECD for their work—and it is all sweet—it does not raise a dime, according to the explanatory memorandum? Doesn't that make an interesting conversation?


So powerful are these provisions that they are getting jammed through the parliament because our tax base is at risk. We hear these erudite presentations from government members about transfer pricing—it is eroding tax bases and impeding developing countries for having doctors—and how it is fantastic, but when you look at the detail it does not raise a dime. So what is it?




Dr Leigh:
  It's protecting revenue.




Mr BILLSON:
  The interjection is that it is protecting revenue. It does not raise a dime, yet so urgent is this potent and powerful measure that the parliament is not afforded the courtesy of a hearing about it. You just have to jam it through. When you look at its impact on small business, submission after submission points to an overriding concern about this legislation creating extraordinary additional compliance costs for taxpayers and also uncertainty about what taxpayers need to do and what they need to do differently to ensure that they are complying with these revised transfer pricing tests.


The government comes in here and talks about the evil of these behemoth multinationals, ignoring the fact that there is no safe harbour for small business. There is no carve-out; there is none of the wisdom reflected in the United Kingdom law. I quote from the ICAA's excellent submission, where they say:


In our view, in a proper balancing of compliance costs against revenue risks, it is essential that some taxpayers are completely carved out of the transfer pricing rules. This is on the basis that below a certain point it is just not cost effective or practical to impose transfer pricing guidelines. The UK has recognised this in its transfer pricing rules which provide that SMEs are exempt from the transfer pricing rules. An SME under this definition is one that has less than 250 employees and either:


turnover of less than €50m; or


assets with a balance sheet total of less than €43m.


We note that this approach of completely carving SME taxpayers out of the transfer pricing rules need not however, prevent the ATO from still being able to gather information—


and use its extraordinary toolkit that is available now—


to address any concerns it has around related party dealings by SMEs.


They make the following point:


… the Institute believes that penalties should not be imposed for any adjustment made under Subdivisions 815-B to 815-E on a SME taxpayer that has made reasonable efforts to comply with the legislation—


should be taken into account. Where has that wise counsel gone? The de minimis thresholds of $10,000 and $20,000 proposed here are far too low to achieve their intended purpose. To go after those behemoths that the government likes to say this is about, why are those thresholds so low? The proposition is to raise the threshold to $5 million to have their intended effect, but then we think, 'This is not supposed to raise a dime.' It is a saviour of budgets. It is the headline the government is after. It is an appalling abuse of parliamentary process and it is just further evidence of this dysfunctional, divided and hopeless government. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (13:24):  A strong tax system is fundamental to driving innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth, because it is only through a strong tax system that we are able to provide the infrastructure that business needs to thrive; it is only through a strong tax system that we are able to fund high-quality education and the research and development we know business depends on. So making sure that we have a strong tax system with good anti-avoidance provisions is a pro-business measure. Those who oppose it—those who say that we ought to have a tax system with loopholes in it—are not pro-business; they are pro-loopholes. They are standing up for those who believe that there ought to be loopholes that those with cunning lawyers can use to avoid paying tax.


This bill puts in place measures that will counter tax avoidance and multinational profit-shifting. It will, as the speaker before me reluctantly acknowledged, protect significant amounts of revenue. Over $1 billion of revenue will be protected by these measures. That is what these measures are about. They are about ensuring that our tax system follows the values that Australians hold dear: the values of equality and fairness; the value of opportunity; the values that say that, just because you can hire the best lawyer in town, you should not be able to get an unfair advantage with our tax code. That is all this bill is about.


If you listen to those opposite, you might think that this bill has been cooked up in a Treasury dungeon somewhere and thrust upon the parliament, but nothing could be further from the truth. Treasury went through a normal public consultation process, as they do with tax reform bills of all types. But beyond that, in the case of this bill, the Assistant Treasurer set up an expert roundtable and Treasury used that expert roundtable extensively. So the views of those affected by these changes have been thoroughly canvassed.


As the member for Throsby acknowledged, there was a willingness on this side of the House to hold a parliamentary inquiry to look into this bill, but when the availability of members was canvassed it was found that, while government members were available in abundance—I cleared the day in my diary—opposition members were nowhere to be seen. So, when the member for Dunkley talks about courtesy, fundamentally the courtesy is of those in the opposition to be willing to attend an inquiry. When we found that there was not a single member of the opposition willing to turn up to this inquiry, we took the view that fundamentally the opposition were not particularly interested in holding a parliamentary inquiry. Had the members for Higgins, Wright and Moncrieff been willing to attend that inquiry, it might well have gone ahead. Had even one of them been willing to attend that inquiry, it might well have gone ahead. But all of them had more pressing concerns.


You would not have known that by listening to the member for North Sydney; you would not have known that from listening to the member for Dunkley. For them, this is just a big story about a government conspiracy. But, when it actually comes to making time to hold a parliamentary inquiry, opposition members were unable to do so. Now they have the temerity to turn up in the parliament and attack the government for failing to hold that inquiry. That is just not good enough. If you cannot make yourself available for a parliamentary inquiry, you forego the right to come into this parliament and claim that that inquiry should have gone ahead.


Let me go to some of the measures before speaking about the context in which they are being implemented. These amendments will maintain the effectiveness of the general anti-avoidance rule to counter tax avoidance. The role of part IVA is exposing the substance or reality of what taxpayers have done to the ordinary operation of the tax law. Taxpayers should not be able to avoid the tax consequences of what they have actually done by arguing that they would have done something completely different or nothing at all. They should not, in colloquial language, be able to have their cake and eat it too. In putting together this bill, with consultation with the public and the expert panel, we received legal advice from senior counsel with expertise in part IVA. So this is a balanced response to address problems without interfering with ordinary commercial activities. That is schedule 1.


Schedule 2 deals with multinational profit shifting. It is about bringing Australia's transfer pricing regime into line with OECD best practice. It is one of the reasons we have the OECD. It is not just a rich nation's club headquartered in Paris; it is aimed at sharing best practice, particularly in the area of taxes but also in areas like education and health. Here, we have looked to best practice across OECD countries and we have put in place these reforms to make sure that we do not have the tax base eroded and we do not have profits shifted. In doing that, we will protect a significant amount of revenue.


These powers directly reflect the OECD guidelines. There is not a broad new power. They have what is known as a reconstruction power, an essential feature of a modern transfer pricing regime. The notion behind a 'reconstruction power' is that it helps you tackle an artificial structure, not just an artificial price in an isolated transaction. It is no surprise that there are some who are at the moment using these loopholes and benefiting from the avoidance measures and multinational profit shifting, but they will not be able to do so under this bill. Those of us on this side of the House believe that it is fundamental to a fair go and fundamental to equal treatment of firms that they not be allowed to erode the revenue base in the process. If we are to fund the services that the social sector demands and that I know from my conversations with businesspeople that they are keen to see then we need a strong revenue base. Less tax from one company just means more taxes that have to be paid by other companies and other individuals across the economy.


We know there is a strong demand for infrastructure spending. That is why this government has doubled the road budget and quadrupled the rail budget and spent more on urban public transport than all other governments since Federation combined. But we know there are still calls from business to spend more on infrastructure. Routinely, when business groups survey their members, infrastructure spending stands out as a key priority. Why wouldn't it? We had a period under the Howard government when the pause button was pressed on infrastructure spending and infrastructure decisions were made not based on the national interest but based on sectional political interests. One of my academic papers looked at the Roads to Recovery program. There you could see, even taking into account the population density of an electorate, that coalition electorates were receiving significantly more Roads to Recovery funding than were Labor electorates. That was because, under the coalition, infrastructure spending was too low and was not targeted to the areas most in need and not driven by cost-benefit analyses. That is not true under this government. But in order to maintain strong infrastructure spending we need a strong tax system to back it up.


A lot has been said in this debate about the general issue of tax reform under this government, so let me address directly some of the statements that the shadow Treasurer and the member for Dunkley have made about tax reform under this government. We have a proud record of tax reform. As economists and environmentalists alike have urged, we have put a price on carbon pollution, the most efficient way of addressing dangerous climate change. We have moved from a royalties regime to a profits based mining tax which will make sure that when the world price goes up through luck rather than ingenuity the tax share goes up commensurately. We have put in place an instant asset write-off. We have tripled the tax-free threshold. Those opposite will sometimes ask, 'We had a low-income tax offset there; what do you mean you have tripled the tax-free threshold?' Let me be very clear: what I mean by that is that we have taken one million Australians out of the tax-filing system.


The member for Dunkley likes to talk about reducing red tape. One of the big forms of red tape for low-income Australians is filing an annual tax return. If those opposite were to get into power, they would put the responsibility for filing a tax return back onto a million Australians for no additional revenue and no additional benefit to those individuals. We know from surveys that they take a day a year to file a tax return. So that would be an extra day a year gone for a million Australians were the coalition to come to office.




Mr Billson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am enjoying the member for Fraser's contribution, but there are about 4½ minutes left for him to actually deal with the bill before the House. I encourage—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member will resume his seat. The member for Fraser will continue.




Dr LEIGH:
  I am addressing directly some of the statements made by the member for North Sydney and the member for Dunkley on the issue of tax reform and the suggestions that have been made that this reform to counter tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting has somehow come out of the blue. It is important to understand the context of tax avoidance and multinational profit-shifting laws. Their broad context is a Labor legacy of tax reform.


We have been committed to good tax reform, guided by the experts. We, for example, followed through with fuel tax reforms that were brought into parliament by Peter Costello in 2003, supported by the opposition right up until the last minute, when they realised they could get some political mileage from backflipping on a Peter Costello reform—extraordinary stuff!


The reason we are committed to this bill to counter tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting is that we realise revenue must be raised as fairly as possible and must be spent as fairly as possible. That is why we have means tested the baby bonus, the private health insurance rebate and family tax payment part B. When the member for North Sydney went to London he talked about 'the age of entitlement'. When he came back to Australia he said that reducing the baby bonus for second and subsequent children was like China's one-child policy.


We need a bill to counter tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting because a strong tax system is essential to a fair society. We have to protect that revenue because if we do not then that means increasing taxes in other places. That is fundamentally the problem that the coalition has in so many of these areas. They are constantly saying that there are taxes they are going to reduce, that there are revenue measures they are going to oppose. The effect is that they now have a $70 billion hole in their costings—not my figure, a figure of the member for Goldstein, subsequently backed in a few days later by the member for North Sydney, who said, 'well, $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion', as though there really was not much difference. What is a spare $20 billion between friends? Let me be clear as to the implications. 




Mr Simpkins:
  Where's your surplus?




Dr LEIGH:
  I did look over because I thought briefly that the interjection might be the member for Wright turning up to this debate to explain where he was when we had the parliamentary hearing that was scheduled. But let me continue. 


The bill before the House ensures that we protect revenue, because if we do not protect revenue then we get into the problem the coalition find themselves in. The problem the coalition find themselves in is a massive costings gap. That is because, if you are a special interest, the coalition welcomes you with open arms, but, if you are a struggling Australian family, the coalition puts up their hand. They want to cut the schoolkids bonus, which is $410 for primary school children and $820 for secondary school children. They want to take that away. They want to increase taxes on low-income Australians by bringing down the tripling of the tax-free threshold. They want to cut pensions, because they have to do that once they have gotten rid of the carbon price, that most efficient way of dealing with dangerous climate change. 


This bill is part of a set of Labor reforms concentrating on making sure our tax system is as fair as possible. On this side of the House we will not be driven by special interest. We will be driven by the Australian national interest. We will be focused, like a laser beam, on the interests of Australians and on making sure our tax system is fair and equitable. (Time expired)

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (13:39):  I actually think my colleagues the member for Fraser and the member for Throsby are being too hard, because they need to appreciate that those opposite do have consistency. When it comes to issues of revenue and whether or not the taxation base of this country is being eroded, you have to know that they will not do anything about it. It has been there for decades. They had their little game where they were trying to track down the BLF. Malcolm Fraser and then Treasurer John Howard were in there, boots and all, after the BLF. That uncovered all these bottom-of-the-harbour taxation schemes. 




Mr Simpkins:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not think we are here to talk about the Labor Party’s preselectors; I think we are here to talk about the bill. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! The member will resume his seat. The member for Chifley. 




Mr HUSIC:
  Nice try, sunshine. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  And the member for Chifley will make his remarks through the chair and refer to members by their correct titles. 




Mr HUSIC:
  Absolutely; I withdraw that. When they had a threat to the taxation base of this country, they did nothing in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. We had the types of arguments you have got here today that try and scoff at whether or not it is a legitimate thing. We had the member for Dunkley say the same thing. In the member for Dunkley's eyes, if this measure does not raise a dollar it is not worth doing. But even though there are some on that side who do not recognise that protecting the taxation revenue of this country is an important priority, there are some conservatives who do. For example, on 21 May last year, one particularly prominent person from their side said that this is a big issue. He said: 


This is a big issue relating to the erosion of the Australian tax base. Over time, the erosion of the tax base will become material. You’ve got X billion dollars of revenue . . . being earned—


In this case he singled out Google—


paying very little tax in Australia.


Who said that? That was the shadow communications spokesperson, on the front page of the Australian Financial Review, under the headline 'Raise taxes on tech giants: Turnbull'. He goes on to say how this is a big threat to taxation revenue. He is not the only conservative to think this. 


Over in the UK David Cameron sees this as a significant issue, regardless of the member for Dunkley or the shadow Treasurer thinking that this is not an issue. Prime Minister Cameron says that this requires the immediate attention of the G8. Why? Because, as he acknowledges, left on the shoulders of just one country, companies that move across borders will flout taxation laws, will erode revenue and will ensure that they find ways around it. So Prime Minister Cameron is saying that the G8 has to work on this. Here we are saying we need to work on it. 


What do we have here in Australia? We have conservative politicians who—with respect to consistency when it comes to taxation revenue and protecting our revenue base—turn a blind eye to these things, to the rorts and the threats to taxation revenue, at a time when they have to plug a $70 billion hole in their estimates. But we have got others saying that this is serious enough to work on at the G8 level. The OECD is dedicating massive amounts of attention to this very issue. Frankly, as technology has changed, as we have globalised, as companies move across borders, this is a significant issue. Our taxation system taxes profits. When a company is operating across borders and sets up transfer pricing in a way that takes into account the fact that profits are taxed, it will be able, through its transfer pricing arrangements, not only to jack up prices locally for consumers but to do it in a way that lessens the ability of taxpayers to get their fair share. That is why it is an important issue. 


The reason you have to listen to the contribution of some of those opposite during this debate is that this matter will be significant. In years to come, when they catch up with the rest of the world that realises that this is an issue, they will be back-peddling at a million miles an hour. You will not get a speed camera that can pick up how quickly they will back away from their words. This is a massive issue for governments worldwide. To be leaving it in their hands, saying, 'We need to have a committee process that fully looks at this,' when the rest of the world is already furiously looking at it is a joke. 


How long did those opposite give for the Workplace Relations Act changes that ushered in Work Choices? When they ripped out conditions for Australian workers across the country, they did nothing—they gave no time whatsoever. Now they have become a big defender of parliamentary process, when, at the same time, we have these massive threats to our revenue. Their position on this is a joke and they need to recognise they have to speed up and get with the program. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Chifley will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (12:24):  It is rare for us to oppose a bill such as this, the Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013, because it is meant to be a matter that goes to the integrity of the tax system. However, if we were to be in a position where we could witness the dying days of the Whitlam government prior to its dismissal, but without the dismissal, then we would be witnessing it now because this government is lurching from announcement to announcement, completely disregarding process along the way. It is a real test for the Independents as to whether they are going to agree to a process where Australians face a more aggressive and empowered Taxation Office without having any public hearing into the Taxation Office or holding any public servant to account for the additional powers that are going to be given to them by this parliament. I find it extraordinary. I do not know what the government's motivation is—I seriously do not. 


The House Standing Committee on Economics was not afforded the opportunity to have a public hearing into this legislation. The government used its own numbers on the committee, including the vote of the now independent member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, to prevent a feasible hearing date from being set. I thought, when the deal was done between the Independents and the  Labor Party, that we were going to have this grand era of transparency and accountability, that the sunshine was going to come in, so that everyone could see what was happening in the bowels of this chamber and in the bowels of this parliament. Yet the government—I suppose the Independents will vote with this; I would hope they do not, but I suppose they will—will try to roll this massive additional power for the tax office through the parliament without any scrutiny, treating the House of Representatives with utter contempt. 


If the government and the Independents choose to do that, so be it. But, if there is a change of government, let's not have them come whingeing to us about the treatment they may get in the future or have them lecture us about how the parliament was treated in the past. I do not want to hear them whinge about it—because this will be one of the signature examples used. I am not really interested in the denial of democracy by the Labor Party, because it is a consistent theme, but denying a parliamentary committee from simply having a hearing on what was previously a noncontroversial bill makes it a controversial bill. 


So the coalition are going to oppose this bill and we call on the Independents to join with us in opposing this bill until such time as this House has the opportunity to see whether there is justification for the Australian Taxation Office to have a massive increase in its powers and to see how the Australian Taxation Office justifies claiming that, with these additional powers, it will achieve a billion dollars of extra revenue. A billion dollars of extra revenue: that is what they are claiming. 'No problem. Give us these extra enormous powers and don't worry; we'll claim an extra billion dollars of revenue.'


With all the integrity measures over previous years, where did that revenue come from? You ask for a tightening up of this law, you ask for new prosecutorial powers, you ask for all this additional influence, so prove to us—whether it was under the Liberal Party or under Labor—that with the additional powers you actually did improve the integrity of the system and increase revenue.


Schedule 1 to the bill seeks to amend the general anti-avoidance provisions in the 1936 Income Tax Act—provisions that are commonly referred to as part IVA. Former Treasurer John Howard was responsible for inserting part IVA into the tax act. Part IVA applied to schemes that were entered into after 27 May 1981. When introducing part IVA, John Howard said:


The proposed provisions seek to give effect to a policy that such measures ought to strike down blatant, artificial or contrived arrangements, but not cast unnecessary inhibitions on normal commercial transactions by which taxpayers legitimately take advantage of opportunities available for the arrangement of their affairs.


In 2000, when introducing the GST, the coalition included division 165 in the legislation, a general anti-avoidance rule. Division 165 resembles part IVA in many aspects, although of course it is dealing with a transaction based tax, rather than a tax on a profit or income earned over a period. 


We have consistently demonstrated that we are firmly opposed to tax avoidance behaviour. We firmly support the need for a strong set of provisions that deter abusive tax arrangements. The legislature—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  If the Assistant Treasurer wants to intervene again, he can get up here and explain how his good mate Eddie Obeid got away with shuffling money between trusts. Is that what you want to do, keep interrupting me, Sunshine? We know how close you were to Eddie Obeid.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Cheeseman
):  Order! If the member for North Sydney has imputations of the nature that he has just made that he wishes to make, there is an appropriate avenue available to him under the standing orders. He should use that.




Mr HOCKEY:
  It is okay, mate. If you give me a lecture across the table on integrity, I will give you a lecture about your relationship with Eddie Obeid. We must not countenance a change—




Mr Bradbury:
  I rise on a point of order on relevance.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The matter being raised is of no relevance to the debate. I draw your attention to the fact that the bill that we have before us relates to countering tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting. The member should direct his attention and his comments to that.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  On that point of order, there was no real point of order raised by the minister across the table. The fact of the matter is that this bill is about tax avoidance and Mr Obeid is involved in some of those issues. It is very relevant.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I believe that these matters are before relevant tribunals. I will get advice from the clerk as to whether these matters ought to be left before those tribunals as opposed to being raised in this chamber. I have sought advice from the clerk. It is my intention to ask all members participating in this debate to remain relevant to the particular bill before us. If we could have cooperation on that, that would be appreciated.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I would ask you, Deputy Speaker, to support me in that regard. We are focused on the concerns expressed by a number of individuals and corporations about whether the ATO is properly using its powers in relation to deterring abusive tax arrangements. In the Australian Financial Review this year, an article said that draft change to part IVA, on which the amendments in this bill are closely based, would 'determine whether a company is guilty of avoiding tax by looking at how else it could have done a deal if tax implications were not considered'. There is an extraordinarily large disconnect between the way in which business is properly conducted and the way in which the government, the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office would require business to be conducted.


To taxpayers, profit after tax is a crucial metric. Suggesting otherwise introduces a sense of artificiality, even unreality. This point was made by the Corporate Tax Association, which said:


The reality is that business and individuals operate in an after-tax world, and from a practical and corporate governance perspective, it would be highly problematical to ask board members to put their minds to what the company would have done in the highly artificial world where tax is assumed not to matter.


Similarly, the Law Council of Australia observed 'Ordinary taxpayers, small business and large corporations will be required to assess their tax obligations by reference to the tax which would have been paid if they had done something that in reality they never would have done.' This bill is going to overlay complexity and compliance costs onto normal commercial transactions, whether business transactions, new investments or corporate restructures.


We really must start this debate by asking whether these amendments are required at all. Submissions to the Economics Committee from pre-eminent professional and industry groups whose members have deep expertise in taxation law argue that these amendments are just not necessary. For example, the Corporate Tax Association states:


… we have consistently maintained that the proposed changes represent an over-reaction to the Taxation Office losing a number of court decisions that have quite limited application.


CPA Australia made a related submission:


… we believe that the proposed amendments to Part IVA contained in Schedule 1 of the Bill are confusing and deficient and do not result in an anti-avoidance regime which is comprehensible to tax practitioners let alone the broader community.


From the Tax Institute:


The Courts have applied the current rules appropriately to find that a tax benefit exists in only those cases where the taxpayer's actions have resulted in a loss to revenue. Recent cases have not resulted in the effectiveness of Part IVA being compromised and as such the amendments in the Bill are an unnecessary overreaction.


I repeat: an unnecessary overreaction. More red tape for business—when is it ever going to stop? More compliance costs for business—when is it ever going to stop? I only wish the Labor Party would have the same tough structure for itself that it is trying to apply to people who work hard and earn a buck—the same corporate government procedure in itself and within the Labor Party, particularly New South Wales and particularly the New South Wales Right. I wish they would do that instead of just applying to everyone else a higher standard than they are prepared to apply to themselves.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Whilst the member for North Sydney is making some devastating points, which I would probably agree with in another forum, I fail to see how they are relevant to the legislation before the chair. I would be quite happy to join with the member for North Sydney in this discussion somewhere else, but not on this legislation before this parliament at this point in time.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Cheeseman
):  Order! I would ask the member for North Sydney to remain relevant to the bill.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I do wonder how Treasury determined that schedule 1 to this bill 'is expected to prevent the loss of over $1 billion a year'. It is a nice round number: a billion dollars. It has a whiff of convenience to it, don't you think? We were of course denied an opportunity to ask Treasury officials for an explanation. The government controlled committee did not hold a hearing. The Treasury later put in an undated submission just before the bill came into this place. So it looks as though a government that does not want to be held to public hearings in relation to one of its bills has something to hide. They are doing it on the media, they are doing it on so many things, just like in the dying days of the Whitlam government. It is just a repeat. Everything has a political agenda.


I welcome integrity measures, especially when it comes to taxation. The fact that they do not want to have hearings suggests to me that there is another agenda. The coalition will vigorously pursue these matters in the Senate committee inquiry into the bill. So we are going to try in the Senate, and if the Greens are true to their word they will support a full inquiry in the Senate.


Building up the jurisprudence around fundamental parts of a taxation system can take many years. It was 13 years before the High Court delivered its first judgement on part IVA, in the Peabody case. If the amendments to be made by schedule 1 are passed then there will be a period, probably extending over a number of years, before there is a settled judicial view as to their correct application. Uncertainty is the enemy of investor confidence, of business confidence and of consumer confidence.


Even for the experts these amendments are not easy to interpret, and their application is not predictable. Last year the Inspector General of Taxation reviewed the ATO's management of litigation and found that the ATO's success rate before the courts was 56 per cent in 2009-10, 47 per cent the year after and 45 per cent to May the year after that.


The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit also had questions for the ATO regarding their litigation success rate—that is, the actual litigation. I do not think that includes all the assessments the ATO issues and then intimidates people into settling. The commissioner acknowledged—the previous commissioner, I would imagine—to the JCPAA that the ATO success rate was still very positive in terms of numbers. But he had concerns about the court's approach to the general anti-avoidance provisions. So it was all the fault of the courts.


The inspector general went on to note that some industry stakeholders held the view that the reason for the ATO's losses on general anti-avoidance-rule cases may be due to the ATO's poor case selection of matters they considered appropriate to litigate. Stakeholders also informed the inspector general that they had concerns about whether officers internal to the organisation could objectively review the facts and evidence in a case to determine, independently of the compliance section, whether the matter should be settled, defended or appealed.


This is a matter that I have raised on previous occasions, and I sense that a lack of objectivity in decision making inside the ATO is starting to have a significant impact on tax policy. The poor decisions about which cases to litigate, which have led to losses in court, are now driving the government's legislative agenda. And unfortunately there will be a cost imposed on a large number of taxpayers who must comply with a new general anti-avoidance rule.


I cannot fathom how the Treasurer can possibly justify the statement in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that the compliance-cost impact of the amendment will be low. Where do they get this from? The Law Council do not agree. They see the schedule as thrusting additional costs onto taxpayers—red tape:


The consequence of legislating this Bill will be to create significant difficulties, for ordinary taxpayers, small businesses and large corporations (both Australian and foreign) in understanding their tax obligations.


Who says it is low? On what basis do they say that the regulatory impact is low? Who writes this? And where is their accountability? How much have they consulted with businesses big and small, who are drowning under red tape? Yet the suggestion is that the regulatory impact is low.


Justice Pagone of the Supreme Court of Victoria, an author of a leading work about part IVA, has explained how onerous a new approach to the general anti-avoidance rule would be for taxpayers, since the onus of proof rests on them:


The question about what needs to be established arises in the context of the legal burden of proof falling upon the taxpayer to disprove what would have happened or might reasonably have been expected if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out. …


The ability of the Commissioner to rely upon something which did not happen, would not have happened, but which nonetheless might reasonably be expected to happen, may be difficult for taxpayers to disprove.


Do you reckon? Does the Assistant Treasurer understand this legislation? Can he get his mind around it? This is saying that business needs to start to model every alternative use, every alternative tax scenario, before it actually goes down this path—don't just get on with the job of doing your business but consider this impact on your business if you went down a different path, and prepare yourself. And the advice is that the regulatory impact is low.


Finally, the amendments' proposed starting date of 16 November 2012 must be changed. Where did they get 16 November from? This bill is different from the draft version that was released on 16 November last year. The changes made by the bill should not begin before royal assent. This is typical of Labor. They want to regulate yesterday; they introduce the bill now. And they say, 'All this is applying.' What is applying? 'Oh, well, the bill.' What bill? We haven't got a bill. It is like media; the process is no different. You guys are a shambles. But the problem is that the taxpayers are paying the price. This is not the way to govern a country; it is just not. How could anyone plan anything on a bill that has not been passed, has not even been debated and yet is meant to apply from 16 November last year?


I do not know what is going on here. If there is a change of government in September, the mountain of hard work will just get higher and higher to try and get back some certainty, stability and predictability into government. For crying out loud! I have never seen anything like it. I said that this is like the dying days of the Whitlam government. If Gough Whitlam had not been sacked, this is what it would have looked like—exactly this: a shemozzle appealing to every union official; a shemozzle all about protecting the leader. There is no good policy here. It is bad policy. What is more, it is incompetent and malicious.


Schedule 2 of this bill inserts new subdivisions into the Income Tax Assessment Act as well as the Tax Administration Act that the government says will modernise transfer pricing rules. Our transfer pricing rules have been rarely amended and they have largely stood the test of time. Last year, the government sought to make retrospective changes to the transfer pricing law that took effect from 1 July 2004. Typical. The bill sought to retrospectively amend legislation to include transfer pricing articles within Australian tax treaties. It also sought to clarify the interaction between transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules, which had previously only been dealt with through administrative arrangements.


The coalition opposes retrospective tax changes as a matter of principle. That is why we oppose the bill. How can anyone get on with the job of living their daily life, complying with the law as it stands, when along will come Labor in the future to introduce laws that say they broke the law today? That is why the Liberal Party is, in principle, always going to oppose retrospective changes. We understand that retrospective legislation can change the substance of transactions struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law at the time of the agreement. It can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances in which taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at the earlier time to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. It may change a taxpayer's tax profile, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and, of course, the pricing of those decisions.


Most importantly, the retrospective application of the change will heighten Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. 'We have trashed everything else so let's give sovereign risk a go,' says Labor. At the time, the government refused to answer questions around the quantity of revenue at stake. It was only after questioning at Senate budget estimates last year and a subsequent response to a question on notice that the ATO advised that there was $1.9 billion of primary tax in dispute in relation to transfer pricing issues for audits current at the time.


We find ourselves in a very similar position today. We have a bill before the House dealing with significant changes to important legislation that has not been given due process in this parliament and has not been given proper scrutiny. But Labor wants to ram it through. It does not have any regard or respect for taxpayers. That is why we are going to pursue it in the Senate.


The bill before the House seeks to replace the existing transfer pricing rules in division 13 by inserting these into three subdivisions in the Income Tax Act 1997—companies, branches of companies, and trusts and partnerships. It also inserts a subdivision into the Tax Administration Act in relation to record keeping and penalties that may be applied by the commissioner. The amendments within this schedule align with the internationally consistent transfer pricing approaches as set out by the OECD. These amendments apply to both tax treaty and non tax treaty cases. These amendments also contain specific rules relating to transfer pricing documentation.


These new rules are self-executing—that is, taxpayers will now apply the new transfer pricing laws on a self-assessment basis. The commissioner may challenge a taxpayer's calculated tax result, to which the taxpayer may then respond. To the extent that taxpayers may apply these complex rules when they did not previously, an increase in compliance costs is likely.


The complex and costly compliance rules impose a much greater requirement to keep contemporaneous documentation on small and medium business impacted by the de minimis thresholds that apply to the bill—more red tape. The de minimis threshold at which entities need to apply these complex and costly compliance rules at face value appear to be too low relative to the revenue risk. My colleague the member for Dunkley has raised this issue as well. I am not sure if he is speaking on this bill.




Mr Billson:
  I am.




Mr HOCKEY:
  There is no-one in the Labor Party who has ever worked in a small business, is there?




Mr Billson:
  No-one.




Mr HOCKEY:
  And they have had quite a few small business ministers in the last five years.




Mr Billson:
  Five.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Five small business ministers in five years.




Mr Billson:
  Four in the last 15 months.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Labor has had four small business ministers in the last 15 months.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  I rise on a point of order. While like any member here I enjoy banter between the member for North Sydney and the member for Dunkley, I would ask you to direct the speaker to make his contributions through the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask that the minister direct his comments through the chair and ask him to remain relevant.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am directing my comments through the chair and I am directly relevant. That is why I just talked about the red tape impact on small business. I cannot see how that is not relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am mindful of the fact that the government has made such a mess of this bill and maybe one of the reasons is that it has had five small business ministers in five years and four small business ministers in the last 15 months. That might be related to the fact that hardly anyone in the parliamentary Labor Party has ever worked in small business—hardly anyone. Has anyone in the Labor Party worked in small business? I cannot hear a word. No. They would not know what the red tape burden is. I can tell you what the red tape burden is: it costs money; it costs jobs. Many submissions to the House economics committee inquiry argued that the de minimis threshold should be raised and that doing so would not put revenue at risk. It would result in large savings in compliance cost and reduce complexity, especially for small- to medium-sized enterprises.


We are just asking why the government is so committed to this bill. Why is it so rushed? We are concerned that the design and drafting of this schedule may have been rushed. It requires further testing. That is consistent with the submissions from the Corporate Tax Association, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and the Tax Institute. For example, on page 7 of its submission to the committee, the Tax Institute said: 'We are concerned that the bill as currently drafted would not yield many of the lauded simplicity and certainty benefits and will increase the compliance burden, especially and disproportionately on small to medium enterprises.' Is anyone listening? These are submissions that are saying that this will mean more red tape for small- and medium-sized business and that you have got it wrong.


We find it difficult to fathom how the financial impact of this schedule is estimated at zero extra tax dollars per year whereas the financial impact of schedule 1, relating to general anti-avoidance provisions, is expected to prevent the loss of over a billion dollars per year. Where does that number come from? It has been plucked out of the air. We have an impressive record in relation to tax simplification. We have an impressive record in relation to tax reduction. But it is the Labor Party that is introducing bills while refusing to facilitate proper scrutiny, and they just keep getting it wrong: exhibit A, the mining tax; exhibit B, the carbon tax; exhibit C, the 27 new or increased taxes Labor has introduced. We will oppose this bill because it is bad legislation and the format in the House is a disaster.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:54):  The role of government is to provide security and services that are needed by the citizens of the country. It is the responsibility of citizens, including corporate citizens, to make a contribution to the provision of those services. Over the last several decades we have seen an increase in demand for local, state and federal governments to provide more services and new areas of services such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which every speaker on the legislation in this House has stood up and said they applaud. They said that this Labor government initiative is an important initiative, but they have all expressed concerns about the capacity of successive governments to foot the bill for this to provide education, research and development, and infrastructure and also meet the increasing costs of traditional services in the area of health. Indeed, we have had a raging debate on the funding of health services in this country. It is known that the system we have had in place until recently is unsustainable because the significant increase in health funding costs will far outweigh—in fact, they will swamp—the capacity of any state or territory government to meet those costs under pre-existing arrangements.


So, what we know is that we have to get the revenue side of things right. If the public's demand for the provision of these services remains unabated, we need to get the revenue side of things right. We also need to ensure that we do it in a way that creates the right environment for businesses to invest. And I note that the member for North Sydney, the man who wants to be Treasurer of this country, in his devastating contribution to this debate, dragged out the old chestnut of sovereign risk. What he should have done before raising issues of concern about sovereign risk is pick up a copy of the 2013 World Bank report. These are the sorts of reports one should be looking at in relation to business confidence about investing in this country—the reports of authoritative institutions, such as the 2013 World Bank report on the best countries to do business in. You will note, Mr Deputy Speaker Cheeseman, because I know you are on top of this issue, that the World Bank, in its 2013 report, rated Australia as in the top 10 countries to do business in, out of 185 countries. So, when they wheel out this nonsense week after week about sovereign risk, the only ones who are listening are the Liberal Party cheer squad—certainly not the authoritative reporters on this matter such as the World Bank.


These bills are aimed at ensuring that we close down tax loopholes, and there are two schedules aimed at doing that. It is not surprising—and I make no criticism whatsoever—that there are those organisations who see this as a threat to their tax avoidance mechanisms and regimes. It is quite natural that if an organisation or an individual has profited by minimising their tax through tax avoidance schemes they are going to make a bit of noise when the government and the parliament see it fit to try to close down some of these avoidance mechanisms. That is normal. They will make some noise, they will make some complaints—there is nothing abnormal about that. But it is abnormal to have the man who would be Treasurer of this country, the man dealing with his own fiscal problems at the moment—a $70 billion black hole in his budget costings—get up in this parliament, not five minutes ago, to defend those rules. That is abnormal. You would think that a man who has some fiscal problems of his own would want to look at each and every measure he could to try to close some of these tax loopholes.


Schedule 1 of the bill is aimed at closing those tax loopholes that have been addressed by the minister. Schedule 2, which I would like to address in some detail, goes to transfer pricing. But before I do that I want to address some of the points that the member for North Sydney raised in his devastating address. The crux of his contribution to this debate is that there has not been any consultation and somehow this legislation would have been improved by a public hearing. I want to address both of these issues. First, on the issue of consultation, particularly as it goes to schedule 2 of this bill, there has been extensive consultation on those matters. A discussion paper was released in November 2011. That is nearly 18 months ago. There was a series of large stakeholder meetings to discuss the principles that would form the basis of the legislative framework throughout 2012. There was a month of public consultation after that around draft provisions in November 2012. In December 2012 there was an additional large stakeholder meeting to discuss the details of the draft. The bill has benefited significantly from this consultation process.


I sit on the House Standing Committee on Economics, which this bill was referred to for a public inquiry. We set down a date for a public inquiry, 4 March. All the government members were able to make themselves available to hear evidence from concerned members of the public on 4 March. But where was the member for Moncrieff? Where was the member for Higgins? Where was the member for Wright? They were not available. In a devastating criticism, the shadow Treasurer said the government should have had a public inquiry into this bill and that government members of the economics committee should have made themselves available. He should have picked up the phone and talked to the member for Moncrieff, the member for Higgins and the member for Wright. I presume he has their phone numbers. If there is any blame in this, it should be directed to his own members of the economics committee. We were ready, willing and available to hear evidence in a public inquiry but it was his own side that closed it down. They made themselves unavailable.


This contribution from the member for North Sydney was nothing more than a ginormous bubble of fluff. We hear a lot of contributions like this from the member for North Sydney. He should be directing his devastating critique of this bill to members of his own back bench, because if there was not a public inquiry then the blame lies fairly and squarely on the coalition members of the economics committee; that is where the blame lies.


In his 30-minute tirade we heard nothing from the member for North Sydney on the issue of transfer pricing. This is a very important part of this bill. What is transfer pricing? Transfer pricing is where a transnational corporation has operations in one country, in this case Australia, and operations in another country, and they use their global network as a means of minimising tax by transferring costs and profits from one part of their operation, which may have a tax impost on them, to another part of their operation in another country purely for the purpose of avoiding a tax. It became quite famous over the last 12 months.


There was a lot of public debate about transfer pricing when that global IT company that is familiar to all of us in this place, Google—a company that set itself up with the motto 'do no evil'—was exposed as having engaged in extensive transfer-pricing operations to avoid taxation, including avoiding taxation in this country. They quite rightly were rounded on by leaders right around the world saying that a company that is dedicated to 'doing no evil' really wanted to look at some of its corporate practices.


This bill is addressed at cracking down on transfer pricing. Transfer pricing has sometimes been described as something which is just part and parcel of doing business if you are a transnational corporation. Indeed, the global CEO of Google, Mr Eric Schmidt, said on 13 December, 'Transfer pricing is just a part of capitalism.' I reject that and I call on all members in this place to reject that. It may in some countries be legal but it is certainly not moral. It is not a practice that is without victims. In this country, the victims are the taxpayers who are at threat of having to bear a greater burden of the tax take because companies like Google and other large transnational organisations are avoiding tax in this space, avoiding their responsibility to make contributions towards infrastructure and vital services that are needed in any advanced democratic country such as ours. Through their tax avoidance processes they are effectively shifting the burden of taxation onto other taxpayers. In this respect, I would say states and territories are also victims of this—because if there is less money available through corporate taxation arrangements from these transnational corporations then there is less money available for the Commonwealth to disburse to the states and other entities for the provision of health and education services.


But it is not just taxpayers who bear the burden of this and lose out from transfer pricing; it is also some of our domestic companies who are penalised. If they are not a part of a transnational corporation, there is not a level playing field. They are penalised because they do not have access to transfer pricing loopholes. That means they are paying a proper rate of tax while somebody down the road, a transnational corporation, is cheating. They are getting an unfair advantage in a similar market, so you do not have a level playing field. Costs are imposed, but not borne, by the domestic competitors. So they have an interest. There are many, many Australian companies who are going to welcome this legislation because it will go a long way to addressing some of the loopholes that are available to transnational corporations to transfer costs out of this jurisdiction so the domestic companies are bearing a disproportionate burden of the tax take.


It may not be of interest to everybody in this place, but I know that a lot of people also share the concern, not just as citizens of Australia but as global citizens, that transfer pricing arrangements are also used as a way of denuding treasury coffers, typically those of developing nations, of the vital revenue that is needed to ensure that they can build the health systems, education systems, transport systems and all those robust institutions that are needed for a thriving democracy and a thriving economy in developing countries. Where transnational corporations use these sorts of loopholes to avoid those taxes they are harming everybody. This is not a victimless crime. This is something that affects everybody.


So, instead of hearing long-winded, misguided and, in some cases, downright untrue contributions from the shadow Treasurer, these are the sorts of things we would expect members of the opposition to be focusing their attention on. How can we ensure that we have a level playing field for countries paying tax in this country to ensure that we are not disproportionately levying a tax burden upon wage and salary earners and other taxpayers to the advantage of transnational corporations and to the disadvantage of domestic taxpayers who do not have these sorts of loopholes available to them? These are the sorts of things we should be talking about.


If the member for North Sydney is truly aggrieved about the fact that the economics committee did not hold a public inquiry then he should be hauling the member for Higgins, the member for Wright and the member for Moncrieff into his office right now and saying: 'Where were you? I have just come into the House and embarrassed myself by saying there should've been an economics committee public inquiry into this. I have made a complete and utter goose of myself in the parliament by calling for a public inquiry. I've now discovered that the government members of the economics committee were ready, willing and able to have that inquiry and the only reason that it did not occur is that my own backbenchers were not available, were not doing their job, and would not turn up.' They have severely embarrassed the shadow Treasurer—and they are probably delivering their apology to him right now. I would also call on the shadow Treasurer to come to the House and issue an apology to all members on this side of the House for misleading us.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (13:09):  Well, there you have it; there was the defence of this extraordinarily poorly handled legislative process. The member for Throsby has come up with 'the diary defence': the fact that the government has proven itself to be unwilling or incapable of engaging with the many organisations that have made considered and thoughtful submissions on this bill and the fact that it chose one date that did not happen to work for some of the committee members. That's it—the diary defence. It is Labor's only defence to an appalling abuse of parliamentary process, to an uncosted and untested impact on the enterprising Australians who create wealth and opportunity. All we get from the member for Throsby is the diary defence: 'Oh, we would like to have had this conversation, but we chose a date and some people couldn't make it so we abandoned the hearing.' What utter nonsense.


This kind of shambolic, dysfunctional poor excuse for governance that we see under this pathetic Labor government has just been demonstrated writ large here. Here we have substantial changes to tax laws that will impact not just, as the member for Throsby would have you believe, on the evil big end of town involved in all sorts of rorts and the like. This impacts much wider than that. It impacts on SMEs across the country. It is a range of provisions that have not been tested for their justification in terms of the problem they seek to solve, nor for their construct in terms of whether they are effective at all, nor for their calibration. The question is whether this is nothing more than a last-minute election grab for power by a government desperate to look like it is doing something at a time that it presides over the most appalling deterioration in the Commonwealth's finances. It is hard to draw any other conclusion.


I listened carefully and courteously to the member for Throsby. His attack on the very valid points and criticisms and measured remarks of the shadow Treasurer was to say that somehow the coalition is defending rorts. Is everything so base politic to you guys? Does it not matter to you that the public policy formation process should be more inclusive and should value the input of those who live and work with this every day? Or do you just want the headline of the title of this bill? I think that is really what this is about. I do not think government members have turned their mind to any of the actual content of this legislation. No, they are just happy that they have a piece of legislation before the parliament talking about countering tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting and they have not bothered to apprise themselves as to what the actual mechanisms are, or their consequences for enterprises in this country. When will you guys get tired of your constant assault on small business? It is quite remarkable.


I hear a government member interjecting that it is all about multinationals, but perhaps if he could quote himself he might have then recognised the merit of the argument. The submissions provided by tax authorities, by accounting firms and by business advisers one after another pointed to the deficiencies in these provisions as they have been drafted. The fact is that the government has refused to allow an engaging hearing process. The word 'hearing' has as much meaning as question time: you do not get any answers and you do not even get a hearing to be heard and have your concerns addressed and have the arguments weighed against what is being asserted in the documents foisted on this parliament. No, under this Gillard Labor government we do not have that.


It is the same with the government's media reforms. They just jam it through and any tactic will do. And we see this again with this legislation. There have been no opportunities for people who have taken the time to work through this process and engage themselves in this formulation of widely reaching laws. For a start, they just deserve basic courtesies. The Australian business community gets enough of it when the tax office is telling it how it should run its business. It is not that they have done something wrong. It is just a little inconvenient that you are an independent contractor. We insist that you are an employee, because that is easier for us, and we will refuse to give you an ABN because we reckon you are not really an independent contractor. Yet the law is clear. They should apply the law—a novel idea—but no, they have to go the jihad on SMEs.


Here is another example of it. The tax office has not had a great record on some of its cases on anti-avoidance measures. The shadow Treasurer outlined that there is a one-in-two diminishing rate of success. The member for Fraser, having a learned mind, would turn his thinking to just why that success rate is the way it is. Would he immediately think the law is not up to the task or might he actually look at the cases? Might he actually feel that the interpretations being imposed by the tax office are inconsistent with the way the law is drafted? Maybe there was not any anti-avoidance at all. They could have looked at those internal case selections and had some external people look at them, to reality check the cases that they have pursued, rather than self-support each other's assessment within the ATO. If you got a dispassionate assessment of it, then you might get a different outcome. But they say, 'No, we're in and we're going to change the law. Let's change the law.'


This change of the law actually contemplates posing a retrospective tax question: what if this transaction had been done another way? If the tax office want to get into that business, they should go into business and make those judgments. But, in the meantime, they should apply the law—I know that is a novel idea! We have seen how this works in other examples. We saw how this worked under the sober and thoughtful warning of the Inspector-General of Taxation. The member for Fraser might recall that the Inspector-General of Taxation himself was concerned about the way the tax office went about its business.


There was the example of some whistleblowing from a former ATO staff member about formal targets to punch through objections to audit decisions and wave other ones through irrespective of their merits. It was widely reported, but what was of more concern was that late last year the Inspector-General of Taxation's report found that more than 5,800 small businesses had been targeted by the ATO. They were forced into simply paying default tax assessments because they could not afford to fight or correct the ATO's false assertions. There was the institution designed to be fair and consistent in applying the law going after these little guys because they could not push back.


We saw a more of it in MYEFO. Do you know what was extraordinary in MYEFO, Mr Deputy Speaker? I looked through that document to see whether the government would maybe finally get the idea that, after reducing the number of people employed in small business by a quarter of a million over the last five years—despite population growth and your Treasurer saying there has been trend economic growth—there has been a substantial contraction in SMEs. I am hearing all these stories that the information you give only has to be slightly off and the ATO will go after you and how they were so active in insolvencies that they ran out of administrative filing fees and that is why insolvency rates were at record highs.


I looked in MYEFO to see whether there was a little bit of encouragement or support for small businesses. Do you know that the only small-business positive comment in that document was about what the Chinese government was doing to support Chinese small businesses? In MYEFO, the government was comforting itself that the slowdown in the economy in China would not be as great as some had predicted because the Chinese government was doing things to support small business. That was the only positive comment. Do you know what the other mention of small business was in MYEFO? It was the announcement of another $380 million to continue this jihad on small business, knowing that small businesses have no capacity to fight back. The tax office is after you, there is a behemoth in the room and the small businesses—as found by the Inspector-General of Taxation—too often have to pay go-away money.


We see this here in these measures. In schedule 1, under the anti-avoidance provisions, it is quite remarkable because there is a nice round $1 billion dropped on the table. That is what the effect is going to be: a nice, sweet $1 billion. There has been concern raised by any number of eminent organisations, including Certified Practising Accountants Australia, who do terrific analytical, evidence based work on these concerns, the Tax Institute, the Corporate Tax Association of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. All of these organisations have said there are some problems with the way in which these provisions operate, because they assume some alternative theory about commercial transactions that are then imputed into the tax thinking and therefore might produce a different outcome.


That is not to say that someone has been behaving motivated by tax mischief or tax opportunity. This is actually: 'Maybe, we could reconstruct this process and see if the transaction could be executed in another way.' That might spit out a different tax outcome. There might be a perfectly legitimate business justification about why the transaction went the way it did. But does that then leave people open to further action of a retrospective nature under these expanded general anti-avoidance provisions? There are has been no effort to calibrate how they deal with anti-avoidance, but they look all the world like they are just dealing with a poor success rate on litigation.


When these bodies seek to get guidance on that and to interact, as happens in a hearing, on the calibration and justification, they get nowhere. There is no opportunity to do that. It was interesting, wasn't it, that even in that truncated, poor excuse for a committee hearing exercise—which has brought great shame onto this parliament—the Treasury's submission was a belated attachment. It was an afterthought. They tried to get behind the policy justification, which should come out of Treasury, to see how the particular instruments are being advocated and crafted in the interests of the tax office's conduct. There is no chance to have that conversation at all. That is what is the great shame about this process.


You then move onto schedule 2, which was quite interesting. You heard the member for Throsby talking about the evils of transfer pricing and what that can do to the tax take in Australia. Do you know that, in the explanatory memorandum, schedule 2 does not raise a dime? Do you not find it the slightest bit interesting that we have got a nice, round $1 billion figure for anti-avoidance but, when it comes to this horrendous evil and the reaching over to the OECD for their work—and it is all sweet—it does not raise a dime, according to the explanatory memorandum? Doesn't that make an interesting conversation?


So powerful are these provisions that they are getting jammed through the parliament because our tax base is at risk. We hear these erudite presentations from government members about transfer pricing—it is eroding tax bases and impeding developing countries for having doctors—and how it is fantastic, but when you look at the detail it does not raise a dime. So what is it?




Dr Leigh:
  It's protecting revenue.




Mr BILLSON:
  The interjection is that it is protecting revenue. It does not raise a dime, yet so urgent is this potent and powerful measure that the parliament is not afforded the courtesy of a hearing about it. You just have to jam it through. When you look at its impact on small business, submission after submission points to an overriding concern about this legislation creating extraordinary additional compliance costs for taxpayers and also uncertainty about what taxpayers need to do and what they need to do differently to ensure that they are complying with these revised transfer pricing tests.


The government comes in here and talks about the evil of these behemoth multinationals, ignoring the fact that there is no safe harbour for small business. There is no carve-out; there is none of the wisdom reflected in the United Kingdom law. I quote from the ICAA's excellent submission, where they say:


In our view, in a proper balancing of compliance costs against revenue risks, it is essential that some taxpayers are completely carved out of the transfer pricing rules. This is on the basis that below a certain point it is just not cost effective or practical to impose transfer pricing guidelines. The UK has recognised this in its transfer pricing rules which provide that SMEs are exempt from the transfer pricing rules. An SME under this definition is one that has less than 250 employees and either:


turnover of less than €50m; or


assets with a balance sheet total of less than €43m.


We note that this approach of completely carving SME taxpayers out of the transfer pricing rules need not however, prevent the ATO from still being able to gather information—


and use its extraordinary toolkit that is available now—


to address any concerns it has around related party dealings by SMEs.


They make the following point:


… the Institute believes that penalties should not be imposed for any adjustment made under Subdivisions 815-B to 815-E on a SME taxpayer that has made reasonable efforts to comply with the legislation—


should be taken into account. Where has that wise counsel gone? The de minimis thresholds of $10,000 and $20,000 proposed here are far too low to achieve their intended purpose. To go after those behemoths that the government likes to say this is about, why are those thresholds so low? The proposition is to raise the threshold to $5 million to have their intended effect, but then we think, 'This is not supposed to raise a dime.' It is a saviour of budgets. It is the headline the government is after. It is an appalling abuse of parliamentary process and it is just further evidence of this dysfunctional, divided and hopeless government. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (13:24):  A strong tax system is fundamental to driving innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth, because it is only through a strong tax system that we are able to provide the infrastructure that business needs to thrive; it is only through a strong tax system that we are able to fund high-quality education and the research and development we know business depends on. So making sure that we have a strong tax system with good anti-avoidance provisions is a pro-business measure. Those who oppose it—those who say that we ought to have a tax system with loopholes in it—are not pro-business; they are pro-loopholes. They are standing up for those who believe that there ought to be loopholes that those with cunning lawyers can use to avoid paying tax.


This bill puts in place measures that will counter tax avoidance and multinational profit-shifting. It will, as the speaker before me reluctantly acknowledged, protect significant amounts of revenue. Over $1 billion of revenue will be protected by these measures. That is what these measures are about. They are about ensuring that our tax system follows the values that Australians hold dear: the values of equality and fairness; the value of opportunity; the values that say that, just because you can hire the best lawyer in town, you should not be able to get an unfair advantage with our tax code. That is all this bill is about.


If you listen to those opposite, you might think that this bill has been cooked up in a Treasury dungeon somewhere and thrust upon the parliament, but nothing could be further from the truth. Treasury went through a normal public consultation process, as they do with tax reform bills of all types. But beyond that, in the case of this bill, the Assistant Treasurer set up an expert roundtable and Treasury used that expert roundtable extensively. So the views of those affected by these changes have been thoroughly canvassed.


As the member for Throsby acknowledged, there was a willingness on this side of the House to hold a parliamentary inquiry to look into this bill, but when the availability of members was canvassed it was found that, while government members were available in abundance—I cleared the day in my diary—opposition members were nowhere to be seen. So, when the member for Dunkley talks about courtesy, fundamentally the courtesy is of those in the opposition to be willing to attend an inquiry. When we found that there was not a single member of the opposition willing to turn up to this inquiry, we took the view that fundamentally the opposition were not particularly interested in holding a parliamentary inquiry. Had the members for Higgins, Wright and Moncrieff been willing to attend that inquiry, it might well have gone ahead. Had even one of them been willing to attend that inquiry, it might well have gone ahead. But all of them had more pressing concerns.


You would not have known that by listening to the member for North Sydney; you would not have known that from listening to the member for Dunkley. For them, this is just a big story about a government conspiracy. But, when it actually comes to making time to hold a parliamentary inquiry, opposition members were unable to do so. Now they have the temerity to turn up in the parliament and attack the government for failing to hold that inquiry. That is just not good enough. If you cannot make yourself available for a parliamentary inquiry, you forego the right to come into this parliament and claim that that inquiry should have gone ahead.


Let me go to some of the measures before speaking about the context in which they are being implemented. These amendments will maintain the effectiveness of the general anti-avoidance rule to counter tax avoidance. The role of part IVA is exposing the substance or reality of what taxpayers have done to the ordinary operation of the tax law. Taxpayers should not be able to avoid the tax consequences of what they have actually done by arguing that they would have done something completely different or nothing at all. They should not, in colloquial language, be able to have their cake and eat it too. In putting together this bill, with consultation with the public and the expert panel, we received legal advice from senior counsel with expertise in part IVA. So this is a balanced response to address problems without interfering with ordinary commercial activities. That is schedule 1.


Schedule 2 deals with multinational profit shifting. It is about bringing Australia's transfer pricing regime into line with OECD best practice. It is one of the reasons we have the OECD. It is not just a rich nation's club headquartered in Paris; it is aimed at sharing best practice, particularly in the area of taxes but also in areas like education and health. Here, we have looked to best practice across OECD countries and we have put in place these reforms to make sure that we do not have the tax base eroded and we do not have profits shifted. In doing that, we will protect a significant amount of revenue.


These powers directly reflect the OECD guidelines. There is not a broad new power. They have what is known as a reconstruction power, an essential feature of a modern transfer pricing regime. The notion behind a 'reconstruction power' is that it helps you tackle an artificial structure, not just an artificial price in an isolated transaction. It is no surprise that there are some who are at the moment using these loopholes and benefiting from the avoidance measures and multinational profit shifting, but they will not be able to do so under this bill. Those of us on this side of the House believe that it is fundamental to a fair go and fundamental to equal treatment of firms that they not be allowed to erode the revenue base in the process. If we are to fund the services that the social sector demands and that I know from my conversations with businesspeople that they are keen to see then we need a strong revenue base. Less tax from one company just means more taxes that have to be paid by other companies and other individuals across the economy.


We know there is a strong demand for infrastructure spending. That is why this government has doubled the road budget and quadrupled the rail budget and spent more on urban public transport than all other governments since Federation combined. But we know there are still calls from business to spend more on infrastructure. Routinely, when business groups survey their members, infrastructure spending stands out as a key priority. Why wouldn't it? We had a period under the Howard government when the pause button was pressed on infrastructure spending and infrastructure decisions were made not based on the national interest but based on sectional political interests. One of my academic papers looked at the Roads to Recovery program. There you could see, even taking into account the population density of an electorate, that coalition electorates were receiving significantly more Roads to Recovery funding than were Labor electorates. That was because, under the coalition, infrastructure spending was too low and was not targeted to the areas most in need and not driven by cost-benefit analyses. That is not true under this government. But in order to maintain strong infrastructure spending we need a strong tax system to back it up.


A lot has been said in this debate about the general issue of tax reform under this government, so let me address directly some of the statements that the shadow Treasurer and the member for Dunkley have made about tax reform under this government. We have a proud record of tax reform. As economists and environmentalists alike have urged, we have put a price on carbon pollution, the most efficient way of addressing dangerous climate change. We have moved from a royalties regime to a profits based mining tax which will make sure that when the world price goes up through luck rather than ingenuity the tax share goes up commensurately. We have put in place an instant asset write-off. We have tripled the tax-free threshold. Those opposite will sometimes ask, 'We had a low-income tax offset there; what do you mean you have tripled the tax-free threshold?' Let me be very clear: what I mean by that is that we have taken one million Australians out of the tax-filing system.


The member for Dunkley likes to talk about reducing red tape. One of the big forms of red tape for low-income Australians is filing an annual tax return. If those opposite were to get into power, they would put the responsibility for filing a tax return back onto a million Australians for no additional revenue and no additional benefit to those individuals. We know from surveys that they take a day a year to file a tax return. So that would be an extra day a year gone for a million Australians were the coalition to come to office.




Mr Billson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am enjoying the member for Fraser's contribution, but there are about 4½ minutes left for him to actually deal with the bill before the House. I encourage—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member will resume his seat. The member for Fraser will continue.




Dr LEIGH:
  I am addressing directly some of the statements made by the member for North Sydney and the member for Dunkley on the issue of tax reform and the suggestions that have been made that this reform to counter tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting has somehow come out of the blue. It is important to understand the context of tax avoidance and multinational profit-shifting laws. Their broad context is a Labor legacy of tax reform.


We have been committed to good tax reform, guided by the experts. We, for example, followed through with fuel tax reforms that were brought into parliament by Peter Costello in 2003, supported by the opposition right up until the last minute, when they realised they could get some political mileage from backflipping on a Peter Costello reform—extraordinary stuff!


The reason we are committed to this bill to counter tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting is that we realise revenue must be raised as fairly as possible and must be spent as fairly as possible. That is why we have means tested the baby bonus, the private health insurance rebate and family tax payment part B. When the member for North Sydney went to London he talked about 'the age of entitlement'. When he came back to Australia he said that reducing the baby bonus for second and subsequent children was like China's one-child policy.


We need a bill to counter tax avoidance and multinational profit shifting because a strong tax system is essential to a fair society. We have to protect that revenue because if we do not then that means increasing taxes in other places. That is fundamentally the problem that the coalition has in so many of these areas. They are constantly saying that there are taxes they are going to reduce, that there are revenue measures they are going to oppose. The effect is that they now have a $70 billion hole in their costings—not my figure, a figure of the member for Goldstein, subsequently backed in a few days later by the member for North Sydney, who said, 'well, $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion', as though there really was not much difference. What is a spare $20 billion between friends? Let me be clear as to the implications. 




Mr Simpkins:
  Where's your surplus?




Dr LEIGH:
  I did look over because I thought briefly that the interjection might be the member for Wright turning up to this debate to explain where he was when we had the parliamentary hearing that was scheduled. But let me continue. 


The bill before the House ensures that we protect revenue, because if we do not protect revenue then we get into the problem the coalition find themselves in. The problem the coalition find themselves in is a massive costings gap. That is because, if you are a special interest, the coalition welcomes you with open arms, but, if you are a struggling Australian family, the coalition puts up their hand. They want to cut the schoolkids bonus, which is $410 for primary school children and $820 for secondary school children. They want to take that away. They want to increase taxes on low-income Australians by bringing down the tripling of the tax-free threshold. They want to cut pensions, because they have to do that once they have gotten rid of the carbon price, that most efficient way of dealing with dangerous climate change. 


This bill is part of a set of Labor reforms concentrating on making sure our tax system is as fair as possible. On this side of the House we will not be driven by special interest. We will be driven by the Australian national interest. We will be focused, like a laser beam, on the interests of Australians and on making sure our tax system is fair and equitable. (Time expired)

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (13:39):  I actually think my colleagues the member for Fraser and the member for Throsby are being too hard, because they need to appreciate that those opposite do have consistency. When it comes to issues of revenue and whether or not the taxation base of this country is being eroded, you have to know that they will not do anything about it. It has been there for decades. They had their little game where they were trying to track down the BLF. Malcolm Fraser and then Treasurer John Howard were in there, boots and all, after the BLF. That uncovered all these bottom-of-the-harbour taxation schemes. 




Mr Simpkins:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not think we are here to talk about the Labor Party’s preselectors; I think we are here to talk about the bill. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! The member will resume his seat. The member for Chifley. 




Mr HUSIC:
  Nice try, sunshine. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  And the member for Chifley will make his remarks through the chair and refer to members by their correct titles. 




Mr HUSIC:
  Absolutely; I withdraw that. When they had a threat to the taxation base of this country, they did nothing in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. We had the types of arguments you have got here today that try and scoff at whether or not it is a legitimate thing. We had the member for Dunkley say the same thing. In the member for Dunkley's eyes, if this measure does not raise a dollar it is not worth doing. But even though there are some on that side who do not recognise that protecting the taxation revenue of this country is an important priority, there are some conservatives who do. For example, on 21 May last year, one particularly prominent person from their side said that this is a big issue. He said: 


This is a big issue relating to the erosion of the Australian tax base. Over time, the erosion of the tax base will become material. You’ve got X billion dollars of revenue . . . being earned—


In this case he singled out Google—


paying very little tax in Australia.


Who said that? That was the shadow communications spokesperson, on the front page of the Australian Financial Review, under the headline 'Raise taxes on tech giants: Turnbull'. He goes on to say how this is a big threat to taxation revenue. He is not the only conservative to think this. 


Over in the UK David Cameron sees this as a significant issue, regardless of the member for Dunkley or the shadow Treasurer thinking that this is not an issue. Prime Minister Cameron says that this requires the immediate attention of the G8. Why? Because, as he acknowledges, left on the shoulders of just one country, companies that move across borders will flout taxation laws, will erode revenue and will ensure that they find ways around it. So Prime Minister Cameron is saying that the G8 has to work on this. Here we are saying we need to work on it. 


What do we have here in Australia? We have conservative politicians who—with respect to consistency when it comes to taxation revenue and protecting our revenue base—turn a blind eye to these things, to the rorts and the threats to taxation revenue, at a time when they have to plug a $70 billion hole in their estimates. But we have got others saying that this is serious enough to work on at the G8 level. The OECD is dedicating massive amounts of attention to this very issue. Frankly, as technology has changed, as we have globalised, as companies move across borders, this is a significant issue. Our taxation system taxes profits. When a company is operating across borders and sets up transfer pricing in a way that takes into account the fact that profits are taxed, it will be able, through its transfer pricing arrangements, not only to jack up prices locally for consumers but to do it in a way that lessens the ability of taxpayers to get their fair share. That is why it is an important issue. 


The reason you have to listen to the contribution of some of those opposite during this debate is that this matter will be significant. In years to come, when they catch up with the rest of the world that realises that this is an issue, they will be back-peddling at a million miles an hour. You will not get a speed camera that can pick up how quickly they will back away from their words. This is a massive issue for governments worldwide. To be leaving it in their hands, saying, 'We need to have a committee process that fully looks at this,' when the rest of the world is already furiously looking at it is a joke. 


How long did those opposite give for the Workplace Relations Act changes that ushered in Work Choices? When they ripped out conditions for Australian workers across the country, they did nothing—they gave no time whatsoever. Now they have become a big defender of parliamentary process, when, at the same time, we have these massive threats to our revenue. Their position on this is a joke and they need to recognise they have to speed up and get with the program. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Chifley will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

 (Cowan) (13:45):  Yesterday I attended a gift-unveiling ceremony for the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Australia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnia's Ambassador, Dr Damir Arnault, officially unveiled the gift to recognise the strong and friendly ties between the two countries. The gift was a mediaeval-style stone sculpture which has been located in Parliament House's formal gardens. The sculpture was created by Mr Adis Fejzic, who was born in Sarajevo but now resides in Brisbane. At the unveiling, Mr Fejzic described his gift as a 'summary' of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Australia. The sculpture features the Star of David, a cross and a crescent, appearing as one and representing the multicultural and multireligious Bosnia and Herzegovina. The connection to Australia is emphasised with the traditional Bosnian spheres constellated in the form of the Southern Cross.


Bosnia is a country that has over the decades changed, advanced and developed greatly. In January I had the opportunity to visit Sarajevo and saw the progress. Also, yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with ambassador to discuss the issues currently facing his homeland. We also discussed how Bosnians living in Western Australia would benefit greatly from the signing of a social security agreement with Australia. The government needs to address this matter urgently. Finally, I would like to thank the Bosnians in Cowan, and there are many, for their efforts and their positive contribution to our community. Bosnians across the whole country contribute strongly to Australia.

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  on indulgence—Five weeks ago today, Australians woke up to the news that Pope Benedict XVI had resigned and that there would be a new pope. Today we woke to the news of the election of the new pope, a pope from the New World. Former Cardinal Bergoglio has taken the name Francis, the first pope to do so—a name synonymous in the Catholic tradition with poverty and purity, something which speaks of a very admirable ambition for the papacy. The Catholic Church now has a new pope, and the global south now has a new voice.


We are advised that His Holiness will officially be installed in a mass in Rome on Tuesday, 19 March, the Feast of St Joseph. Today I spoke to Sir William Deane and requested that he and Lady Deane, two of our nation's most eminent and beloved Catholic laypeople, represent the Australian government at this very significant occasion. I am absolutely delighted that Sir William Deane accepted my invitation; indeed, he expressed that he was honoured to do so. Sir William as a former Governor-General is of course a particularly fitting Australian representative. No doubt Sir William and Lady Deane will be joined by many Australians who choose to go to Rome, and no doubt they will be joined in prayer by many, many more who will watch from home with great joy. We wish them, on that journey, and Pope Francis well in these historic days.

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:07):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I think it follows exactly a question asked to the Treasurer yesterday, which was answered yesterday. What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition, and what of course is always the backdrop to these questions from the Leader of the Opposition, is that the opposition fails to recognise that, as a result of the global financial crisis, as a result of circumstances in our economy, including the sustained high rate of the Australian dollar and the pressure it is putting on manufacturing, tourism and some other industry segments, we are seeing revenue write-downs.


What the government will always do in these circumstances is focus on jobs. I had the opportunity a little earlier today to make a major statement about our focus on jobs, on putting the jobs and opportunities of Australians first—that is what we will always do.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:08):  The Leader of the Opposition chooses to take words out of context and to twist the meaning of what the Treasurer said. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the Treasurer's full answers in this parliament.


I would also say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to be taken seriously on questions of budget accounting, if he wants to be taken seriously on his often-stated desire to return to surplus, then he cannot at the same time come into this parliament and oppose savings measures. We have been treated to the farce over the last few days—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I note in passing that in fact the Leader of the Opposition is the only person at the dispatch box who has an economics degree, but putting that to one side for the moment—




A government member interjecting—





Mr Pyne:
  Well, where's your economics degree from? The point of order is that the Prime Minister was asked a very straightforward question—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Leader of the House will resume his seat. That was an absolute abuse of the right to take a point of order. If you had come to the dispatch box and asked for relevance, I would have actually said the Prime Minister should return to the question before the dispatch box. But, if everyone wants to keep using the word 'you' in respect of their economics degrees: mine is from Melbourne Uni. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. You can tell already it's Thursday from the student politics performance we are seeing over there. Any time that the Manager of Opposition Business wants to come and look at my academic transcripts, studying economics at Adelaide and Melbourne universities, he is more than welcome to—in fact, I think I still have the textbooks in the shed; he can have those as well.


But to the Leader of the Opposition—

The SPEAKER:  Order! If individuals would like to hear an answer, we do need silence. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  To the Leader of the Opposition: no-one is going to be reassured about his competence because he went boxing and played rugby 30-odd years ago. A reassurance about his economic competence would be taking a consistent approach to questions of surplus— (Time expired)

 (Banks) (14:50):  My question is the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Will the minister update the House on the operation of the carbon price and related changes to the tax system for working people? What has been the impact of the carbon price on the economy and jobs so far?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:50):  I would like to thank the member for Banks for his question, because the carbon price has been operating now for nearly nine months. Despite all of the absurd, ridiculous and mendacious predictions from those opposite, the fact is that the economy is growing, jobs are growing and emissions are falling. In the first six months of the carbon price, emissions in the national electricity market in fact fell by 8.6 per cent. As we have heard already in question time, 71,000 jobs were created in the last month and 920,000 jobs have been created since Labor was elected to government.


Beyond that, the government uses the carbon price revenue and has done so to make significant tax cuts for low-and middle-income earners. We have done that by trebling the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200. The fact is this: that reform has freed up one million people from having to lodge a tax return and is providing tax cuts to over seven million people. In fact, 6.3 million people have received a tax cut of at least $300 a year.


But not everyone supports those tax cuts, of course. Last week, I was on a radio panel discussion with the shadow Treasurer. I asked him during that interview, 'Are you going to reduce the tax-free threshold?' He replied, 'Well, we've said that.' So let's get it absolutely clear: the Liberal Party will be increasing taxes on low- and middle-income earners; they will be reducing the tax-free threshold—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order on the question of relevance. The precedent is that quoting opposition policies is not directly answering the question and therefore he is out of order and should be asked to either sit down or return precisely to the question.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will refer to the question before the chair.




Mr COMBET:
  It is entirely relevant to the question. The fact of the matter is that the coalition will reduce the tax-free threshold—reverse the reform that the government made. They will increase income tax for over seven million people. The coalition will bring the lowest paid one million Australians back into the tax system. They will have to fill out a tax return and many of them will have to pay additional tax. It is a tax hike on over seven million people. That is coalition policy. There is no objection to it. That is the fact of the matter and the shadow Treasurer has confirmed it time and time again.


We have the opposition leader endeavouring to re-present himself to the community as a sensitive and caring character who understands the cost of living, but what rank hypocrisy it actually is, because he does not understand it at all. He is taking a policy position to the election to increase taxes for over seven million Australian people. I will tell you what: we do not mind campaigning on that issue.

As a result there has been no opportunity to consider any unintended consequences or conflicts with existing laws and regulations.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (15:14):  Our democracy depends on a free press as much as it depends on free elections. The work that journalists do, the work that newspapers, broadcasters and website bloggers do, is as important as the work that we do here as legislators. A key test of a democracy is the extent to which the press is free—not free from anything but free from government. Around the world the greatest threat to press freedom is governments—governments that seek to have the press tell them what they want. We know that every government feels it is being treated unfairly by the press, and I have to say that any government that read the press every day and was satisfied with the reports would have a press that was not doing its job. The job of the press is to make governments and the powerful uncomfortable. The job of journalists is to uncover wrongdoing. The job of journalists is to hold governments to account. I will come to some great examples of that in a moment. 


When you have a government in a country such as ours which has never sought to regulate newspapers—to interfere with the content of newspapers in peacetime—take that step for government oversight of the content and the standards of newspapers, that is an incredibly big step. That is a momentous moment. It begins with a walk with the Public Interest Media Advocate and could end with a press that is virtually controlled by the government. Keeping government's hands off the press is fundamental; it is vital to our democracy. So, you would think that if a government, a competent government—were we to have one—were even to consider a step such as this, it would do so with the greatest of care, with the greatest consultation, with lengthy hearings, with extensive debate. 


But, oh, no. These so-called media reforms are really a jumble of measures, each of which has virtually nothing to do with the others—some relate to licence fees, some to content, some to newspapers. They are a complete dog's breakfast of measures which have no coherent unity among them. They have been flung into the parliament by Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and the only question that his action has settled is this: he is without question the least competent minister in this most shambolic and inept of governments. Yesterday, when the Leader of the House was sitting opposite me, I asked him to nominate a more incompetent minister and he was unable to nominate one. So that title is without question. 




Mr Adams:
  What about the editor of the Australian?




Mr TURNBULL:
  Clearly, honourable members opposite have some other nominations for the most incompetent minister. I will put my case to you. Senator Conroy has been unable to persuade the proprietors of television stations, including Mr Kerry Stokes, that they should accept a media law package which includes a 50 per cent cut in their licence fees. Anyone who cannot sell a 50 per cent cut in licence fees to a television station proprietor must be the worst salesman of all time. I put it to you, Madam Speaker, Senator Conroy could not sell fresh fish to starving seals. This is a long cavalcade of incompetence. This is the same government that introduced a mining tax that generated little or no revenue. We should give credit where credit is due—the gentleman's name has been bandied around today, and the truth is that the only Labor politician so far that has succeeded in spreading the benefits of the mining boom is Mr Eddie Obeid. It is fair to say he has spread it fairly narrowly within his immediate family, but every single one of the profound defects in the way this government operates is on display here: a lack of consultation, even a lack of consultation within their own cabinet. 


Yesterday we even had the chief executive of News Limited, Kim Williams, say that he had not been engaged by the government in the preparation and the discussions relating to this legislation. Whether you are a fan of News Limited or not, whether you are a fan of Kim Williams or not, they do employ 14,000 Australians. It is a large media company and, just as the government would have been well advised to consult the mining industry before they introduced that hopeless mining tax, so you should talk to the various stakeholders and interest groups within the media industry before you proceed. The reality is that this is a case of malicious, malevolent intent, revenge directed at the News Limited newspaper group, coupled with that characteristic indelible, unmistakable Conrovian incompetence.


I say this to you, Madam Speaker: in terms of the importance of protecting freedom of speech and freedom of the press, remember this: I mentioned Mr Eddie Obeid a moment ago, and it was not a government agency or the New South Wales police or in fact ICAC that uncovered what appears to be the largest example of corruption in our lives—the scale of the corruption is colossal; it disgraces the Labor Party indelibly. Who uncovered that? Kate McClymont, one courageous journalist working for the Sydney Morning Herald. She was able to pursue that because of cooperation and collaboration with the ABC—cooperation between media outlets which this government is threatening to ban. Imagine that! Is it a payback against Kate McClymont as well?


The coalition is profoundly opposed to any measures which restrict freedom of the press. We know that if we are fortunate enough to be returned to government, we will grind our teeth at the injustices meted out to us by the newspapers of the day. We will rant and rage against the unfair broadcasts and criticisms of us. We know all that, but we know that that is vital to our democracy and we would never seek to restrict that freedom.


The government has tried to suggest that the Public Interest Media Advocate is just a sort of teddy bear and is not going to involve any serious restriction on the newspaper industry. Senator Conroy told the ABC AM program:


The public interest advocate when it comes to the Press Council functions is simply a registration function, that the Press Council itself is upholding its own positions.


What Australians want to see is the media be accountable through the Australian Press Council. The Government or the advocate are not changing a single standard that the Press Council currently has.


Yet, as we know from the language of the bill itself, the Public Interest Media Advocate will judge the extent to which standards formulated under the news media self-regulation scheme, the Press Council, deal with privacy, fairness, accuracy and all other matters relating to the professional conduct of journalism. If the Public Interest Media Advocate comes to the conclusion that the Press Council is not doing its job and deregisters the Press Council, then all of its members will lose the exemptions under the privacy law without which they are not able to conduct their business. If a newspaper or media group that is covered decides it does not want to join the Press Council, as the West Australian has decided—and that should be its perfect right—it will not have the protection of the exemptions under the Privacy Act. This is getting the government, through this bureaucrap, absolutely, directly involved in the standards that affect journalism.


There is an even more sinister element here. We have many laws that deal or relate to media industry acquisitions. In terms of diversity and competition, the competition regulator, the ACCC, has extensive powers under its act and, of course, has recently used them to ensure that Kerry Stokes did not buy a larger share in Fox. So, there is protection there already. This new regulator will be able to approve or prevent media acquisitions if they fail a public interest test. What does that mean? It is a completely vague concept which is utterly unworkable in any practical sense and meaningless because it has no other purpose than to protect not the public interest but political interest. Every media acquisition will require extensive consultation with the government. It will be the government that will determine who can buy what newspaper.


Of course governments will make those decisions on political grounds, just as the Labor Party government did in 1986 when it allowed Rupert Murdoch to buy the Herald and Weekly Times group. That is a very important point to bear in mind, because it was not the coalition. We are accused of being lickspittles of the media moguls. Let me tell you: I have been involved with media moguls most of my life. I have never seen anything as sycophantic as a Labor politician in the presence of a billionaire. Remember this: they rant and rave about media concentration but they allowed Rupert Murdoch's News Limited to buy the Herald and Weekly Times in 1986, and that is what gave Murdoch the domination of the metropolitan daily newspaper market. In the nearly 30 years that has intervened, Murdoch still has the same domination in the metropolitan dailies, but the slice of the overall news and information pie represented by newspapers gets smaller every day because we have never had such a diversity of voices, courtesy of the technology of the internet, that we have available today. We have access to more news, more views, more opinion and more sources of factual information than ever before.


Social media alone gives every individual their own little megaphone, which, if aggregated with others, can be an enormous megaphone. It means that politicians such as any of us do not have to suck up to an editor or a producer to get our views out into the public domain. We can post them via social media on our own sites on Twitter or on Facebook and we can be heard. We have a more diverse media world than we have ever had. Yet this is the moment, a time when diversity is greater than ever and a time when it is actually increasing and not diminishing, when the Labor Party—the architects of the largest media acquisition in our country's history, the one that created the dominance of metropolitan newspapers that they rail against today—say we must regulate the media.


We know that their motives have nothing to do with diversity. They have nothing to do with protecting a diversity of voices. What they want to do is pay back News Limited. They want to send a message to Kim Williams and his editors that says: 'If you don't play nice, there will be a stick waiting for you. If you don't play nice, next time you want to buy something, next time you want to buy a business like Alan Kohler's Business Spectator and the Eureka Report, you're going to have to pass the Public Interest Media Advocate's public interest test. That's going to be, of course, whether we think you pass our political interest test.'


I say this to you, Madam Speaker, if by some mischance this shambolic set of reforms manages to get through this parliament, if we are returned to government after the election, we will repeal them. If this Labor Party, this Labor government, gives to future governments the tools to manipulate the media, we will disown them and abandon them, and we will return Australia's media to the state it has today of being free.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (15:29):  Let us take a considered and careful look at the record on free speech, since that is the way in which this has been put by the member for Wentworth. Let us compare the hysterical rhetoric that we have just heard from the member for Wentworth, and the hysterical rhetoric from a whole range of people on the other side of this chamber, with what has actually happened in terms of historical facts.


The Labor Party has always been the party which stands up for freedom of speech and democracy in this country. It is the Labor Party which has for over a century now fought for the protection of democratic values. It is the Labor Party which has fought for legal protections which allow all Australians—all Australians—to exercise their right to speak freely and engage in democracy, not just those with the most vitriolic views.


The ability of citizens to speak freely and to openly debate the issues of the day is a hallmark of a robust democracy, and I suspect that the member for Wentworth might be able to agree with that statement. The right of all citizens to speak freely is one of our most highly valued and fiercely protected rights. Freedom of association is another right which is valued and fiercely protected. Voting rights are another key part of democracy—so is giving the right to all our citizens to enjoy fully the benefits of our democracy. Without those rights, freedom of speech becomes meaningless in practice, and that is why Labor has fought not only for freedom of speech but also for all those other rights.


Australia's first racial discrimination act was passed under Prime Minister Whitlam. The establishment of the Human Rights Commission occurred under Prime Minister Hawke. The Sex Discrimination Act gave new rights to more than half our population. I could mention the introduction by the Hawke government of section 327 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which prohibits a person interfering with the free exercise of any political right in relation to an election. Native title and, with it, the fundamental recognition of the rights of first Australians was introduced of course under Prime Minister Keating. It was Labor that created section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1995, ensuring that hate speech and racial vilification has no place in Australia and that vulnerable groups in our community enjoy to the full the right to be an Australian citizen and the right to enjoy the benefits of our community—that is a provision which this Liberal Party has pledged to repeal. Or I could mention the Disability Discrimination Act, giving rights to some of our most vulnerable Australians; it too was passed by Labor. Once again, today, we are passing landmark legislation to create a National Disability Insurance Scheme. 


Our government has appointed a new Children's Commissioner—one of the first acts I was able to take as the new Attorney-General—to represent and speak out for those who have a smaller voice in Australian society. And it was our government that repealed Work Choices, which of course limited Australians' right to freedom of association. Australians in 2007, with their vote, overwhelmingly rejected the restriction on their liberty and on their right to organise that were bound up in that Work Choices legislation. It is our government that has asked an independent monitor to consider national security assessments of irregular maritime arrivals; established a parliamentary human rights scrutiny committee; and required all ministers to report on compliance of laws with human rights principles.


It was our government that introduced the most significant pro-disclosure reforms to the Freedom of Information Act since the act was first passed. We have removed application fees, we have abolished the conclusive certificates that were so beloved by the Howard government and we have introduced free decision-making time for journalists. We have established the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. It is the Labor Party that has always been, and will continue to be, the champion of individual liberties, enshrining these protections in law. 


By contrast, we have seen a lot of empty posturing about free speech from the Liberal and National parties. The member for Wentworth took it to perhaps the heights of the overblown rhetoric we have seen on this subject when he said yesterday—and I will quote him, because the level of bluster and rhetoric he reached was so startling:


Freedom is at stake, liberty is at stake, democracy is at stake …


The member for Wentworth's credibility is at stake if he thinks that those comments are appropriate to this legislation that has been proposed. The Liberal Party's credibility is at stake if they seriously think democracy is at stake because of these reforms.


Let us look at a few more historical facts here. Democracy can be said to have been truly at stake when the Liberal Party, the same Liberal Party that sits opposite us now, tried to outlaw a political party in 1950. That is what Liberal Prime Minister Menzies did—tried to outlaw a political party, which of course the Australian people resoundingly rejected at a referendum. We can go further back in time and point to the same Menzies, not as Prime Minister but as a minister, trying to prevent Czech socialist Egon Kisch, a famous case, from even entering Australia because of his political views. In contrast, Labor did not seek to prevent the right-wing extremist Geert Wilders from entering Australia this year. We can point to other examples of such conduct by this Liberal Party while in government, such as Sir Robert Menzies repeatedly suppressing damaging media stories with D-notices or, indeed—to bring it a bit more up to date—the conduct of the Howard government, which repeatedly used conclusive certificates to prevent freedom-of-information releases, and those, of course, as I have mentioned, are provisions which the Labor Party has repealed in government.


You could say that democracy was truly at stake when the Liberal Party, under the leadership of former Prime Minister Howard, wanted to and did impose gag orders on churches and charities in exchange for funding. Labor has lifted that ban. If we are going to talk about freedom of speech and freedom to participate in political debate in this country, let us remember it is Labor that lifted that ban, allowing charities to speak freely and to participate in political debate, and made sure that there will be no such bans in the future. But this Liberal Party, in its Liberal National Party manifestation in Queensland, has not given up on gagging charities and churches or anyone else who has an opposing view. The Queensland LNP government has not only imposed gag orders on churches and charities but has removed funding from organisations which speak out against that government. Now, that is democracy at stake, not the imagined and overblown, rhetorical opposition that has been raised to these media reforms. And it is not surprising—it is not something that should surprise any Australian, given the history of the conservative parties in Queensland. It was of course the Bjelke-Petersen government that dispatched secret police to keep records on individuals and on Indigenous activists; it was the Bjelke-Petersen government that banned street marches and locked up individuals for protesting. That is the attitude of the conservative parties in this country to free speech.


It was under the Howard Liberal government that two journalists faced jail for contempt. If we are going to talk about freedom of the press we should remind ourselves of what was the actual conduct of the Liberal Party while in government: to stand by and do nothing when two journalists were faced with jail for contempt of court for refusing to reveal their sources. By contrast, this Labor government has introduced journalist shield laws to make sure that that situation cannot occur again, to protect the freedom of the press to do their work, to protect freedom of speech in this country.


Democracy was truly at stake when the Howard government restricted voting rights by passing laws that cut off the rolls as soon as an election was announced, bringing it forward by nearly a month, to make sure that thousands of young Australians and other people who had not got on the roll were disenfranchised. That is something that puts democracy at stake, not these media reforms.


We could point to the Liberal Party's hero Peter Costello fighting all the way to the High Court to resist giving News Limited journalist Michael McKinnon Treasury information under the Freedom of Information Act. Labor has removed gag clauses. Labor is allowing charities and churches once again to speak freely and contribute to robust democratic debate in Australia. Labor has improved journalist shield laws. Labor is developing whistleblower legislation.


It is not a stretch to say that the party of which the member for Wentworth is a part is now much closer to the American Tea Party than it has ever been before. It is a party that is focused on selfishness. It is a party that is focused on unregulated big business more than ever before. It is ridiculous to think that liberalism has anything to do with the dries that are now occupying the benches on the other side of this chamber. We see through the Liberal Party's sanctimonious posturing in relation to media reform. It is, as usual, simply backing self-interest and jumping on the bandwagon.


Let us take a brief, considered look at this current free-speech debate that has been put forward in response to the media reforms. Journalists occupy an extremely privileged position in our democracy—they have access to information that no other business, no government nor the average man or woman on the street can access. The onus is on journalists to protect and keep the confidentiality of their sources. The reform that we are talking about does not force journalists to reveal their sources; what it does is to focus attention on Australians' personal information. It is a package of reforms that will enhance privacy for Australians. It will ensure that the media deals with photographs and personal data in an appropriate and entirely responsible fashion, and it will be modelled on self-regulation.


I want to mention a perhaps-overlooked fact in this debate: the provision that we are seeking to amend, section 7B(4) of the Privacy Act, was placed there by the Liberal government in 2000. It was placed there when the Privacy Act was extended from its previous form, which just dealt with government, to the whole of the private sector. That is the provision we are dealing with—the provision which says, in simple terms, that journalists are exempt from the provisions of the Privacy Act provided they work for a recognised organisation that signs up to a code that says there will be an observance of privacy protections. All that is occurring with this proposed amendment is the use of the same provision, one that was put there by the Liberal Party in government. I would like to note what Senator Ian Campbell said in the second reading speech in 2000 on this very provision. He said in the Senate:


The media in Australia have a unique and important role in keeping the Australian public informed.


In developing the Bill the Government—


that is, the Liberal government—


has sought to achieve a balance between the public interest in allowing a free flow of information to the public through the media and the individual's right to privacy.


In order to achieve this balance, the Bill does not apply to acts and practices of media organisations in the course of journalism— 


and this is the important bit—


where the media organisation has publicly committed itself to observing published standards that deal with privacy in a media context.


The Liberal Party, too, expects the media to uphold these standards—and that is the context in which we should be seeing this. The Liberal Party in government put in place an exemption for journalists. That exemption will be continued. It was a conditional exemption when they legislated for it; it will be a conditional exemption under these reforms as well—and the condition is that the journalist is someone employed by an organisation that is going to observe privacy standards. It is not particularly complicated, nor is it some massive intrusion, as has been suggested here. We will be continuing to use self-regulation. The Press Council will continue to be in existence and it will develop the standards. It will not be the independent Public Interest Media Advocate who is developing the standards; it will be the self-regulating Press Council which is developing the standards. The Public Interest Media Advocate is going to consult with the federal Privacy Commissioner, Tim Pilgrim, who will take into account Australians' privacy protections in the media and decide whether or not the standards that are developed by the Press Council are appropriate.


We could take a look at the member for Wentworth's own record on free speech. Just yesterday he encouraged Senator Conroy to sue News Limited—and it is not surprising, because the member for Wentworth is an expert on using defamation writs to silence his critics. He sued the Sydney Morning Herald over a piece involving an allegations about an ex-girlfriend's cat. He went after the Australian Financial Review because of an article calling him 'part polymath, part sociopath'. He has a long track record of using defamation writs to silence free speech.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-03-14,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (15:44):  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on a matter of public importance. I would like to start by contrasting two quotes. The first is from Winston Churchill, who said:


A free press is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men prize; it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny … Under dictatorship the press is bound to languish, and the loudspeaker and the film to become more important. But where free institutions are indigenous to the soil and men have the habit of liberty, the press will continue to be the Fourth Estate, the vigilant guardian of the rights of the ordinary citizen.


That is a very important quote. I would like to contrast that quote with another from a very famous person, Lenin. Back in 1920, Lenin said:


Why should any man be allowed to buy a printing press and disseminate pernicious opinions calculated to embarrass the government?


Well, this is a government that has made an art form of embarrassing itself. It does not even really need the assistance of a printing press to do that; it is doing it all by itself.


But I must say that it is a sad day for democracy in Australia, a sad day for the history of the Australian parliament, when the opposition has been forced to bring on a debate to defend the freedom of the press from a democratically elected government seeking to muzzle its influence. Make no mistake, the media reforms introduced into the parliament by the government this morning are nothing more than a full-frontal attack on the freedom of the press in this country. It should not be for the government to approve the standards by which the media outlets must conduct themselves.


This debate about free-press controls and the reform of the media industry provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the key parliamentary figures involved in this matter. On the government side, we have the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy is quite famous—for nothing particularly good, I might say, but he is quite famous. He is famous for bragging that he has unfettered power over the telecommunications industry in Australia and that he could make senior executives of Australia's major telecommunications companies 'wear red underpants on their head'. Would you like to hand control of what good media reporting is to a minister who has claimed that he has the authority to make telecommunications company executives wear red underpants on their head? I think not. He is also famous for overturning the Australia Network tender process because the preferred tender came from a company that he in fact despised. I could go on, but those two examples give a fair indication of the type of man we are dealing with. I need say no more.


But on the other hand, on the coalition side, we have the shadow minister for communications, the member for Wentworth, and he has a track record in relation to freedom of speech. It was the member for Wentworth, the shadow minister for communications, who rose to prominence by standing up to the establishment and defending free speech in the Spycatcher trial. His reputation goes before him.


The contrast could not be more obvious. The government only support freedom of the press when it suits them. We on this side of the House recognise that freedom of the press is the foundation stone of a democracy. On the other side, we have a minister who spends his days attempting to deceive and mislead this parliament and the Australian people about the true status of the NBN, and in his spare time he is now attempting to muzzle the media.


For this reason, we are resolute in our opposition to the government's proposal to regulate the media. Not only are we opposed to the government's attempts to control the media on an ideological basis; we are also appalled by the chaotic handling of this issue and the minister's insistence that these reforms must be rammed through this parliament. We found out this morning that the minister rammed the changes through cabinet, even though some of his senior colleagues were absent from the meeting. The minister rammed these changes through the Labor caucus despite the protests of the caucus chairman. The arrogance of this minister is breathtaking.


The bills introduced this morning should be subject to a major Senate inquiry. They should have been released for comment before being introduced into this House. The key stakeholders should have been consulted. At the very least, the cabinet should have been given time to read the papers. At the very, very least, the cabinet ministers should have had the chance to read the papers before being asked to approve them.


These are typical bullying tactics from Senator Conroy. I have a message for the minister: these tactics may work in your factional fights within the Victorian ALP, but they are not appropriate in this parliament and have no place in this parliament.


As the shadow minister for regional communications and a member representing a regional electorate, I am also bothered by the government's approach to the reach rule. Geographical boundaries are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the media landscape. Media consumers are accessing news and entertainment on demand, from all over Australia and the world. In years gone by, someone living in my town of Coffs Harbour would have had access to a local newspaper—whichever newspapers were delivered to the local newsagent. Now we have access to newspapers from all around the world. We used to have a choice of two TV stations. Now we have more than a dozen digital television stations and access to online videos from many, many sources. People are getting their local news and stories from blogs and websites as well as the local newspaper. We have YouTube and scores of other sources. So, while the reach of traditional television networks is still restricted by law, the reach of new media is unlimited. With this in mind, changing the current reach rule does not appear to be an unreasonable proposition.


However, I am deeply concerned about the possibility that mergers between television networks could result in a reduction in the amount of quality locally significant content broadcast in the regions. Unfortunately, the government has given the new joint select committee only one day to examine how the reach rule might impact on local news services and what measures should be put in place to protect local content. This is a very complex issue and the amount of time being offered for consideration does not do justice to it. We need to have proper scrutiny, proper analysis, and we need the opportunity for stakeholders to make a meaningful contribution. These are measures that need to be properly thought through and they ought to be subject to thorough parliamentary scrutiny. A one-day inquiry and the deadlines imposed by the minister with regard to these bills fall far short of the standard of proper parliamentary scrutiny that the members of this House see as appropriate.


The free-to-air television body Free TV Australia made two submissions to the Convergence Review which advocated the removal of the reach rule. We have now seen two of the three main free-to-air networks air concerns about removing the reach rule and one national network enter into preliminary merger discussions with a regional network pending the removal of the reach rule. It is clear that some stakeholders are eager for the reach rule to be removed, and some believe that removing the reach rule would be detrimental to business. I mention these background issues to make the point that removing the reach rule is a complex issue that requires more scrutiny than can be provided in a one-day committee meeting. 


Despite the complexity of the issue, the bottom line is quite simple: we will not be railroaded into supporting an outcome that is not in the best interest of our constituents. We will only be satisfied with the outcome if it protects local content and local news. Despite the rise of the internet, Australians living in the regions still rely on their local television network as their key source of local news and stories. We must not allow any changes that reduce the amount of local content and storytelling broadcast in regional licence areas.


I am also concerned about the impact on local presence if the reach rule is removed. Whilst these are separate issues, they are linked. Local news and content is important, but it is also important to have reporters and cameramen on the ground in the regions. We need to have local news and stories told by local people, not by some syndicated network 3,000 kilometres away, where the individual involved cannot even pronounce the local place names. Holders of regional broadcast licences are using limited public spectrum to make money. In return, the least we can expect is that they broadcast material relevant to that licence area. 


This government has a history of introducing rushed and ill-considered reforms and seeking to avoid the harsh glare of public and parliamentary scrutiny. We will participate in the joint select committee in good faith, but we will not be rushed into supporting an outcome that is not good for our constituents, we will not be rushed into any measures that will reduce freedom of speech for the press and we will not be rushed into playing the minister's games—a minister who cannot be trusted. He cannot be trusted with the NBN and he certainly cannot be trusted with media reform.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (15:54):  This is a matter of importance. The debate on the member for Wentworth's motion is very, very important because it says that there is a threat posed to free speech by the government's proposed media reforms. But at the heart of the Labor government's media reforms—as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker—is the potential for further concentration of media ownership in Australia.




Mr Hawke:
  Rubbish!




Mr MURPHY:
  It is not rubbish. If the member for Mitchell listens to me he will understand better. I have been in this place for 15 years, and every time this issue rears its ugly head I have been an outspoken opponent of concentration of media ownership. 


I will accept the point that the member for Wentworth made in relation to the Labor government's allowing News Limited, Mr Murdoch, to buy the Herald and Weekly Times—and we understand the politics of that time. I disagreed with it; I still disagree with it. It certainly allowed News Limited and the Murdoch family to get a stranglehold on the print media in Australia. Even more shameful for the government of the day, our government, was the fact that the Foreign Investment Review Board somehow, conveniently, looked the other way when Mr Murdoch decided to abandon his Australian citizenship and become an American citizen to dominate the media internationally, starting in America and the UK, while being allowed to keep his media assets in Australia. I opposed that. I was not here at the time; I certainly would have railed against that if I had been.


We have not heard from the member for Wentworth or the member for Cowper about the potential for concentration of media ownership in Australia. For the benefit of those members, and the member for Mitchell, I will remind the House that the Murdoch media owns 70 per cent of the metropolitan daily newspapers in Australia. They own more than 50 per cent of the regional and suburban newspapers in Australia. They now have a 50 per cent monopoly share in Foxtel in Australia; interests in AAP, HarperCollins Publishers and other publishers; and have one of the most accessed sites on the internet: news.com.au.


I do not have any problem with the so-called propaganda, that has been referred to in recent days, by the Murdoch media. The Murdoch media have the right to run the stories however they like but they do not have the right to drown out all the other voices. And this is what is going to happen without this legislation. And that is why I feel so passionately about it.


Those on both sides of the House—whether they are in the Labor Party or the Liberal Party—are guilty of surrendering to the power of the media moguls in Australia. And that is wrong. If this legislation goes through it will preclude Mr Lachlan Murdoch from getting control of a free-to-air television network—and I am referring specifically to the Network Ten—and being able to buy radio stations.


What do you think would happen if the Murdoch family were able to get control of a free-to-air television network in Australia? I will tell you. The lucrative sporting dollar would flow principally to the Murdoch family. They have the game sown up with Foxtel. It is a very convenient way to get around the antisiphoning legislation so that the most attractive programs that have to be run on free-to-air television will be run by channel 10 under Mr Lachlan Murdoch, extracting the best advertising dollar. And what will that do to Channel 7, Channel 9, the ABC and the SBS, in terms of their capacity to broadcast sport and provide a bit of competition? It will neuter them. What will they be left with? They will be left with broadcasting the lawn bowls and programs like that. Okay, it might be fair enough for those people who like lawn bowls but it is not very lucrative like the Rugby League, the cricket, the Melbourne Cup, World Cup soccer and the Olympic Games—all the principal sporting events. 


I draw to the attention of the previous speakers, and the member for Mitchell, a very sober and balanced analysis in response to all the hysteria led by Mr Kim Williams, the chief executive of News Limited in Australia, in relation to this package. Mr Richard Ackland, who is a very respected commentator, says:


The self-righteous bloviating from press interests, and the shrill coverage from News Limited papers in particular, leads to the suspicion that Senator Conroy can't be far wrong with his tiny package of media reforms.


The Daily Telegraph, without a glimmer of irony, thinks it is an ''aggressive attempt to silence your media''.


Kim Williams, Rupert Murdoch's provincial governor, said this is the first government outside of wartime to ''attack freedom of speech''.


The ever-reliable ''professor'' David Flint thinks the media plan is an assault on the very foundations of our federation.


Opposition spokesman Malcolm Turnbull declared—


as the Attorney-General said in his speech, repeated here—


''Freedom is at stake, liberty is at stake, democracy is at stake.''


It is at stake if our laws do not go through the parliament, because there will be a concentration of media ownership. I will go on, for the benefit of the member for Mitchell, who is still in the chamber, so he knows what Mr Ackland said. The article continues:


And this from a Liberal Party spokesman whose leader has growled at the ABC about its ''bias'' and about whom the public broadcaster lives in fear of retribution.


What is really at stake is how far these special pleaders can get away with their over-egged rhetoric.


Maybe forgotten in the excitement is the realisation that under the Conroy plan, Murdoch's News Limited will now have its Foxtel pay TV operations subject to a public interest test for mergers and acquisitions. It can't get more shocking than that.


The main components of the Minister for Communications' announcement on Tuesday, about which the details, expected to be revealed on Thursday, are: self-regulating press standards with oversight by a public interest media advocate; and a public interest test for media mergers and acquisitions.


Some TV ''reach'' provisions are to be referred to a parliamentary committee that is expected to solve something that the free-to-air moguls can't agree on themselves. So one point at a time.


The main print standards body will still be the industry-run Australian Press Council, although the plan envisages the possibility of competing self-regulatory bodies that are approved or ''declared'' by the public interest media advocate.


The standards or codes of journalistic conduct are the ones that presently exist. The industry will remain self-regulating and no government funding is to be provided.


The PIMA would have oversight of the media councils, seeing that they were doing their jobs properly and responding to complaints appropriately.


Where's the threat to free speech, liberty and democracy in that tiddlywinks scheme?


The complaints are a bit rum when you consider that historically the press barons fought tooth and nail against the implementation of even an industry-run council. They turned on and off the funding faucet whenever it suited and generally regarded the whole process with disdain.


Now the Australian Press Council is being embraced as the rock on which our freedoms are built.


Instead of fines and torture as penalties for disobedience proposed by the Finkelstein review, it is now a carrots and sticks approach.


Journalist exemptions under the Privacy Act would apply only to those media organisations who signed up to a self-regulating press standards body. How wicked is that?


I do not have time to read the rest of it, but everyone should read it because it is a balanced and accurate reply.


I remind the House where I started: what this is all about is the future of our democracy, because this will allow concentration of media ownership in Australia. People do not vote for a media company; in a small number of cases they vote for a local member and in most cases they vote for a party, its policies and the leader. They do not vote for Rupert Murdoch.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  They vote for John Murphy now.




Mr MURPHY:
  I hope so.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:04):  This week we have seen a new low from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy with his announcement of Orwellian media reforms. Those who have followed the career of the minister—the factional power plays and the egocentric statements that he can, if he so chooses, get people to wear red underpants on their heads—might describe these Big Brother media reforms as a new low, and they might think that is a big statement. In this place, when I make such statements, I am at least protected by parliamentary privilege. But, if Senator Conroy has his way, those who critique him in the press may not be so lucky.


Why? He has announced that the government will regulate the media in this country—a media that has been, until this point, free of government control and interference. In all other longstanding democracies, the media has been free for centuries. He has said that the government now will intervene and interfere here.


Why does the media need regulation? What is the problem that he says needs solving? No-one can in fact articulate this. The Prime Minister herself, when questioned by journalists—something that may well become an inconvenience of the past if these reforms go through—ducked the question. She could not give one example. We know, though, the real reason why these so-called reforms have been brought into this place: the Greens have demanded it. Bob Brown demanded it when he was leader. He described News Limited as the 'hate media'. The member for Reid describes the media as the 'Murdoch press' and 'press barons'. Christine Milne, the new leader, is very concerned about who owns what in the media. The simple fact is that the Labor Party do not like being held to account. They do not like scrutiny. Why is this? Because a free media does not do as it is told.


A free press is critical to our democracy. That is why we stand opposed to any restrictions on the press. Winston Churchill said so accurately some time ago:


A free press is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men prize; it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny … where free institutions are indigenous to the soil and men have the habit of liberty, the press will continue to be the Fourth Estate, the vigilant guardian of the rights of the ordinary citizen.


This is why it is important. We have seen the investigative reporting of our press in recent times. We have seen them uncover the scandals of the HSU. We have seen them uncover the scandals of the Obeid empire. All of this of course is very inconvenient to those who sit opposite.


What has been the reaction to Senator Conroy's announced changes? Have they been universally acclaimed? No. His announcement has united each and every voice in the media to condemn the move. Let me remind the House of some of the statements which have been made. Kim Williams, the chief executive officer of News Limited, said:


This government will go down in history as the first Australian government outside of war time to attack freedom of speech by seeking to introduce a regime which effectively institutes government-sanctioned journalism.


Seven West Media said:


This is an unprecedented restriction that is wholly inconsistent with the notion of a free press.


Greg Hywood, the chief executive of Fairfax, said:


… there's no evidence that there is a problem to solve in Australia. We can't see the purpose of further regulation of news publications.


Andrew Bolt, the HeraldSun commentator, said:


I never dreamed—never feared—Australia would have a government plotting to control journalists it did not like. 


But lest they think that this is some media conspiracy, News Limited conspiracy, let me quote Mark Scott, the managing director of the ABC:


It's a disaster for us all. It's profoundly disappointing. The voice of industry was ignored.


Let us examine the reforms which the government says are so vitally needed. There are two in particular that I want to examine today: the new public interest test, which it says will apply to media mergers; and, secondly, the government appointed Public Interest Media Advocate.


First to the public interest test. The government is very concerned that we have a diversity of voices. Yet never before have we seen in the media such diversity as exists today. The internet has definitely changed the landscape, as has social media. We now have access to voices like we have never had before. This should give some comfort to those opposite.


Already we have regulators who look to the very questions of diversity and competition. We have the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, which actually implements the former Trade Practices Act, now the Competition and Consumer Act. They make sure that we do have competition in this space. 


Only recently the ACCC knocked back Channel 7 in its attempt to buy Fox Sports. When those opposite have been asked the question, 'What is it in particular that this public interest test will ensure does not occur?' they cannot explain it. Also, the Australian Communications and Media Authority looked to the question of diversity. Yet the government says we need to add another regulator, that we need to add a new test, a test which no doubt will cost more and a test which so far lacks any detail. If the government is truly concerned about media diversity, let me remind them that in 1986 it was the Hawke-Keating government which allowed News Limited to buy the Herald and Weekly Times. Yet it is only now, months out from an election, that the government seems to think we have an issue with media diversity.


Let me also touch on the Public Interest Media Advocate. The government say that this is vital in order to have the right ethical standards and sanctions. Yet we know that this is simply a solution in search of a problem. They cannot say what it is that the Public Interest Media Advocate will do. They also ignore the fact that we already have an independent body, a self-regulated independent body, the Australian Press Council, which does indeed regulate the ethical standards of the media.


In the time remaining, I want to touch briefly on the process which has led us to this matter of public importance today. After doing nothing for two years, Senator Conroy now claims that there is great urgency to respond to the Convergence Review and the Finklestein inquiry. He says it is an imperative to regulate the media and to pass the bill by the end of next week. We on this side are alarmed at the lack of process, the lack of due diligence, the lack of consultation and the lack of detail which have become a hallmark of this current government and the way they do business. 


I reflect upon recent initiatives of the government which have had a similar lack of process and lack of scrutiny: the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, again another Greens-Labor special, a $10 billion Bob Brown bank, with no consultation, no notice, no detail and $10 billion of taxpayers' funds being whittled away. This was all done in less than five business days and according to the timetable set by Senator Conroy. We know that he wants to put through this bill by the end of next week. There has been no detail, there has been no consultation even among the cabinet of the Labor Party. It has been rushed through to try to restrict the voice of freedom in Australia. This is something we all must stand united against.


A free press is essential for our democracy. The Conroy announcement will ensure that the media is turned into a eunuch. We must stand united against this. It will hurt our democracy and ultimately hurt the Australian people.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2013-03-14,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (16:16):  I was about to begin by saying that lately I am wondering whether there is something in Australia's drinking water. We have seen, I think, another example of it just in the last few seconds. I speak with some authority on that matter, given I am a member of the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, and I suggest that the matter raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not in conformity with the consensus view of the privileges committee. But we are here this afternoon to talk on this matter of public importance with which the opposition has led its attack on the government's current proposals for media reform.


I did not hear the quote from the member for Higgins, but I heard her quoting Sir Winston Churchill. Because I did not hear the exact quote, I am not sure where he made the quote she shared with the House—but I know it would not have been on the internet and it would not have come off YouTube; it was more likely broadcast live on the wireless. You might recall that. That is the thing before we had transistor radios and even before Video Killed the Radio Star.


I make the point that the world has changed somewhat in technological terms and in broadcast terms since the days of Winston Churchill; maybe some of those on the other side might want to keep up with some of those changes. I am wondering what this debate over the course of the last few days is really all about. I have with me two reports. They cannot be seen by those listening on radio, but one is the inquiry report of the Hon. R Finkelstein QC. It is 468 pages long. It is a weighty document and one I can claim to have read maybe 70 per cent of. I am not going to claim 100 per cent. It is weighty and time consuming, but I suspect that there are very few others—



Mr Murphy interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Reid, of course. I am confusing the seats; there have been all these changes. But I know the member for Reid has read it. He holds a great expertise in these areas.


The second document is the convergence review, which is another 176 pages. Again, I think I can claim to have read almost all of that report. Again, I have seen no evidence whatsoever that anyone on the other side who has participated in this debate has read any of those documents at length. I am even more sure that no-one who has contributed from the other side has even read the proposals put forward by the government in any great detail; because, if they have, they have completely misunderstood them or otherwise have sought to deliberately misrepresent them.


The other great thing which has changed since Sir Winston Churchill's days is that the media—the print media in particular, although radio does a pretty good job—has become increasingly bold in its reporting of matters that in Winston Churchill's time would have been considered private and therefore sacred and not for publication. The intrusion of the media into our public lives has grown extensively in recent years. That is something that cannot be challenged by those who sit opposite. That is why I am disappointed that the government has not yet further progressed the idea of a statutory tort in privacy, giving people who have had their privacy breached by media organisations or any other individual a statutory course of action.


Back to my theory about there being something in our drinking water: the campaign that was waged against Ray Finkelstein's recommendations and his report was really extraordinary, in my view. It was completely over the top and they must have been shocking to such a learned individual. They must have been a real lesson for him in the way politics works in this country. But the present self-regulatory arrangements, of course, suit Australian newspaper proprietors and, therefore, he should not have been surprised by the ferocity of some of the responses.


The Australian Press Council is a creature of the industry and is funded by the industry. It causes our newspaper owners little grief, no matter how extreme they might become from time to time in their reporting. We saw an example of that earlier this week, where the minister was depicted as Stalin and a number of other despotic leaders. As Finkelstein points out, the APC suffers from serious structural constraints. It does not have the necessary powers or the required funds to carry out its designated functions. Publishers can withdraw when they wish and order their funding as they see fit. Since the beginning this debate, they have changed some of those things in the hope of holding an intervention from government at bay, but the change has been very, very small indeed.


Letting our media police themselves is obviously, from my point of view, a mistake. It has left victims of their exaggerations and misinformation with no other option than to find redress through the courts. But, as Finkelstein points out, these processes are 'protracted, expensive and adversarial, and offer redress only for legal wrongs and not for the more frequent complaints about inaccuracies and unfairness'. While it has never delivered the desired outcomes, self-regulation is becoming less and less efficient.


Finkelstein's response was to advocate for a public regulator—a regulator completely at arm's length from the government of the day, a regulator which would be publicly funded so as not to be captured by the media proprietors themselves. I thought that was a perfectly sensible recommendation, and Finkelstein of course stands by it, but there was a huge amount of opposition from media outlets towards this public regulation and a very public campaign. The government has heard those complaints. They have taken them on board and said, 'Okay, we'll allow the industry to continue to regulate itself.' That should have been welcomed very loudly by the industry, but we put one condition on it, and that is effectively what this debate is all about. We have asked that, in future, when they construct their regulatory regimes and when they construct their processes for enforcing the standards—the standards set by themselves—those standards and those processes will be ticked off by an independent advocate looking after the public interest, an independent advocate which will take into account community expectations. This is not rocket science.


It is pretty clear to me that the front page we saw on the Telegraph this week involving Minister Conroy would surely not meet community expectation. I doubt anyone on the other side would defend that front page. This is no conspiracy. This is an independent expert, someone highly regarded in the community—it might be a former judge, for example—inviting media proprietors to come to him or her and ask, 'What are the standards as you see them? What are the standards acceptable to the Australian community?' He or she would look at those and tick them off, saying, 'I agree. I think that is a good approach. I congratulate you on your effort,' and then he or she would ask, 'How would you go about your corporate governance—your processes to ensure these standards are upheld?' and, I suppose, 'How would you ensure that any journalist or editor breaching your own standards would be dealt with?'


Those on the other side would have you believe that this is some form of government intervention. I do not think anyone on the street around our cities and towns would share that view. This is a crazy reaction to what is a fairly soft policy, certainly compared to Finkelstein's recommendations and, indeed, some of the recommendations in the convergence report. But, notwithstanding that, for some reason media proprietors have gone to war. Those on the other side, of course, see a political opportunity in that. Isn't it a shame? That is despite the fact that in my communities people are now saying we are becoming more like Fleet Street every day, the media is out of control and you cannot trust what they are saying. You would have thought that those on the other side would take a bipartisan approach and work with us to see whether we can fix these problems.


I just want to make this point, though: I believe this will restore confidence in our media publications. This will allow people to appreciate and find confidence in the fact that someone is looking over self-regulation. That restoration is a good thing for the media proprietors. The sooner they work that out the better for them and the better for the Australian community.

 (Mitchell) (16:29):  I want to thank the Leader of the House for his generosity. One person I will not thank is the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. In finishing on the Matter of Public Importance, I note that the Leader of the House is in favour of free speech—but the minister for communications is not—so I want to praise him for that generous move.


This so-called reform is a great sham. I am pleased in the time remaining to put on the record my strong opposition to what the government is doing. This minister has a track record, whether it be mandatory internet filtering or mandatory data retention. All of the things that he has tried to do use the words 'mandatory' and 'compulsory'. So I do not buy the arguments of the Attorney-General, who came in here and said, 'We're really about individualism and freedom.'


He asked, 'What is everybody really going on about?' The Prime Minister said, 'I can't believe this sanctimonious nonsense about freedom of the press.' The media are going on about these reforms which came in response to a problem from the UK. The Finkelstein report of 468 pages, which the member for Hunter raised, was from the UK. I am against these proposals. (Time expired)

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (16:30):  Six months from today, Australians can vote for fairness for our military veterans by electing a coalition government in Canberra. Only the coalition is committed to the fair indexation of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme military superannuation pensions. Under a coalition government, DFRB and DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will have their superannuation pensions indexed in the same way as age and service pensions. I have been on this since we were in government. Signing the pledge gives a written guarantee to the 57,000 military superannuants under these schemes that the coalition will keep faith with those who have served and protected Australia. This will ensure that these veterans and their families will have access to fair, just and equitable indexation of their superannuation entitlements.


In my time as a member, I have been in regular contact with members of the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Service Men and Women, West Australian Branch, known affectionately as TPIs. TPI members in my electorate have studiously and consistently advocated for the fair indexation of their pensions. As far back as 2007, Labor led people to believe it would provide a fairer deal for ex-service men and women. Labor has never delivered. Since the 2010 election, the coalition has twice tried to pass legislation through the parliament to deliver fair indexation to ex-service men and women and their families. At every attempt, Labor and the Greens have combined their numbers to defeat the legislation.


Currently, DFRDB and DFRB members have their superannuation indexed only in line with movements in the CPI. The coalition's plan provides for these superannuants, aged 55 and over, to have their superannuation pensions indexed in the same way as other Australian government income support pensions. Twice yearly, pensions will be indexed to the higher of the consumer price index, male total average weekly earnings or the pensioner beneficiary living cost index. This will provide increases for up to 57,000 retired Australian Defence Force members, with superannuation pension indexation which better reflects changes in the costs of living.


These changes have long been sought by veterans organisations, including the TPI ex-service men and women in my electorate of Tangney. These are honourable men and women who served Australia, and the coalition believes this fair indexation is the right thing to do given the nature and risks of military service. Australia's service personnel, past and present, after giving so much to their nation, deserve to live their lives with financial security.


Labor's commitment at the 2007 election to fix military superannuation has become another of its many broken promises. The Gillard Labor government has promised much to those in the veteran community but, as I have heard consistently from local TPI representatives, has repeatedly failed to deliver, due to its self-interest and poll driven policy paralysis. This Labor government is probably unable and unwilling to find the funds necessary to meet its commitment to veterans and their military superannuation reform requests because of its tide of waste. There has been more energy spent criticising the coalition's plan by this government than coming up with anything of its own. I say ex-service men and women deserve more than your empty rhetoric.


The coalition have consulted widely and listened carefully to the views put forward by veterans, ex-service personnel and others. Our plan is fully costed and fully funded. If the Labor government is re-elected in September, veterans will be worse off and will not get the fair indexation they deserve. Our veterans and their families deserve fair indexation. A coalition government will deliver it and fund it in our first budget.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (09:30):  Today I rise in this House to acknowledge the 50 years of Lifeline's contribution to Australia and especially to Queensland, my state. In Queensland, Lifeline services are operated by UnitingCare Community. Lifeline is dedicated to providing crisis support services, suicide prevention and mental health support for Australians. The key service streams include individual and community support for children, families and older persons as well as disability services and child care. This week in the parliament we were asked to wear our Lifeline badges. For those in Australia who may not have seen the Lifeline badge, it is a round badge with a series of dots on it. I believe there would be half a generation of Australians who do not understand what the dots symbolise. Back before the iPhone and before mobile phones, when we used landlines, you would speak into the mouthpiece of the phone, which is what the dots on Lifeline's badge symbolise. Lifeline's catchcry was: if life's problems are getting you down, pick up the phone and call Lifeline.


Lifeline services available in Queensland today include their crisis line, which is 131114—possibly the most symbolic of all of the programs that Lifeline runs; it is what they are known for. Lifeline also runs suicide bereavement and prevention support for individuals and groups and a disaster recovery program, which my very community has taken advantage of in the last couple of years as our electorate of Wright has been devastated and inundated with floodwaters. Lifeline offers accredited and non-accredited training direct to the public and the industry sector. UnitingCare Community is aided by over 2,600 staff and 5,600 volunteers who help and support 300 different community service programs. That is an incredible volunteer effort. In Queensland we have 130 Lifeline shops across metropolitan and rural areas, and we have 10 Lifeline centres across the state.


I take the opportunity, in closing, to advise all of my colleagues that in the parliament here we have a Parliamentary Friends of Lifeline group, and I encourage each of you to take up the challenge of being part of the Lifeline family. As a way to understanding Lifeline far better, if you are part of the community and you would like to get involved in Lifeline, there are a number of areas you can get involved in from a volunteer perspective, whether it be in their shops or in their phone counselling. Or, if you would like to get some training and some upskilling, reach out to your local Lifeline centre. Once again, I congratulate them on their 50 years. Keep up the great work, Lifeline. You are doing a great job. Australia would be a worse place without you.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:01):  I wish to speak on the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. I will say from the outset that I agree with the proposal and the words being proposed for a possible referendum, but I have been disappointed and somewhat frustrated at the way this has been handled. It is nearly 12 months since the expert panel, set up by the government to look at the constitutional recognition of local government, presented its report and we are still in the position that we are in today.


I was alarmed to read in the national presson Monday of this week that the minister is going to spend another six weeks negotiating with the states before a final decision is to be made. One of the witnesses to the inquiry in Sydney in January, the Australian Electoral Commission, indicated that, to run a referendum efficiently, you need approximately six months. Of course, we are past that point and we are getting into a narrow margin of time.


It is well known that some states are in favour of this referendum and some are opposed, but the states that are opposed made their position clear long before the words of this referendum question were made known and long before they realised what this proposal actually meant. As someone who comes from a local government background, to an extent I do not believe that this referendum goes far enough. On the other side of that, what is being proposed is basically to close up a loophole. It is to enable the federal government to directly fund local government in some programs. It is not a major overhaul of the federal-state relationship; it is not going to undermine the states' relations with local government. The programs that the federal government—sometimes on an ongoing basis, but sometimes on a temporary basis—fund for local government are very important to the people in those local government areas. The obvious one, the one that is discussed a lot, is the Roads to Recovery program. This program is seen, particularly in the bush, as the signature program. It is the ongoing legacy of John Anderson, the former member for Gwydir, that the program has been put in place. It has already had one challenge in the High Court. I believe that if the program were lost then most of the 17 local government areas in my electorate would be not viable.


The other program, if you cast your mind back to 2008, is the stimulus program implemented by the Rudd government. Many of those programs turned out to be a debacle—the insulation program and the BER program in many cases turned out to be a poor use of money.



Government members interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  I am going to give you a pat on the back in a minute, so settle down. I guarantee that the money that went to local government through those local infrastructure programs was used to good value. The money given to every local government area I am aware of that got funding directly from the federal government during that stimulus program was money well spent. Other dollars were leveraged so that the dollars that came from federal government to local government were magnified several times over. If the Rudd government at the time had given more money to local government and less to ill-thought-out and ill-conceived green programs like the pink batts program, the Australian economy would be a lot better off.


So where are we now? The government says that it wants a referendum, and there is a bit more negotiation to go through. The coalition has said that it supports the concept of recognition of local government, but there are some reservations as to the timing and the preparedness. I personally believe that, if the minister gets his skates on and gets around the states to explain to them that this is not an affront to their sovereignty but merely housekeeping to close a loophole, this is possible. I had some frustration at the Australian Local Government Association's initial input into the hearing in January, but I was somewhat relieved to see them come to a firmer position in the later hearing. Right across Australia local government bodies are prepared to come into action to fight to see this referendum succeed.


I do not know whether the reluctance of the minister to commit to doing more on this is to do with a lack of finance for the case. It is interesting that the referendum to recognise the Aboriginal people in the Constitution has now been delayed. It was given a considerable amount of funds to present the case for and against, yet at this stage there has been no promise of any funding to move on this local government referendum.


In closing, there is still time. I have told the minister that if he goes ahead with this I will do my level best to make sure that this referendum is a success. The Australian local government bodies rely on this, particularly in regional Australia. In regional Australia the local government bodies rely on direct funding, so the minister needs to bring the states into line and get this referendum underway. If he does not do that pretty well immediately then I feel that the success of the referendum would not be great. The real tragedy would be to put this referendum up in a half-baked way. It needs to happen in a way that is going to be successful.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:09):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Parkes. When I serve on committees with him he always makes a positive input and I know that in this inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government he also had a positive input. He comes from a regional area that relies heavily on the council and on funding from both state and federal government and he works hard for anything that would assist his council areas with more streamlined funding. If you have ever been to Parkes you will know that it is also now known as 'Coultontown'. He has a high presence there and I know he is enthusiastic to see that this referendum, if it goes ahead, is successful. This whole debate has been like that: everyone wants to see a successful referendum proceed.


However, I feel that, because of the lack of time we are faced with to run a successful campaign, there might not be success. During the inquiry I questioned one of the witnesses giving evidence around the earliest time any legislation could be introduced to proceed with a referendum. Under the current time line, the earliest time it could be introduced would be about budget week in May. That would leave a very short period of time for a successful information campaign about this referendum to be made public so that people could be informed. The witnesses said they did think that short-term propositions had been successfully advocated for, but I cannot think of any. At this point in time, we think that maybe we need more time to have a successful referendum.


The government has demonstrated extraordinary lack of action to put in place the preconditions that were recommended by the expert panel and other stakeholders such as the Australian Local Government Association. As a direct consequence, the time remaining between now and 14 September is likely to be insufficient to put in place the necessary mechanics, education campaigns and other measures highlighted by expert witnesses as necessary to ensure an informed outcome of the referendum question.


Coalition members are of the opinion that the referendum should only be considered once the preconditions identified by the expert panel have been met. The coalition acknowledges the constitutional uncertainty that recent High Court cases have created with respect to direct funding of local government programs by the Commonwealth. The coalition is committed to restoring funding certainty to local programs and has indicated support for the appropriate limited financial recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution as a way to achieve this. Coalition members of the committee also note that the evidence received by the committee highlighting that the program's specific funding, which is currently provided directly to local government, may still be provided in full via existing avenues that are constitutionally valid. Coalition members consider that the existence of valid alternative funding pathways to address the funding uncertainty introduced by the recent High Court cases reduces the imperative to pursue constitutional change in the face of the fact that preconditions for success highlighted by the expert panel and other stakeholders such as ALGA have not yet been met. The coalition members are mindful of the inquiry terms of reference, which called for an assessment of the likelihood of success of the referendum. They remain of the view that the recommendation of the main report, to proceed with a 2013 referendum, despite the preconditions for success not being established, places at risk many millions of taxpayers' dollars. This risk, together with the risk of a lack of informed and positive public engagement with the issue, appears to be unnecessary given the alternative pathways to ensure ongoing local government program funding should the direct model in fact be successfully challenged in the courts prior to the referendum question being put.


Regarding the lack of action by the government, the coalition's support for action to address funding issues through constitutional change has been provided subject to consideration of the specific change to be proposed by the government and the change being limited to remove the question of constitutional validity in relation to direct Commonwealth funding of local government. Similarly, it was offered in the expectation that the government would approach the consideration of any such referendum question on the basis that all practical and reasonable steps were taken to ensure the Australian population made its decision on a fully informed basis.


The government formed the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government—the expert panel—to identify options for the constitutional recognition of local government and to report on the level of support for such recognition amongst stakeholders in the general community. The expert panel's final report stated:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum (see page 16). Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process.


As such, the expert panel was supportive of the 2013 referendum on financial recognition of local government through a change to section 96 of the Constitution, provided two conditions were met. The first condition was negotiation with the states to achieve their support for the government's proposed question, and the second was to take steps, as recommended by ALGA, to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue.


The expert panel's final report was delivered in December 2011, almost two years prior to the latest possible date for the next federal election. As at that date, the government had plenty of time to ensure it took the blueprint for a referendum on financial recognition of local government as provided by the expert panel, put it in place and proceed to put the question to a voting public equipped with the benefit of a full public education campaign on the issues. As noted in the majority decision Final report on the majority finding of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government: the case for financial recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons from the history of constitutional referenda, we now have the benefit of a nominated election date, 14 September 2013. This date is some 10 weeks earlier than the latest possible date the election could have been held.


At the first hearing of this committee, reservations were expressed by ALGA with regard to timing, were a referendum to be held in conjunction with the 2013 general election. They noted that they did not consider the question should be put to the people before a number of preconditions have been met. These preconditions reflected the conditions recommended by the expert panel in their report. Coalition members note the supplementary submissions by ALGA, received after the second hearing, in which ALGA indicate they will actively support the 2013 referendum, but accept wholly the argument put by ALGA in earlier evidence of their advisability of first meeting the stated preconditions. 


As at the date of the first hearing in mid-January 2013, evidence was received that, even given the latest possible date for an election being late November 2013, the prospect of meeting those preconditions in time to hold the referendum at the same time as the election were not high. Given the nominated date for the election and the time that has since elapsed, the prospect of these preconditions being fully met by 14 September this year has only reduced. As such, the prospect of a referendum held in conjunction with this year's federal election raises serious risks that it will be held in an environment where potential consensus of stakeholders, including the states, has not been met and where the opportunity to fully inform the voting public through public education and other avenues has not been fully realised.


There has been a lack of engagement with the states and, as yet, I do not think some of the states have even responded to the minister in regard to where they stand or whether they will support this referendum. The coalition members of the committee were strongly of the view that the meeting of both of the expert panel's conditions is vital before any referendum on this issue is put to the people. Australia is a federation of states and, as the evidence attests, the support of state governments can make or break referenda. If state governments are largely opposed to change, history proves it is very difficult for referenda to pass. In the view of the coalition members, the recommendation by the expert panel that the government negotiate to achieve the states' support for financial recognition is an essential precursor to the committee being able to make a recommendation on the likelihood of the referendum being supported by the Australian people. A number of witnesses reinforced the view that, for the referendum to be successful, states either had to be actively supportive of the measure or at least run dead on the issue.


I quote the conclusion to our dissenting report to the report of the inquiry:


Coalition members noted that the Chair’s Preliminary Report recommended action be taken immediately to put in place the necessary steps to hold the referendum in conjunction with the 2013 Federal election.


We held concerns that the time was insufficient but remained open to the prospect that such immediate action may address those concerns. However, it is clear that such urgent and immediate action has not occurred and seven weeks has passed with little if any progress.


Coalition members are now of the opinion that the time remaining between now and the nominated election date of 14 September 2013 is insufficient to put in place all the necessary mechanics, formal, informal and partisan education campaigns and to otherwise ensure an informed outcome for the referendum question.


We acknowledge concerns regarding the impact of further High Court cases that may impact on the constitutionality of direct payments to local governments by the Commonwealth and that delays in granting constitutional financial recognition may come at a cost to the many valuable services provided at a local government level.


As noted, the Committee received constitutional evidence that clearly demonstrates that avenues exist for funding currently provided directly to local government, to still be provided in full, even in the face of (potential) judicial findings that direct payments are not constitutional.


The most obvious avenue is through grants through the states, tied on the basis that they must be both passed on in full and subject to use for the programs currently funded (or as directed under future Commonwealth-local government programs).


Coalition members acknowledge that this is a less clean avenue than direct payment, but accept the evidence that options such as this are available and that, accordingly, there is likely to be no potential risk of loss of funding to local government, eventuating from further developments following the Pape and Williams cases.


As such, we consider there to be little financial risk to local government in delaying the holding of a referendum on financial recognition of local government in the Constitution, until such time as the conditions previously discussed have been met.


As such, Coalition members of the Committee recommend that a referendum on the issue of financial recognition of local government only be held after the pre-conditions posed by the Expert Panel and those previously promoted by ALGA, have been met.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:22):  I rise to speak on the final report of the majority finding of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, the case for financial recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons from the history of constitutional referenda, including the dissenting reports.


The coalition has committed to support the appropriate financial recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution—that is our policy. Back in December 2011, the expert panel produced—and I was very honoured to serve on that expert panel—its recommendation. The final report said, and this was back in December 2011:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA—


the Australian Local Government Association—


necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum … Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process.


That was December 2011. They were very clear recommendations with a very clear way forward—and what did the government and the minister do with those recommendations? Zip. Absolutely nothing. Once again, they are either setting this up to fail or they are just not interested in this program. They made an election promise to have a referendum on this issue, but they have done nothing to support it in any way.


There are a whole range of thoughts and views out in the public arena. Some people think that this is all an undercover plot to take over state governments; I assure you, it is not. But, unless we run an informed public awareness campaign, those are the sorts of messages that are going to get up in the public arena. That is why the expert panel—and, indeed, this second committee—came up with the same conclusion: we need to talk to the states and we need to run a public awareness campaign.


That was the recommendation in 2011. It is now the recommendation two years later, and the government has done nothing. The minister is reprehensible in his lack of action on this issue. Where is the funding for ALGA? Where is the funding for this campaign? The government was quick to give the Indigenous community $10 million to help them with their public awareness campaign, but to show its lack of interest and lack of support for this particular issue it has given nothing, committed nothing, to the Australian Local Government Association for their public awareness campaign, which was a recommendation that came out of the December 2011 report and again in the report from the committee that we have just had—because if you do not want to do something, form another committee and take the time to do nothing. That is the hallmark of this Labor government.


There is no doubt that we have issues with funding for local government and, indeed, the Pape and Williams cases show that there are issues going forward. But as Professor AJ Brown said in his comments to the hearing that we held in Sydney earlier this year, this constitutional change should not be seen as anything more than a new conduit for funding to local government. It is not about taking away the rights of state governments; it is more about looking at funding more money to local government. His report states: 


… this is a mechanism for local government to get a larger agreed share of the total financial pie. That is what local government is legitimately looking for and that is what it should be looking for. State governments are incrementally allowing local government a larger share of responsibility and resources in the federal system as a whole, as is the federal government. When anything major happens, the first thing that both federal and state governments agree on, once they have agreed that they need to do something, is who is going to do it, and more often than not local government plays a huge role.


I think we have all seen that over the years. We have seen the shifting of responsibility from state and federal governments down to local government. Because local government is closer to the people, because it does have that community contact, they are in a place to deliver programs and projects more efficiently, more effectively and, quite frankly, with better financial value than many of the state and federal governments. Dare I say it, if local government had delivered the pink batt scheme, it would have worked; but you are never going to achieve something like that from the federal government level.


So, once again, it is all very well shifting the jobs onto local government, but we need to be able to fund them so that they can do it effectively. Local governments now do everything from running the bus system and the transport system to running libraries and child care. Basically, they pick up the need in the community because they see it, they understand it and they know what their community wants. So we need to be able to fund that effectively.


As Professor Brown went on to say:


So we really need to recognise that this is about increasing, in a planned, sustainable way, the financial flows of resources to local government—growing them, even though that should occur necessarily as a result of both federal government and state government being prepared to share those resources with the third tier of government more effectively. That is what this is about.


The other issue that he highlighted, and which I agree with, is that any change that could possibly pass as a referendum would need to leave the regulatory control over local government with state governments as it is currently. Once again, I highlight that this is not a conspiracy to wipe out state governments. We all agree that regulatory control over local government should be left with the states. This is about providing a more effective and more efficient conduit for financial delivery for the states, as has been successfully challenged recently in the High Court. As I said, the federal government, by not doing anything, is setting up this referendum to fail.


In the first round of hearings, ALGA raised their issues about not being prepared and not being ready without having the funding to run an effective public campaign. However, at the last hearing they said they believed that if they were funded appropriately they could run that campaign. So this is why my colleague Mark Coulton, the member for Parkes, and I made the additional comments that we believe that of all people, ALGA, the Australian Local Government Association, is best positioned to know whether it can or cannot deliver the public awareness campaign in the time frame and is best positioned to know through its members whether this referendum will succeed.


They came to the last hearing and said yes, they are ready to go. But, once again, what has the minister done? Has the minister got any further with his negotiations with the states? We have not heard back. This is something he should have been doing, quite frankly, from before the expert panel started meeting. Why hasn't he raised these issues with the states? This is of vital interest. Why hasn't he reassured the states that this is not about taking power away from them, that this is just a conduit, as Professor Brown said, for more efficient and effective funding methods? But, once again, the minister has done nothing. The minister is not interested in seeing this referendum succeed, and I am very concerned that the funding they allude to—the funding they gave the Indigenous referendum supporters—is not going to be there for ALGA. And, quite frankly, that funding needs to happen today if ALGA is going to be able to effectively run a public awareness campaign for this referendum to succeed.


We all know the importance of local government in the community, because they are there on a day-to-day basis. If ALGA tells us it needs funding to run an effective campaign, then that is what we should be doing. Once again, tragically, we are not getting that support from this federal government. I call on the minister to act immediately to reassure his state ministers that this is a campaign to make funding more efficient, to bypass the problems we have had with our successful challenge in the High Court and to move forward with the campaign for a referendum.


I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the many local government areas and associations and indeed individuals who contributed over 140 submissions to the inquiry, as well as to those who attended the public hearings, which helped with our deliberations. There is a genuine interest in this area, and there is a genuine interest in facilitating the right outcome. But, once again, it is the government that is dragging the chain. It is the government that is setting this up to fail. In February this year, ALGA gave further evidence to the committee that they recommended that we continue with a referendum. But, as I have said, unless the government is genuine, unless the government funds that campaign and unless the government works with the local government associations and bodies, we are not going to see this referendum succeed. And if they go ahead on that flawed basis they are setting it up to fail, which I believe is completely reprehensible.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:32):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the final report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. I do so from a position of having a little bit of experience in these matters, having served on local government for six years. A saying that goes around amongst some councillors—and perhaps the previous speaker, the member for Ryan, is aware of it—is that if you do any more than a decade in local government you are immediately declared criminally insane! So I am sort of glad that I went on to bigger and better pastures—but I am not sure how long the member actually served in local government!




Mrs Prentice:
  A decade.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  A decade—you may be just under the limit! But, to go on to the report, I am pleased to see that the report has recommended the adoption of financial recognition. It is the minimalist recognition, I think it is fair to say, and it is through the constitutional financial powers that are extended to the Commonwealth government—simply that the words 'local government' be inserted into that financial head of powers. That is, as I said, a minimalist position, but it is a very important one. As many people around this place would know, we had the Pape case in the High Court, which came up with a ruling that direct funding by the Commonwealth government to schools being state controlled was not constitutionally valid. So there is speculation, and I suppose it is well founded in local government circles, that that same ruling could essentially be used to negate some of the federal funding that goes direct to local councils. 


One of those programs which have been quite successful was that introduced by the former Liberal-National coalition government and continued under the current government—that is, Roads to Recovery. Roads to Recovery has had immense benefits for local governments all around Australia and in local communities. It is delivered directly from the federal government to local governments to assist them in their road construction budget. 


I think that in the Mackay region in particular it has been somewhat of a godsend. I know that roads are the No. 1 issue for nearly all residents in my area; it is certainly in the top 3. I learnt that in the first week of being a local government councillor. I think it was probably three days after I had found out I was elected to then Mackay City Council. At 5.30 am I got a knock on the door—I was actually living in an area which is now in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore—from someone who wanted to complain about a road. I thought, 'Wow, this is a good initiation into local government: 5.30 am knocks on the door by constituents.' His complaint was about a local road, which we got upgraded through the Roads to Recovery program eventually, McColl Street, which is in Walkerston.


There are so many roads that get upgraded through this program. Currently, over the last period of this term of parliament, we have had Roads to Recovery funding going to Casey Avenue in South Mackay; they are doing a bridge upgrade there. We have Connors Road in Paget, Archibald Street in Paget, Grasstree Beach Road—again, down in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker. There is also Eversleigh Road in Sarina, Paradise Street in South Mackay, Mount Martin Loop Road—in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker—along with Armstrong Beach, Paradise Street in South Mackay, and on and on it goes. If this funding were not there, or if there were a High Court challenge to that funding, it would be to the detriment of all of those residents and motorists who use those roads. I can tell you from the point of view of the ones in my electorate—Connors Road, Archibald Street, Paradise Street—these are very well-used and, up until recently, well-worn roads. So, if we did not have this funding in place or if it were subject to a High Court challenge, that would be to the detriment of not just the local government but to the local communities. 


I know that there is an argument that we can direct that through the states. Certainly, through the financial assistance grants, funding does go from the federal government through the states to local government. But the report has given some indication as to why that is not such a good methodology for distributing that funding. They give three reasons. The first is a little bit of a superficial reason but it does say here that that indirect route through the state governments 'lessens the ability of the Commonwealth to implement and to be seen to be implementing its own policies at a local level'. The other two reasons are probably more important. The second reason the indirect route is not good is that 'it fails to recognise local government as a legitimate third tier of government in the Australian system.' It says:


Although this is an issue of status, it is clearly of great significance to local councils throughout Australia.


I am going to come back to that point in a second. The final and probably the most important one is:


… local government and its advocates raised concerns that Commonwealth funding via State governments is inefficient, ineffective, and may result in a reduction of the money flowing to local government by reason of deductions for administrative expenses. 


It is always a major concern when you have got double handling or triple handling of finances that you are going to see less of the dollar actually get down on the ground. You are going see less of the money actually going into bitumen, less of the money going into the work crews that actually build these roads. So that is the reason why the financial recognition is extremely important.


The No. 2 point that was raised on the issue of the validity of local government is also a key point. Obviously we had local government amalgamations. I went through that. I was on a bigger council that, most people would have thought, stood to benefit from amalgamations at the time with Mirani Shire Council and Sarina Shire Council. I was opposed to that even though there were some benefits. At that time I represented a rural division in which there were a fair few residents who felt that because they were in rural division they missed out on a lot of the funding that went through Mackay City Council at the time.


The unfortunate reality is these amalgamations were just done by the stroke of a pen really by the then Beattie government. What it saw was reduced representation for residents in Mirani shire and Sarina shire. They had councils that were about seven members strong with their own elected mayor. Now, on the Mackay Regional Council, I do not think there is one representative—if I am not mistaken—from the old Mirani shire, which, as I said, had its own mayor and six councillors; and there is but one representative from the old Sarina shire.


I think that reduced representation is a very sad thing because if you have your own council and your own mayor collecting your own rates, then you are spending all that money back in your own area. You have got people on the ground in these little townships. I know in places like Netherdale, Yongala and Grasstree Beach their say is completely watered down now. So some of the projects, as a fact of life, get overlooked now because there is not that representation there.


I know the report states that there could have been another view in the recognition of local government in the Constitution, a democratic recognition, which may have gone one step better in giving local government a true position and not just making it a creature of the state governments. Unfortunately, it is at the moment. The reality is tomorrow we could see other councils merged. We are currently seeing de-amalgamations across the state and that too can be done at the stroke of a pen although they are giving a vote at this stage. I know it is causing some concern again, particularly in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker. Being in your part of the world, I read the newspapers and know that there is some concern about that. The fact is local government now is simply the creature of state government. If I was to vote on a particular option, it would be for a full democratic recognition. However, I accept that that may not be amenable to a lot of people, particularly to state governments. The financial recognition as a minimalist position is probably the best way for us to go.


What a good job all of the local governments in my local area do in trying circumstances as well. Mackay Regional Council is powering ahead under the leadership of Mayor Deidre Comerford. Certainly the council is extremely united. It is getting things done. Local government is always subject to complaints. Some of them are legitimate, but I think that on the whole there is a great deal of respect for the work that Mackay Regional Council is doing.


Mayor Jenny Whitney of the Whitsunday Regional Council is having a very trying time at the moment because of the massive amount of debt that was left by the last administration. She is doing what she can to fix that up. She is powering on and getting results. I know that there is lot of support in the Whitsunday community for her and for what she is trying to do with the council.


Further north, the Burdekin Shire Council under Mayor Bill Lowis is a common-sense council. Bill is a common-sense mayor. A lot of the things that he says are probably outside the square of what a lot of even the council bureaucrats think. But it is very common sense. It relates to a lot of people in the Burdekin. They are going to go great guns over the next few years.


Finally, in Townsville, representing some of those southern areas, is Councillor Jenny Hill, the Mayor of Townsville; and my local councillor, Councillor Les Walker. He is a good councillor by all reports of the local residents. Again, they are doing a good job up in Townsville, I would say. They are dealing with financial issues.


Getting back to the report, I commend it. I am not actually sure whether this year is the right time to be holding a referendum. Perhaps having a referendum outside of an election period may be more beneficial. It would be more costly, I know, but it might be more likely to see the result get up that we on all sides of the House want. Whenever it is, I will be a strong supporter, having been in local government. I know the benefit that the constitutional recognition of local government will have. Thank you very much for letting me address the chamber.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:47):  At the outset, I compliment the member for Dawson on his remarks. He has given a lot to local government in his area. It is one of the reasons why he is now serving his electorate as a federal member. I also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the member for Greenway, who headed the committee that looked into constitutional recognition of local government. She has done a thorough job—she wants me to say an excellent job, and I will: an excellent job—of compiling this report. I also note that there has been a dissenting report to the final report on the majority finding of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, The case for financial recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons from the history of constitutional referenda. That dissenting report was submitted by Senator David Bushby, Senator David Fawcett and the member for Swan, Steve Irons. There are also additional comments from coalition members the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, and the member for Ryan, Jane Prentice. They also need to be taken on board in this debate.


I represent a large electorate, the Riverina in south-west New South Wales, which takes in 13 local government areas. They are: Bland, based at West Wyalong; Carrathool, based at Hillston; Coolamon; Griffith City; Gundagai; Junee; Leeton; Murrumbidgee, based at Coleambally and Darlington Point; Narrandera; Temora; Tumbarumba; Tumut; and Wagga Wagga City. There are two cities among those 13: Griffith and Wagga Wagga. The other 11 are shire councils. They are all good councils. They are all run by people who want to do the best for their local communities. Local government is grassroots representation at its very best. I am proud to say that all 13 shire or city councils within my electorate are doing an earnest and admirable job.


I would like to draw on some reflections made last night by the member for Makin, who is a former mayor of the City of Salisbury in South Australia. He made some very pertinent points to this particular debate. He indicated that there were propositions in both 1974 and 1988 to change the Australian Constitution in order to give local government the recognition it, as he put it, quite rightly deserves. I certainly agree with him on that point. In 1974 the proposal was to change section 51 of the Constitution, related to the ability of the federal government to borrow money on behalf of local government. At the same time there was a proposition to amend section 96 in very similar terms to what are being proposed currently. This would have enabled the federal government at the time to fund local government directly. As the member for Makin provided us last night, the 1974 proposition failed.


The 1988 proposition was slightly altered. It was about inserting a new section 119A into the Australian Constitution, which effectively gave recognition to local government as a legitimate level of government in Australia; perhaps in a similar way to the state constitutions. And again, as the member for Makin pointed out and as we all know, it also failed.


Only eight of the 44 referenda since Federation have actually succeeded, and that is why this is too important to put to the people and allow it to fail now. The member for Makin also pointed out the court case of Pape v Commissioner of Taxation in 2009. That court case found that the Australian government did not have the authority to fund local government directly. As the member for Makin pointed out, this is not simply about doing what we think is morally right; it is also about ensuring the way this government and this country has operated for decades continues.


He pointed to Roads to Recovery, which is a wonderful program. We all know how important Roads to Recovery is in fixing up those local and regional roads to the state which we should have in this country of ours. Safety is of paramount importance and, unfortunately, we all know from the road toll statistics around our nation that the—

Mr McCORMACK:
  For a constitutional question to succeed, as the member for Makin pointed out last night, it not only needs to be passed by a majority of states but also needs to be passed by a majority of voters across the whole of the country. As he said, it is not easy—and indeed it is not easy.


I spoke to four mayors just this morning about this particular piece of legislation, and certainly about constitutional recognition of local government—firstly, the mayor of the largest council in my electorate, that being Wagga Wagga City Council. The mayor there, Rod Kendall, said that it is extremely important that local government be granted funding directly from the Commonwealth. He pointed out that local government is a highly respected level of government. He said that this is such an important issue, certainly when you consider that Wagga Wagga at the moment is negotiating with New South Wales for funding for a levy bank to protect the 63,000 population city from future flooding by the Murrumbidgee River. We experienced an evacuation of the central business district last March when the Murrumbidgee River came within centimetres of flooding the central part of the city. That would have been absolutely disastrous. The devastation in sheer dollar terms, let alone the human cost, would have been extraordinary. It just makes good sense that Wagga Wagga City Council receive the funding it needs to heighten, to lengthen, to strengthen the levy bank that has existed in the city since the early 1960s.


But at the moment it would be difficult for the Commonwealth government, if it did wish to fund that particular piece of infrastructure, to ensure that the full amount of money went straight to that particular project. As most mayors alluded to when I met them this morning, any money that is directed through the states to local government invariably gets creamed off. I also spoke to the general manager of Wagga Wagga City Council, Phil Pinyon. He talked about Roads to Recovery. He talked about the funding that local government receives under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, and of course that is always contingent on the states actually saying that there is enough damage for the Commonwealth to fund it.


The then Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, in her capacity as the Minister for Emergency Management, was fantastic last year when it came to funding local government areas within my electorate after there were devastating floods in February and March. She even allocated funding as a special one-off payment—grants of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child under the Centrelink program—to a village called Ungarie, in the Bland shire. The New South Wales government overlooked this particular community because there was not enough widespread damage throughout the Bland shire for it to actually get the state tick-off for Commonwealth assistance. Ms Roxon provided that funding and it was very much appreciated; it was tremendous.


The member for Greenway, the chair of this committee, wanted me to point out that the planning director of the city of Wagga Wagga, Andrew Crakanthorp, believes that there is enough time and enough will—I certainly agree with him there—and that it is way too important for us not to proceed with a referendum. Whether now is the time, whether there is enough time between now and 14 September to be able to do that given the fact that it is now six months to the day to the election—and certainly whether this legislation actually passes—we will see, but we need to be ready to say, 'All systems go,' if indeed it does. I know the member for Greenway thinks there is time enough; I know the government thinks there is time enough. Certainly this has bipartisan support, but whether or not we can convince the public, educate the public, and get the states on board in those six months remains to be seen. 


John Dal Broi, Mayor of Griffith City Council, said that it is a big issue for grants to go straight to a local government rather than be filtered through the state. He said that by the time they get the funding from the Commonwealth via the states, it is watered down—and he is quite correct. Ian Chaffey, Mayor of Tumbarumba Shire Council, has been serving in local government, on and off, since 1977. He is a long-time mayor; he is a wonderful advocate for local government and for common sense. He talked about the states raking off money; he said, 'They will always take off a tidy slice, generally through bungling, incompetent bureaucrats.' He said that one of the biggest hurdles—to use his word—to get this through was to convince the public that it is necessary. He said, 'It's not a grab for power, but an opportunity for reform.' He said that local government in New South Wales is a wonderful thing and that his shire is doing its best to be able to use the money that it gets—and certainly there are a lot of road projects within Tumbarumba shire which do need fixing—but that the resistance, through all forms of reform and through all forms of change, is always difficult. He actually quoted Alvin Toffler's Future Shock from the 1970s to say that people just do not like change, they resist change. Certainly the states are resisting change. As I understand it, at the moment we are still talking and trying to work it through, but they are resisting this change because they see it as taking away some of their power. 


I spoke to Rick Firman, who is the mayor of Temora Shire Council, and he said that he was quite nervous—'quite nervous' were the words he used—about whether there is sufficient time to be able to convince the public and to be able to get the states on board to get this referendum, if goes ahead on 14 September at the next federal election, passed. All councils have contributed to a campaign fund through their state shire associations and other organisations, overseen by the Australian Local Government Association, to try to get this particular referendum passed. I know there is a project in Temora Shire Council at the moment that they would love to get Commonwealth funding for—that is, a heavy vehicle bypass through that beautiful town of Temora. There was no better demonstration of the fact that a heavy vehicle bypass is needed than when on Friday, 23 November last year, at the opening of the Temora medical centre, some heavy duty, heavy-wheeled stock trucks—semi-trailers—passed through Hoskins Street at the time of the opening. Not only could we not hear ourselves think, but the slosh coming out of those cattle trucks, and the stench that it left, left something to be desired. There are some wonderful little cafes in Temora's main street and alfresco dining. It is difficult to eat a meal after a cattle truck has passed just metres away and you get the odour—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  You understand where I am coming from! It is difficult. Rick Firman and the general manager, Gary Lavelle, have been working tirelessly on getting environmental impact statements and plans drawn up and doing everything they can to get a heavy vehicle bypass. I have raised this with the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean. He is interested in the project. Temora is a great town and it needs this to happen. But if it happens under the current arrangements, and New South Wales takes its share, then the money that hopefully the Commonwealth would provide to such a vital piece of infrastructure would, unfortunately, as the Griffith mayor said, be watered down. Temora shire, like many councils in New South Wales, is at the moment facing the prospect of amalgamation. Resource sharing is a good thing and councils certainly do it at the moment. I know that Bland, Temora and Junee shire councils work hand in hand on so many things. But these are big areas and they do not need to be amalgamated. One of the reasons Bland Shire Council did not get funding from the Commonwealth last year is that it was so big, and Ungarie was so small that the devastation caused to it was not big enough for the whole shire to get that tick off.


This is an important piece of legislation. The mayors of my 13 local government areas are very keen to ensure that there is constitutional recognition of local government. However, with regard to whether this is the right time, this is too important a change to the Constitution to get wrong by not having public support and state support. That is why there was a dissenting report by coalition members. However, I do commend the member for Greenway for her report.


Debate adjourned.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:01):  I wish to speak on the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. I will say from the outset that I agree with the proposal and the words being proposed for a possible referendum, but I have been disappointed and somewhat frustrated at the way this has been handled. It is nearly 12 months since the expert panel, set up by the government to look at the constitutional recognition of local government, presented its report and we are still in the position that we are in today.


I was alarmed to read in the national presson Monday of this week that the minister is going to spend another six weeks negotiating with the states before a final decision is to be made. One of the witnesses to the inquiry in Sydney in January, the Australian Electoral Commission, indicated that, to run a referendum efficiently, you need approximately six months. Of course, we are past that point and we are getting into a narrow margin of time.


It is well known that some states are in favour of this referendum and some are opposed, but the states that are opposed made their position clear long before the words of this referendum question were made known and long before they realised what this proposal actually meant. As someone who comes from a local government background, to an extent I do not believe that this referendum goes far enough. On the other side of that, what is being proposed is basically to close up a loophole. It is to enable the federal government to directly fund local government in some programs. It is not a major overhaul of the federal-state relationship; it is not going to undermine the states' relations with local government. The programs that the federal government—sometimes on an ongoing basis, but sometimes on a temporary basis—fund for local government are very important to the people in those local government areas. The obvious one, the one that is discussed a lot, is the Roads to Recovery program. This program is seen, particularly in the bush, as the signature program. It is the ongoing legacy of John Anderson, the former member for Gwydir, that the program has been put in place. It has already had one challenge in the High Court. I believe that if the program were lost then most of the 17 local government areas in my electorate would be not viable.


The other program, if you cast your mind back to 2008, is the stimulus program implemented by the Rudd government. Many of those programs turned out to be a debacle—the insulation program and the BER program in many cases turned out to be a poor use of money.



Government members interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  I am going to give you a pat on the back in a minute, so settle down. I guarantee that the money that went to local government through those local infrastructure programs was used to good value. The money given to every local government area I am aware of that got funding directly from the federal government during that stimulus program was money well spent. Other dollars were leveraged so that the dollars that came from federal government to local government were magnified several times over. If the Rudd government at the time had given more money to local government and less to ill-thought-out and ill-conceived green programs like the pink batts program, the Australian economy would be a lot better off.


So where are we now? The government says that it wants a referendum, and there is a bit more negotiation to go through. The coalition has said that it supports the concept of recognition of local government, but there are some reservations as to the timing and the preparedness. I personally believe that, if the minister gets his skates on and gets around the states to explain to them that this is not an affront to their sovereignty but merely housekeeping to close a loophole, this is possible. I had some frustration at the Australian Local Government Association's initial input into the hearing in January, but I was somewhat relieved to see them come to a firmer position in the later hearing. Right across Australia local government bodies are prepared to come into action to fight to see this referendum succeed.


I do not know whether the reluctance of the minister to commit to doing more on this is to do with a lack of finance for the case. It is interesting that the referendum to recognise the Aboriginal people in the Constitution has now been delayed. It was given a considerable amount of funds to present the case for and against, yet at this stage there has been no promise of any funding to move on this local government referendum.


In closing, there is still time. I have told the minister that if he goes ahead with this I will do my level best to make sure that this referendum is a success. The Australian local government bodies rely on this, particularly in regional Australia. In regional Australia the local government bodies rely on direct funding, so the minister needs to bring the states into line and get this referendum underway. If he does not do that pretty well immediately then I feel that the success of the referendum would not be great. The real tragedy would be to put this referendum up in a half-baked way. It needs to happen in a way that is going to be successful.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-03-14,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:09):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Parkes. When I serve on committees with him he always makes a positive input and I know that in this inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government he also had a positive input. He comes from a regional area that relies heavily on the council and on funding from both state and federal government and he works hard for anything that would assist his council areas with more streamlined funding. If you have ever been to Parkes you will know that it is also now known as 'Coultontown'. He has a high presence there and I know he is enthusiastic to see that this referendum, if it goes ahead, is successful. This whole debate has been like that: everyone wants to see a successful referendum proceed.


However, I feel that, because of the lack of time we are faced with to run a successful campaign, there might not be success. During the inquiry I questioned one of the witnesses giving evidence around the earliest time any legislation could be introduced to proceed with a referendum. Under the current time line, the earliest time it could be introduced would be about budget week in May. That would leave a very short period of time for a successful information campaign about this referendum to be made public so that people could be informed. The witnesses said they did think that short-term propositions had been successfully advocated for, but I cannot think of any. At this point in time, we think that maybe we need more time to have a successful referendum.


The government has demonstrated extraordinary lack of action to put in place the preconditions that were recommended by the expert panel and other stakeholders such as the Australian Local Government Association. As a direct consequence, the time remaining between now and 14 September is likely to be insufficient to put in place the necessary mechanics, education campaigns and other measures highlighted by expert witnesses as necessary to ensure an informed outcome of the referendum question.


Coalition members are of the opinion that the referendum should only be considered once the preconditions identified by the expert panel have been met. The coalition acknowledges the constitutional uncertainty that recent High Court cases have created with respect to direct funding of local government programs by the Commonwealth. The coalition is committed to restoring funding certainty to local programs and has indicated support for the appropriate limited financial recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution as a way to achieve this. Coalition members of the committee also note that the evidence received by the committee highlighting that the program's specific funding, which is currently provided directly to local government, may still be provided in full via existing avenues that are constitutionally valid. Coalition members consider that the existence of valid alternative funding pathways to address the funding uncertainty introduced by the recent High Court cases reduces the imperative to pursue constitutional change in the face of the fact that preconditions for success highlighted by the expert panel and other stakeholders such as ALGA have not yet been met. The coalition members are mindful of the inquiry terms of reference, which called for an assessment of the likelihood of success of the referendum. They remain of the view that the recommendation of the main report, to proceed with a 2013 referendum, despite the preconditions for success not being established, places at risk many millions of taxpayers' dollars. This risk, together with the risk of a lack of informed and positive public engagement with the issue, appears to be unnecessary given the alternative pathways to ensure ongoing local government program funding should the direct model in fact be successfully challenged in the courts prior to the referendum question being put.


Regarding the lack of action by the government, the coalition's support for action to address funding issues through constitutional change has been provided subject to consideration of the specific change to be proposed by the government and the change being limited to remove the question of constitutional validity in relation to direct Commonwealth funding of local government. Similarly, it was offered in the expectation that the government would approach the consideration of any such referendum question on the basis that all practical and reasonable steps were taken to ensure the Australian population made its decision on a fully informed basis.


The government formed the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government—the expert panel—to identify options for the constitutional recognition of local government and to report on the level of support for such recognition amongst stakeholders in the general community. The expert panel's final report stated:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum (see page 16). Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process.


As such, the expert panel was supportive of the 2013 referendum on financial recognition of local government through a change to section 96 of the Constitution, provided two conditions were met. The first condition was negotiation with the states to achieve their support for the government's proposed question, and the second was to take steps, as recommended by ALGA, to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue.


The expert panel's final report was delivered in December 2011, almost two years prior to the latest possible date for the next federal election. As at that date, the government had plenty of time to ensure it took the blueprint for a referendum on financial recognition of local government as provided by the expert panel, put it in place and proceed to put the question to a voting public equipped with the benefit of a full public education campaign on the issues. As noted in the majority decision Final report on the majority finding of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government: the case for financial recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons from the history of constitutional referenda, we now have the benefit of a nominated election date, 14 September 2013. This date is some 10 weeks earlier than the latest possible date the election could have been held.


At the first hearing of this committee, reservations were expressed by ALGA with regard to timing, were a referendum to be held in conjunction with the 2013 general election. They noted that they did not consider the question should be put to the people before a number of preconditions have been met. These preconditions reflected the conditions recommended by the expert panel in their report. Coalition members note the supplementary submissions by ALGA, received after the second hearing, in which ALGA indicate they will actively support the 2013 referendum, but accept wholly the argument put by ALGA in earlier evidence of their advisability of first meeting the stated preconditions. 


As at the date of the first hearing in mid-January 2013, evidence was received that, even given the latest possible date for an election being late November 2013, the prospect of meeting those preconditions in time to hold the referendum at the same time as the election were not high. Given the nominated date for the election and the time that has since elapsed, the prospect of these preconditions being fully met by 14 September this year has only reduced. As such, the prospect of a referendum held in conjunction with this year's federal election raises serious risks that it will be held in an environment where potential consensus of stakeholders, including the states, has not been met and where the opportunity to fully inform the voting public through public education and other avenues has not been fully realised.


There has been a lack of engagement with the states and, as yet, I do not think some of the states have even responded to the minister in regard to where they stand or whether they will support this referendum. The coalition members of the committee were strongly of the view that the meeting of both of the expert panel's conditions is vital before any referendum on this issue is put to the people. Australia is a federation of states and, as the evidence attests, the support of state governments can make or break referenda. If state governments are largely opposed to change, history proves it is very difficult for referenda to pass. In the view of the coalition members, the recommendation by the expert panel that the government negotiate to achieve the states' support for financial recognition is an essential precursor to the committee being able to make a recommendation on the likelihood of the referendum being supported by the Australian people. A number of witnesses reinforced the view that, for the referendum to be successful, states either had to be actively supportive of the measure or at least run dead on the issue.


I quote the conclusion to our dissenting report to the report of the inquiry:


Coalition members noted that the Chair’s Preliminary Report recommended action be taken immediately to put in place the necessary steps to hold the referendum in conjunction with the 2013 Federal election.


We held concerns that the time was insufficient but remained open to the prospect that such immediate action may address those concerns. However, it is clear that such urgent and immediate action has not occurred and seven weeks has passed with little if any progress.


Coalition members are now of the opinion that the time remaining between now and the nominated election date of 14 September 2013 is insufficient to put in place all the necessary mechanics, formal, informal and partisan education campaigns and to otherwise ensure an informed outcome for the referendum question.


We acknowledge concerns regarding the impact of further High Court cases that may impact on the constitutionality of direct payments to local governments by the Commonwealth and that delays in granting constitutional financial recognition may come at a cost to the many valuable services provided at a local government level.


As noted, the Committee received constitutional evidence that clearly demonstrates that avenues exist for funding currently provided directly to local government, to still be provided in full, even in the face of (potential) judicial findings that direct payments are not constitutional.


The most obvious avenue is through grants through the states, tied on the basis that they must be both passed on in full and subject to use for the programs currently funded (or as directed under future Commonwealth-local government programs).


Coalition members acknowledge that this is a less clean avenue than direct payment, but accept the evidence that options such as this are available and that, accordingly, there is likely to be no potential risk of loss of funding to local government, eventuating from further developments following the Pape and Williams cases.


As such, we consider there to be little financial risk to local government in delaying the holding of a referendum on financial recognition of local government in the Constitution, until such time as the conditions previously discussed have been met.


As such, Coalition members of the Committee recommend that a referendum on the issue of financial recognition of local government only be held after the pre-conditions posed by the Expert Panel and those previously promoted by ALGA, have been met.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:22):  I rise to speak on the final report of the majority finding of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, the case for financial recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons from the history of constitutional referenda, including the dissenting reports.


The coalition has committed to support the appropriate financial recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution—that is our policy. Back in December 2011, the expert panel produced—and I was very honoured to serve on that expert panel—its recommendation. The final report said, and this was back in December 2011:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA—


the Australian Local Government Association—


necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum … Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process.


That was December 2011. They were very clear recommendations with a very clear way forward—and what did the government and the minister do with those recommendations? Zip. Absolutely nothing. Once again, they are either setting this up to fail or they are just not interested in this program. They made an election promise to have a referendum on this issue, but they have done nothing to support it in any way.


There are a whole range of thoughts and views out in the public arena. Some people think that this is all an undercover plot to take over state governments; I assure you, it is not. But, unless we run an informed public awareness campaign, those are the sorts of messages that are going to get up in the public arena. That is why the expert panel—and, indeed, this second committee—came up with the same conclusion: we need to talk to the states and we need to run a public awareness campaign.


That was the recommendation in 2011. It is now the recommendation two years later, and the government has done nothing. The minister is reprehensible in his lack of action on this issue. Where is the funding for ALGA? Where is the funding for this campaign? The government was quick to give the Indigenous community $10 million to help them with their public awareness campaign, but to show its lack of interest and lack of support for this particular issue it has given nothing, committed nothing, to the Australian Local Government Association for their public awareness campaign, which was a recommendation that came out of the December 2011 report and again in the report from the committee that we have just had—because if you do not want to do something, form another committee and take the time to do nothing. That is the hallmark of this Labor government.


There is no doubt that we have issues with funding for local government and, indeed, the Pape and Williams cases show that there are issues going forward. But as Professor AJ Brown said in his comments to the hearing that we held in Sydney earlier this year, this constitutional change should not be seen as anything more than a new conduit for funding to local government. It is not about taking away the rights of state governments; it is more about looking at funding more money to local government. His report states: 


… this is a mechanism for local government to get a larger agreed share of the total financial pie. That is what local government is legitimately looking for and that is what it should be looking for. State governments are incrementally allowing local government a larger share of responsibility and resources in the federal system as a whole, as is the federal government. When anything major happens, the first thing that both federal and state governments agree on, once they have agreed that they need to do something, is who is going to do it, and more often than not local government plays a huge role.


I think we have all seen that over the years. We have seen the shifting of responsibility from state and federal governments down to local government. Because local government is closer to the people, because it does have that community contact, they are in a place to deliver programs and projects more efficiently, more effectively and, quite frankly, with better financial value than many of the state and federal governments. Dare I say it, if local government had delivered the pink batt scheme, it would have worked; but you are never going to achieve something like that from the federal government level.


So, once again, it is all very well shifting the jobs onto local government, but we need to be able to fund them so that they can do it effectively. Local governments now do everything from running the bus system and the transport system to running libraries and child care. Basically, they pick up the need in the community because they see it, they understand it and they know what their community wants. So we need to be able to fund that effectively.


As Professor Brown went on to say:


So we really need to recognise that this is about increasing, in a planned, sustainable way, the financial flows of resources to local government—growing them, even though that should occur necessarily as a result of both federal government and state government being prepared to share those resources with the third tier of government more effectively. That is what this is about.


The other issue that he highlighted, and which I agree with, is that any change that could possibly pass as a referendum would need to leave the regulatory control over local government with state governments as it is currently. Once again, I highlight that this is not a conspiracy to wipe out state governments. We all agree that regulatory control over local government should be left with the states. This is about providing a more effective and more efficient conduit for financial delivery for the states, as has been successfully challenged recently in the High Court. As I said, the federal government, by not doing anything, is setting up this referendum to fail.


In the first round of hearings, ALGA raised their issues about not being prepared and not being ready without having the funding to run an effective public campaign. However, at the last hearing they said they believed that if they were funded appropriately they could run that campaign. So this is why my colleague Mark Coulton, the member for Parkes, and I made the additional comments that we believe that of all people, ALGA, the Australian Local Government Association, is best positioned to know whether it can or cannot deliver the public awareness campaign in the time frame and is best positioned to know through its members whether this referendum will succeed.


They came to the last hearing and said yes, they are ready to go. But, once again, what has the minister done? Has the minister got any further with his negotiations with the states? We have not heard back. This is something he should have been doing, quite frankly, from before the expert panel started meeting. Why hasn't he raised these issues with the states? This is of vital interest. Why hasn't he reassured the states that this is not about taking power away from them, that this is just a conduit, as Professor Brown said, for more efficient and effective funding methods? But, once again, the minister has done nothing. The minister is not interested in seeing this referendum succeed, and I am very concerned that the funding they allude to—the funding they gave the Indigenous referendum supporters—is not going to be there for ALGA. And, quite frankly, that funding needs to happen today if ALGA is going to be able to effectively run a public awareness campaign for this referendum to succeed.


We all know the importance of local government in the community, because they are there on a day-to-day basis. If ALGA tells us it needs funding to run an effective campaign, then that is what we should be doing. Once again, tragically, we are not getting that support from this federal government. I call on the minister to act immediately to reassure his state ministers that this is a campaign to make funding more efficient, to bypass the problems we have had with our successful challenge in the High Court and to move forward with the campaign for a referendum.


I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the many local government areas and associations and indeed individuals who contributed over 140 submissions to the inquiry, as well as to those who attended the public hearings, which helped with our deliberations. There is a genuine interest in this area, and there is a genuine interest in facilitating the right outcome. But, once again, it is the government that is dragging the chain. It is the government that is setting this up to fail. In February this year, ALGA gave further evidence to the committee that they recommended that we continue with a referendum. But, as I have said, unless the government is genuine, unless the government funds that campaign and unless the government works with the local government associations and bodies, we are not going to see this referendum succeed. And if they go ahead on that flawed basis they are setting it up to fail, which I believe is completely reprehensible.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-03-14,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:32):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the final report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. I do so from a position of having a little bit of experience in these matters, having served on local government for six years. A saying that goes around amongst some councillors—and perhaps the previous speaker, the member for Ryan, is aware of it—is that if you do any more than a decade in local government you are immediately declared criminally insane! So I am sort of glad that I went on to bigger and better pastures—but I am not sure how long the member actually served in local government!




Mrs Prentice:
  A decade.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  A decade—you may be just under the limit! But, to go on to the report, I am pleased to see that the report has recommended the adoption of financial recognition. It is the minimalist recognition, I think it is fair to say, and it is through the constitutional financial powers that are extended to the Commonwealth government—simply that the words 'local government' be inserted into that financial head of powers. That is, as I said, a minimalist position, but it is a very important one. As many people around this place would know, we had the Pape case in the High Court, which came up with a ruling that direct funding by the Commonwealth government to schools being state controlled was not constitutionally valid. So there is speculation, and I suppose it is well founded in local government circles, that that same ruling could essentially be used to negate some of the federal funding that goes direct to local councils. 


One of those programs which have been quite successful was that introduced by the former Liberal-National coalition government and continued under the current government—that is, Roads to Recovery. Roads to Recovery has had immense benefits for local governments all around Australia and in local communities. It is delivered directly from the federal government to local governments to assist them in their road construction budget. 


I think that in the Mackay region in particular it has been somewhat of a godsend. I know that roads are the No. 1 issue for nearly all residents in my area; it is certainly in the top 3. I learnt that in the first week of being a local government councillor. I think it was probably three days after I had found out I was elected to then Mackay City Council. At 5.30 am I got a knock on the door—I was actually living in an area which is now in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore—from someone who wanted to complain about a road. I thought, 'Wow, this is a good initiation into local government: 5.30 am knocks on the door by constituents.' His complaint was about a local road, which we got upgraded through the Roads to Recovery program eventually, McColl Street, which is in Walkerston.


There are so many roads that get upgraded through this program. Currently, over the last period of this term of parliament, we have had Roads to Recovery funding going to Casey Avenue in South Mackay; they are doing a bridge upgrade there. We have Connors Road in Paget, Archibald Street in Paget, Grasstree Beach Road—again, down in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker. There is also Eversleigh Road in Sarina, Paradise Street in South Mackay, Mount Martin Loop Road—in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker—along with Armstrong Beach, Paradise Street in South Mackay, and on and on it goes. If this funding were not there, or if there were a High Court challenge to that funding, it would be to the detriment of all of those residents and motorists who use those roads. I can tell you from the point of view of the ones in my electorate—Connors Road, Archibald Street, Paradise Street—these are very well-used and, up until recently, well-worn roads. So, if we did not have this funding in place or if it were subject to a High Court challenge, that would be to the detriment of not just the local government but to the local communities. 


I know that there is an argument that we can direct that through the states. Certainly, through the financial assistance grants, funding does go from the federal government through the states to local government. But the report has given some indication as to why that is not such a good methodology for distributing that funding. They give three reasons. The first is a little bit of a superficial reason but it does say here that that indirect route through the state governments 'lessens the ability of the Commonwealth to implement and to be seen to be implementing its own policies at a local level'. The other two reasons are probably more important. The second reason the indirect route is not good is that 'it fails to recognise local government as a legitimate third tier of government in the Australian system.' It says:


Although this is an issue of status, it is clearly of great significance to local councils throughout Australia.


I am going to come back to that point in a second. The final and probably the most important one is:


… local government and its advocates raised concerns that Commonwealth funding via State governments is inefficient, ineffective, and may result in a reduction of the money flowing to local government by reason of deductions for administrative expenses. 


It is always a major concern when you have got double handling or triple handling of finances that you are going to see less of the dollar actually get down on the ground. You are going see less of the money actually going into bitumen, less of the money going into the work crews that actually build these roads. So that is the reason why the financial recognition is extremely important.


The No. 2 point that was raised on the issue of the validity of local government is also a key point. Obviously we had local government amalgamations. I went through that. I was on a bigger council that, most people would have thought, stood to benefit from amalgamations at the time with Mirani Shire Council and Sarina Shire Council. I was opposed to that even though there were some benefits. At that time I represented a rural division in which there were a fair few residents who felt that because they were in rural division they missed out on a lot of the funding that went through Mackay City Council at the time.


The unfortunate reality is these amalgamations were just done by the stroke of a pen really by the then Beattie government. What it saw was reduced representation for residents in Mirani shire and Sarina shire. They had councils that were about seven members strong with their own elected mayor. Now, on the Mackay Regional Council, I do not think there is one representative—if I am not mistaken—from the old Mirani shire, which, as I said, had its own mayor and six councillors; and there is but one representative from the old Sarina shire.


I think that reduced representation is a very sad thing because if you have your own council and your own mayor collecting your own rates, then you are spending all that money back in your own area. You have got people on the ground in these little townships. I know in places like Netherdale, Yongala and Grasstree Beach their say is completely watered down now. So some of the projects, as a fact of life, get overlooked now because there is not that representation there.


I know the report states that there could have been another view in the recognition of local government in the Constitution, a democratic recognition, which may have gone one step better in giving local government a true position and not just making it a creature of the state governments. Unfortunately, it is at the moment. The reality is tomorrow we could see other councils merged. We are currently seeing de-amalgamations across the state and that too can be done at the stroke of a pen although they are giving a vote at this stage. I know it is causing some concern again, particularly in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker. Being in your part of the world, I read the newspapers and know that there is some concern about that. The fact is local government now is simply the creature of state government. If I was to vote on a particular option, it would be for a full democratic recognition. However, I accept that that may not be amenable to a lot of people, particularly to state governments. The financial recognition as a minimalist position is probably the best way for us to go.


What a good job all of the local governments in my local area do in trying circumstances as well. Mackay Regional Council is powering ahead under the leadership of Mayor Deidre Comerford. Certainly the council is extremely united. It is getting things done. Local government is always subject to complaints. Some of them are legitimate, but I think that on the whole there is a great deal of respect for the work that Mackay Regional Council is doing.


Mayor Jenny Whitney of the Whitsunday Regional Council is having a very trying time at the moment because of the massive amount of debt that was left by the last administration. She is doing what she can to fix that up. She is powering on and getting results. I know that there is lot of support in the Whitsunday community for her and for what she is trying to do with the council.


Further north, the Burdekin Shire Council under Mayor Bill Lowis is a common-sense council. Bill is a common-sense mayor. A lot of the things that he says are probably outside the square of what a lot of even the council bureaucrats think. But it is very common sense. It relates to a lot of people in the Burdekin. They are going to go great guns over the next few years.


Finally, in Townsville, representing some of those southern areas, is Councillor Jenny Hill, the Mayor of Townsville; and my local councillor, Councillor Les Walker. He is a good councillor by all reports of the local residents. Again, they are doing a good job up in Townsville, I would say. They are dealing with financial issues.


Getting back to the report, I commend it. I am not actually sure whether this year is the right time to be holding a referendum. Perhaps having a referendum outside of an election period may be more beneficial. It would be more costly, I know, but it might be more likely to see the result get up that we on all sides of the House want. Whenever it is, I will be a strong supporter, having been in local government. I know the benefit that the constitutional recognition of local government will have. Thank you very much for letting me address the chamber.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:47):  At the outset, I compliment the member for Dawson on his remarks. He has given a lot to local government in his area. It is one of the reasons why he is now serving his electorate as a federal member. I also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the member for Greenway, who headed the committee that looked into constitutional recognition of local government. She has done a thorough job—she wants me to say an excellent job, and I will: an excellent job—of compiling this report. I also note that there has been a dissenting report to the final report on the majority finding of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, The case for financial recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons from the history of constitutional referenda. That dissenting report was submitted by Senator David Bushby, Senator David Fawcett and the member for Swan, Steve Irons. There are also additional comments from coalition members the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, and the member for Ryan, Jane Prentice. They also need to be taken on board in this debate.


I represent a large electorate, the Riverina in south-west New South Wales, which takes in 13 local government areas. They are: Bland, based at West Wyalong; Carrathool, based at Hillston; Coolamon; Griffith City; Gundagai; Junee; Leeton; Murrumbidgee, based at Coleambally and Darlington Point; Narrandera; Temora; Tumbarumba; Tumut; and Wagga Wagga City. There are two cities among those 13: Griffith and Wagga Wagga. The other 11 are shire councils. They are all good councils. They are all run by people who want to do the best for their local communities. Local government is grassroots representation at its very best. I am proud to say that all 13 shire or city councils within my electorate are doing an earnest and admirable job.


I would like to draw on some reflections made last night by the member for Makin, who is a former mayor of the City of Salisbury in South Australia. He made some very pertinent points to this particular debate. He indicated that there were propositions in both 1974 and 1988 to change the Australian Constitution in order to give local government the recognition it, as he put it, quite rightly deserves. I certainly agree with him on that point. In 1974 the proposal was to change section 51 of the Constitution, related to the ability of the federal government to borrow money on behalf of local government. At the same time there was a proposition to amend section 96 in very similar terms to what are being proposed currently. This would have enabled the federal government at the time to fund local government directly. As the member for Makin provided us last night, the 1974 proposition failed.


The 1988 proposition was slightly altered. It was about inserting a new section 119A into the Australian Constitution, which effectively gave recognition to local government as a legitimate level of government in Australia; perhaps in a similar way to the state constitutions. And again, as the member for Makin pointed out and as we all know, it also failed.


Only eight of the 44 referenda since Federation have actually succeeded, and that is why this is too important to put to the people and allow it to fail now. The member for Makin also pointed out the court case of Pape v Commissioner of Taxation in 2009. That court case found that the Australian government did not have the authority to fund local government directly. As the member for Makin pointed out, this is not simply about doing what we think is morally right; it is also about ensuring the way this government and this country has operated for decades continues.


He pointed to Roads to Recovery, which is a wonderful program. We all know how important Roads to Recovery is in fixing up those local and regional roads to the state which we should have in this country of ours. Safety is of paramount importance and, unfortunately, we all know from the road toll statistics around our nation that the—

Mr McCORMACK:
  For a constitutional question to succeed, as the member for Makin pointed out last night, it not only needs to be passed by a majority of states but also needs to be passed by a majority of voters across the whole of the country. As he said, it is not easy—and indeed it is not easy.


I spoke to four mayors just this morning about this particular piece of legislation, and certainly about constitutional recognition of local government—firstly, the mayor of the largest council in my electorate, that being Wagga Wagga City Council. The mayor there, Rod Kendall, said that it is extremely important that local government be granted funding directly from the Commonwealth. He pointed out that local government is a highly respected level of government. He said that this is such an important issue, certainly when you consider that Wagga Wagga at the moment is negotiating with New South Wales for funding for a levy bank to protect the 63,000 population city from future flooding by the Murrumbidgee River. We experienced an evacuation of the central business district last March when the Murrumbidgee River came within centimetres of flooding the central part of the city. That would have been absolutely disastrous. The devastation in sheer dollar terms, let alone the human cost, would have been extraordinary. It just makes good sense that Wagga Wagga City Council receive the funding it needs to heighten, to lengthen, to strengthen the levy bank that has existed in the city since the early 1960s.


But at the moment it would be difficult for the Commonwealth government, if it did wish to fund that particular piece of infrastructure, to ensure that the full amount of money went straight to that particular project. As most mayors alluded to when I met them this morning, any money that is directed through the states to local government invariably gets creamed off. I also spoke to the general manager of Wagga Wagga City Council, Phil Pinyon. He talked about Roads to Recovery. He talked about the funding that local government receives under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, and of course that is always contingent on the states actually saying that there is enough damage for the Commonwealth to fund it.


The then Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, in her capacity as the Minister for Emergency Management, was fantastic last year when it came to funding local government areas within my electorate after there were devastating floods in February and March. She even allocated funding as a special one-off payment—grants of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child under the Centrelink program—to a village called Ungarie, in the Bland shire. The New South Wales government overlooked this particular community because there was not enough widespread damage throughout the Bland shire for it to actually get the state tick-off for Commonwealth assistance. Ms Roxon provided that funding and it was very much appreciated; it was tremendous.


The member for Greenway, the chair of this committee, wanted me to point out that the planning director of the city of Wagga Wagga, Andrew Crakanthorp, believes that there is enough time and enough will—I certainly agree with him there—and that it is way too important for us not to proceed with a referendum. Whether now is the time, whether there is enough time between now and 14 September to be able to do that given the fact that it is now six months to the day to the election—and certainly whether this legislation actually passes—we will see, but we need to be ready to say, 'All systems go,' if indeed it does. I know the member for Greenway thinks there is time enough; I know the government thinks there is time enough. Certainly this has bipartisan support, but whether or not we can convince the public, educate the public, and get the states on board in those six months remains to be seen. 


John Dal Broi, Mayor of Griffith City Council, said that it is a big issue for grants to go straight to a local government rather than be filtered through the state. He said that by the time they get the funding from the Commonwealth via the states, it is watered down—and he is quite correct. Ian Chaffey, Mayor of Tumbarumba Shire Council, has been serving in local government, on and off, since 1977. He is a long-time mayor; he is a wonderful advocate for local government and for common sense. He talked about the states raking off money; he said, 'They will always take off a tidy slice, generally through bungling, incompetent bureaucrats.' He said that one of the biggest hurdles—to use his word—to get this through was to convince the public that it is necessary. He said, 'It's not a grab for power, but an opportunity for reform.' He said that local government in New South Wales is a wonderful thing and that his shire is doing its best to be able to use the money that it gets—and certainly there are a lot of road projects within Tumbarumba shire which do need fixing—but that the resistance, through all forms of reform and through all forms of change, is always difficult. He actually quoted Alvin Toffler's Future Shock from the 1970s to say that people just do not like change, they resist change. Certainly the states are resisting change. As I understand it, at the moment we are still talking and trying to work it through, but they are resisting this change because they see it as taking away some of their power. 


I spoke to Rick Firman, who is the mayor of Temora Shire Council, and he said that he was quite nervous—'quite nervous' were the words he used—about whether there is sufficient time to be able to convince the public and to be able to get the states on board to get this referendum, if goes ahead on 14 September at the next federal election, passed. All councils have contributed to a campaign fund through their state shire associations and other organisations, overseen by the Australian Local Government Association, to try to get this particular referendum passed. I know there is a project in Temora Shire Council at the moment that they would love to get Commonwealth funding for—that is, a heavy vehicle bypass through that beautiful town of Temora. There was no better demonstration of the fact that a heavy vehicle bypass is needed than when on Friday, 23 November last year, at the opening of the Temora medical centre, some heavy duty, heavy-wheeled stock trucks—semi-trailers—passed through Hoskins Street at the time of the opening. Not only could we not hear ourselves think, but the slosh coming out of those cattle trucks, and the stench that it left, left something to be desired. There are some wonderful little cafes in Temora's main street and alfresco dining. It is difficult to eat a meal after a cattle truck has passed just metres away and you get the odour—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  You understand where I am coming from! It is difficult. Rick Firman and the general manager, Gary Lavelle, have been working tirelessly on getting environmental impact statements and plans drawn up and doing everything they can to get a heavy vehicle bypass. I have raised this with the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean. He is interested in the project. Temora is a great town and it needs this to happen. But if it happens under the current arrangements, and New South Wales takes its share, then the money that hopefully the Commonwealth would provide to such a vital piece of infrastructure would, unfortunately, as the Griffith mayor said, be watered down. Temora shire, like many councils in New South Wales, is at the moment facing the prospect of amalgamation. Resource sharing is a good thing and councils certainly do it at the moment. I know that Bland, Temora and Junee shire councils work hand in hand on so many things. But these are big areas and they do not need to be amalgamated. One of the reasons Bland Shire Council did not get funding from the Commonwealth last year is that it was so big, and Ungarie was so small that the devastation caused to it was not big enough for the whole shire to get that tick off.


This is an important piece of legislation. The mayors of my 13 local government areas are very keen to ensure that there is constitutional recognition of local government. However, with regard to whether this is the right time, this is too important a change to the Constitution to get wrong by not having public support and state support. That is why there was a dissenting report by coalition members. However, I do commend the member for Greenway for her report.


Debate adjourned.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (12:02):  I take this opportunity to update the House on two important local issues in my electorate of Swan, in Western Australia. Since last year, I have been working with the Contemporary Gymnastics Academy in Carlisle to help them find a new home so that they can expand the services they provide to local people. There was uncertainty surrounding their lease and they were looking for expanded new premises that could cater for the ever-growing interest among kids and adults in the sport and exercise programs that they provide. Given that they are one of the only artistic gymnastics clubs in the local area, it was particularly important that they survive and thrive into the future. 


Following the relocation of activities, which previously took place at the Queens Park Recreation Centre, to the new Cannington Leisureplex, the Contemporary Gymnastics Academy put in an application to the council to lease the centre. There was great community support for this proposal, as indicated by one of the surveys I did through the area. Unfortunately, after a lengthy process, the City of Canning decided to award the lease at the new centre to the eightball association, which was disappointing for the gymnastics club. However, we did not give up and we continued to look for a new home due to the support in the community and the fact that there are exceptionally few gymnastics facilities in the region. We started looking and put out a call to the public for a location for a new home for the gymnastics centre. 


In the Southern Gazette on 12 February 2013, in an article by journalist Susanne Scolt, we put out a public call to try and find a new home. Mrs Michele McDermott said that she was particularly keen that the club stay in the local area as all the gymnasts were local residents. We also knew, however, that while most of the members came from the Victoria Park area there was a big potential for expansion in the Canning area following the survey results I conducted in the local community. So we ideally wanted somewhere in the heart of Swan which would be accessible to everyone. Michele stated that they were looking for a warehouse that was square, with a lot of space for training and a high roof for their equipment. 


After a long process, I am pleased to be able to advise the House that Michele and the gymnastics association have found new premises on Tennant Street, Welshpool, and the club's future is now secure. This is very close to where my business used to be. I visited the new facility recently and it is twice as big as the old facility and perfect for the club. The location is close to perfect as it is close to the suburbs of Canning, Victoria Park and Belmont and also next to a train station. 


I would like to publicly thank the owners of the Welshpool site who worked with the club and provided the facilities at a reasonable rate. They have made a great contribution to the community by doing this. Michelle must be congratulated for her tenacity—and she should be commended as she has been focused throughout the process and has got a deserved result. I will continue to help the club in any way possible into the future.


Finally, I would like to talk about another local issue that I have been working on in Lathlain in my electorate of Swan. In January Lathlain residents contacted my office about an escalation of antisocial behaviour taking place at the vacant Red Castle Motel site in Lathlain. According to residents, the site was occupied by squatters and had seen a spike in incidents since a fire at the vacant building in September. There was concern that the premises might become a base for criminals and drug dealers operating in the area.


We contacted the relevant parties, and a meeting was held between the officer in charge of Kensington police, the police inspector of the south-east metropolitan district, representatives of the owners and representatives of the town of Victoria Park to address the issues. The meeting was positive and there was a consensus on immediate action to prevent the site from becoming a source of crime in the Lathlain-Burswood area. The priority was obviously to secure the building, and there was widespread agreement from all parties that this needs to happen as soon as possible, and this has now been undertaken. Significant responsibility lies with the owners to secure the premises to prevent access.


We know that crime is in issue in the Burswood area and we do not want this to develop into a base for further criminal activity. Long-term, the stadium precinct developments—including a train station overhaul, combined with the rejuvenation of the Crown at Burswood—provide an opportunity to design out much of the crime problems that exist in the area. In the meantime we must stay vigilant and continue to crack down on the antisocial behaviour as much as possible. I will continue to work with the police and the council to do what I can to help. Our focus, as always, is on the community who deserve and should be able to live in a harmonious environment and have an expectation of safety and freedom from crime in their area. Thank you.
