"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—It is a great pleasure to contribute to this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001. Anyone who has been following the debate over the last few months about the excise on fuel and the price of fuel would, I dare say, have a fair knowledge of the reasons behind the introduction of this bill. Most members of the public who are concerned about the price of fuel will welcome the fact that the excise has been reduced by 1.5c, even though it does not make a considerable difference to the price that they pay for a tank of fuel. We need to go back and look where this originated. It originated from an opposition that is just determined, no matter what, to destroy the budget situation in Australia. There is no doubt that, if we had oppositions across Australia like this opposition, the country would be in a very poor state because this opposition is not interested in talking about what is good for the country but it is interested in what it can do to make sure the government does not get the country into a financial position that is strong and that will benefit all those Australians who are dependent on a strong and balanced economy. 
The fuel debate has been a very dishonest debate. The price of world fuel rose at the same time as the GST was introduced and this opposition went out to indoctrinate the Australian public into believing that the increase in the price of fuel was purely excise. Some of the media headlines we saw across Australia did not help at all. Sometimes I wonder whether the media are interested in the truth or whether they are interested only in sensational headlines. Quite frankly, there is a large proportion of the community that believes that the price of fuel did increase because of excise. That is patently untrue.
The Labor Party have a very interesting history in relation to excise. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition were out there making great noises about excise and about the increase in excise, but they always forget that famous 1993 statement where the government went to an election with the promise of  l-a-w law cuts but came back and immediately increased excise by 5c a litre —nothing to do with inflation. The Leader of the Opposition, who at that time was in another position, said this was a very small adjustment.
Let us look at the debate that we had over the so-called inflationary spike from the introduction of the new tax system, which was around 1.6c, and then look at the debate that led off from that, where the opposition were out there ranting and raving about a tax on a tax. This was the GST of course that was on the inflationary spike—a tax on a tax—and this was going to make some great difference to the Australian motorist. Isn't it amazing that the GST effect on the inflationary spike was 0.1525 of 1c. That was the great tax on a tax that we had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition running around talking about as an unfair tax—0.1525 of 1c was the amount. Talk about hypocrisy! Quite frankly, this has to be the most hypocritical opposition in the history of Australia.
Another thing that seems to be missed in all this talk on the new tax system—and again I might say that it is not being helped by the media—is that the GST is the states tax. So if there was a GST influence on the inflationary spike then it was the states tax. That is where the GST goes to. We never hear that—we always here that it is a federal government tax—but of course the GST has taken over as the states tax, and they are very happy about it. Although we might have noted in the petrol debate that the hypocritical Premier of New South Wales and the hypocritical Premier of Victoria were running around talking about the federal government increase on excise, the GST is their tax. I think you have to look very closely at what this debate is all about. 
We also have states out there posturing about this terrible impost on the Australian public who are collecting their own taxes. Of course, it has now changed: they are saying there is no state fuel tax. Isn't that marvellous! What hypocrites; what distorters of the truth! If you remember—
—The member for Paterson might listen and he might come up to the north of the state and see the difference in price across the border in Queensland, because the Queensland state government refunds the fuel tax that has given them the 8.35c a litre that is given to all states. As we know, the Commonwealth government cannot treat any state differently, so the money collected is given back to all states, and the only state of course that refunds it to the motorist is the Queensland government. We have the Premier and the Treasurer of New South Wales and the member for Clarence, the Minister for Local Government, standing up and saying, `There is no state fuel tax.' Absolute baloney! You only have to look at the price across the border and there is a state fuel tax. Why aren't the states doing something for the motorist? It is a little bit like the milk debate, isn't it? Take the money and give nothing back. It is the same with this: take the money, give nothing back and blame the federal government.
I think it is quite a joke that the member for Clarence should stand up and say that there is no state fuel tax. Everyone in the street says to me, `Isn't this typical.' You have only to look across the border to see what the difference in price is, and he is trying to tell us there is no state fuel tax. They do not get very far. His adviser, Mr Terry Flanagan, who has been running all around the place to meetings in trying to convince people, is not getting much credibility at all. There is no doubt that this particular bill will help. I think the most important part about it is that there is no automatic indexation from now on. If governments want to increase the excise, then they will have to come back to the parliament to do so.
The opposition have been going out there trying to peddle the story that the government are deliberately putting an excise and a tax on fuel for their own benefit. But where does the federal government get the money from? We can get it only from a few areas these days: we can get it from the excise, we can get it from company tax and we can get it from personal tax. But where does it go? Are the opposition really saying that there should be a reduction in excise so there can be a reduction in pensions? Because that is where the money goes. Let us look at the last federal budget. There was something like $153 billion in the budget and $53 billion went to pensions, disability pensions and welfare. Where does that money come from if it does not come from fuel excise? Are we to increase taxes? Are we going to have some other means of raising the revenue that is going to provide that money for the community? We do not hear about that. They go out there and rant and rave and try to stir up people and their emotions about fuel prices. 
We even had a letter in the media up in my area on the North Coast of New South Wales recently from Senator Aden Ridgeway complaining about the excise on fuel. I thought that was rather interesting coming from a Democrat, because from my memory it is the Democrats who say there should not be a reduction in fuel excise. The Democrats believe there should be a high price on fuel so that people burn less. That has always been my understanding of their argument. Now we have people getting on the bandwagon and talking about excise because they think it is a popular story and that they are going to gain some political benefit from it. I thought it was very interesting to say the least that Senator Ridgeway bought into this debate up on the North Coast of New South Wales. Needless to say, I will be replying to his letter. 
Obviously people are not happy with the price of fuel at the present time. I dare say I am included in that. Let us look at the farming community. Because of demand, the price of diesel has gone up a lot more than the price of petrol and that is causing trouble in the farming community and also in the construction industry, despite the fact that this government brought in a new tax system and reduced the excise on diesel, that this government compensated for most of the increase of the GST on fuel—and there is a minor argument there about the level of compensation for the increase in GST on fuel—and that the government brought in a scheme which meant that isolated areas in Australia could get up to 2c a litre extra reduction in the price of fuel. There is no doubt that people are not impressed with the increase in fuel prices. I was in England in September last year and the price of fuel there then was $2.50 a litre. I think that puts it into perspective. Looking at the statistics, it is clear that only America has cheaper fuel than Australia. We need to put some of that into perspective, despite the fact that people do not like paying extra prices. If the world fuel moguls do not screw the market as much as they would like to, and the price of oil on the world market comes down, I am sure we will see that reflected in the marketplace.  
I note that in a report from the ACCC it believes the price of fuel has not increased as much as might have been expected because of world effects. The ACCC believes that the effect of the new tax system has been passed on to consumers in Australia. I dare say you would find it difficult to convince the consumers of Australia of that argument. However, it is interesting to note that the new tax system has had benefits and that the ACCC believes some of those benefits have been passed on to consumers. 
I want to make some comments about the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001. Again, there has been a certain amount of hypocrisy here, because I know the Labor Party have been running around saying there was a certain promise on the price of beer in Australia, that that is going to be maintained and that they are going to defend that position. I used to be a publican and I know that serving beer across a counter is different from serving packaged beer from a bottle shop. I know that there has been a difference in price for some time and I dare say that that has had an effect on business. 
I understand the position of hoteliers who are saying that this could have an effect on their business. Nevertheless, you cannot get away from the fact that if you are serving beer across the counter it is a service that comes within the realm of the goods and services tax. It is no different from a restaurant where you are serving food; you are serving beverage. Whether we like it or not, it certainly comes within the realm of the goods and services tax.
If we are going to continue to react to every little group in the community that see that they may have been disadvantaged by the introduction of the new tax system, where we look at all the negatives and we do not look at the positives, I dare say we are going to finish up with a tax system that is going to be as complicated as, if not more complicated than, the wholesale sales tax that we replaced. That is something which I think is causing concerns already. I fervently believe that if the Democrats had not interfered in the new tax system it would be a much better system at the present time. You can certainly say that in the area of food, where small businesses have this complication of what is taxed and what is not taxed, and you can certainly say that in the diesel fuel area, where there are some extraordinary problems that have been caused by the Democrats. I would have been much happier, if in fact it had been proven in the long term that people on lower incomes in the community were disadvantaged by the new tax system, and we would have been much better off, increasing their pensions or their benefits than interfering in the system that was put forward. The member for Paterson, who is at the table, may well laugh, but the Labor Party had the opportunity to help here, but they are not in the mood and never have been. If they had supported the government in the Senate, the Democrats would not have had a say. They would not have had any influence whatsoever. The Labor Party had their opportunity to support the government in these areas and they opted to be the spoiler. All they want to be is the spoiler. All they want to do is affect the standard of living in this country by continuing to undermine the budget credibility of this country. That is all they want to do. 
If you have a look at the excise on beverages, you see that not all but a lot of that is in the state area. The member for Paterson probably does not listen enough to understand that these things do happen, but he would remember the High Court decision which struck down the state taxes on fuel, the state taxes on liquor and the state taxes on cigarettes. I well know because in the hotel I used to pay my state tax, and a fairly hefty blow it was at the end of the year. Again, this is a state area. I am just wondering, if in fact this does flow through to the states and the likes of Mr Carr and Mr Bracks do not get the money from the GST that they are fervently waiting for, what effect that is going to have. I would hope that they might start to talk to the Leader of the Opposition about the effects that it has on state budgets. Undoubtedly, the effect will flow through to the state governments if this move by the government is stopped by the Labor Party in the Senate.
I think there are a lot of things at stake here. The bills are important bills. They make a commitment. As the Prime Minister said at the time, he heard what the people were saying about this particular issue. I do believe the people were hoodwinked. I do believe they thought they were going to get a much greater benefit than they did because they were absolutely misled by an opposition that was prepared to go out there and lead them up the garden path and tell them stories that they were going to get huge benefits out of this. Of course they did not, because the amount of excise itself was not what they thought it was. I have had this put to me on many occasions by people who I suppose do not follow the debate as closely as we do. I had one woman talk to me one day about the huge price of fuel. I said, `How much do you think that increase has been from the government taxes that are collected?' She said, `It has to be 30c.' It is more like 2c. But that was the misleading of the community that was deliberately being done and is still being done by the Labor Party opposition.
I think it is about time the Labor opposition acted a little bit more responsibly in this place, because one thing about our system of government is that there needs to be responsibility—from government, definitely, but also from an opposition, because an opposition plays a part in the governing of the country and it can have influence on the government of a country, particularly with the way the Senate is made up at the present time. If the Labor Party had any sense of responsibility, they would be working with the government on some of these issues to see that Australia and Australians benefit from the changes that have been put in place.
It has been said often in this place and it needs to be repeated: while the opposition stand and rant and rave about all these issues, they are not going to change them. So it is hypocrisy in its greatest form to stand up and talk about all the difficulties of a tax system when they know very well that it is right and they know very well that, as soon as they get the government benches—which they will one day, goodness knows when, but they will—they will embrace it. They will then, of course, as the Treasurer has said, believe that it is the greatest tax system in the history of Australia.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—To answer the honourable member for Page, the Labor opposition has opposed the GST from its introduction. The government is now suffering from the slow burn we told them would affect them, and the National Party is in disarray because of it. It is no good the honourable member for Page coming in here arguing that everything with respect to increases in petrol prices in this country has something to do with the Labor opposition. It is the government's decisions that have put the government where it is, and the public is angry at the government's endeavour to try and gain some financial benefit from the GST over and above what was being gained because of the changes in excise. 
The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 effect a decrease in excise and, of course, there is the by now famous 1.5c cent reduction in the excise on petroleum products. This was supposed to have made an impact in country areas which were hurting so much from the price of petrol, but the effort has been too little and too late. There was hardly any change in petrol prices in my electorate; in fact, it seems that there has been no change at all. When people are paying over the odds anyway, it is hardly a ripple on the pond. It might be reasonable for Tasmanians if Tasmanians knew that they were going to get some of the proceeds from higher petrol prices resulting from government taxes and excises, but if we look at the allocations from the Roads to Recovery and Roads of National Importance programs, then I am not surprised at Tasmanians' anger. For instance, last week I attended a public meeting at the Copping hall and listened to a community in anguish about the number of deaths on the Arthur Highway, one of our premier tourist routes to the renowned Port Arthur site. Two days after the meeting, another three people died, including a one-year old child. 
Successive Liberal governments have ignored and forgotten this pathetic excuse for a highway, spending only $75,000 of road excise taxes from 1992 to 1998. The current Labor government in Tasmania has, at least, tried to balance the books by spending over $1 million already on this road, but this, of course, is a drop in the ocean for what is needed to be done to this road.
We heard at that meeting that studies had been done over the years but that each time a request had been put in for the Roads of National Importance it had been rejected. They have been turned down three times. The problems there are intense and immense and cannot be dealt with solely through one source of funding. All three levels of government need to be involved. What needs to be done? The meeting noted that the temporary addition of turn-outs has not worked and, in fact, has added to the danger problem. It listed some suggestions. The edges of the road, to the guideposts, must be sealed as there is insufficient room for two large vehicles to pass each other and remain on the road surface. Trees along the road inside the road surface must be removed. Those trees overhanging the road from the far side of the fences must be lopped. Any passing lanes should be where the road rises and not where it falls. Proper road markings must be made on the road with the use of white paint.
It is a tourist route, and there are between 100 and 200 coaches on this road each month. Coupled with the timber trucks and other large carriers, the road is insufficient to cope with the current volume of traffic. It was also felt that anything the size of a B- double should be banned from roads maintained by the state as they are of insufficient standard. Turn-offs around the Lewisham, Primrose Sands and Copping areas are not allowing traffic to enter the highway at busy times without dangerous manoeuvres.
The people have said that they have no faith in the engineers or in the consultation process that went on because what they said was not listened to. They advocated the issues when the people came down for consultation, and what they said has turned out to be what is required. This community cannot waste any more time. Urgent action must be taken to stop the carnage. Tasmania needs urgent assistance through the Roads of National Importance through the federal parliament, and the state government is once again seeking to put in a request. Senator Abetz was at that meeting and agreed to make a cooperative effort to try to secure funding this time for a major problem such as this highway.
I appreciate that road safety must be put above political point scoring but, by the same token, the buck cannot be passed. We are all responsible. We have to fix it. With the weather deteriorating and the road surfaces slippery, we must start doing something immediately even if, at this stage, it is only removing the trees and erecting danger barriers and additional speed signs. I have asked the state government to make a start with that. I am seeking urgent assistance from the federal government for this problem before any more Tasmanians or tourists to the state die. The people of Port Arthur and the Tasman Peninsula have suffered enough. At the time of the massacre at Port Arthur the then Liberal transport minister, John Cleary, wrote to the Prime Minister asking for special funds to upgrade the road. He was refused. 
Since 2 January this year, eight people have died. I extend my deepest sympathy to those families and have pledged to do everything I can to prevent any more senseless loss of life. Action must be taken, and I call on all levels of government to put a special effort into making sure that the deaths of these people are taken into consideration in the move to improve this highway, that governments show that they do care and want to ensure that roads are made as safe as possible. I have written to the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson; and I have written to the state minister, whose office has already been in touch with me. I ask now that something be done. No-one can prevent human error, but we can ensure that it is not added to by terrible road surfaces, bad engineering and the lack of funding to make the proper corrections.
When I speak to this excise bill I speak of the fact that Tasmania has not received its fair share of the excise that has been collected. We have not got our 2.5 per cent share of road funding. Over the last few years there has been only a small amount allocated through the Roads of National Importance program—RONI. This was in the Braddon electorate and was a result of an agreement between the last Liberal state government and this government to build a bridge in the middle of Devonport, which really should have been funded under the national highway scheme—it is on the national highway. There has been no RONI money allocated to Tasmania since then and therefore my state has been missing out on its fair share. The Arthur Highway was first built in the 1800s with convict labour and was meant to take only horses and carts. Now there are 160 to 200 tourist buses a month going down this road. Coupled with all the domestic traffic, hire cars and other commercial vehicles, the traffic has grown out of all proportion to the state of the road.
The GST has not helped the overall amount of allocation to states for such activities as road building, health and education. Our tax base is shrinking. Fewer people are paying more tax. They are the people at the lower end of the tax scale who do not get offered salary packages and other fringe benefits. When we discuss the imposition of excises—which, after all, are taxes under a different name—it must be realised whom they are being collected from and what the end use is likely to be. Who are the drinkers of the most beer in Australia? Who traditionally drinks beer socially as part of their entertainment? It is the Australian workers in the rural areas, in the building industry, in the factories and in the hundreds of small sites around the country. They are the ones who are also suffering from the imposition of high petrol prices and are being given a very small handout far too late to make any difference.
It is very interesting to recall that during the last election campaign the Prime Minister promised that there would be only a very small increase. I will quote the Prime Minister:
There will be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer.
The Prime Minister said that on the John Laws show on 23 September 1998. To quote him again:
Across the board there is virtually no change in relation to alcohol. A tiny CPI equivalent rise in relation to ordinary beer.
That was on the Alan Jones program on 14 August 1998. The Prime Minister has been found wanting again. And we wonder why there is a slow burn on the GST. People's petrol prices and people's beer prices have increased—these are pretty ordinary costs to most ordinary Australians. 
Petrol prices are still high and beer prices went up once the GST was introduced, and now the government are having another go here today—the workers are now having to pay more for their beer. So what are we doing with these bills? We are taking away with one hand and giving with the other, with no real gains for anyone. So raising the price of beer is not going to really help deal with the problems faced by rural Australia. I accept the argument that the opposition is making that we should amend this bill to impose a lower rate of excise, more in line with the Prime Minister's promise that ordinary beer will not rise by more than 1.9 per cent as a result of the GST. I would also like to see some of these excises being put to use for the good of rural people out of whose pocket much of these excises on beer and petrol come.",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001. The purpose of this bill is to reduce the excise on petrol, diesel and other petroleum products by 1.5c a litre, to increase the excise on aviation kerosene by 0.036c a litre and to introduce the new three-tier excise structure for beer. I want to speak about the fuel excise reduction because that is of most interest to my constituents and certainly something that they widely welcome.
At the time the tax reform was introduced—at the end of June 2000—the commitment was made that 6.7c a litre would be taken from the excise on fuel and that 1.5c a litre would be contributed to that reduction by savings that the oil companies would make from tax changes. Overall, this would ensure that there was a negligible influence from the imposition of the new tax arrangements. Regrettably, the oil companies were poor corporate citizens and did not fulfil their responsibilities. There is no doubt that this approach on the part of the oil companies has caused a great deal of heartache out in the community. I am pleased that the government has stepped in to keep faith with the commitment that was made—that they have done what the oil companies should have done. The government has now delivered in full on the promise that was made at the 1998 election. It is regrettable that taxpayers' dollars have to be put in place because major companies in Australia, which were proponents of tax reform and which will be beneficiaries of tax reform, have failed to keep faith with the Australian people. However, the government has done so. The effect of this bill will reduce the excise on unleaded petrol and diesel to 38.143c a litre. It will reduce the excise on leaded petrol to 40.516c a litre. I am pleased that the government listened, acted and delivered for Australian motorists and fuel users.
I would like to give a short history of fuel excise in Australia. When the Australian Labor Party came to office, fuel excise was 6.155c a litre—I will repeat that for the House: it was effectively 6c a litre. When they left office, it was 34.183c a litre, from 6c to 34c a litre. That is an increase of 28.028c a litre, or over 450 per cent. Ten cents a litre resulted directly from the ALP's budget increases—without any compensation to motorists—half of which was contained in the 1993 budget. It is interesting now to recall the description that the Leader of the Opposition used at the time to describe this 10c a litre increase. It was seen as a `small adjustment'. If 1.5c a litre is widely and quite understandably welcomed by motorists and fuel users around Australia, it shows the most appalling disregard for motorists and fuel users for the Leader of the Opposition to call 10c a litre a `small adjustment'. The increase in fuel excise under the Labor Party was 35 per cent—not 35 per cent in total, it was 35 per cent per annum for 13 years. Compare this to the increase under the coalition government: 2.3 per cent per annum. It was in fact the Labor Party that introduced automatic indexation of fuel excise in 1983-84.
This bill contains measures, which came into effect on 2 March 2001, to reduce the excise on petrol and diesel by 1.5c a litre. It is important to mention that many of the small country service stations were not able to pass that on on 2 March 2001. In the cities, where there is a high turnover, it was a simple matter to do so—what they won on the swings they lost on the roundabouts, as the saying goes. But small service stations in the country, many of which at the time had, say, 47,000 litres in their tanks, had to wait until that was used—because it had been purchased at the old excise price—before they could pass the savings on. Unfortunately, spurred on by some of our opponents in politics, there was a degree of anger directed towards the staff and owners of the small service stations, who earnestly wanted to pass on the savings and keep faith with the commitment that was made. Exploiting the situation by others in politics was a very poor approach.  
The excise rate on other petroleum products which have concessional rates will also be proportionately reduced under this bill. I am pleased to see that the ACCC has increased powers to ensure that the benefit is passed to motorists and not absorbed by the oil companies. The Treasurer has also called on state governments to play a role in reducing fuel prices. The reality is that state governments receive payments equivalent to 8.35c per litre collected by the Commonwealth. The only state that passes that on to motorists is Queensland, although I notice that at one stage Premier Beattie did try to claw it back but public anger and opposition resulted in a reversal of the decision. Other states should consider doing likewise. It is of considerable assistance to motorists if there is not a state tax on fuel. I commend the member for La Trobe, who I understand is a strong proponent of this measure.
The coalition has also done one other thing which is not readily appreciated at this point in time and that is to remove the automatic indexation of fuel excise. This will have the effect of freezing the fuel excise at the lower level proposed in this legislation. In other words, it will be frozen from now on. For any government to change that, they will have to bring a bill into the House of Representatives and the Senate. They will have to say to the Australian people that, once again, they are going to use automatic indexation, twice yearly increases, to take advantage of motorists and fuel users in Australia.
This is a significant decision for country areas. For the people out there who have seen the excise increase year after year, accompanied now by crude oil increases and of course commensurate increases in the price of diesel and other fuels, it has been a sore burden to bear. But I am very proud to be part of a government that has said: `This is a big country with big distances and hence big fuel bills; we are not going to allow either a coalition government or a future government to take advantage of motorists and fuel users by automatically increasing the tax on fuel. Any government that wants to do that will have to go to the parliament and hence to the people, to a public debate.' I think that is entirely appropriate and I applaud the government for taking a stand against continuing taxation on fuels. It hits us hardest in rural and regional areas where people have long distances to take children to school and products to market—a whole range of business and personal activities. I have to say that this commitment implements National Party policy, which has always been to oppose the automatic indexation of fuel excise.
But it is interesting to look at what the opposition would have done. While they were happy to promote this issue throughout the rural and regional areas, while they were happy in my area to put out petitions calling for a change to fuel excise, let us see what the ALP in government were actually proposing to do—because it is fine to stir up an issue; it is fine to go out and raise community anger. In fact, it is the role of opposition to oppose and encourage governments to make decisions—that is probably justifiable—but you have to have the honesty to be able to say, `Well, having focused on this problem, we will also address it in a responsible way.' Let us see what in fact the ALP in government were proposing to do about fuel excise. Allow me to read from an interview with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer. The compere said: 
What about fuel excise, Mr Crean? That causes a lot of problems too. What sort of commitment can Labor make regarding fuel excise?
Simon Crean said:
Well, what we've—basically our position has been that there needs to be this mix between indirect taxes and direct taxes. We always had fuel excise in that mix. We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regimes. 
That was not the issue. It is quite plain that the Labor Party were opportunists in this debate. They were not going to make any change to fuel excise at all. I am going to widely distribute this interview in my electorate—in fact, I am reproducing it in all of my literature. It is not appropriate to go to country people, stir up an issue, opportunistically take advantage of it, and then say, `But we're not going to do anything'—and never were. That is not an acceptable way to behave in either government or, particularly, in opposition.
I would like to move now to another statement that Mr Crean made which is inaccurate. He goes on to talk about the city-country differential. There is no doubt that this is a matter of great concern. When you have a difference between city and country prices of up to 10c a litre, there is no doubt that motorists and fuel users are angry about that. They hear the prices their relatives are paying, perhaps in Brisbane, and they wonder why they have to pay more. Allow me to read from Mr Crean's interview again. He says:
I mean, the reason you've got low prices in the cities is because you've got a lot of independents in the cities—in Melbourne and Sydney—driving the price down. What we really need to do is to encourage that sort of direction.
If only it were that simple. In fact, it is not. The reason for the differential between city and country prices, according to information that I have been given, which I intend to pass on to the ACCC, is, once again, the major oil companies. We know they are poor corporate citizens. They continue to be that. They take advantage of the country in order to benefit the city. I have no problem with city prices being low. We do not begrudge the city lower fuel prices at all. But what they are doing is taking advantage of the situation. 
Allow me to explain how it is suggested that this happens. It is very difficult, in such a simple industry, where you have a homogeneous product delivered by four major companies to outlets, to find out what happens. You would imagine that this would be the simplest industry in Australia in which to track down what happens. But the oil companies have been able to make it very complicated—in order, I think, to cover their tracks. We know they are poor corporate citizens. 
In a country area, the average turnover might be 130,000 a month, compared to turnover in a large outlet in Brisbane of, say, 350,000 litres a month. However, for these two establishments the basic costs are the same. Their rates are pretty much the same; labour costs are the same; rentals are much the same. Their fixed costs are generally the same. Certainly there are more shop sales in a city area, because there are more customers. There is a boost there to the profits of the business in the cities. But what happens is this. The oil companies will tell you that they supply their fuel to all of their outlets at the same price. For argument's sake, if that price for delivery is 80c a litre, then, as far as it goes, that statement is true. Then how is it that, when motorists in Brisbane are paying, for instance, 75c a litre for fuel, motorists in my area are paying 85c a litre? The natural conclusion is to say that the service stations are taking advantage of us. They are not. 
Allow me to explain what the oil companies have been doing. Let us look at a little country area to start with. The margin there is about 5c a litre. It certainly varies, but anything less than that and they are really not viable. They are running on 5c a litre. They buy at 80c per litre, they have a margin of 5c a litre, and they sell at 85c a litre. That is a pretty simple equation. 
What happens in the city however is that the service stations buy at 80c per litre and their margin is 3c per litre. They have a greater turnover so they can operate at a slightly lesser margin. What the oil companies do in the cities is give a rebate of 8c per litre, effectively. That of course allows them to sell at 75c per litre. The oil companies are happy to give a rebate in the cities of some 8c per litre, apparently, according to the information I have, but they will not give the same rebate in country areas. There is a rebate if it falls below 4c per litre. As most country service stations tell me, under 4c per litre, and you are not there anyway. It is simply not viable to operate a business at that level. So of course they avoid getting into that situation and never receive the extra rebate. 
I believe this is a very serious matter. It is not a matter of more competition; it is a matter again of oil companies playing country and city off against each other. We know they are poor corporate citizens. They have demonstrated that to every motorist in Australia. I trust when this information is supplied to the ACCC that, with their increased powers, they will take this matter up. It is unfortunate that national competition policy can focus on farmers and the small mechanisms they have to assist them on the world market and that it can bully many of the small producers in Australia but when it comes to the big players it seems that all of these matters cannot be properly investigated, brought to book and rectified. 
The argument that transport costs encourage the differential between city and country is simply not so. Transport costs from, say, Brisbane to my area are about 1c per litre, maybe a bit more. That does not go anywhere near accounting for the up to 10c a litre differential. One of the other tricks that the oil companies get up to is not maintaining faith with their distributor network. The distributors in country areas might sell, for argument's sake, 130 million litres a year. But if one of their customers buys, say, 3.5 million litres a year they will sell to them at a far better price than their wholesaler, their distributor. Why should that be? I would have thought that under the trade practices legislation you cannot have it both ways. If you are going to preferentially price on the basis of quantity, it does not work both ways—you cannot preferentially price if someone buys less. Again, the oil companies have proved that they can make and break the rules as they wish. 
This has to be looked at. I trust that Professor Fels will live up to his formidable reputation and investigate properly through the inquiry that the Commonwealth is setting up, and the coalition government has instigated, as to why there is a differential between city and country prices. I do not believe it is because country service stations are taking advantage of motorists. They do not have the capacity to do that. When you see most of their operations, they are really struggling. I do not believe it is transport, which equates, as I said, to about 1c per litre. I do not believe it is because there is more competition in the city areas. Yes, there may be but in some of the larger centres such as Toowoomba and Townsville, and so on, one would imagine that there would be adequate competition—plainly, it is not competition. Again, I think it is our poor corporate citizens, the major oil companies. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I might just pick up from where the member for Dawson left off because I give her great credit for acknowledging the fact that the city-country price differential on fuel remains totally unacceptable and has of course been compounded by the GST. It is an incontestable fact that, for the first time in the history of the Federation, country motorists are paying more tax on their fuel than their city counterparts. In addition, the member for Dawson has identified a number of market issues as they relate to that city-country price differential. I have to disagree with her on a couple of points, though. I am disappointed she has left the chamber. Competition is the answer and another inquiry into the industry is what we do not need. We do of course need to come to a conclusion in the inquiry by the ACCC into the government's fuel grants scheme—that is, the rebate of 1c or 2c to country motorists, for which there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that it is not being passed on to motorists. I very anxiously await the results of that inquiry. 
But we do not need a general inquiry into the industry—the answers are there before us. The member for Dawson is correct: you cannot put the very large city-country price differential down to transport costs alone. Quite clearly, there are greater things at play than transport costs. Of course, what is at play is the share power of the major oil companies and the way they are able to manipulate prices and take excessive profits wherever and whenever they can get away with it. There are other issues such as volume throughputs; that is, city service stations sell much more fuel and need only make a very small margin on each litre of fuel as compared to country outlets which have much smaller volumes. Then there are what we call non-forecourt sales; that is, sales other than sales of petrol—things like hamburgers, chips and a range of other grocery items. These are sales which allow the non-forecourt areas of city service stations to be profitable and, in doing so, allow them to subsidise their fuel prices—in other words, make less on the money they charge for their fuel than is necessary in the country. But at the end of the day a large city-country price differential will be maintained while ever the major oil companies are allowed to control the price of fuel all the way from the refinery to the bowser.
In 1980, then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser tried to do something about this problem by divorcing the major oil companies from the practice of petrol retailing. He introduced the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 which effectively divorced them from that area of petrol operation. That was a good move. In those days we had nine major oil companies and his move was out of concern about concentration in the market. Today we have four oil companies and we have a very effective oligopoly in operation which allows them to control the price of that fuel all the way from the refinery to the bowser.
Over the course of those 20 years, since that legislation was introduced, the major oil companies have been very effective in circumventing that act, largely through the system of fuel discounting. In other words, they sell the fuel to the service station retailer at a price they know he cannot sell it at and be profitable and then they offer him a discount to make him profitable which gives them total control over the retailer; notwithstanding the fact that they are not the retailer themselves.
The other method has been the introduction of multisite franchising, a practice whereby the major oil companies, in controlling one franchisee—quite often a former employee of a major oil company—who has 19 or 20 subfranchise agreements, effectively control up to 20 additional service stations. So it is an act that has been circumvented by the major oil companies. This is an issue, but it is no excuse for repealing that act, which is what the government has been attempting to do. The government, rather than curtail the power of the major oil companies, wants to deliver to them more power to control prices. What the government must do is more strongly enforce the sites act and leave it in place in order to keep the major oil companies out of retailing.
The member for Dawson will have an opportunity to do something about the city-country price gap when my private member's bill on this issue comes back to the parliament. The bill will for the first time give service station operators in this country the right to shop around for their fuel rather than be tied to one exclusive agreement with one particular major oil company. That will introduce competition at the wholesale level in the market for the first time. We have seen the impacts that further competition can have at the retail level with the arrival of Woolworths and the other independents into the market. The member for Dawson will have the opportunity to support my bill so that we can demonstrate what effect the arrival of competition can have at the wholesale level of the market.
For some months my bill has been under consideration by the Senate Economics References Committee. That committee has now reported to the Senate. That committee has recommended to the Senate that my bill be supported in that chamber, so it is my intention to have that bill introduced into the Senate where I expect to secure the support of the Democrats. Therefore, I expect that bill to secure passage through that house. When that occurs I will then introduce that bill into the House of Representatives once again. It did not get too far last time because the government controls the numbers here and it did not get past the first reading. I will not need to introduce it here again. It will come back here as a message from the Senate and the member for Dawson and others will have an opportunity to really do something serious about addressing that unacceptable city-country price gap. 
It is not surprising that the speakers list for the bills before the House is a fairly long one, because the price of both fuel and beer is a huge issue in every electorate in this country. A huge number of government members, particularly those in marginal seats, are very concerned about the likely response of their constituents to the government's broken promises over the way in which the GST has affected the prices of both of those products. I might just remind the House of what those promises were. The first was that the GST will not cause the price of petrol to rise. The second was that the GST will not cause the cost of beer to rise by more than 1.9 per cent.
I note that, while the list is fairly long, a lot of government members were talking a lot about petrol but not too many of them were talking about beer, and I want to go into detail on both of those issues. Before I do so, I want to say something about the way in which the government has introduced these bills for debate today. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 deals with alcohol excise. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 deals with petrol excise. The government has decided to link the two bills in a cognate debate in an attempt to hold the Australian parliament and the Australian consumer to ransom. The government has made the passage of the legislative underpinning of its petrol backflip conditional upon the parliament's support for the legislative underpinning of its broken promise on the impact of the GST on beer prices, which have risen up to 10 per cent as a result of the GST.
The opposition will not allow the parliament or the Australian consumer to be held to ransom. These are not ransom notes; these are ransom bills. We will hold our ground and force the government to make good on its election promises. The PM again said last night, speaking at COSBOA's small business summit—and I want to congratulate COSBOA on the organisation of that summit and I acknowledge the Minister for Small Business, who is at the table and who also attended the dinner last night and indeed the breakfast this morning—said again that he stood by his GST package. He said that he went to the last election seeking the imprimatur of the electorate, seeking a mandate. He said he secured that mandate and, having secured that mandate, he was determined to drive through his program of what he calls `tax reform'. Let us revisit what he went to the last election with. He went to the electorate promising a new tax which would be good for the economy. We now know the result. Six months into the tax, after 9½ years of solid economic growth, for the first time the economy has gone into negative growth. He said it would be good for employment and, of course, we now know that, as a result of the first six months of the operation of the GST, unemployment is on the rise.
He said it would be good for business confidence, and there are a whole raft of surveys now available that indicate that business confidence is sinking to all-time lows. He said that the GST was going to be good for small business. There is no shortage of surveys which would indicate something very different. He said it would be good for their profitability. Wrong. He said it would be good for their cash flow. Wrong. We saw another survey very recently, in the last few days, from Australian Business Ltd which indicates that something like 66 per cent of small firms, firms with 25 employees or fewer, now say that the GST has had a negative impact on their cash flow. The majority of those identified slow payments from their larger business customers as one of the key reasons for that. I say that that is something the government could do something about today. The government also went to the Australian people saying that the price of petrol would not rise and that the price of beer would not rise. We know now without any doubt that those two specific promises have been well and truly broken. 
To what extent can the Prime Minister claim a mandate? He had no mandate to do this to the Australian people—no mandate to sell pensioners short, no mandate to drive the economy into reverse, no mandate to drive unemployment up and no mandate to put in place a tax system which is crucifying the small business community. Today he has shown he has learned nothing from the first six months of the operation of the GST and the impact on all those people. He has shown that he has learned nothing from the Western Australian election result, he has learned nothing from the Queensland election result and he has learned nothing from the Ryan by-election result. He has demonstrated that today by making this a cognate bill and trying to link together one bill which is an attempt to make good his promise on petrol—I emphasise `attempt' because the 1.5c decrease will go nowhere near making good on that commitment—with another bill which entrenches that failed election promise on petrol. 
Notwithstanding the fact that government members refuse to do so, let me say something about beer. This is not just a consumer issue. It is true to say that the 10 per cent slug on consumers is an absolute disgrace, but so is the impact on small business pubs, now less competitive against the bottle shops run by large organisations such as Coles Myer, and less competitive against their bigger competitors. And, of course, there has been an enormous impact on demand for their product. If you are a bit tight on money, as so many are in the new economic environment, and packaged beer in your large bottle shop is now relatively cheaper than a middy or schooner of beer at your local pub, what do you do? You go for the packaged beer, which is now relatively less expensive. So it has had an impact on consumer demand within those small-business pubs. It has also had an impact on microbreweries, an emerging industry in the Australian economy which we should be supporting, particularly as they form part of our tourism sector. It is an industry which has been adversely affected by the impact of this broken election promise on the price of beer.
On petrol, the member for Page began his speech by saying that this is something that Labor has forced the government to do and we should be held to account for the impact on the budget bottom line. I thank the member for Page for acknowledging that point. He is, of course, vulnerable in his own electorate. He knows that the people in Page are very angry about the government's broken election promises on both beer and petrol. We are very proud of the fact that we have held the government to account and we have as a result forced them some way towards honouring their promise on petrol. We will continue to do the same on beer. We will continue to hold them to account on their broken promise that the price of beer will not rise as a result of the GST.
Let me revisit the issue of petrol just for a moment. The government originally said it would reduce the excise on petrol by 7c a litre and in doing so assured us that the GST would not cause petrol prices to rise. It is history now that that was effective until the price of petrol went through about 77c a litre. We only dream about petrol prices of around 77c a litre now. The government came under some pressure as a result of that. It was quite obvious that 7c a litre was not going to be sufficient when a 10 per cent GST was added to meet their election promise. We all waited with great expectation for them to review that commitment and make the reduction 8c or even 9c, which is probably the appropriate number required to meet that commitment. After the long wait, what did we learn? We learned that, instead of reducing it by 7c a litre the government had decided to reduce it by 6c a litre only, claiming that there were embedded wholesale savings on behalf of the refiners and the major oil companies generally that should be passed on to the consumer. We know now that those embedded wholesale taxes, if not fictitious, were going to take a long time to flow through the system. That was just another fraud the government attempted to place upon the Australian people. The opposition will hold the government to account on these promises. We will do all in our power in the Senate to hold the government to its promises on both petrol and beer and we will be out there standing up for the consumer and those small business operations that have been affected also by that broken promise.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I find it very interesting that the member for Hunter ignores the `service' part of a goods and services tax, and that is exactly what it is. Does the member for Hunter think that there should be a service charge for a cup of coffee at his local cafe society outlet but not have a service charge on the beer when he goes to the pub? Does he also think that his children should be paying a service charge for their coke when they go to McDonald's but he should not be paying a service charge for beer at the local pub? That is the reason why beer in pubs has gone up: because there is a service charge on that beer, and so there should be.
It may interest the member for Hunter, and I see the member for Paterson sitting down now, that with the tax cuts that he received on 1 July, which we all benefited very well out of, if beer is his focus he could actually afford over 100 schooners of beer a day and still be better off. I am not sure that the member for Paterson would actually drink 100 schooners a day, but he certainly financially would be better off with the tax cuts that he got. It may interest members here that I, like many other members, received a letter from the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia Inc. It reads:
Dear Mr Secker,
I am writing in relation to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill number (No. 2) 2001 due to be debated in Parliament during the week 26th-29th March.
These Bills will give effect to the Government's commitments on alcohol tax, first made in 1998 and laid out in Not a New Tax, A New Tax System, particularly in relation to ready-to-drink products (RTDs).
By way of background, prior to 1 July 2000 taxes on RTDs were riddled with historical anomalies. Even though a can of beer, pre-mixed spirits or fermented-base designer drink are all basically the same size and alcohol strength, pre-mixed spirits paid excise of about twice that paid by beer, and wine-based designer drinks paid no excise at all. This led to significant price differentials between products, made no public health or policy sense, and unfairly restricted consumers' choices.
To address this, the Government announced that all RTDs (not covered by the Wine Equalisation Tax), with 10% alcohol by volume or less, would essentially pay the full-strength beer excise rate. This change, gazetted with effect from 1 July 2000, put the three categories on a somewhat more equal taxation footing and is a welcome first step to recognising that `alcohol is alcohol' and should be treated on the basis of strength, not the method of production.
The Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia (DSICA) strongly supports this reform, and asks for your support for the prompt passage of these two Bills to give legislative effect to it. Should this legislation not be passed before 21st June, not only will it cause significant disruption to the industry and a return to the anomalous taxation regime of the past, but it will also threaten at least $300 million in Government revenue from spirits alone.
So there is very strong support from the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia, and of course there is very strong support from the health bodies around Australia, because it is treating alcohol as alcohol, not on the method of production.
It is always a very good idea, I think, for members to occasionally visit the pub and do the pub test. On 30 June last year, on the Friday night prior to these changes coming into effect, I visited the local Keith Hotel—my local watering hole. I did not have the 100 schooners that I could have afforded with the tax cuts that were coming the next day. I went there again the next night, on 1 July, when these measures had come into effect. On the Saturday after these measures had come into effect, there were actually more people in the pub. Interestingly enough, on the Friday night they were drinking more of the beer in the pub whereas on the Saturday night, after the changes, there had been quite a change to the mixed drinks, such as Bundy and cola and so on because they were about $1 a can cheaper—and so they should be because they are based on an equal amount of alcohol. So consumers, even in one day, had decided to make the change. I took a fair bit of ribbing—as a member of parliament does and should receive when he goes to the local hotel—but, by and by, I have certainly been there in recent times and the local hotel has certainly not noted any lack of clientele because the price of beer has gone up and, of course, the price of mixed drinks has gone down. The average person in Australia, with the tax cuts that they receive, would be able to drink 40 schooners a day and still be financially better off as a result of the tax cuts they receive. Mind you, I think it would put a bit more stress on the health system if everybody took that up. 
The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 include a number of measures on fuel and alcohol which were previously introduced by way of tariff proposals. The major amendments proposed by the bill are an increase in the rate of customs duty for imports of kerosene for use as fuel in aircraft, introduction of a new customs tariff structure for beer, wine, vermouth and other wine products, other fermented beverages, undenatured ethyl alcohol and spirits and liqueurs, and a reduction by 1.5c per litre of the customs duty on imports of unleaded petrol, leaded petrol, diesel and certain other petroleum products.
The proposed amendment affecting aviation kerosene substitutes a new rate of customs duty for kerosene used as fuel in aircraft—avtur—and the proposed new rate of excise duty will be 2.795c per litre. That is hardly going to break the back of anyone flying a plane. According to the Bills Digest, in respect of alcoholic beverages:
Item 4 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Bill inserts Additional Notes 3-8 in Chapter 22 of Customs Tariff Act 1995. Each of these notes provides a definition of different types of wine production which are subject to the wine equalisation tax. As noted in the Government's explanatory memorandum to the Bill:
As WET [wine equalisation tax] is applied to the same imported wine and wine products as their Australian equivalents, these Additional Notes replicate the definitions for similar locally made products contained in Subdivision 31A of the WET Act to ensure uniform tax treatment.
The principal effect of items 5 to 12 of part 2 of schedule 1 of this bill is to introduce a new customs tariff structure for beer, wine, vermouth and other wine products, other fermented beverages, undenatured ethyl alcohol, spirits and liqueurs. The proposed structure is based on the percentage of alcohol by volume—that is, alcohol for what it is—exceeding a customs duty-free threshold of 1.15 per cent. The key rates of applicable customs duty are as follows. For alcohol and alcoholic beverages—excluding beer—containing more than 1.15 per cent by volume of alcohol and not exceeding 10 per cent by volume of alcohol, the rate is $30.46 per litre of alcohol. For beer exceeding three per cent but not exceeding 3.5 per cent by volume of alcohol—that is mid-strength beers—it is $35.38 per litre of alcohol. For beer exceeding 3.5 per cent by volume of alcohol, which is normal strength beer, it is $30.46 per litre of alcohol. And for beer not exceeding three per cent by volume of alcohol, it is $41.67 per litre of alcohol. For brandy made wholly from grape spirits, it is $48.17 per litre of alcohol. For alcohol and alcoholic beverages excluding beer and brandy containing more than 10 per cent by volume of alcohol, it is $51.58 per litre of alcohol. 
These amendments relating to alcoholic beverages proposed by the bill give effect to the government's tax reform measures, particularly the replacement of the wholesale sales tax with the goods and services tax. In this restructure, new tariff subheadings have been provided for each category of beverage classified within these headings, to apply the requisite excise equivalent rate of duty. This procedure has ensured uniform duty treatment for imported and locally produced alcoholic beverages. These amendments have already been in effect since 1 July 2000. 
Most importantly, the good news for my constituents in Barker, and indeed for all Australians, is that the bill contains a reduction in petrol and diesel excise of around 6.7c per litre, which came into effect on 1 July 2000. This was part of the government's commitment—which it has fully met—that petrol pump prices need not rise with the introduction of the GST. In addition to the 6.7c per litre excise cut, the petroleum industry will benefit from substantial cost reductions as a result of the tax changes, estimated at around 1.5c per litre. In total, motorists have received compensation of around 8.2c per litre. 
There has been a lot of discussion in the community as to whether the petroleum industry is passing cost savings onto motoring consumers. On this subject, the ACCC, in its fuel monitoring report for the September 2000 quarter, that is, the period immediately following these changes, said: 
The commission's analysis suggests that actual fuel prices have not increased as much as expected on the basis of movements in the underlying factors, including historical wholesale and retail margins. This is not inconsistent with the suggestion that cost savings from the New Tax System changes have been passed on.
In addition, a fuel sales grant of 1c and 2c per litre is paid to retailers of petrol and diesel in non-metropolitan areas and remote areas, respectively. Fuel prices are generally higher in these areas. On Kangaroo Island, in my electorate, all fuel outlets receive a 2c a litre subsidy, and every other petrol station in my electorate receives a 1c a litre subsidy. It may be interesting to note that, because fuel has been an issue out there in my electorate, I have consistently been checking the fuel prices in my travels around the electorate. It is a pretty large electorate, so I get to see many of the differences. 
On the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of three weekends running, the fuel was actually cheaper at Coonalpyn, Tailem Bend, Murray Bridge and Victor Harbor than it was in Adelaide. As often happens in city areas, there are discounts from about Monday to Thursday, then all of a sudden on Thursday night the prices go up, whereas those prices do not fluctuate in the country. So we actually had cheaper fuel prices in many areas of my electorate than in the city. That is due in part to the fact that we give a direct subsidy to the fuel stations.
By contrast, the ALP, who really have no leg to stand on—they are really like a dog between four trees; they certainly do not have a leg to stand on—increased excise on petrol and diesel from 6.155c per litre in 1983 to 34.183c in March 1996. That is an increase of over 28c per litre, or over 450 per cent. That is the Labor Party's record. Of that 28c increase in excise, 10c of it resulted from Labor's budget increases, which occurred without providing any compensation whatsoever to motorists. Five cents of those budget rises came through the 1993 budget—after Labor went to the election promising not to increase taxes. You might recall that Kim Beazley, the present Leader of the Opposition, was the finance minister at the time. He called the 5c excise hike—and it was actually 7c for leaded petrol—a `small adjustment'. This highlights just how hypocritical the opposition leader is on this issue.
This bill also contains the 1.5c per litre reduction in petrol and diesel excise that came into effect on 2 March 2001. The reduction applies to unleaded and leaded petrol, diesel and other petroleum products that attract an equivalent rate of duty. Duty on aviation fuels and those petroleum products attracting concessional rates of duty is reduced in a proportional amount. This is great news for all Australians, particularly for those who live outside the metropolitan areas, such as in my electorate of Barker, who, by necessity, are greater consumers of petrol and diesel. Whilst I am one of the first to acknowledge that the recent steep increases in petrol prices have been the result of rises in the world price of crude oil, I am well aware of how much this was hurting people in my electorate. I certainly raised the issue on many occasions and was delighted that the government that I am a part of listened to the concerns of the Australian public and helped to ease the burden by reducing excise by 1.5c per litre from 2 March 2001. Of course, we have got rid of Labor's continual CPI excises and that is another benefit to motorists in my electorate of Barker. 
The benefits of these reductions in Barker and throughout country and remote areas of this great country are very significant because of the necessity of fuel to so many people. Whether it is to carry on their business or take part in everyday life, fuel is the lifeblood of the people of the bush. For many people in rural, regional and remote areas, there is no such thing as the option of a taxi, a bus or a suburban train. If you want to access education or health services, or simply have a social life, you are totally dependent upon the motor vehicle. To these people, the cost of fuel is a very sensitive issue. The very significant reduction in fuel taxes on the trucking industry is incredibly important, for example, to the cattle producers, the sheep producers and the grain producers in the south-east of my state where transport can constitute about one third of their operating costs. Compared with the old system set up by Labor, they are getting their fuel 24c a litre cheaper.
Country people in our export industries are well aware of the realities of world markets. In the past fortnight I have travelled through my electorate talking to people at Keith, Bordertown, Naracoorte, Coonawarra, Mount Gambier, Millicent, Padthaway, Gawler, Yankalilla, Karoonda, Pinnaroo, Lameroo, Tailem Bend, Murray Bridge, Kingston and many more places. Everywhere I went, the people I talked to recognised the realities of global markets in relation to oil and the impact that high crude prices have had on the cost of their fuel. But, at the same time, the reality is that they welcome the action taken by the government to share some of that burden.
I welcome the responsible way in which this government has brought relief to help preserve the very foundation of business and trade as well as to the ordinary bloke in my electorate. Our record stands in stark contrast to that of the ALP. They have sought to make cheap opportunistic points out of the plight of ordinary Australians in the petrol debate. They go running, bleating to the media and the electorate in mock horror at the price of fuel when in reality it is all a pretence. When they were in government, they presided over a 500 per cent increase in excise, not only were they responsible for the brainchild of indexation but they also regularly introduced one-off discretionary increases in fuel excise. In fact, the opposition has not given any commitment whatsoever to get rid of their own indexed CPI increases in excise. Not once did they compensate country people for the impact their decisions made on their lives. In fact, they made the burden on the battlers worse because they penalised those who were running older cars on leaded fuel. Prime Minister Howard estimated that cutting petrol excise and abandoning excise indexation increases would cost the budget about $550 million in 2001-02 and more thereafter. As petrol consumption grows, the cost of the government's price relief package will grow.
Let me also dispel some of the other misconceptions that have been peddled by those opposite. Did oil companies cut their prices? Yes. Every Australian oil refinery operator cut wholesale delivery prices. Did petrol retail prices fall? Yes, the day after the announcement the ACCC said that surveys in major capital cities showed prices had fallen by an average of 1.7 per cent. I challenge the Senate to pass these bills so that consumers are not denied the ongoing benefit of the petrol and diesel excise reductions. It is vital that the Senate passes these bills before 29 June 2001 or the pre A New Tax System petrol excise rates will apply.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—It is very interesting to come along here today and listen to the speakers from a government that is in complete denial about the effect that the price of petrol is having on the Australian community. They are in complete denial of what the Prime Minister promised and what he has delivered because he certainly did not deliver what he promised. All Australians remember John Howard saying that the GST need not increase the price of petrol. We also all remember the decision on 1 July to take the arbitrary price of petrol, which meant that the government got an immediate windfall of 1.5c per litre. I can remember the Prime Minister going on national television and justifying this situation by saying that the 1.5c mark-up, because of the change in the taxation situation, would be passed on by the oil companies because there would be a saving to the tune of 1.5c and that down the track it would even itself out. We all know that that did not happen. The oil companies certainly were not in the mood to pass on a saving.
If the government thinks that the 1.5c per litre that we are talking about today, which this legislation is about, is going to remove the angst in the community, they are wrong. It goes to show how much out of touch they are. I had a phone call yesterday from one of my constituents who advised me that the price of unleaded petrol at his local suburban, outer Newcastle service station had increased 8c overnight—we are talking about 1.5c; he rang to advise that the price had increased 8c overnight. 
That is the sort of thing that is making consumers of petrol angry. They do not understand why it happens. They know when it happens. They know that it happens a couple of days before pension day and that this government will not act, is completely incapable of acting, to prevent that but come in here, strutting around like peacocks claiming they are passing legislation to save 1½c on a litre of petrol, and expect the Australian community to give them a pat on the back and say, `You are great people.' Consumers are not going to say that.
The other thing that the government are in complete denial about is that, in the small communities outside the cities such as Dungog, Gloucester, Forster and Tuncurry in my electorate—I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you know those areas only too well because they are not far from where you live—the price of petrol has not dropped below the mid-90c range since before Christmas. Those people did not get any benefit from the January price cut that their city cousins got. The other point is this: under the GST system, you are now talking about a tax on distance from the capital cities of Australia. Because their retail price of petrol is consistently 10c or more higher than in the cities, that 10c represents an extra 1c in GST, an extra 1c in tax that this government are taking and pocketing. They are doing nothing about reducing the tax burden on those people. As I say to people in my electorate, not only do we pay more for our petrol but we travel greater distances, we travel over the worst roads and the government do nothing but accept it. 
On this side, we remember many of the questions that were asked of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer in pre-GST days about how this government would treat the price of petrol post-GST. Almost invariably they would go out of their way to confuse their answers by including diesel. We did not want to know about diesel; we wanted to know what they were going to do about petrol. But always we would get the answer, `We are going to give you 24c a litre rebate on diesel.' The point is that again we have a government in denial, because the majority of people who live outside the cities do not drive diesel vehicles but drive petrol vehicles. Many of the diesel vehicles outside the cities are not eligible for the 24c a litre rebate anyway. Once again, we were always given the red herring of the price of diesel, which does not relate to most consumers.
The anger in the electorate that I represent is not about the 1.5c per litre; it is about the high level of tax, the consistently high price that they have to pay above the retail price that their city cousins have to pay and the distances that they have to travel. What are we talking about? We are talking of a saving of about 90c on a full tank of petrol for the standard six-cylinder car. We are talking about a saving of about 90c on a full tank of petrol that, in the outer parts of my electorate, costs in the order of $50. The best this government can say is, `We will save you 90c per filling.' If the government want to stand on that record and say that they are doing great things, so be it, but I am quite prepared to stand on this side and say that people are angry and not satisfied with it. 
Let us go on to another fuel: LPG. I am a great supporter of LPG. We had a wonderful industry here using Australian technology, with Australian designers converting vehicles so that they could be dual fuel. Remember that before 1 July last year there was no tax on LPG. There is still no excise on LPG, but there is a GST. People resent the fact that they paid in the order of $2,000 to have their vehicle converted to a dual fuel vehicle, or that they went out of their way and bought a specific LPG vehicle, only to find that on 1 July they were suddenly hit with a 10 per cent GST on a previously untaxed fuel. This legislation does nothing to assist them either.
But it is worse than that, because this government has killed a great Australian growth industry, and that is the conversion of vehicles. Go and talk to some of the proprietors of taxi fleets that specifically use LPG vehicles. Talk to the people who own the Falcon that was produced to only use LPG. I think they paid in the order of an extra $800 to have that. It is not a dual fuel vehicle; it is LPG only. It is a great vehicle, a great piece of technology. This government has penalised innovation by taxing a fuel that was previously untaxed, and this legislation ignores it.
—Let us take a different view on petrol pricing and the reason it is so high. The Prime Minister tells us that the international price of crude oil is the principal factor, and there is no doubt that that is a major factor. But perhaps the member opposite cannot remember 10 years ago when the Gulf War was on, and I think it is just about exactly 10 years ago. In 1991, when the Gulf War was on, the price of crude oil internationally approached almost $US50. The price of unleaded petrol in Sydney at the time, at its highest point, reached 81c per litre, with the price of crude oil at almost $US50. We sit down and we wonder why this is so with a government that is so good at economic management. There is one reason why—and members opposite know it—and that is the Australian dollar at that time was worth almost US80c. Today, worth less than US50c, $A1 does not buy nearly as much crude oil.
The great economic managers of Australia who will tell us this is great for farm exporters are quite prepared for all Australians to share the load and pay the high price because of this government's mismanagement. And this government has the audacity and hypocrisy to come in here and lecture the opposition on our inability to manage an economy—this government that has driven the Australian dollar down by 35 per cent. The Prime Minister yesterday took great delight in coming in here at question time and telling the Leader of the Opposition that he should be ashamed of himself for talking the economy down. Was this the same Prime Minister that introduced the debt truck to Australia, the same Prime Minister that took great delight in taking around that tabletop lorry with the automatically turning wheels to tell us how much the debt was increasing? I can tell you how much the debt has increased by in the last five years: it has gone from $186 billion to over $310 billion, and with an Australian dollar worth two-thirds of what it was worth then.
—That is a disgrace.
—That is right. It is a disgrace because it makes it so much easier for any foreign country to acquire Australian business and force our dollar and our ownership down even further. It makes it good for exporters—if only they could afford the petrol to get their goods to market. So much for the international price of crude oil. There are many domestic factors that the government is in denial about and for which it will not accept responsibility. I would suggest to the Prime Minister and his Treasurer that if they want to know why the price of unleaded petrol today is over 90c—whereas 10 years ago, during the Gulf War, it only got to 81c—they need look no further than their own domestic management and their inability to manage the price of the Australian dollar. What they have done is an absolute disgrace and future generations of Australians will be paying for it for a long time. 
Let me move on to beer. I come from an area where many people are quite partial to the odd beer. I come from an area where coalminers, at the end of a day, like a couple of beers to wash down the coal dust. Admittedly, there are 2,500 fewer coalminers now than there were in 1996 when this government came to power. The iron and steel workers that used to work at BHP—3,500 lost their jobs when this government sat on its hands and allowed BHP to close its Newcastle steelworks—also liked to have a beer at the end of a shift, but they do not have any shifts now. I guess if they have a beer it is to commiserate and ask, `What went wrong? Why did we lose our jobs? What did this government do that meant that we could no longer have an iron and steel works in Newcastle?'
The worst part about it is that people will be paying more for beer. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is at the table, would know the wonderful bit of arithmetic that was carried out immediately prior to 1 July. We were told that the GST would be the only tax. We got rubbished on this side of the House about the wholesale sales tax. We were asked, `Do we want to go back and join with Botswana, Zambia and those countries that have a wholesale sales tax?' Let us see what the government did. It took the wholesale sales tax off beer and increased the excise, so the amount was the same as the two amounts had added up to previously. But what does that mean when you get a CPI adjustment? It means that, instead of a wholesale sales tax staying at the same level and untaxed, you are now putting a CPI on the whole of the tax component. The price of beer went up because the government was putting a CPI on the whole tax and then adding a GST.
I remember going into Beresfield Bowling Club on the first Friday night after the GST came in. I remember it because Friday night is meat raffle night and the workers, particularly the pensioners, love to get down there, buy their 10 bucks worth of raffle tickets and maybe take home a tray of meat. They have a few beers with their mates and sit around later on and watch the football if it comes on television. I remember that quite well because as I walked in the door one fella said, `I don't often pick a quinella, but I got one tonight.' I said, `What did you get, mate?' He said, `Well, 10 bucks worth of meat raffle tickets cost me $11 because there is a GST on them and the price of a schooner has gone up. That's a pretty good quinella, isn't it?' I said, `John Howard's a winner all the way.' That is the sort of thing that this government is prepared to pass on to the battlers of Australia—an increase in the price of beer and an increase in the cost of raffle tickets, the proceeds of which are going to the local community for charitable works—and then it has the gall to come in here and suggest that all of Australia should pat it on the back because it is going to cut the excise on petrol by 1.5c a litre. All of these things leave a very nasty taste in the mouth of Australian consumers. They will not forget; they have long memories. The Prime Minister said, `I'm out there listening.' He may be listening, but he is certainly not hearing the sort of information that governments need to hear: how much people are hurting.
I feel quite free to mention dairy because it has been spoken about by a couple of members of the government. It was interesting when the minister came and responded to my question yesterday. The dairy industry regional assistance program package is—and has been identified by the government as—a $1.8 billion package. But what has not been told to the dairy farmers of Australia is that we now know that the biggest recipient of funding from that package is the federal government— 
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are actually speaking on a different bill; we are not even talking about the dairy industry.
—What is her point of order?
—I would ask that the member speak to the bill.
 (Mr Nehl)—I acknowledge that the member for Paterson has strayed at a trifle, but he did indicate that it had been a wide ranging debate. In his remaining time, I am prepared to tolerate that sort of extension beyond the bill. 
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You always know when you are hurting them, because they want to shut you up. That is a guaranteed point—
—And we will have the trite platitudes trotted out in a minute. The point is this: the dairy farmers are being dudded to the tune of $600 million by this government that claims it cares; $600 million that should be going to the dairy farmers, should be going to those dairy communities. In the electorate I represent I have dairying communities, such as Gloucester, that have not received one dollar from this government nine months after deregulation. Get out there and listen and hear the message that the people of Australia are sending to you—then you may be able to do something about it. Until you do, you certainly will not achieve any of your goals.",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I am pleased to have further opportunity to speak on petrol excise reduction, particularly in relation to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001, an issue which the coalition government, led by John Howard, has recently addressed, as my honourable colleagues in this House would no doubt be aware—as are motoring Australians across the nation.
The bills contain the reduction in petrol and diesel excise of around 6.7c per litre which came into effect on 1 July 2000. I would like to say here that the government has fully met its commitment that petrol pump prices need not rise with the introduction of the GST. In addition to the 6.7c per litre excise cut, the petroleum industry will benefit from substantial cost reductions, estimated at approximately 1.5c per litre, as a result of the tax changes. In total, motorists received compensation of around 8.2c per litre. 
With regard to whether the petroleum industry is passing on cost savings to consumers, the ACCC found in its fuel prices monitoring report for the September 2000 quarter that:
The Commission's analysis suggests that actual fuel prices have not increased as much as expected on the basis of movements in underlying factors including historical wholesale and retail margins. This is not inconsistent with the suggestion that cost savings from the NTS changes have been passed on.
In contrast—and I am pleased that the member for Paterson is still in the House—the ALP increased excise on petrol and diesel from 6.155c per litre in 1983 to 34.183c in March 1996, an increase of over 28c per litre. Although the member for Paterson has now left the House, I would just like to say for the benefit of those opposite that, of this 28c excise increase, 10c resulted from Labor's budget increases, which occurred without the provision of any compensation to motorists. So he can talk about the Gulf War and about rising petrol process in those days; but, again, of that 28c excise increase, 10c resulted from Labor's budget increases, which occurred without provision of any compensation to motorists. Five cents of these budget rises came through the 1993 budget, after Labor went to the election promising not to increase taxes. Well, that is history.
—We know what happened, as the Minister for Small Business rightly points out. And let us not forget Keating's promise, which was law—in fact, he had the legislation printed. He stood at the dispatch box. I note the member for Jagajaga smile—she would remember that. He stood there, waved his legislation that he had printed—law, l-a-w. But, the moment that the Labor Party were re-elected, the promised l-a-w tax cuts in 1993 disappeared into thin air. 
I have had great pleasure recently in distributing details of the Prime Minister's petrol package to my electorate in Makin, which I will outline for the House. Labor's—I would like to mention `Labor's' a few times—half-yearly indexation of petrol excise was abolished. The coalition government's response to the voice of the Australian people was our effort to keep tax on petrol and petrol prices down. Petrol excise has been reduced by the coalition government by 1.5c per litre. Again, we have the member for Paterson saying, `This is outrageous and it is not going to help,' but we had the Labor Party for weeks and months pulling stunts in this House to have the excise reduced by 1.5c per litre. How hypocritical is that? This reduction in petrol excise is a response to the voice of the community and is an effort to help reduce the cost of petrol. The ACCC price watchdog's powers have been extended. Again, the member for Paterson was complaining. Yes, we all know that when pension day or payday comes along, the prices at the pump go up. The coalition government has been listening to the community. We have extended the powers of the ACCC not only to monitor petrol prices, but also to include the differences between city and county and also to examine whether a cap can be placed on price fluctuations.
There has been an announcement that an inquiry will be held into the issue of fuel taxation in Australia and it is welcomed with open arms, not just by me and my colleagues, I am sure, but by all motoring Australians. I do not grow weary of telling my constituents that the petrol excise `issue' is a hard-won battle, but the coalition government's vigilance in responding to community concerns should be recorded here in this place. By announcing these measures and taking these actions, the coalition government, unlike its predecessor, has and will continue to recognise the need for the petrol excise issue to be addressed.
I would like to restate my delight about the Prime Minister's decision regarding petrol excise relief. This demonstrates that both the Prime Minister and the government are willing to listen to strong community concerns with regard to issues which affect our community. Instead of focusing on the Labor Party's abysmal record on the petrol issue, I am going to outline the real benefits to the Australian community. This will benefit, for example, those mums and dads who ferry their children to and from school and to sporting venues—many of us who are parents know what a time consuming and expensive exercise that can be; small businesses which bear the travel expenses associated with their sales representatives travelling to visit prospective and existing clients in motor vehicles; farmers whose livelihood depends on the running of machinery or equipment and transport related operations; and everyday constituents like pensioners who need to travel within their community to the local shopping centre for food and groceries.
The recent announcements by the coalition government are good news for the public. It is anticipated that Australians will be saving approximately $600 million per year in fuel taxes in the first year. This saving will increase in time as no longer will the CPI increases build up. 
The Labor Party's record in addressing this issue is extremely poor and pathetic. As I said earlier in my speech, when Labor came to office in 1983 petrol excise was roughly 6c per litre. When the Australian people told the then government what it was feeling and how it was hurting, this was ignored by the Hawke-Keating regime. Excise went to over 34c per litre, an increase of over 450 per cent. This is a legacy which has been addressed by this coalition government. The fuel price indexation introduced in 1983 by the Labor government has been quashed. I have said this before but I think it is worth repeating: we should bear in mind that on no less than five different occasions the Labor Party legislated to increase the petrol excise over and above the inflation adjustments during its term. I will be very interested to hear how the member for Lowe will talk about that point when he gets up to make his speech. I would really like to hear the rationale for how on five different occasions the Labor Party legislated to increase the petrol excise over and above the inflation adjustment during its term. I will be really interested to hear what the member for Lowe has to say about that. 
—You will.
—Thank you. I restate the point that, as part of the government's recent announcement of measures to address the petrol excise issue, John Howard and his coalition colleagues are listening to the electorate. The ACCC price watchdog's extension of powers will include an ability to monitor not just petrol prices within the city areas but also the differences between rural, regional and city locales. The ACCC will also be holding an inquiry which will consider and review the issue of fuel taxation within Australia. Thus, on the basis of revenue neutrality, the whole petrol tax regime will be reviewed. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I am very happy to respond to the invitation by the member for Makin in relation to her interest in what I am about to say. I remember the very first week we were back here, when the government was haemorrhaging with regard to the anger that was being experienced throughout Australia at the price of petrol. My leader, the Hon. Kim Beazley, attempted to introduce his petrol tax cut bill, which was dismissed a moment ago by the member for Makin as one of the stunts which occurs on this side of the House. I have a clear recollection of Mr Beazley inviting the member for Makin to come and join us on this side of the House, along with the members for McEwen and Riverina and a number of members of the government, to support our private member's bill to do something to give relief to the people of Australia from the heavy impost of the price of petrol which has occurred in recent times, in no small measure due to the impact of this disgraceful GST. What did the member for Makin do? The member for Makin stayed in her seat. She had no intention of coming over to this side of the House. 
Whilst I have a degree of warmth and affection for the member for Makin, I must say that on this particular issue and in terms of the message that she was conveying to her constituents in Makin it was a monumental triumph for double standards and hypocrisy. If it were not for the Labor Party making an issue of this in this parliament, we would not have had the Prime Minister do another monumental backflip and hand back half a billion dollars to the long-suffering motorists of Australia. So, whilst I will give the member for Makin some credit in obviously making some vigorous representations, no doubt in the party room—
—And in the media.
—Yes, in the media.
—I am sure too the member for Fisher, who is interjecting at the table. I just want to put the member for Makin on notice that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot go back to your electorate and give one message to your constituents there but come into the parliament and absolutely desert your constituents. I thought that you would know better, because you are in a marginal seat like I am, and the last thing you can do is give mixed messages to your constituents and expect them to support you. It is quite obvious that we are going to have an election at the end of the year—
—But the government listened to her.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, at the table, is provoking me and interjecting, but I am happy to respond. Although he is a decent chap, I came in here to see what the member for Makin had to say, because I was very interested, when the debate took place on the first day we returned and the Leader of the Opposition held up in this House his petrol tax cut bill, that the member for Makin did not want to know anything about it. She, along with other members of the government, was shamed. But, to her credit, the representations that she and others made in the party room obviously had a big impact on the Prime Minister, because ultimately— 
—She is very effective.
—I hope she is effective. But the point I am making, for the honourable parliamentary secretary at the table, who persists in interjecting, is that she cannot come into this House and stand up for her constituents and then go back to her electorate working the local radio stations and her local press and giving them a false expectation. They will be reminded of that—
—The parliamentary secretary insists on interjecting. Madam Deputy Speaker, he can have his go when I am finished, because I have got the right to speak here for 20 minutes and I am not having much success. Whilst he comes from a lovely part of Queensland—
 (Mrs Gash)—If I recall, I also had to admonish you. Order!
—and I am pleased to say he has a nice electorate, he should have the decency to let me say what I am going to say. I was provoked before I even got to my feet by the member for Makin simply for sitting in this chamber. I notice that the member for Hinkler has joined us, and I will probably stick around to hear what he has to say. The point I am making—for the benefit of the member for Hinkler, who is probably just coming to the table, and I was with him a short while ago at a Standing Committee for Communications, Transport and Arts meeting—was that the member for Makin was sending one message to her electorate but coming in here hypocritically and not supporting the Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill on this issue.
To the extent that the government have handed back $½ billion for the long-suffering motorists of Australia I will give the government credit, as I will give them credit for, also in the context of roll-back, doubling the first home owners grant. Also, I am pleased to hear reports in the media—a further extension of roll-back—that the long-suffering taxpayers in the $30,000 to $50,000 income category can expect personal income tax relief when the budget is handed down in May.
I am very happy to respond to the member for Makin's interjections earlier in the debate, because the people that I represent—indeed, the people in Australia at large—are certainly haemorrhaging as a result of the price of petrol and beer, and they are very concerned about the litany of broken promises of the Howard government. In fact, I was in here last night speaking on this flyer, which does not have any direct relevance to this bill, about the broken promises on aircraft noise in my electorate. It is yet another example of the dishonesty of the government in relation to what we have to say on this issue of aircraft noise and what they were trying to say about the Labor Party policy prior to the 1996 election. I demonstrated last night the hypocrisy of the government on that issue. But I am not here to talk about that. I will talk about that later this morning when we debate the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001.
—Are you paid by the word?
—I am not paid by the word. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would ask you to ask the parliamentary secretary sitting at the table to refrain from interjecting, because I am trying to put my case and the arguments that we on this side of the House represent because, quite frankly, in terms of the taxation that has been visited on the people of Australia, my electorate is struggling at the moment. Can I say to the member for Fisher that the small business proprietors are being strangled, the low income workers are being strangled, the self-funded retirees are being strangled and the pensioners are being strangled as a result of the GST. Anyone who tries to convince me that a flat 10 per cent GST is fair must have rocks in their head. 
To pick up on what the member for Paterson said—he made a very erudite speech prior to the member for Makin—I endorse fully what he was saying because he was talking about the anger of his electorate, the people that he represents, over petrol and beer prices. He made a very salient point about the debt truck that the Howard opposition sent around Australia prior to their getting into government and how the level of debt had increased. In fact, the debt truck's wheels have obviously come off and, quite plainly, the government stand condemned over the level of debt. Anyhow, given all the bad press and all the bad television and media coverage, particularly on talkback radio, I am pleased that the government is doing something to give relief to the people of Australia.
In relation to the amendments that are before the House today which will be moved by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Simon Crean, while I support these amendments and in the main support the bill, I want to make some comments about the pain that my constituents in Lowe and Australians generally have needlessly felt as a result of the new taxation system. Before I go into some detail about that, I want to refer to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said yesterday. He made a very good point that `GST did not get rid of hidden taxes; it made them worse'. The purpose of the bills that we are debating in this House today is to amend the Customs Tariff Act and the Excise Tariff Act to implement the taxation arrangements for alcoholic beverages from 1 July 2000, the reduction in excise for petroleum products from 1 July 2000, the reduction in excise of 1.5c per litre for specified petroleum products from 2 March 2000—in line with the Prime Minister's announcements last parliamentary sitting—and, finally, adjustments to the cost recovery level of excise on aviation kerosene, and corrections of minor anomalies in the product stewardship oil provisions which were to have taken effect from 13 May 2000.
I would like to deal with each of these amendments in turn. Firstly, in relation to the excise on alcoholic beverages, under the previous tax system wholesale sales tax was applicable to beer at a higher rate. Under the new tax system, major changes were made to excise levels by the government to stop the retail price of beer falling. These excise increases equate to around 90 per cent. Despite the Prime Minister's promises and assurances that the price of an ordinary draught beer would not rise by more than 1.9 per cent, what ordinary Australians saw when they went to the pub to relax and sink a cold middy was a major rise in the cost of beer. As a result of the excise rises on 1 July last year, brewers have reported a four per cent decline in sales and most hoteliers have also felt the pinch.
Clearly, the Prime Minister should have kept his promise to beer drinkers, brewers of draught beer and hoteliers that prices would not rise more than 1.9 per cent as a result of the GST. I call on the government to honour its original election promise. Prime Minister, the message from my constituents in Lowe who all like to have a middy or two is that it is never too late for you to do a backflip in this policy area and finally keep your promises on beer excise. I note that, according to page 1 of today's Daily Telegraph, the price of draught beer is now approximately 10 per cent higher than pre-July 2000 levels. This is a disgrace, particularly as it is the ordinary working person's drink.
Under these bills there will be a new three-tiered level of taxation on beer based on strength. Basically, low alcohol beer is beer whose alcoholic strength is less than 1.15 per cent, mid-strength beer has between 1.15 and 3.5 per cent alcohol content and full-strength beer has more than 3.5 per cent alcohol content. I would like to support the proposed amendments providing for a new rate of other alcoholic beverages of an alcoholic strength under 10 per cent which will bring designer drinks, alcoholic sodas, coolers and other such beverages into the excise regime. I also wish to take a moment to list the points in the regime as described in the Bills Digest for Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001: 
In respect to spirits and other excisable beverages of an alcoholic strength by volume of more than 10 per cent, the rates of applicable excise duty are:
Brandy—$48.70 per litre of alcohol;
Fruit Brandy/Whisky/Rum/Liqueurs—$51.58 per litre of alcohol;
Spirit for fortifying Australian wine or Australian grapes (subject to regulations)—free;
Methylated spirits (subject to regulations)—free;
Spirit for scientific or educational purposes (subject to regulations as prescribed in by-law)—free; and
Spirit for use in public hospitals (subject to regulations)—free.
I turn to the area of fuel tax reductions announced by the Prime Minister on 1 March 2001, a declaration made in light of the disastrous result for the Liberal and National parties in the Queensland and Western Australian elections in a blatant pork-barrel attempt to win back the voters of Ryan—ha, ha! It was an attempt that failed, because Australians are cynical of the government and their broken promises. As I said in this House on Monday, the Prime Minister and the government are in denial about the real impact of the GST on ordinary Australians. The 9.7 per cent swing in the Ryan by-election came on top of a 7.4 per cent swing in 1998, and that was only 2½ years earlier. More than 17 per cent of the people of Ryan have changed sides. That in no small measure is due to the GST.
That aside, I support the measures I will shortly discuss in greater detail, because it is about time that the self-funded retirees, the pensioners and the families in suburbs such as Homebush, Five Dock and Ashfield in my electorate of Lowe had some of the budget surplus brought about by the new tax system passed onto them and into their pockets instead of having to pay through the nose for petrol and other necessities whose prices were affected as a result of the GST, including ladies' sanitary products, breast pumps, sunscreens and bandaids. More than 12 months ago, I made a speech in this House dedicated to the impact of the GST on ladies hygiene products. On behalf of women, can I say that we will be rolling back the GST because we believe this is a necessity of life—not, as the government has seen fit to do, making those items subject to the GST. That is disgraceful.
Let me return to the subject at hand and elaborate in further detail on the rate of excise. On unleaded petrol, diesel and other petroleum products that attract the equivalent rate of duty, there will be a reduction of 1.5c per litre. The rate of duty will now be equivalent to 0.38143c per litre. The other aspect of the amendments to fuel excise under these bills is legislating the 6.7c per litre reduction in fuel excise which has operated since the commencement of the GST. While I welcome these measures with open arms, I would like to make the observation that the Prime Minister should have been more honest with Australians in the first place. Why did it take him so long to do the decent thing and reduce the excise? Prior to the 1 March announcement, the Prime Minister was walking around saying to all and sundry `It can't be done' or giving the paltry excuse that the fluctuations were all due to world oil prices, not to the GST or excise rises. That is codswallop. The Prime Minister knows that the rising petrol prices are due to double taxation. For example, how can LPG rises be linked to the price of crude oil when clearly LPG has no relation to oil at all?
It can be done as Labor recommended in its own petrol price inquiry. Labor's inquiry was widely consultative-with hearings conducted in 35 locations across Australia and with evidence presented from more than 180 witnesses and written submissions. I would like to quote from page 1 of the summary and recommendations from the inquiry: 
... the Prime Minister has broken his promise that the GST would not increase fuel taxation for motorists. This undertaking has been broken on all major categories of fuel: petrol (both leaded and unleaded), diesel and LPG.
The Prime Minister found this out only when he looked at the problem more carefully. Why? Because he thought he was going to face a backbench revolt and voter backlash in Ryan—and he did. It may have quelled those backbenchers such as the members for Makin, Riverina and McEwen, whom I referred to earlier, who were trying to hold their own government to ransom, but the voters saw right through that. Labor was ahead on this issue, speaking out at every opportunity, calling for the relief of battling motorists; the government refused to act until they realised the stakes were too high. The government take a lot of pride in the fact that they handed back that half billion dollars to the motorists, but that would not have occurred but for the Labor Party campaigning very hard on this issue over the Christmas-New Year period.  
My colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Simon Crean, said in his speech yesterday, and it bears repeating:
The member for McEwen and other members on the government's backbench have a choice: they can vote for the petrol one, now that they have backflipped on it, but they can also vote for honesty on beer. They can do it through this mechanism that we are proposing. But do not perpetrate another deceit in this parliament by saying that we will be opposing the bill. The only people being deceitful are government members, if they continue to talk about our opposing this bill—another example of continuing deceit about the broken promise as now revealed in the leaked document that we have. If they perpetrate it, they will be speaking from a false script.
I would further note that, in relation to the amendments relating to the 6.7c per litre reduction, at present the government is in fact collecting 6.656c per litre—yielding an extra $14 million in a full year to the Commonwealth—plus a 10 per cent GST on top of that. 
The other amendments are to correct minor anomalies and are fully supported by the opposition. One fixes a double taxation anomaly in the product stewardship regime and the other relates to increasing the excise on aviation kerosene by 0.036c per litre for cost recovery relating to airport regulation. This brings the total excise to 2.795c per litre retrospectively from 13 May 2000.
These bills should be voted on separately. While I do support the aspects of the bills in relation to petrol, I cannot speak in favour of a bill which exploits the broken promises given to the people of Australia on excise increases relating to alcoholic beverages, namely, beer, the working person's drink. I have had many letters from concerned beer drinkers in my electorate of Lowe. They are furious that the government is hitting their hip pockets once again. They are fed up with the hypocrisy, the dishonesty and the deceit visited on the people of Australia by the Howard government, and they will reward them on 17 November.",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—The purpose of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 is to change the excise on aviation kerosene, alcoholic beverages and petrol. In my speech today I would like to focus on the changes to the ready to drink category of alcoholic products in the package of cuts to fuel taxes announced by the Prime Minister in early March. As part of the new tax system, the government embarked on alcohol tax reform, much of which was designed to remove some antiquated taxes and historical anomalies that existed between different categories of alcohol products. One area of particular interest to me was the ready to drink market, as this affects a number of Bundaberg rum products. As honourable members know, I come from the city of Bundaberg—proudly so—and Bundaberg rum is an important part of the economy of my district. Bundaberg rum is the largest selling spirit label in Australia, ahead of the Scotch whiskies, gins and other products, and we should not underestimate the ability of Bundaberg rum to earn revenue for the company and its shareholders, for the economy through the work force and the tourists that it attracts, and for the Commonwealth through its excises and other taxes. This one distillery on the banks of the Burnett River in my electorate delivers more than $100 million per annum to the Commonwealth in excise and taxes—a remarkable figure, I am sure you will agree. 
The bill today delivers on policy initiatives that go a long way towards providing a more level playing field for this great Australian icon and for other quality distilled alcohol products. Ready to drink products, such as heavy beer, pre-mixed spirits and designer drinks, like Sub Zero and Two Dogs, are generally of similar size and strength—about five per cent alcohol. Yet prior to the introduction of the new tax system, these products were taxed quite differently. Pre-mixed spirits—such as Bundaberg Rum, and Jim Beam and cola—paid excise of about twice that being charged for beer while designer drinks on a fermented base paid no excise at all, even though the alcoholic strength of these different types of drinks was essentially the same or in some instances even greater.  
Under the government's legislation, all these drinks will be treated equally and fairly. All ready to drink products with 10 per cent or less alcohol by volume are now basically attracting the full-strength beer excise rate. This change has put the three categories on a more equal taxation footing. However, of course, pre-mixed spirits are still about 50 per cent more expensive than beer due to the cost of production. The ready to drink tax changes are obviously strongly supported by and fundamental to the spirit industry, but this change has also had wide support from the health lobby. In a letter to the Treasurer in September 1999 the Australian Medical Association, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia and the National Centre for Research into the Prevention of Drug Abuse said:
Our sector was pleased that at least under ANTS, ready to drink and beer products were taxed according to their alcohol content.
They went on to say:
From a health perspective, premixed spirits are not the major issue compared with cask wine, full strength beer and cheap designer drinks, which target young drinkers.
Just last week the National Drugs Roundtable 2001 voiced their support for introducing a volumetric alcohol beverage tax and reducing excise on low alcohol products.
It should be noted that cheaper pre-mixed drinks are not increasing alcohol consumption. Data collected by the Distilled Spirits Industry of Australia has shown that it is existing drinkers who are choosing pre-mixed spirits, not new drinkers. The increasing popularity of pre-mixed spirits has largely been offset by the decline in other ready to drink categories and bottled spirits, indicating that consumers prefer the convenience of pre-mixed spirits to mixing their own drinks. Pre-mixed spirits contain a consistent—note, consistent—known and measured amount of alcohol, unlike drinks we mix at home. The road safety implications of this are obvious. In addition, Bundaberg Rum, for example, is available now as Bundaberg Gold. It is a lighter drink, with an alcohol rating of 3.5, roughly the equivalent of a mid-strength beer. I think this is a very responsible attitude being taken by that company. It should be noted that, even after the tax changes that have somewhat levelled the playing field for the various ready to drink products, beer still makes up 50 per cent of the total alcohol market; wine, 32 per cent; spirits, 14 per cent; and pre-mixed spirits, five per cent. I warmly welcome the reforms that have put these three categories of ready to drink alcoholic products on this more equal footing.
The second aspect of the bill I would like to discuss is the fuel tax changes announced by the Prime Minister on 1 March. What is generally not understood about regional Australians is that they not only suffer through a lack of or limited access to public transport but they also have to travel long distances for fundamental things like taking their kids to school or to sport, shopping, collecting supplies from town and the like. They may go 60 or 70 kilometres in each direction to the nearest service town. While this may sometimes affect people in the outlying areas of capital cities, it is equally valid for country areas and is amplified the more remote a country area is. The price of petrol, because of distance, lack of volume sales through the pump or the absence of competition in a particular area, is often 9c or 10c a litre higher there than in the cities—in some areas, even higher again. 
Another aspect that is not recognised is the difference in median weekly family incomes between city and country areas. I know the examples I am going to give are at the extreme ends of the spectrum, but consider that the mean weekly income in Bradfield is $1,400, in North Sydney is $1,317, in Canberra is $1,056 and in Ryan is $1,041. Compare that with Cowper, where the average family income is $486; with Wide Bay, where it is $493; with Richmond, where it is $508; and with my own electorate of Hinkler, where it is $606. You can see there is a great disparity. Not only are these people paying more for their fuel; their capacity to pay for fuel and the other essentials of life is limited by the mean average income of those areas. It becomes a double whammy.
The 1.5c reduction and the removal of automatic indexation will therefore be highly relevant to people in country areas. Although the quantum of the individual items—this first drop and the six-monthly drops that might otherwise have occurred—may not seem significant, a combination of these over a period of four years will be quite significant. The removal of indexation and the more rigorous scrutiny by the ACCC could, collectively, have a significant impact on the price of fuel in country areas. I have done a rough calculation and I think the combination of these moves could, over the coming four years, save people somewhere in the vicinity of between 7.5c and 10c a litre on what they might otherwise have been paying.
It has not been an easy call for the government because it has to balance the evident concern of Australians about the price of petrol on one hand and the need to maintain responsible economic management on the other. So the government did not have a lot of room to move. But the 1.5c reduction in excise was important as it showed that the government was willing to share some of the petrol price pain and show a sensitivity for Australians, especially those living in regional and rural areas. The removal of the half-yearly indexation on petrol excise that was introduced by Labor in 1983 is probably the most important part of the package. As I said, this could return 7.5c to 10c per litre to the country motorist over the next four years.
I think a lot of people in the community were angry when petrol went up automatically with inflation. This change will place a strict economic discipline on this government and all future governments, irrespective of their political colour, as we will now have to legislate when we want to increase excise. It is not generally understood that, in the 13 years that Labor was in office, excise rose on average by 5.2 per cent a year. Since this government has been in place, it has risen only 1.4 per cent per year. All Australians would welcome the fact that the government has not only removed the excise indexation process but proposed an inquiry into the total structure of fuel taxation in Australia.
In addition to concerns about fuel taxes, I witness a great deal of frustration by motorists when petrol prices leap all over the place. In some city areas, where oil companies removed the so-called price support, you can have a price war occurring one minute and then a return to normal retail prices the next. In fact, they can fluctuate several times in a day—prices can go up by as much as 10c in the course of a day. I think that infuriates motorists, and I am pleased that the ACCC has been given enhanced powers to monitor fuel prices and examine whether a cap could be put in place to prevent these fluctuations.
I am pleased, too, that the ACCC will have enhanced powers to investigate the differential between city and country prices and the delivery of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. I think this is a commendable scheme which provides a grant of 1c or 2c per litre to retailers of petrol and diesel in rural and remote Australia. This scheme did help reduce the city-country price differential in the first few months of its introduction, but over recent times the independent monitoring group's Informed sources suggests that this is no longer the case and that the city-country price differential is blowing out again. So it will be interesting to see what the ACCC finds in its investigation. 
These latest announcements add to the changes that the coalition has already made with the introduction of the new tax system. These include the excise cut of 6.7c a litre in July last year, the extension of the diesel fuel rebate scheme to include rail and marine transport, and the introduction of the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme. The introduction of this scheme has meant that heavy transport of all vehicles over 4½ tonnes in rural areas will see, in combination with the GST rebate, a fall of 24c per litre in the cost of fuel for business.
While everyone knows that the primary driving force of higher fuel prices has been the international price of crude oil, it is important that the government also does its bit. The government has a tough balancing act. It has to help where it can while ensuring that it manages the economy responsibly. However, the government could go further. I believe there is a case to examine the benefits or otherwise of ethanol. As I come from a cane growing area, you would understand my interest in this, Madam Deputy Speaker. Although I do not, in this particular instance, profess to speak for the government, my personal view is that we should introduce a program—perhaps in the order of $100 million, spread over five, or perhaps seven, mill districts—of delivering subsidies somewhere in the order of $15 million to $20 million to sugar milling companies or other parties who might be interested in undertaking pilot ethanol plants along the northern New South Wales and Queensland coastline. I believe that this could be allocated by way of a competitive tender, and those companies, perhaps one per mill district, could take part. Companies interested in building an ethanol plant could tender for the grant, and the ones who could obviously put up the best case and who were prepared to take the matter of production of ethanol seriously would be rewarded by the government. I know it is radical, but we talked about ethanol on both sides of politics—as the shadow minister at the table would recognise. We need to break that nexus and do something about it and we could do it in a bipartisan way, because what this is all about is the future security of Australia's fuel supply.
Obviously, some companies would bid and others would not, and there might even be outside parties that are not in the sugar industry. There might be distilleries that want to expand their production out of methylated spirits or rum or something else in order to also have a dimension of ethanol. Of course, it would require both the sugar industry to guarantee that volume of sugar liquor being available for conversion to ethanol and the oil companies to progressively—say at 2½ per cent, five per cent, 7½ per cent and 10 per cent—over time, take the ethanol into the fuel. This was tried in Mackay some years ago where a product—which I think was called petranol—was made available to people on a trial basis. It was a mixture of ethanol and petrol and it came from the Sarina distillery.
While I acknowledge that there is also a capacity in the grain industry, I choose the sugar industry as it is a ready source of liquor capable of distillation. Other countries in the world, notably Brazil, have proved that it can become part of a fuel replenishment program. There may be variance on my suggestion, where the government could tender out the process, taking sugar mills, grain processors and existing distilleries into a comprehensive package and then making it an overall tender process. But I think the idea of moving this into mill districts means that the distribution across northern New South Wales and Queensland would be even-handed. Another thing we could look at would be biodiesel. Biodiesel is another emerging technology and it could perhaps become a subset of the program.
What the recent international increases in crude oil prices and the consequential increase in the price of petrol have demonstrated is that Australia has a diminishing production of crude oil. Some people dispute this and say that that is not the case, but some estimates over the next five years show that we will drop from being 80 per cent self-sufficient down to 65 per cent, and that should worry all of us. 
I believe we should also be fostering strategies not only for ethanol and biodiesel but also for the extraction of oil from shale reserves. Suncorp Southern Pacific Petroleum, which is located in my electorate in the Gladstone area, has the capacity in three-staged periods to produce up to 14 per cent of Australia's oil needs. That is extraordinary: 14 per cent from shale oil. In fact, that area west of Gladstone has more oil reserves than three times Bass Strait. The pilot plant is currently in production. There have been a lot of problems with emissions and so on and the company has been very focused in getting this under control. I would like to make a plea today for encouragement of companies like this by way of special subsidies to get the scheme under way, perhaps the resumption of properties that are affected by emissions or the extension of the excise-free honeymoon that could play an important part in making this company viable.
When you look across this whole bill you see some very interesting things. You see that it is not all gloom and doom about beer. In my area, Bundaberg Rum and Cola, Dark and Stormy, which is Bundaberg Rum and Bundaberg Ginger Beer, are very important products. In their mixed form, they have dropped 14.87 per cent under this scheme. No-one has talked about that. Everyone has talked about the pot of beer going up 20c or 30c but no-one has talked about other products which have fallen in price. Premix drinks are a responsible way to go. I commend to the House the need for more work to be done on Australia's security of fuel and for new technologies like ethanol and shale oil to be part of that technology.",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—It is a great opportunity to speak on this legislation today and also to follow the sometimes thoughtful contribution of the honourable member for Hinkler where he certainly has raised some issues for consideration that go beyond what is necessarily contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 that we are debating today but which of course puts on the table some issues which I think both sides of the House genuinely need to look at. With that spirit of bipartisanship having been put on the table, I will depart entirely and come back to the issues that are before us where we are talking about amendments to the Excise Tariff Act.
There are three major amendments proposed in this legislation. The first is to increase the rate of excise duty for kerosene for use in fuel in aircraft, the second is to introduce a three-tiered excise duty structure for beer and the third is to reduce by 1.5c per litre the excise duty for unleaded petrol, leaded petrol, diesel and other petroleum products. It is no secret that the second two of these amendments are the ones that have attracted the greatest degree of controversy and indeed the greatest degree of concentration by people in the broad Australian community. The reason for that focus of attention has been the feeling by the Australian community that they have been dudded by the Howard government—a feeling that there were promises made about both beer and petrol which have not been adhered to by the government. Of course, it all came down to the change that was brought in under the guise of the new tax system or, in its shorthand, the introduction of the GST. Promises were made, commitments were given and words were used that Australians could understand by the Prime Minister and by his ministers as to what the effect of the GST would be on their lives. They were told, for example, they would have a financial compensation package given them in things like increased pensions and also taxation cuts. 
Labor argued at the time of the introduction of the GST, in the lead-up to it and in the 1998 election campaign, that about 80 per cent of the taxation benefits would go to the top 20 per cent of income earners in this country. We also argued that the compensation packages for people on low and fixed incomes—particularly pensioners we are talking about here—or self-funded retirees who had planned their retirements were not adequate enough to meet the ongoing costs to them in their everyday lives of the introduction and subsequent bedding down of the GST.  
I think we have been proven right. What we have already seen is the clawback arrangement that has been put in place for pensioners—the two per cent that they believed was promised to them having been taken from them with the latest round of pension increases. Why is that significant? It is significant because those pensioners who still have the luxury of owning a family car understand that, when the price of petrol fluctuated the way it did and when the government imposed a tax on a tax through the introduction of the GST and also the excise arrangements, they were being ripped off. They recognised that that would cut into their fundamental lifestyles. 
As if it was not bad enough for pensioners and people on fixed incomes, there was the effect that this had on families—particularly younger members of the community with very young families who used to look forward to the opportunities provided to them in the family car to take trips and so on. They saw that those aspects of their daily lives were having, by necessity, to be changed, for the simple reason that, when we started to see petrol prices going up to close to $1 a litre, people had to make choices. They were economic choices based on fundamental problems. Were they going to be able to put the food on the table for the family? Were they going to be able to pay for the kids to be at school? What we saw with the introduction of the GST was the application of a tax on goods and services where it had previously never existed. If we are talking about schools, we are talking about uniforms, books, et cetera. People had to make economic choices about the way they would live. Those economic choices fundamentally went to: how much money do we put into the number of litres of petrol that we were going to have to put in the car so we could get to work, go and have recreation time and so on?
People know that they were cheated. They know that there was an inflation spike. They know that the Labor Party had been talking about this for some time. And they know that there was a private member's bill that had been introduced into this House which could have removed that impost far sooner than is going to be the case. One thing that I think the Prime Minister has got right is that the people of Australia—those ordinary Australians out there—can see what people promise them; they know when those promises are broken, and they know when they have been deceived. In the case of both beer and petrol, which I have talked about in my contribution today, they believe all of those things have happened.
Let us have a look at each of those in a little more detail. Firstly, let us look at the deception that has been perpetrated on beer drinkers. I believe, the Labor Party believes and I think the majority of Australians believe that has happened. If you go to any pub and talk to the beer drinkers there, what do they reckon about the prices that are being charged? They know that the excise regime is being changed, and they know—because there has been a campaign waged where several hundreds of thousands of signatures have now been collected by the hoteliers, the brewers and so on—that there is something afoot. They know that they are being ripped off. If you go to the Balgownie hotel just up the road from my place and talk to the drinkers in there, you will find that they know. They have signed the petition. Because of what they believed from this government about the introduction of the GST, they thought they were going to be okay. That has all changed. The Prime Minister had given a rock solid guarantee, a promise. It was a bit like the never, ever promise on the GST, as it has turned out to be, but he had given a promise that the price of beer would not go up by more than 1.9 per cent. It is quite significant that a promise was given that, with the introduction of the GST and the changed excise arrangements, the price of beer would not go up by more than 1.9 per cent. If we are talking about this choice—this economic choice that ordinary Australians make, whether they put money towards petrol in the car or have money to go and have a quiet couple of beers at the pub—you can imagine how they feel now, when more than 10 per cent is going to be added to the prices, is being ripped out by these changes that the government has now introduced. There was a promise of 1.9 per cent but there was a 10 per cent hike.  
The fact is, as we have said, that the Prime Minister should have been much more honest and up front with the people of Australia when he was talking about this issue. He should have said, `Okay, look, what is happening is that, because of the taxation changes that were introduced, we are going to put a 10 per cent increase on, we are going to keep that money ourselves, we will put it into consolidated revenue, and at some future time and in some different direction you might get some benefit from it going into schools, hospitals, roads, defence of the nation—whatever it might be. But he did not say that. What was said was that the price of beer would go up by no more than 1.9 per cent. And that is not true. Some 850,000 people who have signed petitions about this in all our electorates know it is not true. The brewers know it is not true. They know they have been collecting tax on behalf of this government—like most businesses in this country do these days, because they are GST revenue collectors. They have been telling people what the true circumstances are. 
It is interesting to also look at just how much this is worth. It is worth roughly $200 million. I can say that, sure, in the broad scheme of things it sounds like it is a lot of money, and it is. But $200 million worth of pain that this government is going to sustain because the beer drinkers of Australia have been ripped off is going to be a very small price for this government to pay, because I think it is going to suffer mightily as a result of it.
The other issue goes to the question of fuel prices and the reduction in fuel excise. I have to say that, from time to time in the politics of Australia, you hear people say about particular issues, `I am listening to what Australians have to say.' What we have seen from this Prime Minister is almost a caricature of a Prime Minister walking around with one hand cocked over the ear and saying, `I am listening to what you say.' All last year, what leaked out of the party room of the government? Nothing but complaint after complaint by members of the coalition about the effect that increased fuel prices was having on their electoral prospects. What did the Prime Minister and the Treasurer do, as they collectively, arm in arm, walked around Australia—although I do not think the Treasurer knows where regional Australia is? They put the hand to the ear and said they were listening. But what did they hear? If they heard what their own coalition backbenchers were saying, if they were able to read the reports that were coming out of all sorts of areas about the detrimental effect that increased prices of fuel were having on the lives of ordinary Australians, they would have done something about this a lot earlier. But they did not. They did not. 
What brought about this backflip of Greg Luganis proportions? Could it have been lack of success in elections? That may have had something to do with it. I think it is fair to say that there were a couple of wake-up calls there on the way. I think the Prime Minister started to get the message when suddenly we saw that Liberal and coalition governments in the states around Australia started to fall over. I think the message about fuel prices, excise and the GST spike came through finally via a number of his own backbenchers. These were all the things that the shadow Treasurer had been talking about for month after month—issues which the Labor Party had identified in its own petrol inquiry led by Senator Peter Cook. A number of members of the Labor Party travelled around Australia—indeed, went to regional Australia, which we know so much about because we have been there so often—and listened to what the people had to say. 
—What a farce.
—The member for Eden-Monaro says, `What a farce'—what a farce to travel around Australia to regional Australia and to listen to what people say about petrol prices! That is what he thinks of the people of Eden-Monaro. The inquiry took back information to say that petrol prices should be reduced. I find it incredible that anybody in this place would say that it is a farce for an MP—it does not matter which side they belong to—to travel around Australia listening to people, come up with a recommendation that the cost of fuel is too high and should be reduced, and have a private member's bill which was going to address that issue introduced into this parliament by the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Eden-Monaro says this is a farce. I am sure all his constituents in Queanbeyan, in Cooma and down on the coast would love to hear those sorts of comments.  
I come back to the issue of listening. I thought it was quite instructive to look at exactly what the Prime Minister had to say in his press conference when he was announcing this reduction in fuel excise. What he said was:
It is designed to do what governments should always do and that is respond to the strongly held feelings of the Australian community. The Australian community has clearly sent us a message that it is unhappy that we haven't done more—even though they recognise that the main reason petrol prices are high is because of the high price of crude oil. They recognise that but they really think that we could have done a bit more.
Dead right! He got that. But I just cannot understand—and I am sure that there are many people on the government benches in here who cannot understand—why it took so long for him to say that he had heard the message from Australia. Why did it take so long when he heard the message coming loudly and clearly from members of his own backbench who stood up like lions in their electorates and said, `We're going to Canberra to fight against increased petrol prices and we're going to Canberra to fight against what's going on with beer prices'? The member for McEwen, every day in her local newspaper, said, `I'm going to do this.' She gets here—and what happens? The lion turns into a lamb, falls into line behind the party machine over there on the Liberal side and says, `Oh, well, whatever the Treasurer says.' `That's all right, Mr Costello. If you want to put the prices up, that's fine, no worries. Let's blame it on the oil companies or let's blame it on the brewers—let's blame it on anybody but let's not put the blame on ourselves.' That was the attitude.
Of course, part of this is that the Prime Minister was trying to say, `Well, I finally listened and I'm going to take 1.5c a litre off'—which we have been saying for month after month should happen—and he thought, `We'll do something a bit smarter than that. We will also remove the excise indexation.' At first blush, people say, `That's not a bad idea,' and probably, in the fullness of time, people will say, `Yes, at the time, it was politically motivated but it may be a good idea, even though it is going to cost governments revenue now and in the future.' But, at the end of the day, you have to say, `Are they going to lose all that revenue or is there something else behind there or is there some other revenue source that is obviously going to make up for this?' Governments do not throw away $1.5 billion just like that—there has to be something else there, and I am sure there is. You do not have to look too far. You just have to look at the new tax system—the GST system in toto.
I suspect that, when we see the budget come down this year, we are all going to be a little surprised at how much revenue this government has actually made through the GST. And yet it has been going around telling everyone about how fair it is and, `This is not really what is going to happen.' There was not going to be this massive increase in the tax take by government. But of course there is because, as we have seen, there is a tax on a tax here in terms of the items that we are debating today. What we have seen consistently over a long period of time is a government not prepared to listen. It then panics, driven by election results that have gone badly for it, driven by polling that has shown that the people of Australia want a change, driven by media headlines in publications like the Sydney Daily Telegraph that say `It's the petrol—stupid' on the full front page. I would imagine that even the Prime Minister, if he read that, would get the message. Given that he comes from Sydney, I am sure that he reads the workers' paper religiously to see what it says about issues. 
So these campaigns were out there and they were bubbling along. It was not as if they were just behind the scenes—they were up front and in your face. You could not go into a pub without somebody talking to you about the increased excise on beer and the price going up by 10 per cent instead of the 1.9 per cent promised by the Prime Minister. You could not talk to any of your constituents—or any constituent around Australia—about petrol prices without getting that. In my capacity as a shadow minister, as I have travelled around talking to people in different parts of this great country of ours, I would get into taxis and the first thing that the taxi driver wanted to talk to you about was fuel prices. He did not know who you were but, when he found out that you were actually an MP, I have to say that the conversation usually got a little rowdy—nevertheless, he got a point of view across. It became quite clear that ordinary Australians were angry and disappointed. They believed that they had been deceived because there had been promises made.
On this side we often talk about the `never, ever' promise that the Prime Minister made about the GST—`It was off the agenda for all time. I will never, ever introduce a GST—never, ever, ever ever—cross my heart and hope to die.' Then of course he did it. People said, `All right, let's give them the benefit of the doubt. It's there now and we'll see how it all works,' and what are they finding now? What are they finding some eight months after it has come in? That slow burn that we said would happen is turning into a forest fire under them. They are seeing prices go up every day. They are seeing broken promises when it comes to things like petrol and beer—the sorts of issues that we are talking about here.
We are seeing a panicked government now saying, `My God, look at the polls. Look at the election results in Western Australia and Queensland and in the Ryan by-election. What more is there to come?' You have people in this place standing up giving answers saying the next government is going to have to do this, that and the other, as if they have already declared the innings over. Why? Because the mistakes that have been introduced by this government have been of their own making because they have failed to listen. As a consequence, this legislation creates all sorts of difficulties. Labor have indicated that we want to see these two issues separated in the Senate, and we will pursue that. We have also said we will not be supporting the passage of the legislation dealing with the price of beer, for the simple reason that it is yet another broken promise for which we believe this government has to be brought to account. We will be voting against it, and we will be voting against it often. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—The total dishonesty of the Australian Labor Party has just been clearly demonstrated by the member for Cunningham, who attempted to use my interjection, of their so-called inquiries being a farce, in a very dishonest way. That is what they do all the time. They are absolutely dishonest in the way in which they speak to the Australian people.
I rise to support the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001. One of the provisions of this legislation is to give effect to the package of fuel tax cuts announced by the Prime Minister on 1 March, a package that was particularly welcomed by residents of my electorate of Eden-Monaro. In particular, this legislation reduces the rate of excise on unleaded petrol, diesel and other petroleum products that attract the equivalent rate of duty by 1.5c a litre, bringing it down to 0.38143c per litre. It reduces the rate of excise on leaded petrol and other petroleum products that attract the equivalent rate of duty by 1.5c per litre to 0.40516c per litre. It reduces the rate of excise on petroleum products attracting concessional rates of duty by 0.297c per litre down to 0.07557c per litre. It also reduces the rate of excise on avtur by 0.112c per litre to 0.02845c per litre. Finally, it reduces the rate of excise on aviation gasoline by 0.110c per litre down to 0.02808c per litre. I put all those figures in because they are often forgotten. There are many areas of industry particularly using various forms of petroleum and there have been drops in all of those rates. It is just not a drop in the price of fuel that you put in your car; there have been drops right across the board. 
The rates of excise for aviation fuel and those other petroleum products attracting concessional rates of duty have been reduced by an amount per litre that is proportional to that of the 1.5c per litre reduction applying to unleaded petrol and diesel. The cut in the petrol excise effective as of 2 March had some immediate impacts in my electorate. In particular, I noticed as I drove into Queanbeyan on the Friday morning that the price of petrol had fallen from 94.9c per litre on Thursday to 93.2c per litre. This was a 1.7c cut, including the GST component. I found that the residents of Eden-Monaro were particularly diligent in ensuring that the tax cut was generally passed on and I thank them for reporting to me and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission any petrol stations that did not appear to be passing on the cut.
Whilst this cut provided some welcome relief, so too did the Prime Minister's announcement that the government would abolish the Labor Party's 18-year-old policy of automatic indexation of petrol excise. It was under the Labor Party's automatic indexation, introduced in 1983, that petrol excise was raised from 6.2c per litre to an incredible 34.2c per litre—a 500 per cent increase over those 13 years.
When we talk about taxation we normally talk in percentage terms, but when it comes to fuel we do not; we talk in cents per litre. When you talk of income tax you talk about percentage rates of income tax, so why should you not look at the tax on fuel as a percentage? When you do look at the tax on fuel as a percentage, in 1983 federal and state taxes accounted for 27.6 per cent of the then petrol price, but by March 1996 it had increased to 58.6 per cent. Forget what the price is, how much of what you are paying was actually tax? While the Labor Party were in government, they went from having 27.6 per cent of the price of fuel being taxed up to 58.6 per cent—not a bad effort in taxation, one might say. Today, March 2001, the percentage has fallen. If you go out and buy fuel today, the actual percentage that you are paying in tax is 47.23 per cent. The percentage has dropped from 58.6 per cent—as it was when we took over government from the Labor Party—down to 47.23 per cent. This means that the growth in the tax component of the price of petrol has grown at a slower rate than the price of production. The massive increase that has taken place in the price of fuel, quite clearly, is all about the price of oil and nothing to  do with the amount of tax. The amount of tax has increased at a very small rate over the last five years. Unfortunately, the perception out there is otherwise. The so-called inquiry the Labor Party ran around the country supposedly doing was designed to mislead people. It was designed for them to run around and create a perception that all of the increase in the price of fuel was due to taxation. It was not; it was all due to the increase in the price of crude oil, and these figures clearly show that.
Let me just pause here to detail Labor's petrol tax increases from 1983 to 1996 during their time in government. In that period, there were 28 adjustments to the level of excise—a great fundraising scheme for the Labor Party in government at the time. In total, Labor increased the tax on fuel by 28.028c a litre. Labor had automatic petrol excise indexation every six months, and there was a steep increase every six months because while the Labor Party were in government inflation was out of control. Inflation averaged well over five per cent per annum, year after year after year, not just in a one-off spike, like we had last year with the introduction of the new tax system. It happened every year—on average it was over five per cent but often it was up near 10 per cent—for 13 years: 1983, 1984, 1985, et cetera. Because of their legislation to index the excise every six months, it went up quite a lot because inflation was high. The CPI was high, so they had to increase it even more. In addition to their automatic increase, which was quite high because of high inflation, they also arbitrarily increased the tax on fuel on four occasions: immediately after coming to office in 1983, Labor whacked on an extra 2.5c tax; in 1986, an extra 3c tax; in 1993, an extra 3c tax; and again in 1994, an extra 2c tax. This was outside of the automatic indexation. This was a 10½c per litre price increase without providing any compensation to motorists. 
What is more, Labor did this after they promised not to, particularly after the 1993 budget. They went to the 1993 election saying that there would be absolutely no increases in tax. Besides these fuel ones, we all remember the wholesale sales tax increases when 10 per cent went to 12 per cent and 20 per cent went to 22 per cent and 30 per cent went to 32 per cent. Can you find anyone who was given compensation for that? Not on your life. You have heard what the Labor Party have said about compensation and various things in relation to GST. I do not know how they sleep at night given what they did in 1993. After promising no tax increases, they whacked up all the wholesale sale taxes and in addition put 5c a litre on fuel. After that 1993 budget they put on 3c and then another 2c. Kim Beazley, the Minister for Finance at the time, called the 5c excise jump—and it was 7c for leaded petrol—a `small adjustment'. Over the last six months we have argued over 1.5c and whether the excise coming off was equivalent to the GST going on. We are arguing about 1.5c when back in 1993 a 5c increase by them was a `small adjustment'.
It is understandable then that Eden- Monaro residents also welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement on 1 March for an inquiry into the total structure of fuel taxation in Australia, particularly when Australians were subjected to what I have just described between 1983 and 1996. Also, the news that the ACCC was to be given special powers to investigate the delivery of the government's $850 million fuel subsidy scheme, which aims to reduce the cost of fuel in rural and regional areas, was welcomed. The ACCC is also to ensure that the 1.5c per litre cut in excise is passed on to motorists—not to the oil companies. This is consumer protection to ensure that the benefits from the government's decision go straight to consumers. We will fine companies $10 million if they do not pass on to consumers the full benefit of the excise reduction.
This is something that was missing from Kim Beazley's Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001. Have a look through their rare proposal and you will notice this vital consumer protection is missing. The Labor Party are so policy lazy that, when they do come up with a proposal, they do not bother to ensure that the compensation goes to the people who need it most; they just look after their mates in the oil companies. Some Labor people in my electorate complained that I would not support the Beazley bill. Why would I when it was so deficient?
The Prime Minister made the decision to cut the petrol excise and abolish Labor's automatic indexation after listening to the concerns of the Australian people. Petrol prices have risen steeply over the past year as a result of the rises in the world price of crude oil. The price of crude oil has gone from around $US12 a barrel to over $US35 a barrel, and is now just below $US30. As a rule of thumb, a $US1 a barrel increase equates to about a 1c per litre rise at the pump. Many people have asked me why Australia is tied to world oil prices. The answer to that question is twofold: (1) we do not produce enough of our petroleum needs—we import petroleum—and (2) if oil producers in Australia were earning less than overseas producers they would understandably sell their product overseas and/or they would lose incentive to explore for new reserves, thus impacting greatly on the exploration industry. It is pretty simple. The way the Labor Party are going these days with banks, they will probably have something in here soon to regulate oil prices in Australia. Who knows? There is always something to come out of left field. 
These bills also contain the reduction in petrol and diesel excise of around 6.7c per litre, which came into effect on 1 July 2000. The reduction in petrol and diesel excise of around 6.7c to compensate for the introduction of the GST resulted in a loss to the federal government, as excise is paid to the Commonwealth, and a gain to the states and territories, as all GST revenue is paid through to them. That is obviously something the member for Cunningham still does not understand. From what he said a few minutes ago, he still does not understand that the GST does not go to the Commonwealth—it all goes to the states.
With this excise cut, the government fully met its commitment to ensure that petrol pump prices need not rise with the introduction of the GST. I can tell you that in Queanbeyan, for instance, between midnight the day before and first thing on the morning of 1 July the price of fuel did not change. So it is crazy to start comparing prices months, weeks or even days later and say, `Look, it has gone up by this,' or, `It has gone up by that,' because we all know how the price of fuel fluctuates from day to day and often from hour to hour, and even from street to street. I always encourage people to drive around and check out a few service stations, because you will often find a difference.
The abolition of the wholesale sales tax and other indirect taxes resulted in cost reductions to the petroleum industry equivalent to around 1.5c. The 6.7c excise reduction and 1.5c in cost savings delivered a total reduction of 8.2c a litre—an amount equivalent to the GST being applied on 1 July. The March 2001 reduction of 1.5c is in addition to this. As to whether the petroleum industry is passing on cost savings to consumers, the ACCC in its fuel price monitoring report for the September 2000 quarter stated:
The Commission's analysis suggests that actual fuel prices have not increased as much as expected on the basis of movements in underlying factors, including historical wholesale and retail margins. This is not inconsistent with the suggestion that cost savings from the New Tax System have been passed on.
The motorists of Eden-Monaro could get, and actually deserve, a further fuel tax cut courtesy of the New South Wales state government. Prior to 1997, the states had business franchise fees taxing petrol. 
When the High Court in 1997 struck those down, at the request of the states the Commonwealth levied 8.3c per litre on the petrol price, collected for and on behalf of the states and paid back to them. When we implemented the new taxation system, the Commonwealth and the states entered into an agreement by which the Commonwealth would pay to the states full revenue for all the taxes to be abolished—financial institution duty, bank account debits tax and stamp duties on mortgages and marketable securities—and as a term of that would pay to the states the equivalent of the revenue replacements, the equivalent of the business franchise fees, the equivalent of 8.3c per litre. That money has been paid to the states under that agreement from 1 July. 
Since the federal government announced the latest excise cut, I have called on Bob Carr to follow suit. He refuses to do this, even though his fellow Labor Queensland government returns in full to motorists the 8.35c per litre payments. In fact, when confronted about the issue on Sydney radio on 5 March, Bob Carr made the claim that it could not be done, that the premiers were no longer being paid revenue compensation. He claimed that it stopped in the middle of last year. He obviously needs to spend more time with his Treasurer or take a weekend out to check the state's books. Let me detail the figures. The New South Wales state government is paid $707 million in revenue replacements, the equivalent of 8.3c per litre. Out of that $707 million it refunds $47 million to motorists, so it pockets $660 million. It has the capacity to refund to the motorists of New South Wales 7.2c per litre. Bob Carr has been running around calling on the federal government to cut excise, and we have done it; now it is time for him to put his money where his mouth is and give the residents of New South Wales a further break. I can see Mr Carr's greedy reasoning here. He desperately wants to hang on to that $660 million, although what he is doing with it I am not really sure. He is certainly not spending it on schools or hospitals in Eden-Monaro.  
If the state government is not going to refund this tax grab to all New South Wales motorists, it could at least refund it in those areas where there is no public transport infrastructure. Up and down the New South Wales coast, in towns like Narooma, Moruya, Merimbula, Pambula, Eden and Bega, there are no public transport options. There are certainly no trains—only the odd private bus or two. People in these areas must drive. They do not have the choice that people in Sydney do where there are buses and trains regularly and at all hours—I should say subsidised by the taxpayer. None of them run at a profit, so they are all subsidised by New South Wales taxpayers, including my constituents, who do not get any public transport. If Mr Carr really wanted to look after the rural and regional areas of New South Wales, this is one area where he could help. He could refund the 7.2c per litre and make it easier for people to get around.
Whilst Bob Carr and Labor are stalling, the coalition is doing. The $850 million fuel subsidy scheme is helping to bridge the traditional disparity between country and city petrol prices. Under this scheme the government subsidises service stations in rural and regional areas by 1c or 2c per litre, and it has had a marked effect. I have noticed when I drive from Queanbeyan to Parliament House that petrol has been a couple of cents cheaper in Queanbeyan over the past year, and petrol has often been cheaper or as cheap in Queanbeyan as in parts of Sydney. That was never the case before. This is a scheme that Labor has said they are going to do away with. I really do not understand their direction on this at all. They seem to be beholden to who knows whom. Fancy wanting to get rid of that when they were out there arguing that we should cut fuel by 1.5c, which we ultimately did.
Let me in my last minute make a number of things really clear. Firstly, the Labor Party introduced automatic fuel indexation and raised the petrol excise from 6.2c to 34.2c—a 500 per cent increase between 1983 and 1996. The coalition government has abolished fuel indexation. The Labor Party arbitrarily increased the tax on petrol four times. The coalition government has never arbitrarily increased the tax on petrol. The coalition government first decreased the tax on petrol on 1 July 2000 by 6.7c. The coalition again decreased the tax on fuel on 2 March by 1.5c. The coalition has also made petrol cheaper by 1c to 2c in rural and regional Australia due to the $850 fuel subsidy scheme.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I appreciate the contribution to the debate from all of the members who spoke on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001. I would like to clarify two misconceptions about this debate. The first is that this is perceived as an attempt to link the petrol excise reduction with any change in beer excise.
—Call it blackmail. Call it what it is.
—No-one is listening to you, Simon. The first thing the bill covers is aviation kerosene. This was announced in the 2000-01 budget and took effect from 13 May 2000, so that is nearly a year ago. The second initiative is in relation to alcoholic beverages, where Labor's 37 per cent wholesale sales tax is being replaced with the changes to the excise and the GST. The third area is in relation to petroleum products, which is the ANTS commitment and reduces the excise on unleaded petrol, leaded petrol and diesel by around 6.7c per litre.
The fourth area is product stewardship in relation to oil. This is a technical measure which increases from two to five the number of decimal places in the excise rates for products dutiable under the product stewardship oil arrangements. The fifth initiative is in relation to the fuel tax reduction. This measure gives effect to the Prime Minister's announcement on 1 March of this year that the rate of excise on unleaded petrol, leaded petrol and diesel would be reduced by a further 1.5c per litre from 2 March 2001, and the duty on aviation fuels and other fuels attracting concessional rates of duty are reduced by proportional amounts. 
The first furphy put forward by the member for Hotham is addressed there. This is not just about two particular issues in relation to excise. It actually covers a number of excise initiatives. The second furphy—and this is one that the member for Hotham has traded on for an extensive period—is that it applies to all beer sold. That is plainly wrong. What the member for Hotham has been claiming publicly is that most beer being sold in Australia is draught beer—over-the-counter beer. That is wrong. Most beer sold in Australia is bottled beer and packaged beer. In an amendment under the ANTS package that went up by 1.9 per cent. The reason draught beer went up more was because of the service component associated with draught beer. Obviously, when you are in a pub there is a service component associated with the person standing behind the bar. There is a service component associated with people cleaning the tables. There is a service component associated with going into a pub and sitting at a table, or into a registered club—whatever the case may be.
I know it is very difficult for the member for Hotham to get his mind around something so hard to understand, which is the fact that there is a service component associated with draught beer, but only 25 per cent of beer sales in Australia are draught beer. In that instance it is quite obvious that the majority of beer sold in Australia does not have a service component. Therefore, the allegations being made by the Labor Party about beer are incorrect.
A third key factor, which has been lost in the debate, involves the way people are meant to pay for these excise changes. They are able to pay for them because of the fact that we reduced income tax. Eighty per cent of Australians are paying no more than 30 cents in the dollar in income tax, so they have more than enough money left over in order to compensate for these increases.
The Labor Party are engaging in a debate full of rhetoric with very few facts coming from their side of the table. It is disappointing that the Labor Party are seeking to deceive the Australian people with their factless rhetoric about beer and petrol. The government will be supporting the bills, obviously. We have not seen the additional proposed amendments from the member for Hotham so I cannot express an opinion on those amendments at this stage. If the member for Hotham really wanted to have an informed debate about this, perhaps he would have given us a copy of the proposed amendments. Unfortunately, the member for Hotham is all about gas and not much action.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I rise this afternoon to speak in detail of the Labor Party's position with respect to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001. The bill relates to the operation of traffic arrangements at Sydney airport. In speaking to the bill, I also propose to address the issues underlying the bill which go to the government's direction as to the future operation of Sydney airport and specifically the difficult questions going to the slot management system at Kingsford Smith. In many ways the bill before us is of a technical nature. It clears the way for substantive changes which relate to the slot management system with specific reference to the operation of Kingsford Smith. It is those changes which will impact on the operation of airlines and the operation of Kingsford Smith airport, Australia's major gateway. 
I might also say—I think it is about time we were honest in this debate—that Kingsford Smith will remain Australia's major aviation gateway for many, many years to come. In that context, I suggest to the House that the bill amends the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 to make part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 subject to its provisions. The bill also seeks to amend the act to specify that the Sydney airport slot management scheme may deal with the specific allocation of slots for specified categories of aircraft movements. The purpose of the bill is to underpin the government's December 2000 announcement, not only with respect to the operation of Kingsford Smith but also with respect to its view about the future operation of Bankstown airport.
In particular, the bill follows a further announcement of the government in January of this year when, under pressure from regional areas of New South Wales, it announced its intention to amend the slot management scheme to address concerns about its announcement of December on the operation of airports in and around Sydney, with specific reference to how it would impact on guaranteed regional access to Kingsford Smith airport.	The actual slot management system and any changes to it are disallowable instruments under section 40 of the act. The detail of the actual changes to the slot management system have now been laid out in a discussion paper which the minister released as late as yesterday afternoon, 27 March. 
In some ways this afternoon we are debating what is, I suppose, a technical bill. The problem for those who actually had to consider the bill was that it was actually rather difficult to consider the potential impact of the bill through a proper examination of the discussion paper because it was only made available to interested parties yesterday afternoon. When it comes to the question of the responsibility of the government both to the general community and to the House of Representatives and the Senate, I think it has been rather tardy in the preparation of the bill in particular and, more importantly, in its failure to make available at the time the bill was presented to the House, just on a fortnight ago, the discussion paper, which is so central to the consideration of the bill in detail.
While confirming that it does not intend to alter the curfew, the 80 movements per hour cap or the guaranteed slots for regional airlines, the government has announced four changes to the slot management system. These changes are of specific importance not only to the operation of airlines in general from a national perspective and from the point of view of Kingsford Smith but also to the future operation of regional airlines in and out of Kingsford Smith, with particular attention to the needs of people living in areas outside the Sydney metropolitan area. The changes proposed seek to: firstly, cap the number of regional slots allocated in the peak periods at the current level; secondly, encourage airlines progressively to introduce larger aircraft; thirdly, establish a minimum seat limit for the allocation of new slots to be determined in consultation with industry; and, finally, remove any risk that the major airlines could avoid the regional guarantee by migrating the regional slots held by their affiliates into non-peak periods.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that your excise proposals on petrol and beer were introduced into the parliament separately?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I think the Leader of the Opposition has been reading too many Daily Telegraph headlines. Maybe he helped to write some of them—having had a look at this morning's, I would have to imagine that that might be possible. Let me simply say that we are following, so I am told, the normal practice that you have when excise proposals are introduced. In his question, the Leader of the Opposition does not—I think quite deceitfully—distinguish between the legislation that validates an excise proposal and the excise proposal itself. Let me make it very clear, as I did on radio this morning, that there is no way that the 1.5c a litre cut in petrol excise is at risk—no way. Not even the negative attitude of the Labor Party on these matters can put that at risk. I want to make it perfectly clear to the Australian public that petrol excise has been cut by 1.5c a litre and that, of course, will be maintained. I also make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that the automatic indexation of petrol excise introduced by the Hawke government, of which he was a member in 1983, will disappear with effect from next August, after having 18 years of automatically putting up the tax on petrol. That was a policy decision of the Hawke government, supported by the Leader of the Opposition and there was no more loyal supporter of the prime ministership of Bob Hawke than the Leader of the Opposition. That is also going to disappear.
The real truth of what is occurring is that the Australian Labor Party wants to refund $185 million to the breweries of Australia. The Australian Labor Party does not want to give it back to the drinkers; it wants to give it back to the breweries. The Leader of the Opposition knows that excise is not collected directly from customers; excise is collected from the breweries. If the measure relating to beer excise is defeated, the government will have a legal obligation to pay the money back to Carlton & United and Lion Nathan. They will be the beneficiaries.
—Exactly. So the new social justice policy of the Australian Labor Party is that you hand $185 million to the breweries of Australia! There are two breweries in Australia: Lion Nathan and Carlton & United. They will love the Leader of the Opposition as a result of this. The Leader of the Opposition has won two great allies today: he has won the allies of the Internet gambling operators and the breweries of Australia.

Minister, are you aware that under the eligibility rules for your dairy package the lessee has walked away from the industry with more than $100,000 from the dairy package while the owners of the farm received only $7,000? Minister, will you now admit that your bungled handling of the dairy deregulation has left many retired farmers in this very difficult situation? Minister, what do you say to retired dairy farmers like June and Brian Barling who have been left with no tenant, no retirement income, minimal access to the dairy package and an asset which has been greatly devalued as a result of dairy deregulation?

I will allow the question to stand but in fact the detail of people's names is not normally regarded as an appropriate part of the question unless necessary to make the question intelligible. In this case the question would have been intelligible without that detail.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Dairy Industry: Deregulation</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—The member for Burke asked me what I would say to these lessors in relation to the impact of dairy deregulation on their property. The first thing I would say would be to ask them what has their state Labor government done to help them. Not a single thing. In common with all other dairy farmers around Australia their answer will be that their state Labor government has done absolutely nothing to help them, nothing whatsoever. They have stood idly by. They have passed the legislation. They have implemented the deregulation. But they have done nothing whatsoever anywhere to assist dairy farmers around Australia to address adjustment issues.
By contrast, this government has responded in full to the industry's request for us to provide an adjustment package. We have provided a $1.78 billion restructuring package to particularly assist those farmers most in need who have required the greatest level of adjustment. That package has been appreciated by dairy farmers, who have noted the contrast in the way the coalition has addressed the issues of dairy farmers compared with what Labor have failed to do. Even now, we have the Labor Party with their so-called dairy policy, announced recently at their latest talkfest, which will effectively strip away the assistance that is available to help dairy communities.  
—I am wondering what the honourable member for Paterson thinks about a Labor Party policy that is going to take $20 million off regional communities, the very sort of support that the people of Gloucester need at this time when they have such difficulties.
—Mr Speaker, I take a point of order under standing order 145. The question is asking about a lessee who has walked away with the money and a farmer left with nothing.
—The member for Burke will resume his seat. The minister's answer has been entirely relevant to the question. 
—As if it is not bad enough that the Labor Party at the state level, where they have been in power, did nothing for dairy farmers around Australia, now we have the Labor Party at the federal level saying that they are going to take away some of the assistance that we have already put on the table to help farmers in areas like Gloucester.
—As the Leader of the Opposition knows, I have never denied him the call.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. I raise a point of order on relevance for this reason: a specific question affecting a constituent of a member has been asked. Some person under this scheme has been able, after three years as a tenant, to walk away with $100,000 and the other folk who are concerned with his farm, who relied on it for their retirement package—
—The Leader of the Opposition is advancing an argument and not making a point of relevance.
—It was a very specific question.
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat!
—Mr Speaker, I repeat: this government acted, Labor has failed. In relation to the case referred to by the honourable member, naturally I am not aware personally of the details of that individual. But I make a couple of comments about lessors and lessees to the effect that, as I indicated earlier, this government responded fully and in detail to the request of the industry about how we should address individual entitlements under the scheme.
—The member for McMillan is warned!
—That included the way in which the adjustment assistance was divided between lessors and lessees. This matter was also considered by a Senate committee of inquiry in great detail, and they endorsed the government's response to this issue. Members opposite voted for a distribution in this way. So it is utterly hypocritical for the honourable member to be asking questions about the distribution in this case when they voted precisely for this sort of a division between lessors and lessees. This government have demonstrated a willingness to consider the issues associated with dairy deregulation. We have shown compassion where the other side have shown nothing but scorn. We have endeavoured to address issues where hardship has been identified where Labor have been prepared to do nothing. In relation to lessors and lessees, we are also prepared to look at particular circumstances where hardship might have occurred and, as has always been the trait of this government in dealing with dairy deregulation, we will be sympathetic to those who are facing genuine need. We will respond positively to circumstances where we can help. Labor just want to strip away that assistance and leave communities utterly defenceless.
—Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the letter from Mr and Mrs Barling that will assist the minister in considering their case.

"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—I seek to add to an answer to a question I was asked yesterday by the member for Perth.
—The Deputy Prime Minister may proceed.
—The member for Perth asked me a question regarding the number of Telstra directors who qualify under section 8 of the act as having knowledge of, or experience in, the communications needs of regional Australia. It is not a board that I appointed; it is outside my own direct responsibilities. I was, of course, happy to make inquiries on the member's behalf—inquiries, I might add, that he could have made for himself. The member offered to table a list of directors. The company secretary of Telstra advises me that, apart from Mr McGauchie, the company considers the following directors qualified. Dr John Stocker, who owns and operates a vineyard at Seymour in Victoria, is the Chairman of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. He was the Chief Executive of CSIRO for many years. He is also a director of Nufarm Ltd, the largest Australian manufacturer of farming herbicides. I think he might qualify. Then there is Mr Sam Chisholm. He owns and lives on a property in Jugiong which carries 14,000 sheep and 1,000 head of cattle. I think he might qualify. Mr John Ralph owns and oversees—
Opposition members interjecting— 
—Owns and operates a 6,000-acre beef and wool property at Wagga Wagga.
—I remind members on my left of their status. 
—Indeed, Telstra chairman Bob Mansfield has an interest in a 14,000-acre place at Ashford in north-west New South Wales. There are five directors who satisfy the regional credentials of the act.  
—Order! Member for the Northern Territory!
—Of course, there is more. The House should also be aware that Telstra Countrywide, which is of great significance in rural and regional Australia, has its own advisory board. Its members are Mr McGauchie, again; former Telstra director Mrs Celia Moar; a former executive member of the WA Pastoralists and Graziers Association; the president of the Tasmania Fine Merino Breeders Association, Rod O'Connor; the former chief executive of Elders, Rick Mollison; a grazier from Blackall in Queensland, Jenny Russell; the Minerals Council of Australia member Noel Bridge, the son of Ernie Bridge; and the Chairman of the Townsville Zone Advisory Committee, Fisheries Management Authority, John Hogan. 
The point has to be made that, if the member was genuinely concerned about whether Telstra was well served by people from regional Australia, the answer would have to be yes. I just leave that point. If he had any interest in it, if he was at all competent in pursuit of the interests of rural and regional people in telecommunications, he could well have answered his own question.

"Sullivan, Kathryn, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, and it relates to access to the chamber by members when a division has been called. There was an incident today when we had a division during what is normally considered to be the lunch break. A situation arose which I think is not unusual. During lunchtime, of course, many members are involved in various functions around the building. Today was no exception. Because of this, a number of us arrived at the doors off the general members lobby at the same time, having come down in the lifts. We stood waiting to go through the doors, which were only half open, one at a time. Whilst we were waiting our turns, the occupant of the chair uttered the words, `Lock the doors.' What followed was a bit of a scuffle as a few of the larger members of this House were able to push their way past the attendant, who was in the process of shutting the door in our faces. I emphasise that we were not late.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The member for Moncrieff has the call and will be heard in silence. 
—We were at the chamber in good time. I might also say, for the information of those opposite who are interjecting, that there were more members of the opposition locked out than there were members of the government. 
—The member for Blaxland is warned!  
—There were two members of the opposition and one member of the government, namely me. I am not large enough to indulge in grappling with the attendant at the door—
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is a distressing story, but I do not think it is a question.
—The Chief Opposition Whip will resume his seat. 
—Mr Speaker, I wish to raise two points with you. Firstly, given that there are three sets of double doors to this chamber, why was only one side open? If both sides of the door had been open, the situation simply would not have arisen. We would not have had to come in in single file. Secondly, what instructions are given by you, or in your name, to attendants that when members are waiting to walk through the door in an orderly fashion they nevertheless are physically barred from walking through those doors, although they were here in good time to participate in the division?

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I just make the observation again at the beginning of this matter of public importance: as the Treasurer was actually challenging Labor to ask him questions in this parliament, why will he not attend to defend MPIs? Why will he not entertain the debate about his botched economic management and the continuing deceit through his complicity in the GST? In an earlier debate on the government's handling of the GST, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the Prime Minister, whenever he was in difficulty, as having `the cunning plan', like Baldrick from Blackadder. Today, I think we have begun nailing who Baldrick is: he is the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. There he is, slotted by the Prime Minister for having put out speaking notes that were supposed to be the cunning plan for this government to get its beer excise up by blackmailing motorists in this country and saying, `Unless you pass beer, you don't get your petrol tax.' There he was with this cunning plan. Instead of a Treasurer getting on with the job that he has been tasked with—such as cracking down on tax cheats and not going weak at the knees when he has an agreement with the Labor Party on business taxation—there he is out there hatching these cunning plans.
With a smirk that would put Blackadder to shame, we have him with his latest effort, his latest cunning plan, to link the beer excise to petrol excise. In the process, he has compounded the Prime Minister's deceit on beer; he has magnified it 10 times over as blackmail. Imagine the conversation that is going on here. You have the Prime Minister in the bunker. He has already backflipped on the BAS, he has already backflipped on petrol, he has been forced back into roll-back but is not wanting to admit it—all the result of earlier cunning plans by this Treasurer—and you have the Prime Minister being confronted with another plan, this time in relation to beer.
I went through some of the scripts of Blackadder, and the following could well have been the first response the Prime Minister gave to Baldrick as he came through the door in the form of the nation's Treasurer. The Prime Minister would have said, `Baldrick, you wouldn't recognise a cunning plan if it painted itself purple, danced on a harpsichord and sang ""Cunning plans are here again"".' But the Treasurer said, `Have faith; we may have mucked up with the other ones, Prime Minister, but have faith because I have got another cunning plan for you.' To which Peter Reith, sitting there in the audience, may have played the role of Edmund, also in Blackadder, and said to the Prime Minister, `I wouldn't get overexcited, sir; I have a horrid suspicion that Baldrick's plan would be the stupidest thing you ever heard since Lord Nelson's favourite famous signal at the Battle of the Nile: ""England knows Lady Hamilton a virgin; poke my eye out and cut off my arm if I am wrong"".' That would have been the advice of Peter Reith to the Prime Minister as Baldrick was coming in with his latest cunning plan.
But let us understand what this plan was, because it is revealed in speaking notes that were faxed to government members, a copy of which was leaked to us. We suspect that, just as there are people on the back bench over there who wanted the government to do the right thing on petrol that we were urging them to do, there are others over there hatching their little cunning plans. They are leaking to us; they are giving us the information that the government is trying to prime its loyal backbench to go into the trenches on to defend the beer-GST deceit. 
What was the note in the speaking notes about the significance of tying beer with petrol in the one bill? It was this on page 2 of the speaking notes: `If the Senate does not pass these bills, then consumers could be denied the benefit of petrol and diesel excise reductions.' That was the gun at the head; that was the reason for linking these two measures in the one bill. There was no reason why they had to link the two measures in the one bill, because the proposals themselves, in an earlier form in the parliament, had come in separately. So why are they linked together? Because the cunning plan that the Treasurer has wreaked is to say, `We won't give them the petrol cut that you backflipped on, Prime Minister, unless they tap the mat on beer.'
But why should people who have been deceived in relation to petrol also tap the mat when they have been deceived in relation to beer? What was the extent of that deceit on beer? It was the Prime Minister himself saying that the price of ordinary beer would go up by only 1.9 per cent as a result of the GST. Since the GST, it has gone up by over 10 per cent, and the Prime Minister likes to tell you that he was not talking about draught beer. Go and try to tell any drinker in the country that draught beer is not ordinary beer, because that is the logic of the Prime Minister's position.
We therefore have another GST deceit, now masked in blackmail, perpetrated by a Treasurer who will not come into this House and defend it, who will not even make an appearance in the debate on the bills that are being passed to put it through and who will not appear in the debate on matters of public importance when his stewardship, his management of the economy, is under challenge. And well it should be under challenge, because this was the Treasurer that smirked his way through saying that the GST was going to be good for the economy. I will tell you what the GST did for the economy: it ended a run of 9½ years of successive economic growth at around four per cent, half of it under Labor's administration and half under theirs. What brought it to an end? The GST—just as it brought to an end that claim by the Prime Minister that everyone except tax cheats would be better off as a result of the GST. Yesterday in question time he moved away from that commitment. He is now simply saying that the average Australian will be better off under the GST. It is another backdown, presumably under their cunning strategy of trying to wriggle their way out of all of the so-called promises that they made in relation to the GST.
This is a government in shambles, a government that cannot take a decision, a government that is like a rabbit caught in headlights that does not know where to go. It is a government that, when it is forced to do something, has to turn to what Labor is proposing to do—the BAS simplification, the petrol adjustments, the roll-back initiatives that it wants to decry on one hand but readily embrace whenever it gets itself into trouble. Yesterday we had a shocking performance by the government in question time. If it were possible to be any worse, we saw it today. Today was an absolute shambles; yesterday was a dead shocker.
Yesterday was the day that the shadow minister for foreign affairs tagged as `Bad Name Day' for the government in the parliament. We had the Prime Minister urging us to take careful note of what the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank had said in his speech overseas, that we should take careful note of every word, and then referring to him as Stewart Grenville, not Stephen Grenville. He was called to attention four times but still could not pick it up—one bad name.
Then we had the Minister for Small Business, sitting at the table, trying to formulate this great argument about former ACTU presidents in this place and he could not even name the last one. He called her Jenny Craig and then got up in his defence and said, `It was a Freudian slip: I was referring to Jennie George.' How long have you been dreaming about her, Minister? That is what I would like to know. If it was a Freudian slip, just what are these dreams that you have been having? And, if they are about ACTU presidents, I hope you are not dreaming about me, my friend. 
To complete the `Bad Name Day', the shadow minister for communications asked the Deputy Prime Minister and champion of regional Australia to name the people that, under their legislation, are required to sit as representatives of the rural community on the Telstra board, and he did not know. This is the champion of regional Australia, the minister for regional services, and he cannot even name them. But we got the answers today, didn't we?
Who is representing regional Australia? There is Sam Chisholm—Farmer Sam—and John Ralph. That is because Senator Alston says that the requirement is satisfied simply because he has a large farm. We know he has a large farm: we saw him sitting at it when he was advertising the merits of tax reform. You remember when he did the Business Council of Australia ads, talking people into the reason we had to embrace the GST, sitting there with the rolling hills in the background and saying, `This country's been good to me and now I'm going to tell you what's good for you—it is called a GST.' They took those ads off the air quick smart when they realised how out of touch the message was that this government believes that this is a person who satisfies their criteria. Bob Mansfield—no wonder this government is so out of touch. This is a government that only ever talks to the top end of town and has no regard at all for what the small end of town is on about; it would not have a clue. Whenever it comes to defending its position, who does it resort to for support and advice? The top end of town. No wonder they are not listening. No wonder they were laughing today at you, Minister, at the small business forum, a forum that you were supposed to attend while I was addressing it about Labor's alternative. I do not think you even came in.
—I was there.
—If you had been there, you should not have got up and answered that stupid question earlier in question time, because at the forum you would have seen what Labor's answer was in terms of roll-back. You would have seen the commitment to simplification, a commitment and a consultation process that I can tell you the small business community want to engage us in. They do not believe that the member for Wills's inquiry is a waste of time. You just wait for the people who are lining up to make the submissions. Before you denigrate the inquiry, just look at how successful our inquiry on petrol was. This was the one that forced your backflip. This was the one that forced you to embrace a backflip on petrol. We look forward to more backflips by you on business activity statements.
Then, today, the other minister was sitting at the table. What a pathetic response it was in terms of dairy farmers. There are dairy farmers all around this country, particularly in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, who are not just hurting; they are desperate. And this government will not lift a finger for them. This government says, `What was Labor's role?' I will tell you what Labor's role was, because I happened to be primary industries minister through the second dairy industry plan. We saw the first one introduced by John Kerin, with sensible restructurings. They were commitments in which the government actually made a contribution and did not stick its hand into dairy farmer payouts and pocket it as tax.
Your dairy industry strategy is nothing more than a disguised tax on milk. You said you were not going to put a GST on it; but you have slugged the consumer with a levy to fund the restructuring of an industry. As well, having imposed it on consumers, the payouts that farmers get—and they have not been getting many of them quickly—are now being pocketed by you in tax. You have contributed nothing. The consumers are paying a huge cost, the dairy farmers are paying with their livelihoods and you are pocketing the money. This is typical of you as a government. You simply want to take and never give. You are a government that does not know how to listen, a government that is committed to the top end of town, a government that does not deserve to hold office and a government whose deceit will continue to be exposed. That is why we want the splitting of the bills in terms of petrol and in terms of beer—to demonstrate that the blackmail does not work. If the Prime Minister backs down today, complete the backdown and split the bills.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I rise—
—Make sure you get the name right!
—Yes, I will get the name right. `Cunning plan', I think, was what most of the speech was about. I had a different title. I thought the Labor Party were going to talk about the economy and about tax reform but, bearing in mind that they have no real plan and no real policies, it did not surprise me that it was actually inside the last five minutes of the speech before the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got anywhere near tax reform. In fact, there was some consideration on this side of the table as to whether we should call a point of order on relevance.
If we are talking about `cunning plans', I think the most cunning plan I have ever seen in politics was the plan put forward by the Labor Party in 1993 when they wrote into documents that they were putting tax cuts into law—l-a-w law. They had this cunning plan. This is not supposition—as we have just heard from the other side; this is actual fact. They had this cunning plan in which they were actually going to con the electorate. They were going to introduce tax cuts—and they did. They were successful in winning an election based on l-a-w law tax cuts. And what was the consequence? When they got back in, the tax cuts were ripped up. Worse still, though—
—Is this 1997 we're talking about?
—No, we are talking about 1993—your last term of government, thank God.
 (Mr Nehl)—The minister will ignore the member for Melbourne and address his remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Members opposite interject—and well they should—because they do not want to be reminded that they not only ripped up the promised tax cuts but also put taxes up. They increased taxes; they increased wholesale sales tax, but they gave no compensation to small business, no compensation to pensioners and no compensation to the community. Then they got stuck into them on excise and they put the price of fuel up as well. They talk about cunning plans, but they take the cake. When they talk about bad name days and dreams, all I ever think about on that score—if I ever happen to think of them in my sleep—is the nightmare that would confront the business community of Australia if Labor were returned to the treasury bench. As we have seen, the nightmare has become a reality in Victoria, where the Victorian government is attempting to reregulate industrial relations, and in Western Australia, where the Labor government is putting in place special privileges and special access for trade unions.
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition only really got down to what I thought the MPI was about for a brief moment, in the last few minutes of his MPI speech. When he finally started to talk about tax, he mentioned the ALP inquiry. What wonderful responses they got as they travelled around the country! Three people at Box Hill. They were probably all from the Labor Party. There would have been more there at the inquiry from the parliamentary Labor Party than people who were genuinely interested in the inquiry.
—The member for Braddon!
—I am just trying to help him out.
—I will help you out if you keep going.
—I would not argue with that, Mr Deputy Speaker. People out there in the small business community have worked out that this inquiry is an absolute sham. 
—They want to know about roll-back.
—They want to know about roll-back. They want to know why roll-back is not included in the terms of reference. Why isn't roll-back included in the terms of reference? The shadow minister for small business stood up to claim that I had misquoted him. I showed him the transcript when he sat down and I had not misquoted him; I quoted him word for word. But when he stood up, he said that what he actually meant to say was that roll-back would come at a cost to government. That is what he said he said, or what he thought he said he said. The inquiry is not looking at roll-back, yet the shadow minister for small business admits that it is going to come at a cost to government. He admits that roll-back will mean that there will be a cut in funding, and we all know that is not going to happen because the Leader of the Opposition has already said categorically—unless he gets his two free subs—that he is going to increase government spending. So what happens? If you cut back the income from the GST, you have got two options. One is to renegotiate with the states and put up the GST rate on those goods that you keep the GST on. If you do not do that, you go to the old favourites of the Labor Party: stick up income tax or stick up excise on fuel, or both. The inquiry we are hearing so little about, except in this chamber—I do not hear anything on that when I go out on trips that I am doing—
—Joel wants to put the fuel price up.
—The shadow minister for small business wants to do away with one of the fuel grant schemes we have introduced so that fuel in the country will cost consumers more. He is on the record. He said it in this House. It typifies the ramshackle, higgledy-piggledy nature of the Labor Party's tax policy.
What we as a government have done is bring to an end a complex and inefficient system of taxation in wholesale sales tax which is only supported by the Labor Party; that is, we think it is supported by the Labor Party. Despite their protestations about the GST, they dislike it so much that they are going to keep it. They are going to make it more complicated. They are going to confuse and frighten small business. They are going to put in more exclusions and more exemptions and impose on small business in wave after wave, like going through a stormy sea in a boat. You just go over the top of one set of changes and plunge into the depth of another. You climb over the top and into another depth. It will be wave after wave of change.
—And nothing to compensate them.
—And nothing to compensate. We know from previous experience that the Labor Party will not compensate. They did not compensate in 1994 when they put sales tax up, they did not compensate when they put fuel taxes up, and they will not compensate small business when they introduce wave after wave of change. I know Mr Bastian's name was mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That is why Mr Bastian said, as I mentioned in question time, that roll-back would increase complexity and increase supervision, and that means increased fear for small business. That is why Mr Bastian went on to say that Mr Beazley is taking the usual political stand, to keep his powder dry, but that position is not going to help and it is becoming an albatross around his neck.
The Leader of the Opposition is yet to tell us what his policy is. The interesting thing that I found about the Ryan by-election—I actually doorknocked and handed out pamphlets—was that Labor was way in front. Then two things happened: the Prime Minister started campaigning and Kim Beazley arrived. The Leader of the Opposition arrived in Ryan and went around. Everywhere they asked him what his policy was and he did not say anything. He made a lot of noise and said a lot of words, but he did not say anything. A small businessman in Ryan said to me, `The Labor Party has gone from being led by a scumbag to being led by a windbag. He didn't say anything.' The Leader of the Opposition went up to Ryan three times and uttered not a word that would give any comfort to the voters of Ryan. The Labor Party vote fell to the point where only the donkey vote got them across the line. 
—A near 10 per cent swing. How safe is your seat?
—It is a lot safer than yours.
—Mine is 22, actually.
—I will halve it and still be in front. What that says is that the Labor Party lie back and take their voters for granted. The government had the courage to introduce the tax reform that Australia needed. We had to do what is right for the country. The Labor Party sat there and engaged in nothing but cheap popularism. As a government, we have undertaken major tax reform. Any time that any government anywhere in the world engages in that sort of reform, there is going to have to be finetuning and changes to the process. That is not roll-back. Roll-back is exempting items that are currently taxed. We are finetuning the system on the basis of what we hear when we talk to small business. Unlike the fake inquiry that the Labor Party are running on taxation and small business, we go out and listen and attract genuine crowds of people who are open and honest with us about what they think we should be doing and how we should be making the system easier.
We went to Ballarat and Wangaratta, we have been all through Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland and we are about to go through New South Wales and Western Australia. What we hear from people are sensible, practical finetuning suggestions. The government are implementing those suggestions. That is what we are doing with the taxation system. We are putting in place ways to make it easier for business at large to deal with the process of what is a monumental change to the tax system. Despite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's assertion that I was not there at breakfast, I was there and I listened to his words. I certainly was not comforted by them. The crowd there did not seem to be too comforted by them either. They wanted an explanation of what roll-back is. He talked about what he would do to the BAS, which is another change—not one which, from my understanding, is supported by small business. What small business are saying to me is, `We like the way you get out there. We like the way the government is listening to the changes we want. We expect to have an interaction and to be involved in the finetuning of the process.'
I thought this MPI was about some sort of blunder or mishandling of the way we have done tax reform. I was a bit confused about what they would talk about. As we saw, except for the last three minutes, they did not even get to the subject. There is no better exponent of policy blunders than the Leader of the Opposition. He has a terrific record of botching a whole range of policy implementation. When he was Minister for Defence, he did a great botch job on the Collins class subs. He then allowed the Navy to go off and buy, sight unseen, a couple of warships that were so full of rust that we were committed to a huge amount of money to repair them. He then moved on to become Minister for Employment, Education and Training and, of course, we heard some candid comments about what he thought of being education minister. The result is on the record that he ran down literacy and numeracy skills for Australian children. As employment minister, he was responsible for record high unemployment levels of over 11 per cent or nearly one million Australians out of work. His coup de grace was when he was Minister for Finance. As part of his responsibilities, we saw interest rates go to 22 per cent and government debt explode and reach peaks of some $80 billion.
The disappointing thing is that, despite those botched jobs, he has not learnt anything. He now wants to embark on a road of roll-back which will send small business into despair, which will cause confusion, heartache and pain and will drive the economic indicators back to where they were under Labor when interest rates were at 22 per cent, when inflation was high and when unemployment figures went into double digits. The last people who can condemn the performance of this government on economic handling are the ALP.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—One of the great privileges of being in the House of Representatives is that you get to witness first-hand the political metamorphosis of the Treasurer, Peter Costello, from last year's Treasurer into this year's Treasurer—from the Treasurer in the age of Costello Uber Alles to the Treasurer of this year which is more like the Treasurer in rapid and in glorious retreat. Do we all remember the Treasurer who used to regale us each day with the bravado of Botswana and with the swagger of Swaziland? Those words seem to have disappeared from his vocabulary altogether. There is no more reference to Botswana and no more reference to Swaziland—in fact, they have been excised totally by the Treasurer's spin doctors. Why? Because in the presence of a 49c dollar and in the presence of $301 billion worth of debt, let me tell you that Botswana and Swaziland are starting to look okay. That is why the spinmeisters have excised them from the daily text.
We also remember the Treasurer in full flight last year on the evils of roll-back under the Australian Labor Party. This year's Treasurer, however, exhibits all the passion of a new convert. What we have from this Treasurer is a bucket load—no, not a bucket load but a truck load, a container load, a train load—of roll-back, whether it is in the BAS, in petrol, in the IAS, in all manner of policy. The Treasurer has become the roll-back kid—the king of roll-back. In fact, what we have with this Treasurer is roll-back cubed, but we have it in the absence of a single uttering of the `S' word: `Sorry, I got it wrong.'
Last year, we also had the Treasurer ridiculing the notion of a slow burn from the GST. Do we all remember that? Do we remember the Treasurer saying that in fact there would be no such slow burn at all? What we have had the Treasurer doing this year is taking a crash course in fire hose management. The slow burn has become an inferno of public rage, moving its way through the Queensland state election, the WA state election, the Ryan by-election and now on its way to the elections in Bennelong and Higgins. It is rolling and it is unstoppable.
Let us talk about the Ryan by-election, as it was raised recently by the member for Groom, the recently elevated minister. He said that the Prime Minister's intervention was important in arresting the Liberal Party's demise. I think it is important to pin a few facts onto the table. The only way that you can measure how the vote moves in a by-election is to count the pre-poll votes because they are the only ones that are counted chronologically during the time in which they are cast. What is the record of the pre-poll vote in Ryan? In the first four days of the last week of the campaign, Labor's vote stood at 43 per cent. On the last day, when cast in pre-polls on the day before voting actually occurred, Labor's vote stood at 44 per cent. When it came to voting day, our vote rose to 50.5 per cent. If you want some classic empirical study as to why the spinmeistering being undertaken by those opposite at the moment is absolutely full of it, just look at the record of the actual pre-polls cast, because it is proof positive that the PM's intervention had precisely the reverse effect.
The spinmeisters have also been at work on Ryan in another way: they are pinning it all on poor John Moore. We know that Mr Moore gave us a hand: about a quarter of the vote we reckon was because of John Moore's particular attachment to his electorate. Let me say that John Moore's indolence as a local member is nothing compared with this Treasurer's indolence as a minister responsible for the management of the taxation system and the management of taxation change. What we have is a Treasurer who loves to be around the place for the headline events—the release of the ANTS package and the release of the Ralph package. He wants to be here for the prestaged theatre of question time, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty of managing the tax system and the impact of it on the Australian Taxation Office he is found to be missing in action. What about the thousand amendments we have had through this place because it was botched on the way through? What about the ATO and its staff in meltdown because they cannot cope with it? What about the replyin5 service? What a joke. 
—They reply in five years.
—They reply in five years, as the member for Rankin rightly intervenes. Look at the impact on the small business community—they have been driven mad and beyond because of the impact of the BAS. And motorists are in revolt over the GST impact on petrol. Where was Treasurer Costello when all this was going wrong at the coalface? He was MIA, missing in action. When you look at Ryan, spare Mr Moore a bit of charity because it ain't all his fault. The result in Ryan was one part John Moore and four parts Peter Costello. 
Let us look at some of the micro impacts in Ryan. We had raised in question time a couple of weeks ago a matter relating to the Brookfield show. Here we had the situation where the good burghers of Brookfield—they have been running a local community show for some years now—after consultations with their local tax office, found that the GST meant two things for them. Firstly, they found that all of the kiddies participating in the finger painting and the pony riding and all of the ladies contributing to the baking competition had to be charged a GST on entering those competitions. That is all tickety-boo according to the government, not a word of refutation from them on that. Secondly, they found that, under the act, unless you could have a reasonable view that a competitor was a hobbyist as opposed to a professional, there was a risk that you would have to have a GST imposed on the prize money earned by the kid after they had won the pony riding competition or won the finger painting competition. How ludicrous! 
What the Brookfield Show Society did in response to this was to insist that each kid entering a competition sign a declaration. We had the ludicrous phenomenon of a finger painting having to be submitted to the show society executive for certification and six-year-old Jessica and Johnny having to say that they were hobbyists. Furthermore, and not disputed by the government, this collection of finger paintings had to be held for seven years in order to ensure that when the ATO subsequently came to audit any or all of this it was all done properly and according to Hoyle. This is a system out of control. Where was Treasurer Costello during all of this? He was MIA, missing in action. 
Of course when we look for other policy disasters we have only to look at what has been happening with the dairy industry recently. I am very sad that the minister for primary industries has absented himself from the chamber, because what we have had from him today is unreconstructed codswallop. But, when you are going to mutter unreconstructed codswallop, it is very important to coordinate your lines with the other players in the team, including, for example, Mike Horan, the Leader of the National Party in Queensland. There is old Mike up there in Brisbane—he has not had the best of seasons of late—in a report today, March 28, from Brisbane saying that he backed federal Labor's push for an industry summit to help the nation's struggling dairy industry. Thank you, Mike. The report further stated:
Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley has repeatedly called on the federal government to convene a dairy industry summit. 
Horan went on to say that such a summit is necessary if we are to bring all of the players together. In policy botch-ups, I think dairying rolls in with the rest of them in terms of a government simply not paying attention, not having its eyes focused on the wheel.
What do we have overall? We had last year's Treasurer saying that there was no problem with a GST on petrol and this year's Treasurer saying, `Whoops! We have now got a half billion dollar problem.' Last year's Treasurer was saying that the BAS was beautiful and this year's Treasurer is saying that the BAS was botched. We had last year's Treasurer saying that the IAS was going to be a little ripper for self-funded retirees—and this year what is happening? The IAS is now what we describe in the parliament as a non-IAS. 
Last year the Treasurer was saying that the economy was booming. This year, whoops, after nine years of sustained economic growth we find that the economy, unique among all OECD economies, has gone into negative growth. Thank you, Pete, for that one. Last year the Treasurer was saying that the foreign debt situation was fine. This year we are confronted with a record net foreign debt of $301 billion. Last year the Treasurer was saying that the international financial markets were ecstatic about the state of the Australian economy. This year we find ourselves with a 49c dollar. Remember the great boast, stemming from the Treasurer's machismo, that the level of the Australian dollar demonstrates the competence of the government's overall economic management? That was when we stood at 70c. We are now at 49c. Macho Pete has become Pete the Mouse against his own measure.
What has the Treasurer's response been to this unfolding economic policy debacle? It has been a two-pronged counterattack. The first prong of the counterattack has been smirk management. The second prong of the counterattack has been voice projection. First, on smirk management, advisers have said that the Treasurer's smirk has just gotten out of control. You can see the old smirkometer down there on the table. The glass is actually bursting. Like the mercury in Brisbane thermometers of recent days, it is just bursting through the top of the smirkometer. The big challenge has been: how do you convert the Treasurer's smirk into a smile? We, the taxpayers, had to pay for that through the employment of a consultant. That is prong one.
The second prong is voice projection. Have we all noticed that when the Treasurer starts speaking in question time he speaks in a very soft voice in order to ensure that everyone is listening? At the mid-point, he starts to raise his voice in order to obtain greater attention from those opposite. For the last three minutes, he shouts to make sure that everyone hears—an offence against occupational health and safety, as has been pointed out in this chamber before. We would simply say about this that the Treasurer is hoist by his own petard. His own statement of 10 October 1996 says:
It is an infallible guide in this parliament that the weaker the argument, the higher the decibel level.
We should call it Costello's law. Quantum of volume is inversely proportional to the quantum of content: q times v equals q times c over two. What we have in response from this Treasurer is smirk management, voice projection and no single change to policy substance.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—The topic of this matter of public importance is: `The government's policy atrophy, resulting in the botched implementation of a range of measures, including the GST and business tax reform.' The Oxford Dictionary describes `atrophy' as `wasting away through undernourishment, ageing, or lack of use; emaciation'. I can really understand why the member for Hotham has used the word `atrophy', as it perfectly describes the opposition's attempts to begin to develop policy.
Let us look at the real policy of a real government. On 1 July 2000, every taxpayer received an income tax cut, and 80 per cent of Australians, some who were on the top rate of 43 per cent, now pay a top rate of income tax no higher than 30 per cent. The government introduced $12 billion in tax cuts by providing assistance worth more than $2.4 billion per year to around two million families and by providing a wealth of assistance to people on social security, to self-funded retirees and to pensioners.
As an integral part of the new system, every taxpayer received personal income tax cuts from 1 July 2000, unlike the promised Keating l-a-w tax cuts in 1993. Did they deliver those promised tax cuts? No, indeed they did not. The 13 years of Labor government saw excise on fuel increase from 6c to 34c a litre. Labor also linked the excise increases to indexation, and they saw it as their very own cash cow. We have fixed Labor's cash cow. The Howard-Anderson government has abolished this indexation. `You can run but you can't hide' is a famous cry used constantly in the House by the opposition. 
We are giving the assistance that is required to adapt to this tax reform, the assistance that was never given to business or to consumers when Labor introduced their paper warfare when they were in government. We currently have 2,500 field officers providing one-on-one assistance to businesses and, as of last Friday, 23 March 2001, 399,599 field advisory visits had been requested, of which over 396,004 have been conducted. We currently have 30 GST signpost officers and a few vacancies are yet to be filled, providing one-on-one assistance to hundreds of small businesses in rural, regional and remote Australia.
When we wanted to provide benefits to all Australians the Labor Party voted against increases in family allowance, increased assistance for single income families, increased assistance for families with children, a changing Commonwealth-state tax treatment, a great tax for states, increases for pensions and income tax cuts for all Australians. Families had their benefits increased as part of the largest overhaul of family assistance ever, without one vote being cast by the Labor Party. The opposition opposed every family benefit that was brought into this House—no increase for assistance for any family. What of the Australian dream of owning your own home? When did the Labor government ever give assistance to those people dreaming of owning their own home? What have the Howard-Anderson government done? They have given all first home owners $14,000 to build a new home and $7,000 to buy an established one—many a dream fulfilled.
We have heard today comments on the GST but not one mention of the states which are the recipients of the GST benefits. Every dollar raised by the goods and services tax is paid to the state and territory governments. All of those additional taxes are putting money into schools, hospitals, police and the roads of the future. In fact, everybody in this House should note that the GST pays for the police on your streets back home at this very minute.
It was also interesting to hear the member for Hotham speak of country Australia. Yes, we do remember when he was the minister for primary industries. How could we forget! We do not forget. People in country Australia would be interested in the views of the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, that he expressed in the Bulletin. Asked about the difficulties of having former trade union bosses getting the support of the bush, Mr Beazley said:
It's not going to be difficult. They actually like Crean and Ferguson. They remember Crean when he was primary industries Minister ... Ferguson when he was ACTU president made a specialty of bush workers—
A specialty indeed! They dished our country people up on a plate in order that they would be consumed and then Crean and Ferguson licked the plate clean and washed them down with copious quantities of Brazilian concentrate. Yes, we will never forget the member for Hotham, Simon Crean, and Ferguson. How could we forget when Simon Crean was the minister for primary industries?
Today we have heard much of the famous Beazley beast, roll-back. Let us look at some of the responses to roll-back. Professor Peter Dixon of the Monash University Centre for Policy Studies has been heard to say this in an interview on ABC radio's Australia Talks Back:
Interviewer:
""But the GST, Peter is now a reality. Is it feasible for Labor to roll it back?""
Professor Dixon:
""I don't think so ... ""
"" ... If you're going to have a GST, you should have a very broad-based GST and as simple a GST as possible. Equity issues I think are much better handled through the tax transfer system, through income taxes, through the progressive income tax system and through transfers.""
These are the thoughts of a very astute man. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, described Professor Peter Dixon as `one of the pre-eminent economic modellers of this nation'. That was in Hansard on 9 February 1999. Simon Crean has described him `as a world renowned independent expert'. That is from a Crean press release on 3 February 1999. I will quote some other comments on roll-back. The President of the Small Business Council of the ACTU said: 
The last thing they want is, after all the effort and hard work they have put into it, to have a rollback and have more changes. We don't want any more changes.
That was on WIN TV news. The Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association said:
The ARA do not want any more exemptions.
I don't think anyone would be really impressed with having to gear up for a new GST. We'd like them to explain what they're proposing but we can't see any way you can fiddle with the GST that would make it less complex.
That was in the Age on 13 July 2000. The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:
Today it's one thing, tomorrow its something else, and continued exemptions only serve to undermine and narrow the tax base.
That was in the Age on 13 July 2000. The Business Council of Australia's Executive Director, quoted in the Age on 13 July 2000, said:
Anything that would add to the complexity, adds to the compliance burden would in our view be a regrettable development.
Make no mistake: Beazley's beast—roll-back—means mayhem. Australians should not and will not be deceived. What you will get with Labor's roll-back will result in a GST in disguise—don't you worry—or, alternatively, a GST in drag. 
This government has listened and it has acted on the issues. The business activity statement, or BAS, saw some businesses having some difficulties. We did not say sorry, as the member for Griffith has spoken about, and then do nothing. We listened and we acted. Sorry means nothing without actions. This government has listened and has acted on the issues, because the BAS has seen some difficulties for some businesses. 
The details have now been finalised for the simplification of the BAS, as announced on 22 February 2001. These changes apply to businesses which currently report and pay GST quarterly and have a turnover of less than $20 million. These businesses can choose to do one of the following: first, continue to pay and report—that is business as usual and no change; second, pay GST and report less information quarterly and complete an annual return—for those of you who are hard of understanding, that means report with less information; or, third, pay a quarterly amount worked out by the Taxation Office and provide an annual reconciliation. This would mean fewer hassles with an annual return. In addition, from the fourth reporting quarter—that is April to June 2001—there will be a new BAS form that will be easier to read and fill out. 
This is a government who listens; this is a government who delivers. The member for Hotham has spoken today of backflips by this government. That is one thing the Australian people will never have to worry about: the Labor Party will not have to backflip on policy because they have no policy to backflip on. Labor policy is just like this blank piece of paper, although I do have a spot—a blot on all Australians. That is Labor policy: a spot, a blot on a blank piece of paper.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The discussion has concluded. ",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Implementation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—Prior to the adjournment of consideration of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 to enable question time to proceed, I detailed the four changes to the slot management system with respect to the operation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport that can flow from the operation of this bill. As I then said, some more information and a description of these changes is now detailed in a discussion paper that was released by the government for public consultation yesterday. I simply say that it is the intention of the opposition to seek a reference of this legislation, in association with the discussion paper and the ACCC decision with respect to Hazelton Airlines and its takeover by Ansett, for detailed consideration. I say to those concerned with the operation of the Kingsford Smith airport that they should consider the content of the discussion paper released by the government yesterday entitled Sydney airport slot scheme discussion paper and make their views known to the Senate committee to ensure that we get proper feedback and consideration of these policy changes.
It is in that context that I suggest that the bill now before the House clearly is about facilitating those changes by ensuring that the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 that allow access to declared services do not override the slot management system. In raising this issue, the provisions of part III of the Trade Practices Act that will be effectively overridden by the act by virtue of this bill were introduced to the Trade Practices Act through the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995. The purpose of the section is to ensure access to certain facilities with monopoly-like characteristics. These provisions are intended to allow a party who believes that they are being denied access to a service by such a facility to apply to have the services `declared'. When a service is `declared', arrangements for access to those services are then negotiated with the service provider. Obviously, disputes can arise from time to time, and disputes regarding arranged access to declared services can be arbitrated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, whose decisions can be reviewed by the Australian Competition Tribunal and the Federal Court. 
Without this amendment the opposition appreciates the potential for conflict to arise between the slot system, which imposes specific restrictions and rights to access Sydney airport, and the outcome of any review process under the `declared' services provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The opposition therefore supports the right of government to make policy decisions regarding equitable and fair access to Sydney airport, and potentially any other airport where that need may arise. For that reason, as I have said, the actual detail and nature of that change is the subject of the discussion paper that I have referred to which was released by the government yesterday.
The opposition will consider, in association with the industry and community, any specific issues arising from that discussion paper, which has not been able to be properly considered because of its late release yesterday prior to this debate. I might say that was despite numerous requests by my office to try to facilitate proper consideration in the House of these matters on the basis that that discussion paper in essence should have been released some weeks ago to facilitate consideration of this bill. Having said that, I also suggest that, in terms of this bill and what is best described as a freeing up of the capacity of the minister to make certain arrangements for access, we definitely support that right, and indeed responsibility, of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. That is what we believe the Minister for Transport and Regional Services ought to be considering and deciding from time to time.
The amendment contained in the bill to specify that the slot system may deal with particular categories of aircraft is also supported. In fact, we venture to suggest that this amendment may be seen as unnecessary, as the existing section 35 of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 already allows the system to deal with the `allocation of slots and associated matters ... such as the conditions that may be imposed on slots'. It therefore seems that the government has proposed this amendment perhaps for more abundant caution so as to put the matter beyond any doubt.
I also confirm, as I have touched on in this debate previously, that the opposition will seek to refer this bill to the Senate Rural, Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. We have found this referral necessary to ensure that all aspects of the proposed changes to the slot management system are aired, understood and pinned down as part of this legislative process. That is important because, when it comes to the management of something as sensitive as Kingsford Smith airport, we actually believe that one should not be required to buy a pig in a poke but in considering these issues one should have the opportunity to consider the whole package in detail rather than one-off, piecemeal consideration of what is a new approach to slot management at Sydney airport.
I know that the minister may not be happy with what he would see as a potential delay by a Senate committee reference. His office did advise us that the government wants to push this legislation through over the next two weeks to coincide with the international airline scheduling processes. All I can say is that the opposition have a job to do, and our responsibility is to ensure that proper scrutiny of this bill and the changes to the slot system are not hampered by the deadline. I simply say that in some ways one can suggest that a potential cause of the tight deadline has actually been the failure of the government to release the discussion paper earlier than yesterday. The government has known of the proposed changes to the system for a number of months, and one should not forget that in considering the need to refer this matter to a Senate committee. Despite the intent of the government for a number of months to bring forward this legislation, we only saw the bill in the last sitting week; in fact, on the final day of the last sitting week. We only yesterday saw the detail of the changes in respect of what is proposed in the discussion paper. Any delay in the proper consideration of these matters is not at our feet; it is at the feet of the government and its desire to push these things through in an effort, I suppose, to circumvent proper consideration of the discussion paper and associated matters because of the manner in which the minister's office has handled this bill. Obviously, my Senate colleagues will do their best, as they always do, to ensure that committee scrutiny of this issue is conducted as expeditiously as possible. However, we will not forgo the need for and our responsibility to have this bill and its related issues appropriately scrutinised. 
In passing, I also refer to the fact that we all believe that the slot management system is a complex system. Therefore, any change to the system has ramifications for the travelling public, airline operators, communities and those affected by the airport and those who depend upon the affected aviation services to meet their business and social needs. The response of the communities and industry to those changes must therefore be considered in any response to the slot management system changes. To do that, those affected need to see the actual detail to assess the impact. As I have said, the discussion paper is out there, and the opposition have said that we will seek to refer the bill to the Senate legislation committee to allow proper scrutiny and input. As the communities and industry affected are both metropolitan and non-metropolitan, I also urge the Senate committee, if it takes up the Labor Party opposition proposal to refer the bill, to ensure that its inquiry is widely publicised and to encourage wide input to its deliberations.
Making the Trade Practices Act 1974 subject to the act is not contentious. The same measures apply in, for example, the Airports Act 1996. In the Airports Act, the same provisions of the Trade Practices Act are overridden to ensure the minister can determine the capacity of particular airports and implement measures to manage aircraft movements and other matters. As I said before—and I think this is accepted on both sides of the House—this is a power that properly sits with the minister for transport in the public, economic and community interest. However, having said that, aspects of the specific changes proposed by this minister to the Sydney airport slot management scheme may be contentious, especially determinations that provide incentives to use larger aircraft. For example, the airlines are tending to reduce the size of their aircraft to maintain viability of some routes. The discussion paper on the precise changes provides some analysis, but it is not enough. There has also been insufficient time to give any proper assessment of that discussion in this debate. It is therefore, as I have said, also intended that the discussion paper receive scrutiny of the Senate in the consideration of this bill.
The proposed changes to the slot management system involving the Sydney airport slot management scheme were made in the context of the government's broader policy statement about the future of Sydney airport. We should not lose sight of that. That decision was roundly criticised by the opposition as a non-decision. It included the use of Bankstown Airport for spill-over capacity from Sydney airport. A consequence of the changes now outlined in the discussion paper released by the minister is that the spill-over function of Bankstown Airport also applies to the new, smaller, regional aircraft that would be denied access to Sydney airport slots. The discussion paper, I note, sets the size limit for those allowed to apply for new Sydney slots at 18 seats. The industry and others need to consider and provide feedback on the impact of that specification. 
For all these reasons and others, full scrutiny must be given to this bill and the changes foreshadowed in the minister's second reading speech, and there must be further clarification of the discussion paper released yesterday. The opposition has therefore taken the decision to ensure this happens through the due processes of the Senate.
Another current issue for the opposition is the role of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in slot management and transport policy. The commission recently issued a decision imposing conditions on any Ansett takeover of Hazelton Airlines. These conditions include a requirement for Ansett to hand Hazelton's Sydney airport slots to new regional operators in certain circumstances. To me, this is looking like policy that should be determined by the transport minister because the operation of the slot management system and Sydney airport are transport policy. They are clearly matters for government to determine first hand, not for ministers to escape their responsibilities by having the ACCC make their decisions for them. Perhaps the transport minister did determine this policy that was announced in conjunction with the ACCC. I do not know, but I suggest that might be the case because we find that, more often than one would like, the current Minister for Transport and Regional Services likes to escape his responsibilities rather than accept the responsibility of making decisions, which is what he is paid to do. For that reason, it is also appropriate that the Senate legislation committee in the consideration of this bill and the discussion paper also consider the ACCC decision going to the merger of Hazelton Airlines and Ansett, because in many ways those decisions are related. 
In that context, I refer to the fact that, in the minister's discussion paper, he includes the following comment:
The proposed changes to the Slot Management Scheme have not been affected by the ACCC announcement of 9 March 2001 in relation to the Ansett acquisition of Hazelton Airlines. Rather, Ansett and the ACCC have recognised that the undertakings given by Ansett and accepted by the ACCC may need to be reviewed in the light of any amendments to the Sydney Demand Management Act 1997 or the Scheme.
I think it is appropriate that the Senate legislation committee consider that statement in the context of the bill so that we as a community and as legislators can determine the basis of the ACCC's decision, what consultation actually occurred between the minister, his office and/or the department and the ACCC concerning the Hazelton merger with Ansett, and the ramifications of this bill and the associated discussion paper for the ACCC's decision going to the merger of Ansett and Hazelton Airlines. It is clearly timely and appropriate to consider that comment in the light of the issues raised by the ACCC decision on the operation of the slot management scheme. It is appropriate to ask some questions to gain a clearer understanding for all parties affected about the line between transport policy and competition policy and how it affects access to our major airport.
I raise these issues because it is clear that, in recent times, the transport minister has been subject to strong criticism of his aviation policy, the lack of direction that comes from him and his office, his poor consultation and a general lack of interest in his portfolio. I refer to a couple of prime examples of this by taking the last two sitting weeks. This week in this House on Monday, Labor exposed a process to develop a secret strategy aimed at trying to fix the Minister for Transport and Regional Services's mess with respect to regional aviation policy. The Liberal candidate for Capricornia, a close mate of the Leader of the National Party and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and the staff of the junior minister for transport, whom one would normally expect to be there to support and back up his senior minister, were involved in developing a so-called rescue package to be released before the next election to remedy the mess the minister has made of regional aviation policy. 
Yesterday we saw the minister, as a result of that exposure, delivering a personal explanation here in the House, where not only did he further expose himself for not doing the job he is paid to do, but more importantly he effectively hung CASA—his own aviation safety regulatory organisation—out to dry in relation to the criticisms, saying they get `too high-handed'. To my astonishment, he took no responsibility himself as the minister. The strategy drafted by the AOPA president in consultation with the junior minister for transport, Senator Macdonald, goes directly to the minister's inadequacies and failings—not just those of CASA. I understand from reading the document why the minister refused my request to table the document for proper consideration by the whole House.
What we had yesterday was the minister standing up and acknowledging the problems but again buck-passing. I suppose when it comes to buck-passing one should not be surprised. It was not that long ago that we had the debacle about the failure of the minister to meet his full requirements under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988. Not only did he fudge the response of the government with respect to whether the formula going to road expenditure had been properly applied under that land transport act, he again proved that when he makes a mistake as the responsible minister it is never his mistake, it is never his responsibility. Who took the rap? It was not the minister, but two employees of the minister—one a very senior person with a proven record of faithful service to the minister and the coalition government. 
I adopt a view that, as the minister, surely you reach the point where you must accept some responsibility for your own actions rather than continuing to buck pass and blame others for your own mistakes and inadequacies. I would also remind the House briefly that there was a further example of this during the last sitting weeks of early March when, after questioning from the opposition, we successfully exposed the aviation fuel rip-off being perpetrated by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The minister initially pleaded ignorance to the question posed during question time on the government's policy on location-specific pricing for aviation services provided by Air Services Australia. These services were provided at huge cost to an industry that in some sections is already doing it tough. The minister was finally forced to come into the House and own up to what was yet another fuel rip-off.
In response, in last year's budget the minister imposed a fuel levy for the specific purpose of subsidising those services to regional Australia. To the shame of the minister—and he is not just the minister for transport, he is also the minister for regional services and the leader of the National Party, the so-called voice at the most senior level in the coalition government for regional Australia—he was forced to humble himself and come in here and stand at the dispatch box and concede that Labor had exposed yet another fuel rip-off with special implications for regional Australia. What it showed was that the government had been ripping off ordinary taxpayers—some in small business doing it tough—yet again. He was forced to admit in the House that he had ripped off the industry and let down regional Australia. Even worse, on being exposed, he failed to promise that the money would be given back to those people who, frankly, more than pay their way for the services provided by the government with respect to aviation activities. Instead, what was his answer? `We will allow it to go through to the normal budget processes'—into consolidated revenue—in his hip pocket, for his own personal projects in the future.
Even in the last two weeks of this parliament—leaving aside the early litany of concerns raised by the opposition—Labor has highlighted the gross deficiencies and policy ineptness of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. It is therefore incumbent upon us, in considering a bill, the intent of which we basically support, to exercise extreme caution with the government's aviation policies. For this reason and for other reasons outlined earlier, the opposition will argue and seek to ensure that this bill and the expected regulations receive the full scrutiny of the Senate. 
The outcome of the committee deliberations will influence our response to the regulations that could, if not properly handled, make significant changes to the slot management system at Kingsford Smith airport. In saying that, and as previously stated, Labor supports the bill and its intent. The devil is in the detail. The discussion paper released late yesterday and any regulations which might arise from the discussion paper and application of the act—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—Having listened to the speech by the member for Batman, I want to say that it is a great pity that he did not pay attention to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 itself. The detail is spelt out in the discussion paper that was released yesterday, the background paper on amendments to the Sydney airport slot management scheme. The details were fully provided for all aspects of the bill, including the aims and objectives. Yet the member for Batman spent the majority of time attacking, in a personal way, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who, in my view, has done an outstanding job and has brought this proposal to the House, something that was never achieved during 13 years of Labor. It is a significant achievement for regional Australia and in protecting the rights of those who live in regional Australia. Certainly there is nothing controversial in this bill. It is supported by regional Australia, by the airlines and by the passengers from regional Australia. 
The member for Batman wants yet another inquiry so he can grandstand on the issue. The fact is that he had 30 minutes to speak on the bill and to outline the details of it—to say why he saw the inadequacies. He was not able to do it. In fact, the key aspects that he brought forward were about the merger of Ansett and Hazelton and what the implications would be for this measure. The fact is that the provisions of this bill and the outline that was provided in the amendments to the slot system would protect the rights of regional Australia—would ensure that the travelling public would have its rights preserved in travelling to regional centres during peak times. 
I also noted that the member opposite did not actually spell out his position. He said that the decision by cabinet was a non-decision. But what about his position on the whole question of the second airport? Is he going to build it at Badgerys Creek if we are unfortunate enough that the Labor Party gets into government? That has not been spelt out. He might like to share his views with the member for Prospect, the member for Chifley and all those who have been protesting about the prospect of a second airport going in at Badgerys Creek. While he might come in here blandly and talk about non-decisions, the fact is that the cabinet made a very good decision in the light of the performance of Sydney airport, the projections of the requirements for traffic coming in and out of Sydney airport and the tourism potential for the airport. The decision is in line with community expectations and the preference of the tourism community, which would like to see the airport close to the CBD. 
The decision provides some possibilities that smaller aircraft can be moved out to Bankstown. That is in line with the appropriate use of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, to ensure that usage is maximised, that in the future smaller aircraft can be moved out to Bankstown. Of course, the rights of the existing operators who fly into Bankstown—the number of slot times allocated during peak hours—should be preserved. It is appropriate to recognise that. There was not one word on what this bill will mean for regional Australia. Forty per cent of aircraft that come into Sydney in peak times are from regional Australia. What the bill is saying to people in regional Australia is that they are not going to be given second preference and all be forced out of the airport. It means that the rights of those people are going to be preserved. They will not take second place to somebody who comes in from Narita airport or Seoul airport. Rather, the bill is saying that we will preserve those 40 per cent of slots that currently exist for regional aircraft. 
The bill goes further than that. It says that in the future additional slots are going to be capped so that we are not going to see a further growth. With deregulation of airline services in New South Wales, there has been a proliferation of new services around New South Wales, meaning smaller aircraft to more destinations. In one way that is a good thing, resulting in greater service to the consumer, but if it goes on at the same rate the ability to service international and interstate aircraft will be restricted. The bill is saying there is going to be a limit on the number of aircraft that will come in in the future. We are going to cap the number where it is and preserve the rights of regional Australia.
More than that, there is a priority given in the way slot times can be moved. If a merger between Ansett and Hazelton is approved, the bill says that, if slot times are swapped around, they cannot be moved more than half an hour. People cannot, by increment, phase out the regional airlines and give preference to interstate or international services. That is very appropriate. If the shadow minister, instead of giving all his rhetoric about the minister, had attempted to get to grips with the detail outlined in the bill on the management of slot times, he would have found that out. 
A further part of the proposal encourages larger aircraft to take additional slot times. Preference will be given to larger aircraft. The bill spells out the regime that relates to that. It says that additional slot times will not be accepted for aircraft that are under 18 seats in size. The reason for that, as we go through the different aspects of the bill, is to make sure that we do not see a situation like that at Heathrow airport. Sydney is a major international airport, with 67 per cent of all international visitors coming through Sydney. We recognise that the airport has to be utilised effectively. Aircraft with two or three people fly into Heathrow. It is ensured that there is maximum usage of the airport so that it can be used efficiently to the benefit of all those who live in London and the greater United Kingdom.
It is an appropriate way of going. It is encouraging larger aircraft route rationalisation, it encourages the smaller aircraft to go to Bankstown, but at the same time it preserves the rights of regional Australia. That is only appropriate. This bill in particular reaffirms the cap that currently exists at Sydney airport. No more than 80 movements an hour can be provided at Sydney airport. There is no attempt at increasing the cap; there is no attempt to remove the curfew. The member for Lowe is in the chamber. Like me, he has an electorate which is affected by aircraft noise. We are particularly interested in any attempt to change the curfew or the cap provisions. This bill does not in any way affect those things. In fact, because of this bill, we are going to ensure that regional parts of Australia are looked after both now and in the future. 
The document also looks at the current situation and the decisions that were made by cabinet—and appropriately so. It said that Sydney airport has shown itself, through the Olympics, to be performing very well. It reached all-time record highs in the number of passengers and the throughput that we saw during the Olympics, and it handled it extremely well. That is indicating that, from the projections we see, at least for the next 10 years, there is no need for additional capacity, especially if changes are made in relation to the use of Bankstown. That is appropriate. 
I was particularly pleased that there was a decision not to proceed with the concept of having an airport at Kurnell. I was pleased on heritage grounds, with the area being the birthplace of modern Australia; on environmental grounds, with it being a Ramsar site, because of the wetlands and the migratory birds from Siberia and Japan; and because of the national park surrounding the proposed site at Kurnell. I was pleased on community grounds: with a community of 2,500 people at Kurnell, it was inappropriate to have that situation. And I was pleased on operational grounds—not having one airport so close to another. The integration of that in the overall Sydney Basin would have been very difficult. On that basis, I was very pleased to see that cabinet decided not to proceed with the Kurnell proposal but, rather, to press on with the maximisation of the use of Kingsford Smith, which is so favoured by the tourism industry, which works so effectively, which is now linked by rail directly into the city, which performs extremely well. 
—Your contract!
—Certainly it was my contract, and one of which I am very proud. If the New South Wales government had performed in terms of its contract, it would be operating well today—no promotion, no new carriages. 
—When did you sign it?
—We signed it six months before the election, in about August before the election. That is in this House.
—Was John Fahey happy with that?
—He was absolutely happy. It was an excellent contract and, without that, we would not have a railway to the airport. I am very interested that the member for Dobell raises the question of railways and the New South Wales government, because I have seen the state Labor government announce this link from Parramatta across to Chatswood on no less than 10 separate occasions going back to the early 1990s. Here in 2001 what do they have? They have a truncated piece of railway, which again is going to be delayed. All these announcements have come to nought. There is no link between Parramatta and Chatswood at all—once again a failure. We promised we would deliver in terms of a railway to the airport. The New South Wales government did not live up to its contract: it did not provide new carriages and did not provide rolling stock which had baggage facilities and of course did not do any promotion of the service.
Returning to the main theme, Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport operates very well. It has excellent infrastructure. It is close to the CBD. This bill is about maximising the use of Kingsford Smith airport and, at the same time, ensuring that we preserve the rights of regional Australia. The people of regional Australia welcome that. Instead of the shadow minister coming in and congratulating the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who I believe is doing an excellent job—he is enormously respected around the rural community and in my electorate as well and is a very decent individual—this being the first time we have seen any bill protecting the rights of regional Australia and their access to Kingsford Smith airport, all we have from the shadow minister is a move to refer it off to a committee. There was no investigation at all of the proposals that come under this program.
This bill amends the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 to make part III of the Trade Practices Act subject to this act. This will ensure that we do not have some other legislation that will override the slot allocation proposal. The slot management scheme guarantees the slots for regional Australia. This bill does not pre-empt the issues raised in yesterday's discussion paper, nor does it make any changes to the slot management scheme. Any changes to the scheme are made by a disallowable instrument permitted by section 40 of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997. So that will be taken care of separately. 
The discussion paper is out. People understand the provisions. The paper gives examples of possible changes if a new airline comes in, in that they can be allocated slots out of those slots that have been returned. It spells out the preferences that are given to larger aircraft. It spells out the requirement that new allocations have to be for aircraft over 18 seats in size. It preserves the rights of the peak time allocation so that airlines cannot marginalise the time at which regional aircraft come in and simply move it to another time which is in a non-peak period by specifying that any swaps with the airline must be in the time frame of one hour. That is, you can swap it only by a margin of half an hour. This is an effective way of solving the problems of our aviation needs.  
The government has clearly said that in 2005 it will look again at the growth of airline traffic and the requirements. International traffic to Australia continues to grow significantly. The former Minister for Tourism, who is the shadow minister at the table, would be well aware of the success of tourism to this country, which has been supported on a bipartisan basis. During the time he was minister he saw a growth in tourism numbers to this country. We have come from having half a million international visitors in 1975 to the situation where we had just on five million international visitors in 2000, and we expect some 5.4 million international visitors coming in this year. 
So the growth is there, which is very good news. As the number of visitors continues to pick up—from Great Britain, from the USA, again from Korea which has been involved in a slowdown, and from Japan—we can see that in the longer term we will need to look at the requirements of additional capacity. But, in the interim—for at least the next 10 years—Sydney airport will work very well.
This is about the operational requirements of managing Sydney airport, of managing smaller aircraft, of providing a real incentive for the airlines to get larger aircraft, of servicing regional Australia, of rationalising the routes and, of course, about guaranteeing the rights of regional Australia. We are ensuring that the cap is preserved, that the curfew is preserved and that the rights of those who are impacted by noise are preserved. Of course, in an electorate which has, at this stage, 53 per cent of all aircraft takeoffs and landings over it—and in the future it is expected to rise to 55 per cent—we are very conscious of increased aircraft movement. I have not received any complaints about this aspect of the provisions of regional aircraft in and out of Kingsford Smith. It is not an issue on which the members of my electorate have expressed concern, but they recognise the rights of their rural brethren and that we need to be cognisant of their needs and that we need to give them parity with those who come from international ports. It is appropriate that we recognise the benefits of international tourism and that we do our best to make sure that Sydney operates at its maximum potential so that we can enjoy the economic benefits of international tourism. As part of that and as part of maximising Kingsford Smith's usage, the way in which slot times are to be managed is highly appropriate.
I personally support this bill very highly. I commend the minister for the effort that has been put into it and the people involved in its administration. It is an effective way of managing it; it is an innovative way of handling it. I cannot understand why the shadow minister would want an inquiry since it has already been canvassed with the airlines and with consumer groups. It ensures the rights and the existing slot times of the regional aircraft that are using the airport and it looks for new entrants into the market and looks to how their rights can be preserved, at the same time ensuring that we see larger aircraft used for rationalisation on regional services. That is also appropriate.
In the absence of the shadow minister's plan of how he would solve the problem, it is very difficult to see that he has much credibility. He says that we have no plan but he comes into this House with no plans of his own in terms of a second airport, despite the fact that he criticises the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. If he does not plan to build Badgerys Creek, he should come out and say so; if he does, he should let the people who are in the seats around the Badgerys Creek location know what his plans are. He should not try to play one off against the other. Criticising the minister when he is trying to maximise Kingsford Smith airport and preserve the rights of regional Australia at the same time does not indicate how he plans to solve the problem. He can have an inquiry but that does not solve it. The minister for transport has come up with a realistic proposal. I commend the minister and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—The government makes great play that the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 is all about guaranteeing regional access for aircraft to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. If that were all this bill were meant to be, we would have no worries about this legislation. However, I am deeply concerned that this bill is all about ratifying the government's new airport policy that was announced on 13 December 2000 to maximise—as the member for Cook has just said—Kingsford Smith airport and also expand Bankstown Airport so that they do not have to build a second airport for Sydney for another 10 to 20 years. I am deeply concerned that the discussion paper associated with this legislation was released only late yesterday and I have not yet had the opportunity to see it. It is timely to remind this House of the words of the member for Gippsland and Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, the Hon. Peter McGauran, when he gave the second reading speech on this bill on 8 March this year. He said: 
The government's policy on Sydney's future airport needs will enable Sydney and Australia to benefit from the growth of air travel, while still protecting local residents and regional New South Wales.
That statement by the member for Gippsland was made in contrast to the actual provisions of the bill. In my view, however, the provisions of the bill are a disaster waiting to happen for the people of Sydney in terms of aircraft noise and air safety. This bill contains provisions that fundamentally alter the management of aircraft movements at Sydney airport. The proposed government amendments are so serious, in my view, that I must voice my concerns on behalf of my constituents that this legislation could result in a marked increase in aircraft noise throughout Sydney and, in particular, my electorate of Lowe. Additionally, these amendments, when combined with this government's announcement on 13 December 2000 to make Bankstown Airport an overflow airport, constitute one of the most irresponsible groups of decisions ever made by the government.
Before going into detail about my concerns, I foreshadow that, when the bill leaves this chamber, it will be referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee where the issues that I and my colleagues raise in this debate will be scrupulously examined. If our concerns are shared by that committee, the government can expect most of these amendments to be defeated in the Senate. I, too, wish to foreshadow that I reserve my right to make a submission to the Senate committee before the bill is settled in the other chamber.
The issues I wish to discuss tonight are: the redistribution of slots to the loudest, largest aircraft during peak periods; the impact on aircraft noise resulting from the slots redistribution; and the impact of these amendments on the ability of a person to challenge the allocation of slots to the ACCC, including the loss of right of appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal and the Federal Court. I must observe that this government has embraced the habit of proposing administrative remedies that are simply both brutal and draconian. When a policy trammels a person's rights, we see this government simply denying rights of appeal in the hands of aggrieved people by cutting off their rights absolutely. We see this approach in immigration law, by denying rights of appeal of whole classes of applicants to the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and we see it here tonight.
Let us not be fooled by any spin about how this bill guarantees regional access. Let us look at the bill itself. What does this bill do? The primary purpose of the bill is to override the provisions of part III of the Trade Practices Act. The relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act were specifically designed to protect a person's access to certain facilities with monopolistic characteristics. Airports are a prime example of such monopolistic practices. This government has sought to ensure that the allocation of slots are protected from possible legal action by a person aggrieved by such allocations by way of application to the ACCC or ACT or on appeal to the Federal Court to have the services declared. 
The very intent of this bill derides the legal protection of the Trade Practices Act by denying the statutory effect of part III on those relying on regional access. And why is the government doing this? The answer is, again, to prepare Sydney airport to be sold, alone, at the highest price it can get. The purpose is to increase the capacity of Sydney airport to its absolute maximum by ensuring that the largest, loudest, bulkiest and dirtiest planes fly over the roofs of Sydney's residential areas during so-called peak periods, which translates to meaning mornings from six to nine and evenings from seven to 11, seven days a week. How could the government possibly come to the decision it has?
I refer to the coalition government's aviation policy dated 13 February 1996 titled `Soaring into tomorrow'. Did the coalition not say, at page 10:
Special slots will be set aside for regional airlines, to guarantee that residents of country New South Wales will continue to have convenient access to Sydney Airport.
Did the coalition not say, at page 14, under the title `Sydney and Sydney West Airport':
We have announced that we will not lease Sydney Airport and Sydney West Airport until there is a satisfactory solution to the current aircraft noise problem in Sydney. The leasing process will be deferred until two conditions are met: the east west runway is reopened; and a genuine environmental impact statement on Sydney West Airport is completed.
Of course, one may be forgiven for thinking that part of the solution in solving Sydney's noise problems means the reopening of the east-west runway and that this runway will remain open. However, this is not apparently so. A review of the sequence of events will reveal the treachery this government has perpetrated on the residents of Sydney.
I first turn to the government's announcement of 13 December 2000. This announcement states that Sydney airport is to expand and that Bankstown Airport is to be an overflow airport. A cursory glance of the proximity of Bankstown and Sydney airports immediately leads to the conclusion that the airports are too close to each other and that, at a minimum, Sydney airport's east-west runway must be closed. Therefore, the 13 December 2000 announcement fundamentally compromises this government's policy. The effect of the 13 December 2000 announcement is a deception. The announcement is designed to give the misleading impression that the government has abandoned the official site of Sydney West airport—that is, Badgerys Creek. The government has done that in a cynical attempt to alleviate an inevitable voter backlash in currently Liberal Party held seats in the west of Sydney by attempting to dishonestly delude voters there that Badgerys Creek is no longer to be considered as the site for Sydney West airport.
In fact, nothing of the sort is true. The Sydney West airport proposal was put by the minister for transport in 1996 from a two-airport site selection process which included the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy sites. The then Commonwealth minister for the environment, exercising his administrative powers, declared that an environmental impact statement was required for this proposal, and in 1997 a supplementary EIS was also required by the minister. To prepare this EIS, PPK Environment and Infrastructure were retained by the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Development to perform this EIS on these two sites alone.
This is to be compared with the Sydney airport site selection program draft environmental impact statement of April 1985 undertaken by consultants Kinhill Stearns. In comparison with the PPK brief, Kinhill Stearns were required to examine a short list of 10 sites from a list of 106 possible sites that were investigated. It is interesting to note that the Kinhill Stearns report, `the MANS', in turn cites Badgerys Creek and Scheyville as the two short-listed sites for Sydney's second airport, whilst on cost-benefit analysis Darkes Forest comes first. To this day it is curious why this government considers Holsworthy in the 1996 EIS at all. A cynical but predictable answer is that Holsworthy was a $5 million decoy, a red herring. It was widely held that Holsworthy would never be a feasible site for Sydney's second airport. The PPK EIS was no contest. 
It is well known that the PPK EIS was fundamentally flawed from the outset, because it pitted Badgerys Creek, a site that came fourth out of 10 in the 1985 site selection process, against Holsworthy, which came ninth out of a 10-site selection process. With the elimination of Holsworthy from the selection process, the government made the decision that the Sydney West airport site would be Badgerys Creek. To this day, Badgerys Creek is the official site for the proposal known as Sydney West airport. The Kinhill Stearns EIS was a true EIS, in that it exhaustively and probatively dealt with the issue of site selection in a way that the PPK EIS was fundamentally denied from performing. Indeed, one of the main criticisms of the PPK EIS is that it was precluded from consideration of other site options or a `no airport' scenario. This summary is needed to explain the present circumstances of this bill. This bill destroys everything that this government said it was going to do.
Like any other bill, this proposed legislation cannot be read in isolation. The broader existing legislation must be brought to bear in order to understand the totality of the impact of this legislation. I first turn to the Airports Act 1996. I have spoken previously on the existing provisions of section 18 of this act dealing with the sale of Sydney airport alone. I also have outstanding questions on the Notice Paper about this issue. I remind this House of the provisions of section 18, which states that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West airport are to be under common ownership and that under subsection 18(1):
The Commonwealth must not grant an airport lease under section 13 of this Act, or under section 22 of the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996, for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport or Sydney West Airport unless each of the airport-lessee companies is a subsidiary of the same company.
We have no Sydney West airport. The reality is that, if this government goes ahead with the lease of Sydney airport at this time, the people of Sydney will be totally dependent on the terms of the lease to prescribe what powers, if any, the government will have as lessor for the choice, location and construction of Sydney West airport. The fundamental commercial and environmental risk here is that the lessee may rely on the contract to reject any nominated site for the location of Sydney West airport. The lessee may simply say `No. For the duration of the 50-year lease, I will not build Sydney West airport'. It is not inconceivable to consider such a scenario.
It is truly appalling to read the material provisions of this bill. This bill seeks to deny administrative remedy to operators of regionally affected aircraft movements who are aggrieved about slot allocations; to ensure that the largest, loudest, bulkiest and dirtiest aircraft fly over Sydney residential areas during airport peak hours by virtue of the new slot management system; in collusion with the provisions of the Airports Act 1996, to ensure the worst possible scenario of an ever expanding Sydney airport, with the loudest, largest and dirtiest planes being given express statutory priority over any other regional aircraft; and at the same time, to ensure Badgerys Creek remains the officially designated Sydney West airport, notwithstanding how the government has attempted to mislead us about that site and the intended use of Bankstown Airport
In reality, the situation is more accurately described thus: Bankstown airport is being converted into an airport that will attract the highest selling price by being considered a regional airport—an overflow airport for Sydney. This intended use is a purpose that was never contemplated in its original form. No EIS has been mooted or considered for the intended use of Bankstown airport, notwithstanding the overwhelming necessity for an EIS under the iron rule that there is an obvious change of land use being considered in the government's 13 December 2000 announcement. Sydney airport is also being fattened for the kill through this bill in the allocation of the largest possible aircraft to maximise throughput and therefore profitability. Badgerys Creek, despite this government's rhetoric and bold announcements, remains thoroughly intact and ready to go. 
The reality is that this government has sought to deceive the public at every step of the way in its intended actions. This government has made every possible effort to obfuscate the real intention of its planning and sale agenda in ensuring that the following occurs. Sydney airport is to be expanded to the point where its capacity is so great as to maximise its sale price. The same is also true for Bankstown airport, and Badgerys Creek site remains very much intact for imminent development and construction of a 24-hour international airport. I am conscious of the cynics who attempt to say that Badgerys Creek is only supposed to be a single-runway airport and who rely on schematics in the PPK report that show stage 1 development in any of the three options as having only one runway. The Badgerys Creek proposal is a minimum three-runway proposal and more runways may be added later. Badgerys Creek airport was always supposed to be the second and major airport for Sydney, eventually surpassing Sydney's air traffic movements. Bankstown can never fulfil the task.
Residents potentially affected by Badgerys Creek can take no comfort at all in this government's decision. I rely heavily on the great wisdom of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee in restoring balance to this bill, for the government in this House has seriously betrayed the people of Sydney on this matter of aircraft noise and air safety. The proximity of Bankstown and Sydney airports makes a mockery of the various air safety provisions and the statutory obligations of Airservices Australia. The effect of this bill will be that the slots manager will be requested to draft amendments to the slot management scheme—a disallowable instrument made in 1998. The proposed amendments may be made either by way of amendment to the existing SMS or by way of a brand new slot management system. Either way, the existence of the new slot management system heralds a dark day for the issues of aircraft noise and air safety.
Throughout my first term of office in this House, I persistently called for the implementation of the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith airport, for the reaching of aircraft movement forecasts of 17 per cent to the north—which affects my electorate of Lowe, from Drummoyne in the east to Homebush in the west—and for the implementation of respite periods of no aircraft noise. It was this government that gazetted the long-term operating plan, yet this government has systematically done everything in its power to pander to the vested interests of Sydney airport by denying the operation of the long-term operating plan through the implementation of the precision runway monitor system which restores parallel runway operations. This bill, together with the 13 December 2000 announcement on Bankstown and Sydney airports, heralds the collapse of the long-term operating plan because the long-term operating plan cannot exist under this regime. Further, any attempt to do so in the future will result in the overriding imperatives of commercial interests that will make the implementation of noise sharing impossible to achieve.
Very simply, if this bill is passed in the Senate in its present form, the result will be an irreversible situation where the loudest, dirtiest planes will fly in parallel operations over the most densely populated portions of Sydney. I cannot permit this to the conclusion reached today. I have already spoken with my parliamentary colleagues at length on this matter and there is agreement that this bill in its present form must be scrupulously scrutinised by the Senate committee to accommodate the environmental impacts foreshadowed within it. I urge the Senate to consider the amendments to the bill in denying the passage of the material provisions dealing with the amendments to the slots. For all reasonable purposes, Sydney airport reached its capacity long ago. To attempt to squeeze more utility out of Sydney airport is a morally irresponsible thing to do. Sydney airport must be capped, its movements must be limited and its operations preserved. 
The construction of Sydney West airport was an issue which the Labor Party received much criticism for when we were in power. We were chastised by the then opposition that in May 1996 said:
What had happened—
about building an airport at Badgerys Creek—
by June 1995? Absolutely and utterly nothing. Not a sod had been turned, not a runway had been built and not a building had been constructed on the site that was supposed to be an operating airport by June 1995.
Here tonight we can say exactly the same of the coalition. But they have done far more than we ever could in doing nothing. Not one sod has been turned, not one runway has been built and not one building has been constructed. No, this government has presented itself as the prophet of hope. It promised to solve the Sydney aircraft noise problem, and failed. It promised not to lease Sydney airport until Sydney's problems were solved, and failed. It promised to build Sydney West airport, and failed. It promised to implement the long-term operating plan, and failed. It promised deferral of the lease of Sydney airport until an EIS on Sydney West airport was completed. Yes, it did an EIS but failed to deliver on the outcomes. In any event, the EIS was fundamentally flawed. In its place, we have an announcement that defies reason, precedent or probative decision making. This is a decision of capriciousness and high-handed disregard for policy making, as the government attempts a 180-degree turnaround on what was promised. There cannot be a more comprehensive example of a government saying one thing whilst doing another.
I call upon the Senate to assist in the cause of reason in preventing this bill being passed. I look to the Senate to move amendments consistent with the sentiments expressed in my speech tonight in the hope that the collective wisdom can be accommodated in changes to this bill as it currently stands. I note from the Bills Digest No. 109 that there is a sense of urgency in passing this legislation so that the slot management system can be amended before the airline timetables for the northern winter 2001 scheduling season need to be settled.
It is horrifying to think that this proposed legislation is being pushed through with such lightning speed in time to suit mere commercial interests when there is so much at stake regarding our domestic environmental issues, including noise and other emissions, and air safety. I believe the people of Sydney are going to feel the impact of this bill if it goes through the Senate in its present form. The decisions today could have irrevocable consequences for the people of Sydney who will have to suffer this decision for many years.
You have heard first hand from a senior member of the government, the member for Cook, who spoke before me, and he made great play—I will give him credit for his honesty—of the fact that this bill is all about maximising the expansion of Sydney airport. The member for North Sydney, who really knows a lot about aircraft noise because he chaired the Sydney Airport Community Forum, would understand better than most in this chamber that this bill is all about maximising Sydney and Bankstown airports because the government is going to sell the airports. Worse, Sydney airport is going to be sold without contemporaneously the owner of that 50-year lease being required to build Sydney West airport.
This government hammered us prior to the 1996 election because of the noise that was created when the parallel runways were introduced. We will accept the flack for that, but we have been trying to do something about it. The government, before the 1996 election, promised that they would do something about it and give relief to the residents of Sydney. They have been dishonest. They are not doing anything about Sydney airport. Maximising Sydney airport is all about putting those huge 747s into Kingsford Smith airport, and the member for North Sydney knows exactly what I am talking about. If the number of smaller planes is capped, they will be moved out to Bankstown Airport to free up the slots for the big 747s that are going to cause unbearable noise for the residents of my electorate of Lowe, for all the residents of the inner west and, of course for the residents in your seat of North Sydney, Minister. You understand this very well. I will give you credit for exposing the dishonesty of Airservices Australia when you were on the Sydney Airport Community Forum, but we have to do something to get rid of these big 747s. We have had a gutful of them in Lowe and in Sydney. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—I know the member for Lowe and hoped that he was not going to take off just then. I have seen lots of gesticulation in this place over the time that I have been here, but I think that was the best interpretation I have seen of a large jet. However, I have to say that it may well have been a Dash 8. The member for Lowe's actions were most interesting and certainly entertaining.
I rise tonight to support the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 for a number of reasons which I am going to enjoy getting into because, over the short period of the time that I have been here since that great day in October 1998, one of the great concerns that I, coming from regional New South Wales, have had is to have guaranteed access to Kingsford Smith airport. I will talk more about that in a moment.
The major part of this bill is to amend the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 to allow the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport slot management scheme to be amended to allow slots to be allocated on the basis of specified categories of aircraft or service types; for example, large capacity aircraft or intercapital or international services. It also provides that Part IIIA—Access to services—of the Trade Practices Act 1974 only has effect subject to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act.
On 13 December last year the government announced its decision on the question of a second major airport for Sydney. It also flagged at the same time that it would amend the existing slot management scheme for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to encourage the use of larger aircraft while maintaining access to regional airlines.
Many of us from regional New South Wales have stood in this House and brought to the House's attention the importance of country people having access to the gateway to the rest of the nation. I come from the electorate of New England, where I have four regional airports, the first being in Tamworth which services a regional city and surrounds of some 50,000 people that is about a one-hour flight from Sydney. It is serviced very well by Eastern Airlines, which is part of the Qantas group, which also have facilities in Tamworth for servicing their aircraft and are looking to do some very exciting things there. It is also serviced by Hazelton directly into Sydney and serviced by Impulse Airlines as well. These provide the business people of the Tamworth region with tremendous access directly into Sydney airport.
One of the issues that has been raised over the period of time that we have been debating this is how we actually put in place a mechanism that guarantees slots for regional airlines so that, if there are later on, for example, takeovers of airlines, those slots should not be traded; they should not be lost to a regional airline and they should in fact stay with the regional airline rather than getting shifted off to some international or interstate group. What is contained in this bill is providing that degree of guarantee.
I know that there is an issue of noise in Sydney. In the early seventies and sixties, I lived and worked for many years under the flight paths into Sydney. I was even under the flight paths when some of the very noisy planes, particularly the first of the international jets, used to operate into Sydney. When I go down there now and look at the new generation of jumbo jet that the member for Lowe was talking about, I find that, while it may be powerful, it certainly is not dirty and it certainly is not noisy by comparison with those planes of 10, 15 or 20 years ago. I often talk with people on the northern side of Sydney on the approach routes to the airport. I have watched and listened and have been in awe of some of the jumbos that do come in and I have wondered where the noise was. The same happens with our regional airlines, particularly with the Dash 8 making its access into Sydney. As a frequent passenger on board those services both out of Tamworth and Armidale, I find the new generations of those planes are certainly nowhere near as noisy as before. 
The amendments contained in the bill cap the number of regional slots allocated in peak periods at its current level. That is a good positive step in the right direction. Many of us who come to Canberra on the new Dash 8 service, a 50 seater, know the importance of the size of that plane. I am sure that, as the market increases, we will see larger aircraft being introduced on the regional air routes into Sydney in particular. The bill establishes a minimum aircraft seat limit for allocation of new slots to be determined in consultation with the industry. There is no doubt that the services out of Armidale and Tamworth in particular, which serve my electorate, and those out of Wagga Wagga in the Riverina electorate are of a reasonable size—they are all around 36 seats. The SAAB that comes out of there is a 36-seat plane and provides a tremendous service. It removes any risk that the major airlines can avoid the regional guarantee by migrating the regional slots held by their affiliates to non-peak areas.
As I mentioned earlier, my electorate is serviced very well by Hazelton, Eastern and Impulse airlines, with very good services out of Tamworth and Armidale. There is a very good service out of Inverell and Glen Innes, major regional cities in my electorate. They are serviced by the Beechcraft aircraft—a very quick aircraft—flying direct into Sydney. It provides an opportunity for business people to get to the central business district of Sydney or indeed to go into the metropolitan areas, to do their business and catch a night plane home. It is very important that business people who live in regional New South Wales have direct access to our capital city—it is our capital city as much as it is everybody else's in New South Wales—to do their business in one day.
I also add to that the importance of timing. To be able to get your slots at the right times is important. For example, if I am coming to Canberra, I am able to got into Sydney where quite often I have a meeting at Sydney airport, which is close to the business centre, catch another plane to Canberra, do business in Canberra, get back to Sydney, often with an hour between planes, have another meeting and then return home. You can do that only if you get the early flights and have access to Kingsford Smith airport in the morning. I fly out of Armidale a lot. The 6.30 a.m. plane gets into Sydney at 7.35 a.m., which is a good time. It would be of great concern to country New South Wales if you were not able to access Sydney at that time and you could get there only at 10 o'clock, 10.30 a.m or 11 o'clock.
—Absolutely. Imagine having to go to Bankstown and then have a meeting.
—Exactly. The member for Riverina raises a good point. We will talk about Bankstown in a moment. The issue is that we needed to have a guarantee of slots. My colleague and electoral neighbour, the member for Gwydir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson, is also very aware of the necessity to have access to Kingsford Smith airport. He continued to raise the issue here—as we did with him and as did our business community and our travelling public community—to have a guarantee of slots. He said he would provide that guarantee. That guarantee is contained in this bill.
What has happened over the last 12 months or two years has been a concerted effort by people on the other side who live in regional areas in country New South Wales and who do not understand a lot about the necessity of business. They started a campaign to undermine our access to Kingsford Smith airport. The mob over there were running a counter-argument out there in the public arena, saying that John Anderson could not deliver a guarantee for regional airlines in New South Wales to have access to Kingsford Smith. This bill delivers it. He said in Mudgee that he would provide access absolutely to Kingsford Smith airport, and I am pleased to say that he has. I take the opportunity to congratulate Minister John Anderson on delivering for country New South Wales people, because they needed that assurance. I will be able to go back—as I have done—to my chambers of commerce, to my business groups, to the travelling public, and say to them that they now have guaranteed access into Kingsford Smith airport.  
It is important for us who live in country New South Wales to have access to the city of Sydney. It is equally important that we are able to have access back to the country for those that come and do business in the country, for tourists who want to come, for example, to beautiful New England to spend some time, to attend the university or to do business. We have to provide that access for business professionals who quite often come out of the city—the surgeons, the doctors—
—The visiting lecturers.
—The visiting lecturers, as the member for Mallee mentions. Those business people who actually want to come up and see other business people. They also have to have access. They also have to have an ability to do their business in a day and get back to Sydney. What we have now is a situation that provides that. It provides that access for country New South Wales people who want to come to Sydney, to have access to Sydney, and it provides those in Sydney who wish to come up with access to country areas.
We are seeing a dramatic change in the airline service industry, and I think a welcome change. We are seeing much more efficient and effective aircraft that are flying on these routes. We have a great service into Brisbane airport, particularly out of Armidale, Tamworth, Inverell and Glen Innes. That is a very good service that leaves early in the morning, gets into Brisbane and is able to service again the business people that come. But the services are changing dramatically. To give the House some indication of that, I was in Tamworth the other day and had to come to Canberra. I was able to fly Impulse in one of their new Beechcraft. On that service, I flew from Tamworth to Newcastle and then direct from Newcastle to Canberra. That made an enormous amount of sense. People were trading and doing business. Instead of coming back that way, I was able to come back knowing that I could get out of Sydney at peak time, knowing that the 705 Eastern flight out of Sydney back to Armidale was going to get me back into my regional airport at about quarter past eight at night. 
I have a couple of comments to make regarding the issue of aircraft noise before I close. Where does the capacity for an airport lie? Where does the capacity to build a new airport and demand for a new airport come from? As a frequent flyer into Sydney airport at all times of the day, and night for that matter, you do notice this change in the quality of the aircraft and the noise levels. In many places around country Australia, people often buy a house near a tip. Quite often they buy that house near the tip because it is affordable, because it is less expensive than buying one somewhere else. Then they start a program of endeavouring to get onto the council to get the tip moved. I have come across this first hand. I have noticed people who have purchased a home near something that is questionable and have raised the issue of trying to get the tip shut rather than accept the fact that one of the reasons the price of a home was lower was the fact that it was near the tip.
I do not think Sydney airport has reached its full potential. I do not think it has reached its full movements. I notice here in the `Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 maximum movement limit report' that the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act establishes a cap of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport. I understand that, in other airports in other parts of the world, the cap is substantially more than that. At Heathrow, and I stand to be corrected, you are looking at something in the vicinity of 130 movements per hour. We have a responsibility as the government to ensure that the assets of the government are used to the best advantage.  
Listening to the member for Lowe, who raised the issue of the capacity of the airport, Sydney airport has some way to go. With the increase in the size of the aircraft that are flying in, particularly from the regional parts, there is a great deal of potential for a growth in New South Wales tourism numbers, a growth in business numbers that are able to access Kingsford Smith, and, from a regional New South Wales point of view, a growth in people moving out of Sydney and visiting and doing business in the country. I commend the minister for the bill and for enabling the guarantee of access to Kingsford Smith airport for regional New South Wales. I thank him for that. I am able to go back to my electorate of New England now and make sure that people are aware of the fact that this government has brought in an amendment bill to guarantee access to Kingsford Smith airport.",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—Listening to speakers from the coalition discuss this Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 and now listening to the member for New England make some initial and concluding comments about noise, the clear message and slogan for all of those people in the seat of Bennelong, for all those people in the seat of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, for all people in Sydney who are impacted upon by aircraft noise, international jets—747s, 737s and 767s—that run into that airport, and for all those people who would be affected by the new wider bodied, bigger aircraft bringing more than 550 passengers into Australia, is very simple: `Don't worry, be happy,' because the aircraft noise really is not very much to worry about. If that were truly the case, the member for Bennelong would not have taken action to bring in a completely new set of arrangements for Kingsford Smith airport so that the Bennelong funnel would no longer operate. Of course, maybe the member for New England is pointing to the fact that the Prime Minister will now be happy to have precision radar management operate at Kingsford Smith airport, for the east-west runway to close down, despite the fact that the government opened it up, for the operation in Kingsford Smith airport to be on the parallel runways, and for those operations to be running directly over the top of Hunters Hill and impacting upon the 5.8 per cent margin that the Prime Minister has. That is news for the Prime Minister and, of course, that impacts directly on North Sydney as well. That is why, as a former member of the Sydney airport forum, the minister has argued that there should be a different approach to it. One would hope that the insensitivity of the remarks about the impact of airport noise are not really held more widely within the coalition.
The bill we are dealing with today is a consequence of a series of decisions that have been made. First, it is amending a 1997 bill to deal with the introduction of slot management at Kingsford Smith airport. But it is also a consequence of decisions announced by the cabinet on 13 December 2000, decisions that directly impact adversely on the future amenity of people in my electorate of Blaxland and surrounding electorates, including the electorate of Lowe, ably represented by Mr John Murphy. That electorate, and the electorates of Fowler and Banks, and a swag of other electorates have been threatened by the future use of Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport. The government has determined that jets such as 737s should be running into that airport. This is consequential upon the decisions taken on 13 December, but the context is even greater than that. It is greater because it deals with the issue of a second airport for Sydney. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, you know and everyone else who has dealt with this issue knows, that this issue has run for decades. This government promised, when they came into power in 1996, to fix it. We know that, in 1997 when there had been no final decision—three years ago—when the slot management scheme was introduced the former minister, Mr Vaile, said:
But you can rest assured that this government will deliver on alleviating the problems as far as a second airport in the Sydney basin is concerned. We will not be vacillating on this the way the Labor Party has done. 
He continues in that vein:
We will not muck about and wait for 13 years to pander to different interests in some of our electorates, as we have seen happen around KSA. We will get on with the job so there is certainty in what is going to happen in aviation in Australia.
Absolutely extraordinary words. Let me read part of them again:
... we will not pander to different interests in some of our electorates...
That is news to the member for Lindsay, it is news to the member for Macquarie, and it is news to the member for Macarthur because the whole decision taken on 13 December was pandering to the interests of coalition members who were perceived to have trouble with a second airport issue. Instead of a decision, what we got at the end of a $14 million process which produced an environmental impact study—that Labor said had to happen before any decision was made on a second airport for Sydney—and after another $5 million was spent to consider Holsworthy airport, was an enormous tome, but just one of five volumes. This is the Environmental Impact Statement, Second Airport Proposal, Volume 3: Supplement, just one of five. I have read it and other members have read it. It is detailed and considered. Preceding it was a draft environmental impact statement. That gave us some clues about where this decision making process might go. This five volume result was considered by the government. For people who could not handle the five volumes or even this supplementary volume there was, of course, a summary that detailed the arguments put forward by the people looking at this.
Instead of a decision based on the $19 million or $20 million spent on an environmental impact statement, all we have got is this slot management amendment bill—and it is the first bit of legislation we have seen following the announcement made by the government on 13 December. That announcement by the government on 13 December amounts to two things. The first is that the message for anyone who lives in Sydney is that Kingsford Smith airport will be expanded in the future and it will take a greater volume of passengers. The government's hope is that that volume of passengers will, over time, be in increasingly larger aircraft. The slot management amendment bill goes directly to imposing that. We will get larger aircraft with more people in them to replace smaller aircraft with fewer people in them. The second thing that the government said is utterly extraordinary. Although there was an indication of it a year before, no-one could really believe that the minister in his press release said:
The government has decided to make Bankstown Airport available as an overflow airport for Sydney.
The people in my electorate were astonished: they know how busy Bankstown is as a general aviation airport. They could not believe that he said: 
The sale conditions ... will encourage the operator to upgrade the airport so it will operate as an overflow for Sydney Airport and, in time, become an attractive alternative for some airline services. The operator will be encouraged to extend the main runway so it can handle jet aircraft and build a new passenger terminal, subject to the completion of the necessary environmental assessments. There will be no pricing restrictions at Bankstown. 
Why is that? It is so the overflow aspects can be dealt with, to push regional aircraft to Bankstown—push and pull them by encouraging them on price and push them by the operation of this amendment bill which, although it guarantees regional slots, has the mechanism over time to convert permanent regional slots into slots for interstate and international aircraft. That is the key to what this bill is about. It is not about preserving slots for regional aircraft at Kingsford Smith; it is about translating them over time to Bankstown Airport through the mechanism of this bill, unless they increase the capacity of their aircraft and maintain their services. He further said about Bankstown Airport—and this is also unbelievable:
The airport will not be capable of handling large jet aircraft such as 747s. 
We can but breathe a sigh of relief in Bankstown. The government is so gracious and the minister is so good, he will not impose 747s on us because Bankstown is not big enough to handle them. Well, thank heavens for that. But with the 737s—yes, big, loud, noisy—the government has said that Bankstown can have them. It has also said that 767s might be able to go there. They are pretty big, but it is saying that perhaps the overflow of those could go to Bankstown as well. He finished by saying:
The Bankstown Airport airspace will be upgraded and operations in the area will be controlled more tightly.
On behalf of the electors of Blaxland, and on behalf of people in the surrounding electorates held by Labor members, we utterly condemn the decision of 13 December 2000 to designate Bankstown as an overflow airport for Kingsford Smith. We reject the notion that jets such as 737s and 767s, and other regular passenger jet services, should be forced over or encouraged into Bankstown Airport. We will not have a bar of that. It is a ludicrous situation to argue that Kingsford Smith, the jet airport in Sydney, should be replaced in some part by Bankstown, less than 18 kilometres from it.
We also reject the notion that Bankstown should become the regional hub for all regional services in New South Wales. The bill we are dealing with today is supposed to be about slot management to guarantee access for regional aircraft in New South Wales at Kingsford Smith airport. This is a sop to regional New South Wales to say, `We have delivered, don't worry about it. For ever and a day you can be sure that your regional aircraft will go in there.'
What are the provisions in relation to new slots? The discussion paper which came out just yesterday has indicated that the minimum seat arrangement would be an 18-seat aircraft. We thought that they would be arguing something greater than that. The bill that we are dealing with today is very flimsy. The explanatory memorandum runs to less than half a page and the bill itself runs to only about two pages. The material in it will in fact be overridden. All this bill does is provide some kind of legislative coating. The discussion paper that I got today says, `Don't worry about what is in the bill because it will not override the discussion paper.' We should add to that: don't worry about what is in the discussion paper because it will be overridden by the regulations that the minister will bring in in a month's time or so. Given that they have been so slow in handling all of these matters, they may take a lot longer. But the key element here is that we are not dealing with all of the facts. Almost all of the facts and almost all of the ramifications of these changes to slot management will not be dealt with in this legislation or even in the discussion paper but in the regulations that will come out, no doubt on the day after the discussion period has finished. So I entirely support the shadow minister's decision to refer this to the appropriate Senate committee to tease out what the reality is of this legislation.
I want to say a couple of things about the current slots and what is provided for in relation to those current slots. We know that the 13 December material put out by the minister gave an indication of what the future was supposed to be like, and Mr McGauran's second reading speech in this House also detailed what this legislation was supposed to be about. This government is very economical, because Mr McGauran's speech is virtually word for word Mr Anderson's press release of 27 March on the discussion paper—they are at one. I might just point out, of course, that they are at one with the 13 December press release. So the government is very tidy and very economical in actually explaining things and getting down to detail!
The supposed intent of this bill is to guarantee regional access. Let us look at what they are really proposing. Firstly, they will cap the number of regional slots allocated in peak periods at the current level. What does that mean? Yes, they will put a limit on them. Previously, there was no limit. But they say they will put a limit on them and guarantee that limit. Secondly, they say that they will encourage airlines to progressively introduce larger aircraft within those slots or for new slots. Thirdly, they will remove any risk that major airlines could avoid the regional guarantee by migrating regional slots used by their affiliates in non-peak periods. Fourthly, they will establish a minimum aircraft seat limit for allocating new slots to be determined in consultation with the industry. We know now that that is supposed to be—at least in the discussion paper—an 18-seat minimum, but that could well change by the time we actually get to the conclusion of this process. 
The key thing with the slots that they are supposedly guaranteeing is that, if you do not use them, you lose them. So in a normal scheduling period—the framework that they use is a northern European summer and a northern European winter—if people who historically have services going into Kingsford Smith airport utilise their slots, they will establish in this next period their rights to those slots. If, however, because of economic pressure or because of other problems that they have, they are not able to use all or some of those slots, they will have to be given over to others. When they are given over to others, the preference is for other regional operators. But if those regional operators cannot take those slots—and we know that most regional operators are not located throughout the state but come from particular areas—the preference is then for interstate or international operators.
The way this slot management operates, if a regional operator has to give up his guaranteed slot, that preserved slot, that becomes a non-ring-fenced slot that is available first to other regionals. If they cannot take it up, and they probably will not be able to, it then goes to the biggest international aircraft coming into Kingsford Smith airport—because this slot management is about bigger is better and smaller just will not get a look in. The greater the capacity of the aircraft means that you get absolute priority as a result of this amendment bill to take any of those new slots. So we will see wide-bodied aircraft with 550 people coming in taking the priority, taking any of those new slots that are allowed, and progressively the capacity of the aircraft will work down. 
The government have chosen this approach to management of Kingsford Smith airport because they have got this blithe, nonchalant approach that everything is fine and wonderful, and don't worry, be happy. We had that from the member for New England in his speech. They say that Kingsford Smith airport is easily handling its transport problems in aviation. The minister at the table knows the reality, because he has been deeply embedded in looking at and understanding these issues for a very long time.
—And fighting for his constituents.
—And fighting for it; I will grant him that. He knows the reality. The argument that the government uses is that the Olympics period was wonderful and everything was okay and, because of that, it is really the way in which you have to look at Kingsford Smith airport and how it is coping. That is a completely and utterly false argument, because all we had during the Olympic period was a substitution of normal inbound tourism and business traffic with Olympic traffic. It is not a real test. Anyone who drove around the roads of Sydney during that period—we had not seen road conditions like it for 30 or 40 years—would know that it was an unreal time. 
The government's mechanism is this. Instead of determining the hard question for any government, instead of determining what they should do about the second airport for Sydney, they do three things. First, they flutter out a few lightweight press releases. Secondly, they determine to go to this slot management regime to increase the size of the aircraft and the number of people in them and to replace smaller aircraft and give priority to the greater. Thirdly, they mount an argument to say, `Let's try and convince everyone that all the excess will get flicked off to Bankstown Airport, Bankstown will have to take it and Bankstown will become a competitor to Kingsford Smith.' These lunatics who made this announcement on 13 December actually say that they want to see Bankstown Airport directly competing with Kingsford Smith in the provision of aircraft services to the people of New South Wales and Australia, effectively. This is crazy. A Boeing 737 rolls into Kingsford Smith airport and has not got a slot, they are a problem, they cannot get it in: `Oh, we will just flick it over to Bankstown.' There is absolutely zero infrastructure provided. There is not one word about road and rail connections and the hundreds of millions of dollars it would cost to provide that infrastructure—just the notion that if you are not lucky enough to get a slot and you are not in there then you are going to get flicked to Bankstown, or you will be encouraged there by the people who run the place.  
This is not sensible economic management. This is not proper governance. This is sloppy, bad and stupid. But it is also an attempt to hoodwink people. We know that these regional slots that are supposed to be guaranteed in this legislation will be under threat in the future from the interstate and international aircraft that have larger capacity. Any airline that gets into trouble will be in serious trouble in terms of determining this.

"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I rise to support the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 because it is an important and necessary measure to properly and fairly manage the movement of commercial aircraft in the sky above the greater Sydney metropolitan area. The legislation will be of considerable interest to those who live in the rural areas of New South Wales because it will guarantee that regional airlines will have direct access to Sydney airport, and this is the very least that those of our fellow Australians who live and work in regional areas of New South Wales deserve. 
This bill represents an issue in which many Sydneysiders may not take a great interest, but this bill will certainly be of acute interest to my constituents in Chipping Norton and Moorebank. I say that because this legislation will guarantee a specific number of slots for regional aircraft flying into Sydney and thereby make it all the less likely that there will be any overflow of regional aircraft that may have to fly into Bankstown Airport. For the record, Bankstown Airport is located on the northern bank of the Georges River, while the suburbs of Chipping Norton and Moorebank in my electorate of Hughes are located on the southern side.
While the management of air traffic over Sydney has been an ongoing concern for successive governments, it has become a very real concern for my constituents since the government announced a proposal on 13 December 2000 to upgrade Bankstown Airport and to allow large jets like Boeing 737s to operate out of Bankstown in about five to seven years time. I have taken every opportunity to make it clear to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services that any proposal to allow large jets like Boeing 737s to operate out of Bankstown Airport is totally unacceptable to me and to my constituents and we would utterly reject it. For those of us who know this area of Sydney very well, with its long-established high density residential development close to Bankstown Airport boundaries, such a proposal is clearly ill-advised and, indeed, fundamentally flawed.
One of the important reasons I support this bill is that the government has announced a proposal regarding large jets like 737s operating out of Bankstown Airport; also, this bill will strengthen the slot management scheme by ensuring that proposed amendments to the scheme at Sydney airport will not be subject to part 111A of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The government has confirmed its commitment to the existing regional operations at Sydney airport. The government will not alter the curfew, it will not alter the 80 movements per hour cap, nor the guaranteed slots for regional airlines.
However, the government intends to make four changes to the slot management scheme which will: firstly, cap the number of regional slots allocated in peak periods at current levels; secondly, encourage airlines progressively to introduce larger aircraft; thirdly, establish a minimum aircraft seat limit for allocating new slots, to be determined in consultation with industry; and, fourthly, remove any risk that the major airlines could avoid the regional guarantee by migrating the regional slots held by their affiliates into non-peak periods. I understand that the Department of Transport and Regional Services is releasing a discussion paper on these projected changes and I urge those residents who have an interest in this area to obtain a copy of the discussion paper and make their submission before the closing date of 27 April 2001. 
Mr Deputy Speaker, you will notice that schedule 1 of the bill now before the House will permit the slot management scheme to differentiate between specified categories of aircraft without fear of running against the provisions of part 111A of the Trade Practices Act. This bill will implement the government's policy to encourage the growth of air transport in Australia whilst at the same time protecting the rights of regional residents in New South Wales for direct access to Sydney airport.
To fully explain to my constituents, part 111A was included in the Trade Practices Act by the Competition Policy Reform Act 1975. This latter act was born out of the 1993 Hilmer report on competition policy. This legislation is necessary because it will override any potential conflict between the government policy of capping access to Sydney airport by regional aircraft and the Australian Competition Tribunal decision requiring the slot management scheme manager to negotiate with regional airlines to provide them with additional slots. By making part 111A subject to the provisions of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, the bill prevents this situation.
For the residents of my electorate who live in areas approximate to Bankstown Airport, this legislation guarantees access to Sydney airport by regional aircraft and thereby reduces the need for any overspill of regional aircraft flying into Bankstown. However, I have some very real problems with the government's proposal to allow large jets like Boeing 737s to fly into a small airport like Bankstown. For a start, there is residential development almost up to the boundary of Bankstown Airport, along Marion Street, and residential areas just across the Georges River in my electorate at Chipping Norton. Although residents in these areas bought their homes in full knowledge of the proximity of Bankstown Airport, their knowledge was that of a general aviation airport which catered for small training aircraft, occasional RAAF aircraft, occasional small regional passenger aircraft and small corporate jets. Imposing large jet aircraft like 737s is simply not on, and I seriously do not believe that such large jet aircraft will ever operate out of Bankstown.
I say this for several reasons. The first reason is implicitly tied up in this current bill. The government has moved to guarantee access to regional aircraft to Sydney airport by this very legislation. I am aware that the National Party reject any idea that residents in regional areas should be treated like second-class citizens and be denied the direct access to Sydney airport enjoyed by every other citizen in the state of New South Wales. I am also aware that the government has announced that the site of Badgerys Creek will be preserved for the future. We can all come to our own conclusions about why such a reservation is considered necessary. Thirdly, I am also aware, after discussions with a senior executive from Canberra airport, that Canberra airport is actively working to become a hub for regional aircraft and is aiming for its share of the regional market, especially those regional services in the southern half of the state. My constituents may like to know that Canberra airport, which is now privately owned and operated, is spending around $40 million on upgrading its facilities, including a business park and state-of-the-art executive facilities, to attract a significant sector of the regional airline market into Canberra. Quite frankly, I cannot see that there will be very much of an overspill of regional services flying into Sydney that will need to fly into Bankstown at any time. 
The airport at Bankstown has been in operation since 1940, when it was developed for use by the military during World War II. After the war, the airport became the centre for general aviation in Sydney. I do not have to remind my constituents—or anyone who has lived close to Bankstown Airport, for that matter—that this airport has been in a constant state of upgrade since the 1940s. Further, smaller regional aircraft have operated out of Bankstown in the past. For example, Tamair operated a service to Tamworth from Bankstown for some time before it moved to Sydney airport. Today, Bankstown Airport provides facilities for the operation of aircraft used for private flying, fixed and rotary wing flying training, and aerial work and charter flying. Organisations based at the airport also provide for the sale, repair and maintenance of aircraft, including restoration of historical and ex-military aircraft; often termed `warbirds'. Bankstown Airport is, in terms of annual aircraft movement, the busiest airport in Australia, having almost 400,000 aircraft movements a year. At the moment, there are no regular public transport operations into or out of Bankstown.
The term `regular public transport' means just that—transport on a regular basis. Bankstown Airport is not equipped for landing approaches under instrument conditions when the cloud base is lower than 910 to 940 feet in the case of a non-directional beacon approach and 680 feet when using a global positioning system approach. Without instrument approach facilities equivalent to those available at Sydney airport, it is unlikely that any regular public transport operator, unable to guarantee operations in accordance with a published schedule, would consider using Bankstown Airport at all. Quite clearly, a fare paying passenger on a regular public transport flight is entitled to the expectation that the operation of his or her aircraft, when flying into or out of Bankstown Airport, would have an equivalent level of safety to that which exists at Sydney airport.
In the event that the proposed upgrade of Bankstown Airport was to include the installation and commissioning of instrument approach facilities equivalent to those available at Sydney airport and that some regional flights were to agree to the use of Bankstown Airport, a significant reduction in the number of general aviation movements would have to be made to maintain at least the margin of operational safety that currently exists at the airport. Ab initio training is not carried out at Sydney airport. To provide an equivalent level of operational safety, it would be a reasonable expectation that ab initio training be moved from Bankstown Airport or at least be curtailed for a period of time before and after the scheduled arrival and/or departure of a regular public transport flight. This simply means that the bulk of flying training operations would need to be moved to other airports, probably Hoxton Park or Camden. Some of the flying training operators are also involved in the business of aerial work and charter flying; to maintain their clients for those operations, they would be in the unenviable position of having to set up an additional facility elsewhere for flying training whilst still maintaining a facility at Bankstown. The effect of such moves would be to place in jeopardy the viability of most of the flying training operators now based at Bankstown. 
Whilst a significant reduction in the number of movements at Bankstown Airport may be seen by some as a reasonable trade-off in accepting some regional flights into Bankstown, nothing could compensate for the operation of Boeing 737s or equivalent type aircraft into that airport. In fact, the only regional aircraft acceptable to my constituents would be those of a weight and capacity and having a noise footprint equivalent to the aircraft which currently use the airport—with the following exception. The ex-military warbirds do not meet Australian airworthiness certification requirements, and some are extremely noisy. Operation of these types of aircraft should not by permitted at Bankstown for other than delivery flights after restoration or repair, and then only with special permission granted for each individual operation. I will be writing to the minister to request that these ex-military aircraft be moved to a more appropriate facility at either Richmond or Williamtown. 
Bankstown operates under what is termed general aviation airport procedures. It has a control zone which is de-activated at certain times, generally at night, and has no curfew. The general aviation airport procedures cater for high density operations in visual meteorological conditions and clearly would be unsuitable for operation of regular public transport aircraft. The absence of a curfew would open the door to regular public transport operations on a 24-hour basis. This is unreasonable, unfair and totally unacceptable.
Operational safety dictates that the airport control tower would need to be manned and active at all times if the airport were open to regular public transport operations and for an appropriate period after the departure of the last flight on any one day. Furthermore, Bankstown Airport has no resident rescue firefighting service. Such a service would need to be re-established to provide a level of safety equivalent to that of Sydney airport.
In fairness to the residents of the area surrounding the airport and those likely to be affected by over-flight noise, the imposition of an appropriate curfew would be absolutely essential. The proximity of Bankstown Airport to Sydney airport poses a challenge for those responsible for arranging flight paths for aircraft operating into and from both airports. Indeed, the conflict of flight paths with Sydney airport was one of the reasons for the refusal of the Holsworthy proposal. Aircraft transiting Bankstown Airport are normally required to do so at 1,500 feet and the normal circuit height is 1,000 feet. In general terms, the larger the aircraft, the greater the area in which it needs to manoeuvre for landing. To permit aircraft larger than those currently operating at Bankstown to use the airport would impose airport noise at a distraction level on residents who have never suffered from such noise in the past and who, even though they chose to live in the vicinity of Bankstown, never envisaged an increase in capacity and noise of the like proposed.
However, I say to the residents in my electorate that if anyone states that they can stop any upgrade at Bankstown or they can stop any regionals operating out of this airport, then they are not telling you the truth for it is not possible to stop operations or activities which have been established by precedent in the past. However, it is possible to tighten the controls that operate at Bankstown and it is possible to make Bankstown a quieter and safer airport than it has been in the past. By this I mean implementing stricter operational controls and imposing a curfew, noise caps and weight caps on the kinds of aircraft that are allowed to operate there.
At the present time, there is another great concern to my constituents, that is, the need for a transparent and publicly open environmental assessment process into the proposal, which must be undertaken before any proposal is implemented. I have asked for an announcement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services that such an environmental impact statement will be undertaken under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1998. Any large jets flying into Bankstown Airport will have a detrimental environmental impact. Not only will it generate unacceptable noise—and in the case of Boeing 737s, I am informed that the noise of the reverse thrust after landing would be absolutely unbearable—but it will also cause unacceptable levels of pollution. This is especially so regarding the pollutant impact of fumes from avtur, which would acerbate the already significant levels of air pollution in this busy area of high density development.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here petitions for presentation from 483 residents in Chipping Norton, Moorebank and Hammondville which were collected by a resident, Mrs Diane Connor. I will lodge these petitions with the Clerk for presentation to the House pursuant to standing order 101. The petitioners consider it vital that an environmental impact statement be undertaken regarding any proposal to upgrade Bankstown Airport. In reality, in the interests of good government, it is only proper, fair and reasonable that the government grant this request. It would be totally inappropriate and against our traditional prevailing philosophy of a `fair go' for all Australians for our government to refuse to provide an EIS on such a serious issue. On behalf of my constituents, I look forward to the minister announcing that an environmental impact study into the proposal to upgrade Bankstown Airport will occur as a matter of urgency. I commend the bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—My contribution to this debate is a contribution from a regional member of parliament whose constituents access Sydney airport and who has thus been very disturbed over a long period of time by the government's failure to address the issues relating to Sydney airport. The Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 is not the answer to the problems at Sydney airport. It is an inadequate response and one which will create confusion and anxiety within the community. It is legislation that is designed not to solve a problem but, rather, to get the best price possible for Sydney airport when this government sells it, as we all know it intends to do. But I will talk a bit more about that a little later.
The Howard government's handling of all issues related to Sydney airport has been appalling. Its indecisiveness demonstrates vividly its inability to make the hard decisions. How long have we been talking about a second airport for Sydney? What has the Howard government done to resolve this issue? The answer is: create confusion. First we had Badgerys Creek, then Richmond, Goulburn, Bathurst, Lithgow and Newcastle. What this has done is create hope and fear within those communities and within communities in Sydney. The result is that the Howard government—and I blame in particular the Prime Minister's vacillation—has completely failed the people of Sydney, New South Wales and Australia.
In Australia we have a Prime Minister who reportedly said he would do whatever he had to do to win the next election. If we look at that and see what the implications are, the implications in relation to Sydney airport are horrendous. It means he will not make a decision, he will not act in any way that will cause any sort of controversy, because he is interested in one thing, and one thing alone, and that is getting votes at the next election—not the best result for the people of Sydney, not the best result for the people of New South Wales and not the best result for the people of Australia. What we need on this issue is some real leadership and a government and a Prime Minister and a minister who are prepared to act in the interests of our country. The result of this inaction—the Prime Minister's inaction, the government's inaction—is a do nothing approach to Sydney airport. That is really what this is: a do nothing approach.
When you look at it you ask why. The implications of the government making a decision on Sydney airport are that it can alienate a lot of people in the community. No matter what decision they make, someone will be upset. As I mentioned just a moment ago, this will lead to the possibility of the loss of some votes for the government and for the Prime Minister. The thing is, if you are not prepared to take a risk and if you are not prepared to act then you should not be in government. The implications of the government not taking a decision on the future of Sydney airport and not doing a bit more than this wishy-washy legislation that we have before us today—which, as I said, is creating more confusion—are that we have got a lack of planning and direction for the future. All that has happened during the time that this government has been in power is that there has been no planning and no direction, just indecision as to what is going to happen in relation to Sydney airport. This really makes it difficult when we are looking at the future.
How can we possibly promote Sydney, promote New South Wales and promote Australia and say that we have got good facilities if the government will not make any decision, will not plan for the future and if we do not have the proper infrastructure in place? Until this issue is resolved it will remain a great concern to a number of people. It will create conflict. It will create anxiety. What really needs to happen is that the government needs to get on with it. It needs to make a decision. It needs to do something. It needs to take a risk. It needs to work in the interests of the Australian people. This is a government that is totally bereft of leadership, one that will do nothing that risks alienating any voters in this year when there is an election. It is a `win at all costs' government, and that has been its approach to Sydney airport. 
The Prime Minister and his government refused to listen to the Australian people on a number of issues, particularly when the people told them that petrol prices were too high. The people told the government that they were doing it hard, and small business was saying that the BAS was not working for them. What was the government's response? They did absolutely nothing until we had a couple of elections—the Western Australian election and the Queensland election—when the government finally listened to what the Australian people were saying. The government were terrified. It was only the fear of losing votes, not the best interests of the Australian people, that actually forced them to act on the price of petrol and to act on the BAS to put together a statement that was more workable for small business. We have a government that listens to people, is prepared to make changes and is prepared to legislate only when it is going to face the ballot box. This is a very difficult issue on which you need a government with a bit of courage and a bit of vision to take some action. There is absolutely no way this government or the Prime Minister will show any leadership in relation to Sydney airport because the only thing that they do is listen to the polls. That is what our poll-driven Prime Minister does.
As a member of this parliament whose electorate, as I mentioned earlier, is based in regional Australia—the Hunter and Central Coast regions—I am most concerned about the implications of this legislation on regional Australia. Aeropelican operate from a smaller airport out of the Shortland electorate, with planes that operate a commuter service between Sydney and Newcastle. Currently their flights are locked in and they have been guaranteed that they can continue to use Sydney airport. Their only purpose is that commuter service, and the changes mean that they cannot increase the number of flights. Therefore the only way that they can grow is if they have larger planes, with larger capital expenses, and the airport really is not suitable for larger planes. The service is used by people in the region. It has a large number of patrons. The implication if it loses any of its slots is that it will have to use Bankstown, and Bankstown would mean the end of a service that serves so many people in Shortland, so I am very concerned from a regional point of view.
I know that the planes operated by Aeropelican are not the only service that has been jeopardised by the government's failure to act on a long-term solution for Sydney airport. The Hunter as a whole is in a similar position to Aeropelican's. The new slots will be for bigger planes, and people from non-metropolitan areas will become second-class citizens. We have seen how this has continuously happened under this government with banks and services being removed from regional areas. Once again, the government reacts only when it is worried about the results at the ballot box, and I believe it stands condemned for that. Sydney airport should be about access for all national and international flights, and the real issue of Sydney airport needs to be addressed by the government. All this legislation is about is building Sydney airport up so that it can be privatised and sold off for the best possible price.
This government are in trouble with their budget. They are trying to get the best price they possibly can, hopefully with a little left over so that they can go to the next election with a bit of a war chest. Then, once again, they will try to bribe the Australian people, as they have in the past, into voting for them. After the election, they will disappoint the Australian people and cause great hurt and hardship, as they have this term. As I said, they are looking at a fire sale to fix their budget problems. 
I will finish where I started. This is a government that lacks leadership, is indecisive, is poll driven and whose main policy is to win at all costs. This is not the answer to Sydney airport and one has only to listen to the debate and the concerns of members from the Sydney area to see that this is the worst possible solution of all.",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2001-03-28,"—Guaranteed slots for regionals have been delivered to regional New South Wales by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Leader of the National Party of Australia, John Anderson. The Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 means that all existing regional slots will remain at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and that the airline operators will have a guarantee of a pricing regime that will ensure they cannot be forced out of KSA due to a hike in landing fees. I have complete faith that in the years to come noise levels at Kingsford Smith airport will be substantially reduced, with quieter aircraft and better climb rates. This legislation guarantees the economic future of country businesses and indeed guarantees the quality of life for country people.
My electorate is well served by the Kendell-Ansett group, Hazelton and the newly arrived Eastern Airlines. The decision by Don Kendell to commence an aviation business in Wagga Wagga has led to a better quality of life for Riverina people. The commitment of Don and Eilish Kendell to the Riverina has been extraordinary and is testament to the fight that country people have put up for equity in services. The people of Sydney under flight paths and around Bankstown are well served by this legislation. By leaving regionals in KSA—that is Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport—it means that larger planes with higher noise levels cannot enter Kingsford Smith airport. The minister has ensured that these slots cannot be traded other than to a regional carrier. So we can have regional carriers in there with propellers and they will make no difference to the noise factor and will have no impact on the slot capacity. But certainly, with the implementation of the parallel runway monitor for close weather, they could be of great use and great benefit to all those people around the Sydney basin suffering from the noise. As the slots are allocated to a region, they cannot be transferred to larger aircraft. This is the best decision for country people, because it removes any risk that the major airlines could avoid the regional guarantee by migrating regional slots held by their affiliates into non-peak periods. The minister, with this legislation, seeks to prevent this abuse.
I heard the member for Shortland state this evening that the decision is due largely to the ballot box, and perhaps she considers that as bribery. As the member for Riverina, representing over 250,000 constituents who want access and equity for the future of their region, I can say that, if this is bribery at the ballot box, I am very happy to accept a poll-driven policy on this issue, because, if it delivers for my people, a substantial improvement in quality of life will be handed to them by this government. Economic development in my electorate of Riverina is of paramount importance. The basic and fundamental issues of economic development are established with telecommunications and a reliable aircraft service in and out of the major centres, particularly in the Riverina. I am not speaking so much about people going from the Riverina into the city but about people needing to get from the city to the Riverina to do their business. We look forward to attracting industry in the future. We have attracted many industries in the past and all of those industries have been attracted to the cities of Wagga Wagga or Griffith because of the reliable air services for international companies. People can come into the international terminal and within a few minutes be in the domestic terminal and moving into the Riverina, and they can almost be back out again in the same day.
They therefore find added benefits in having cheaper set-up costs for their industries in rural and regional Australia and are also able to keep a very close watch on how their industries are progressing. They need to do that. That is called economic survival. It is imperative that we retain our current level of servicing. I congratulate the minister on being able to negotiate this very important package for regional people—whether it be for the constituents of New England, Parks, Riverina and Cowper or for any other constituents. It is important that we have a viable and strong economy in rural and regional New South Wales, and Kingsford Smith airport is the airport that we consider we have a shareholding in. 
People like Don and Eilish Kendell have gone out on a limb and into great debt in order to service the community. They have fought for their existence and their survival in a cutthroat world. That has been a commitment by regional people for and on behalf of regional people. Should we be allocated out of Kingsford Smith at this time, it would be to the detriment of regional and country New South Wales.
I congratulate the minister for emphasising the significance of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001. I sincerely hope that the House will consider the plight of rural and regional New South Wales and recognise that this is also a bonus for those people around the Sydney basin who are currently affected by aircraft noise. It is a win-win situation for all. We are entitled to move forward and to be able to look at future economic benefits that will be derived from being able to have direct access into Kingsford Smith airport. I ask the House to consider passing this bill simply because it represents justice and equity for rural and regional residents of New South Wales.",REPS,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I was interested to hear what the member for Riverina had to say in the debate on the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001. I will mention a few things that might exercise her mind and the minds of other government members who represent regional and rural seats in New South Wales. The result of the legislation that they are lauding tonight will be the reverse of what the member for Riverina has said will happen. What we are going to see with the government's changes to the aircraft situation in Sydney and Bankstown will be that rural and regional people will be divided into two classes: there will be one class of people who will end up having to go to Bankstown and another class of people who will get to go to Sydney airport. What the minister has said is that the government will not alter the guaranteed slots of regional airlines but that it will cap the number of regional slots allocated in peak periods at the current level and also amend the slot management scheme to encourage airlines to progressively introduce larger aircraft.
Those of us who have been looking at the operation of Sydney airport for some years know what this means. You cannot look at this piece of legislation in isolation and say, `Isn't this terrific? We have saved these slots at Sydney airport for rural and regional airlines.' The government has another policy, which is to open Bankstown Airport to rural and regional aircraft. The other thing that government members from the country have to remember is that the government intends to sell Sydney airport and that the new owners of Sydney airport are going to want to maximise their profit. The way they maximise their profit is by having more aircraft and more passengers move through the place.
The kernel of truth is in what the discussion paper says. It will encourage airlines to introduce larger aircraft. They are not going to introduce larger propeller aircraft; they are going to introduce jet aircraft. Larger jet aircraft will be a problem for the people who live around Sydney airport and will be a problem for the people in small to medium sized rural communities around New South Wales. No-one is going to fly a jet to Bathurst and no-one is going to fly a jet to Dubbo, and if you do not have jets coming to your town you will be going to Bankstown. That is the simple truth of it. The member for Riverina can sit there and nod her head, but what she ought to do is read the government's plan. The government has three plans that do not exist in isolation. The first plan, which will happen in the short term, is the sale of Sydney airport to a private operator who will want to make a profit. The way they make their profit is to get more planes and more people through Sydney airport—bigger planes bring more people, bring more profit. The second plan is to extend Bankstown Airport to take regional aircraft. And the third plan is to encourage people to increase the size of the planes and introduce jet aircraft, which will all come into Sydney. So you will have two airports with two particularly different types of aircraft management. You will have jets at Kingsford Smith and you will have prop planes at Bankstown. 
—I will be here in a couple of years time and I will be happy to feel sorry for the member for Riverina and her constituents when what I am saying comes true. The government has a plan for Bankstown Airport and the government has a jet plan for Sydney airport. If your town does not have jets, you do not get into Sydney. The member for Riverina said that her constituents liked the interconnectability between international flights and regional flights, which you have at Sydney. You will have interconnectability if a jet services your town. The jets tend to service the tourist trap towns up and down the New South Wales coast, not the inland towns. There is no jet service to any inland town in New South Wales—none. There are jet services up and down the coast. So the people who will get interconnectability will be the people from Coffs Harbour; the people from Bathurst, Wagga and Dubbo will get the bus to Bankstown. So do not think that the government is doing you a favour. The government saves slots for rural and regional operators to get the National Party off its back for a while. But the outcome of this will be that, if you do not have a jet coming to town, you do not have interconnectability and you get the bus to Bankstown. That is not a good thing for my constituents and it is not a good thing for yours. Too many jets at Sydney will make Sydney unbearable.
One of the things that those of us who represent electorates around Sydney airport like about rural aircraft arriving in Sydney is that the separation space between jets has to be doubled when you put little planes in the middle, because the turbulence from the jets bounces the little planes out of the air. We actually like having all the little planes there, but the people who own the airport do not like it because every time you put one little plane in you take two jets slots out. What does the discussion paper say? The discussion paper says that the management scheme will encourage airlines to introduce larger aircraft. You and I know that the only larger aircraft are jet aircraft, and that is what they want. They want to run Sydney as a jet-only airport because that is how you make more money. If you do not have jets, you go to Bankstown and there is no interconnectability.
So I think those people who represent rural and regional New South Wales ought to just consider in their minds the whole pack of lies that have been told by governments of all colours about what is going to happen at Sydney airport. In the 21 years I have been in this parliament the one group of people that, in a sense, I admire are the aviation bureaucrats, because they have had a policy since Don Anderson was the secretary of the old civil aviation department to expand Sydney into a mega airport and have no other little airports anywhere—just one big hub. I have got to say that they have outlasted all of the politicians. They have outlasted all of us, and they con ministers day in and day out. It is the great Sir Humphrey line, because what they want they have got.
What the people of rural and regional New South Wales will get out of this system is no relief. This bill is smoke and mirrors. It is about saying to people in the country, `Look, we have saved the slots for you.' They have. They have saved the slots for you. They have saved the slots for jet aircraft. You might get to go there for a few months, or even a year or two. In the meantime they expand Bankstown and they slowly move you out to Bankstown—no interconnectability, no advantage and no service for people from rural and regional New South Wales. 
I say to the member for Riverina that she ought to just keep that in the back of her mind and maybe, if she is still here in a year or two's time, she can come up and tell me that I was right. I have followed this debate year in, year out. I got elected to the local council in 1971 on a policy of dealing with this airport. That was 30 years ago in September of this year. In every election I have run in, Sydney airport has been part of the problem. It will be part of the problem when I die. There is no doubt about that. This legislation is just smoke and mirrors. It is to allow the National Party members who represent rural and regional New South Wales to go out and say somehow or other they have been saved. I have no doubt that the member for Riverina is a very nice person and she is not up here telling fibs. She believes what she is saying, but she is being lied to by this legislation.
—Very naive.
—This legislation is just about making decent but naive people go out and tell a story which will be revealed as a lie in a few years time. Part of the proof of that is that the minister said in his announcements on 13 December of last year that they would be putting out a discussion paper. He said it again on 8 March that later this month they would be putting out a discussion paper. The discussion paper came out one day ago. It appeared on the Internet one day ago. It still has not been delivered to members' offices, yet we are here debating this legislation, which is about the discussion paper. They are going to have a bit of discussion about the discussion paper that finishes I think at the end of next month.
It is the same old argument: you go out and you talk a lot, you keep all of the information to yourself, you stampede the debate, and then you say, `Quick, you've got to make a decision.' There might be a fair bit of discussion about this little piece of legislation elsewhere, in the other chamber, and we might get a fair bit of public discussion on this issue, because people are being conned by what the minister is saying in here. I do not think you should trust governments—full stop—on Sydney airport. As I have said, I might sound rather cynical, but I have seen the people of my electorate have a whole lot of problems happen to them because of what has happened at Sydney airport.
The government's other plan for airports in Sydney is to do this job with Bankstown. If you expand Bankstown Airport and turn that into what will become the second-class rural and regional airport for New South Wales aviation, if they go and do some work on Bankstown—put in another runway or extend the runway that is there—no-one yet can tell me the effect of the flight paths from Bankstown Airport and the flight paths from Sydney airport.
My electorate is affected in particular by the use of the east-west runway at Sydney airport. An article in the Sydney Telegraph drew up some suggested flight paths. What you have is the intersection of flight paths from Bankstown with the flight paths out of the east-west runway at Sydney airport. This might be a good thing for my constituents or it could be very bad—there could be mid-air collisions. I do not think even this government is so silly that it would want to have mid-air collisions. What they will do is close down the east-west runway. That would be a plus for my constituents. 
We have more lies being told about Sydney airport in this debate. If you close down the east-west runway, you go back to the old precision landing system at Sydney airport where the two parallel runways are sending traffic straight to the north. That is going to increase the noise—with some decency— over the Prime Minister's electorate. He is not telling the people in his electorate that, but that is the reality. If you set Bankstown up, as the government says they are going to—and the government's plan and the plan of the people who are going to buy Sydney airport is that they are not going to want Badgerys Creek built—they are going to want to have as many jets as they can at Sydney and they are going to want to put the rural and regional people out at Bankstown. Then they will want to rev up Bankstown to save the cost of building another airport at Badgerys Creek. If you close the east-west runway, then you get this noise problem to the north and south of Sydney airport. 
I heard the member for Cook having a few things to say in this debate earlier. He ought to have a close look not only at this legislation, because this is what these aviation bureaucrats do. They give you a little piece of cake, then they bring out another piece of the cake, then they bring out a third and fourth piece of the cake and, by the time you put the whole lot together, you become very sick because you have eaten too much cake. The three or four plans that they have all fit in together. If you have to close the east-west runway at Mascot, all those planes that now take off on that runway will take off and land over the electorate of the member for Cook and they will all be jets. The people of Kurnell that we often hear him talking about in this House will not have the little bit of respite that you get when you have to spread the jets apart should a little 10-seater be bobbing around in the middle.
Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you will do all right. We will have a fascinating little problem for the National Party when all this happens. You will not be here. The member for Riverina might not even be here. She will be getting the little planes and the bus out to Bankstown and you will be flying first-class in the jets to Coffs Harbour. Coffs Harbour will do all right out of this because it will have a jet service. But the people in the real bush will do very badly out of it. My constituents will do badly out of it because we like those little planes that bob around in the middle. It means that we are not getting 80 jets landing in an hour; we are getting probably 60 jets and 20 little ones.
I would say to government members: do not be naive about this. Have a look at the totality of this plan. When you do look at the totality of the plan, the only answer on what to do with Sydney airport is to build another big airport that will take jets, small aircraft and freighters, and that is Badgerys Creek. If people from the bush do not realise that, they will be on the bus to Bankstown.
—But they might be on the bus from Badgerys.
—But you are less likely to be. If you are going to have a decent airport out at Badgerys Creek you can have a good argument for saying that people from rural Australia should be able to fly into Sydney. If all there is, as well as Sydney, is this little airport at Bankstown that only takes propeller aircraft, then you have no argument because the guy who owns Sydney airport says, `I've bought this from the government for a couple of billion dollars; I have an obligation to make some money for my shareholders, and the money is in jets—it is not in little propeller driven aircraft. Anyway, there is another little airport for you at Bankstown.' If there is a bigger airport out on the city rim, some of you might end up going to that, but you will have a better argument for staying at Sydney than you will if they can divide the aviation users of New South Wales and Australia into the two classes of jet users and propeller users. That is what their plan is; that is what they want to do and that is what will put you on the bus to Bankstown. If we build Badgerys Creek, you can sensibly manage Sydney airport and you can sensibly manage the competing needs of people who use that airport and who will use the larger overflow airport.
I do not know who the tactical genius was who decided that it was clever to start the process of making the second airport for Sydney at Bankstown. That is what the government is doing. The argument why you could not build Badgerys Creek in the 1990s was, `We have spent all this money on the second runway at Sydney.' We had extended Sydney's life. 
—But you did that.
—I just said in my speech earlier, I do not trust governments of either side on Sydney airport. Your government has now made the silliest mistake of all in that you have said, `The second airport for Sydney is in effect Bankstown.' Bankstown is a little pocket handkerchief of land rimmed by houses. You cannot expand Bankstown. You cannot put big jets into Bankstown. You cannot even put a 737 into Bankstown, I am told. What you will end up with at Bankstown is a myriad of these small planes, and that is madness.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—We have just heard an interesting exchange between the member for Watson and the member for Riverina. The member for Riverina needs to understand this key statistic: one-third of the people and freight companies in Sydney who use aviation services live closer to Badgerys Creek than they do to Mascot. One-third of the aviation market in Sydney is located closer to Badgerys Creek, the second airport site, than it is to Mascot. The construction of a proper airport at Badgerys Creek would obviously free up the space that is needed at Mascot to make regional services viable—to maintain their security. The best arrangement is obviously to fly into Badgerys Creek and have connecting domestic and international flights for people from rural New South Wales. So too, if they fly into Sydney, they should have those connecting flights.
The problem at Bankstown, and it is almost self-evident, is that people will be on the bus. People will be flying in from country New South Wales and getting on the bus to get their connecting domestic or international flight at Sydney. For those businesses in the bush which want to trade and export and engage in Asian economic integration, something we all talk about, there could not be anything worse than catching a plane out of Wagga, arriving in Bankstown and then being bused on to Mascot for a flight to Bangkok or Singapore or Beijing. If this government, for all its rhetoric about the bush, is to treat businesses in country New South Wales fairly, then obviously they need to make proper facilities available in the metropolitan basin, and Bankstown will not be adequate. The proper thing to do is to use the large market that is available surrounding the Badgerys Creek site.
That is the point that the member for Riverina needs to understand. It would be by far the best way of proceeding for her constituents and mine. The member for Watson pointed out that he brings 30 years of experience and wisdom to this debate. I am only half his age, so I can only boast 14 years of wisdom and experience in this debate. I was first elected to public office—
—He has gone to check the birthday book.
—He has gone to check the parliamentary handbook. It will show that I was elected to Liverpool council in 1987. I spent seven years there and I have had seven years in this place, so 14 years of public office. In all of that time the dominant transport issue in Sydney has been airports—primarily the construction of a second airport. I go back to 1987 when I started to advocate, while on the Liverpool council, the construction of Badgerys Creek, which was within the municipal boundaries. In 1991 I became the mayor and chairman of WESROC and I can remember that every single state and federal MP in the region was in favour of Badgerys Creek. 
At the time of the recession and substantial unemployment, everyone wanted to build the second airport for its job generating capacity. I mentioned earlier on in reference to the member for Riverina that one-third of the aviation market in Sydney is closer to Badgerys Creek than it is to Mascot, so it has a substantial base on which to build jobs—jobs not just in the construction of the airport but to act as a stimulus for freight, tourism and related economic activities. The potential has always been there. From 1991 through to about 1993 or 1994, all MPs, state and federal, were supporting the Badgerys Creek site. I can remember WESROC convening meetings where my friend and colleague the member for Chifley would come along and advocate the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. Some people regard him as the father of the proposal—the person who put it on the agenda in a substantial way in Western Sydney because of its positive economic and employment impacts. 
Of course, one of the things that the public has grown cynical about is inconsistency in politics, people who take a position because of a change in direction in the political wind—not a change of direction in the facts or the economic needs or the planning needs of a region but because the political wind has changed direction. They are the weather vanes of Australian politics. It is no wonder the Australian people have grown cynical about such an approach. What I find now in the Sydney basin is enormous scepticism about airports and the politics of airports. 
Unfortunately, the whole debate has become a case of pass the parcel. Every single month on a Sunday there are television broadcasts of airport related protests in Sydney. People have seen this debate for the past decade, and they have grown very cynical. They have grown cynical of pass the parcel airport politics. Under this government, for instance, and this piece of legislation, let us examine the record. The Howard government was elected in 1996 on a promise of constructing Badgerys Creek airport as Sydney's second international facility. Since then, we have had attempts to pass the parcel onto Holsworthy—a crazy idea developed by John Sharp. It was never going to fly. It got nowhere near passing an EIS process, but it built public cynicism and distrust in this whole debate. There was an attempt to pass the parcel onto Kurnell. The Prime Minister had one last attempt at an alternative airport site prior to the announcement of Bankstown. The member for Watson has clearly explained the difficulties with the Bankstown site, and it should be thoroughly opposed. There have been other proposals, including Wilton, Richmond and Goulburn—places a long way from the Sydney basin. In fact, they were so far away from the metropolitan area that you could not really call them a second Sydney airport. It would be the first southern New South Wales airport if it were to be located at Goulburn. 
In this environment of ongoing protest, lack of political decision making and lack of political direction, the public, understandably, has grown cynical. Indeed, it is quite a fractious debate that we have in Sydney about airports—the airport needs at Mascot and the prospect of a second airport in Western Sydney. What we desperately need is a properly structured debate and policy. Unfortunately, under this government's strategy of pass the parcel, for very narrow political reasons, we are getting no closer to such an approach.
My reservation is that it is getting even worse. I noticed on the back page of the Financial Review on Friday a report about the imminent sale of Sydney airport. Of course, this legislation is related to the sale process and the access regime and slot management that would follow. This is what the Financial Review reported last Friday:
The politics in favour of a quick sale are clear. With the 3G spectrum auction a disappointment based on year-ago hopes, the airport represents the best chance to get the loot to try to bribe voters before a tough election. National Party boss John Anderson has already agreed to the sale so long as money gets diverted to the bush.
What sort of strategy is that? That is an outrageous strategy in terms of the best interests of transport planning in Sydney. This government is planning to sell the airport at Mascot and to divert the money to the bush to try and bribe voters before a tough federal election. This is bad policy on several counts. First of all, asset sales should not be placed into the recurrent budget. Asset sales should not go into the bottom line. We have heard the Treasurer, Mr Costello, explaining this to the House on several occasions; he tries to boast that it is his government's policy not to put asset sales into the budget bottom line. Yet here is the Deputy Prime Minister planning to do just that for pork-barrelling in the bush. It is Labor policy to maintain asset sales for the purpose of debt retirement or other infrastructure projects. It is not Labor Party policy to follow this government's strategy of putting assets into the budget bottom line, as it did with the spectrum sale and now with Mascot airport. Assets should be used for debt retirement or further infrastructure projects. So I am pleased that under Labor policy we will be rejecting that approach.  
But the bigger point about Sydney is that the proceeds of a transport asset sale in our region should be kept in our region. The proceeds of the sale should be kept in the Sydney metropolitan area. In all parts of this country, there is no greater transport deficiency than in Sydney. This morning I met with one of the experts in the rail sector who said, talking about road freight, their main competitor, that the cost of freighting goods from Port Botany to Campbelltown in my electorate in the south-west of Sydney is as great as the cost of freighting goods by sea from Singapore to Port Botany. The cost of getting goods from Port Botany to Campbelltown by road is as large as the cost of getting them by sea from Singapore to Port Botany. This is a graphic demonstration of the high congestion costs in Sydney. The Sydney road network is an absolute gridlock, with the high economic and social costs of congestion. The rail system in Sydney is inadequate. We have not had a new rail line constructed in Western Sydney since the time of Jack Lang other than the two-station Glenfield to East Hills line. So rail has been underfunded and neglected at state and federal level for decades. On top of that we have the abysmal delay and inertia about Sydney's airport needs. So Sydney is in a transport crisis. There is a lack of planning, a lack of provision and a lack of funding. 
What is the plan of the federal minister for transport? His plan is to take the money from a transport asset sale in Sydney and put it out into recurrent pork-barrelling in the bush. This is something that should be rejected, because it would continue this government's punishment of the outer suburbs in Sydney. Just last year the government announced a $5 toll on the Western Orbital road—an absolutely essential piece of bypass infrastructure for Sydney and they are going to put a $5 toll on it. What they should be doing, of course, is reinvesting the proceeds from the Mascot airport sale in Sydney's transport infrastructure: reinvesting in a toll-free western orbital road and in other useful projects. I can list the upgrading of Cowpasture Road, Hoxton Park Road, Camden Valley Way, the Brooks Road on and off ramps and the widening of the Hume Highway at the Crossroads. I can mention those road projects just in my own electorate, and I can assure the House that in the other electorates of Western Sydney there are many other outstanding projects. If the government are to sell Mascot airport, the money should go into transport infrastructure construction in Sydney. It should not go into the recurrent budget; it should not go into the bush; it should be there for asset development in the Sydney basin. What Sydney desperately needs is an integrated transport plan.
I am very pleased to see that the member for Batman has declared his support for an integrated transport plan in Sydney. He has also declared his support for the introduction of a national infrastructure council. This national infrastructure council would be available for recommending to government the proper priorities in transport funding. They would be doing the cost benefit studies. They would be doing the expert analysis and giving advice to government about where the taxpayer dollar would be most productively spent. So we should have a national infrastructure council that gives advice about how the proceeds of the Mascot sale can be used to develop an integrated transport plan in Sydney.
The transport plan should include the construction of a second airport. It should examine the way in which tolls can be removed from the M4, the M5 and, most recently, the western orbital road. The transport plan should include the completion of the M5 East. It should include significant arterial roads such as those in my own electorate that I mentioned earlier on. It should examine the means by which we can improve Sydney's rail freight infrastructure, getting the heavy trucks and vehicles off the roads and onto the rail to free up some of Sydney's road networks and lower congestion costs. Sydney desperately needs an integrated transport plan; otherwise we are going down the Los Angeles path of congestion and enormous social and economic costs. The ALP approach on this is crystal clear: to keep the funding for asset development, to keep the funding in Sydney, to listen to the recommendations about a national infrastructure council and to act on the development of an integrated transport plan for Sydney. 
What else can be said about ALP policy? Let us have a look at this airport issue. Our national platform states that we are committed to the construction of a second Sydney airport somewhere inside the Sydney basin. Of course, all urban planners know that sites like Wilton and Goulburn are outside the Sydney basin. Anyone with commonsense would know that the only available site acquired by the Commonwealth, cleared by two environmental impact statements and approved by umpteen economic studies, is Badgerys Creek. So Labor policy is to proceeds at Badgerys Creek—that is crystal clear—and it should be part of an integrated transport plan.
We need to get away from the pass the parcel politics of airports in the Sydney basin. What we should be doing on airport policy is ensuring that KSA is sold as it operates now. There should not be any watering down of the restrictions that are needed in the inner city. The government should commit itself to the sale of Kingsford Smith airport on its current pattern of operation. The proceeds of that sale should be used as I described earlier on and, of course, the proposal of Bankstown airport should be abandoned. Labor is the only party in this parliament with a public interest transport plan for Sydney. I sometimes think about these airport issues in Sydney and conclude that the only thing they would be useful for would be political study in the future. Some PhD student down the track will have the perfect case study of what has gone wrong with Australian politics: the lack of direction, the lack of decision making, weather vane politics and pass the parcel airport planning generating public cynicism and scepticism.
If you need to look at the things that have gone wrong in our system of representative democracy, look no further than the airport issue in Sydney. The member for Watson mentions 30 years, I have given my history of 14 years, and there is no end in sight. I am pleading for the government to actually bring these matters to a conclusion. They have gone on for way too long and they damage not only the infrastructure and society in Sydney but the fabric of our political system, because they bring this whole place into disrepute. The public have just lost all faith in the concept of airport planning and public interest in Sydney. So there is a real need for leadership, for one side of politics to take a lead, to act with proper structures and proper recommendations and to put the public interest first and sectional interests last—to say there is something good that can be done for Sydney through an integrated transport plan, all the pieces can fit together, we can do something about congestion, we can do something about the Los Angeles scenario and we can actually act in the public interest.
For airports this means stop passing the parcel—stop developing all these side agendas and political tactics to try and divert attention from the real airport needs. If I can contribute to this debate in the future, it will be on the basis of the public interest and the integrated transport needs of the Sydney basin; it will be putting good public policy ahead of cheap political tactics. In the 14 years already mentioned, I have always believed that, in the end, good policy makes for good politics. People give you respect and you have got a better chance of communicating your intentions if they know that you are acting in the public interest. If you are acting out of conviction instead of opportunism, you win the respect of the public and, in the end, good public policy becomes good politics. That is the way we should proceed. I am desperately disappointed at the way the federal government is approaching this issue. Who could have believed on election night 1996 that we would be here more than five years later still debating airport needs in Sydney? Who would have imagined that a government which had a mandate to build Badgerys Creek would squib it so badly and then engage in the most cynical, opportunistic, cheap political tactics that you could possibly imagine. Let us put that to an end. There is a better way. A policy approach has been developed on this side of the parliament and the sooner that is acted on in the public interest the better off we will all be.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—While I am here to put the summing up speech for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, I too have been in this parliament for a long time—in fact, 20 years. I was very interested to hear the members for Watson and Werriwa lecture us on some of the historical aspects. The simple fact is that I was here when we were in the Old Parliament House when Wal Fife, member for Hume and Minister for Aviation, stood up and proposed a $300 million investment in a parallel runway at Mascot airport. Of course, some time after that we lost government and the first thing that the then Hawke Labor government did was to cancel that runway, and for years and years and years the congestion and the noise built up and eventually they were forced to build it. I might add, as I recollect, that the then Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, was very critical of the delays involved. So when it comes to procrastination we cannot rewrite history in this place, because it is all on the record.
I thank the honourable members, on behalf of the minister, for their contributions. The Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001 will make a minor change to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997. The bill will enable the slot management scheme for the airport to differentiate between different categories of aircraft movements, despite the access provisions of part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act.
The Sydney airport slot management scheme has been a great success. More than 82 per cent of flights through Sydney airport are now on time—a figure better than any of the major airports in the United States. Sydney airport is now coping extremely well with its level of air traffic. The government has concluded that it will cope for the next 10 years, provided we implement some minor changes to the slot management scheme. 
Yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister released a discussion paper setting out the proposed changes to the scheme. I remind the Opposition Whip that the bill does not pre-empt the outcomes of the consultation process. It simply ensures that the amendments to the scheme, whatever their final details, will be valid. The discussion paper recognises that Sydney airport is a vital transport hub for regional New South Wales: over 40 per cent of the regional passengers arriving at Sydney airport connect with flights to other destinations. The government believes that it is essential that regional airlines have guaranteed access to the airport, and the discussion paper includes key measures to protect them.
I note that the opposition has announced that it intends to convene a Senate inquiry into the bill. The government always welcomes parliamentary scrutiny, but I warn the House that it is extremely important that the bill and the amendments to the scheme be finalised by 1 June. The slots for what is known as the northern winter 2001 scheduling season must be allocated in early June. The world's international airlines will be gathering from 2 June to 12 June to coordinate their timetables. The airlines need to have stable slot allocations before they attend the conference. We cannot allocate slots at Sydney airport according to our own convenience. We cannot ignore the international scheduling process. The slots allocated at Sydney airport will affect the slots allocated at Heathrow and gate availability at airports such as Bangkok, Tokyo and Los Angeles. I welcome the opposition's support for the bill, but I urge all of the parties involved in the Senate process to conduct a timely inquiry that recognises the realities in the international airline industry. I commend the bill to the House.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—This evening I wish to raise an issue of great importance to people within my electorate: the completion of the television tower on Browns Mountain. I wish to tell the House of a story of hard work, of tenacity and of community, a story of a local community and their triumph over privatisation. This is a story of a small community's battle to receive that most basic of communication infrastructure needs—television services. I hasten to point out that this community is not hundreds of miles from established services but is in fact only a few minutes from my home town. 
Lilydale is located just 20 kilometres from Launceston and the problem faced by nearly everyone within the greater Lilydale community is the poor quality of television reception within the area. This is an issue that I have brought to the attention of the House on a number of occasions—namely, occasions filled with government inaction which have stalled the construction of the tower upon Browns Mountain. This tower, for which I now understand construction is to commence tomorrow, will deliver to the people of Lilydale something that we all take for granted—basic television service. We must be very careful not to trivialise the issue of television services. Each time I am in Lilydale, the issue of the tower is raised with me. It is raised not only by the residents of Lilydale, by the parents and by the children but also by teachers at the Lilydale district school. 
Teachers at the local school have been continually concerned that the lack of television reception within Lilydale was having a detrimental impact upon the education and social development of the children who live there. The teachers simply are not able to ask the children in their class to do any homework that is based upon television news or current affairs portrayed on television. This is a picture of a community, just 20 kilometres outside of Launceston, without any television service to speak of. In this House in June of 1999, almost two years ago, I raised this issue and said:
The community of Lilydale in northern Tasmania is a privatisation casualty. Lilydale has been unquestionably adversely affected by the federal government's failure to ensure the continuation of a partially constructed television transmission tower. 
I might remind members that this was a tower which the government had already invested substantial public funds towards developing. Unfortunately, the rapid growth in the number of transmitters—from 826 to 1,197 in the years 1992 to 1997 nationally—is unlikely to grow with the sale of the NTA to the NTL. I know the residents of Lilydale would have liked to have seen the number of operational transmitters in that financial year grow by at least one. Lilydale is a Tasmanian example which illustrates the implications of privatisation. The federal government must attempt to discover a sense of fairness and equity which extends to regional areas.
The impact of the privatisation of the NTA upon Lilydale was devastating. The National Transmission Authority had planned for the construction of the tower on Browns Mountain. However, no provision was made for its construction within the sale of the authority. This meant that the NTL, which purchased the National Transmission Authority, were under no obligation to commence the construction of this vital service to Lilydale, despite promises by the previous member, a member of the current government, to ensure that this service existed. After the federal government finally agreed to provide additional funding to the ABC for the construction of the tower, the community were hopeful that they would be at the end of their battle. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  
The delay caused through both the privatisation of the National Transmission Authority and federal government inaction in providing funding for this construction has denied the people of Lilydale this most basic of connections to the world. The government speaks so fondly of all it has done for communications in Tasmania yet these people do not even have television. The delay resulted in the planning permit, which the National Transmission Authority had received for the construction, expiring. This, combined with the time taken to receive the agreement of land-holders for the construction, caused further delay.
During this time the community of Lilydale continued to fight strongly for the service that they deserve. This was a David and Goliath fight. The small community of under 1,000 people felt forgotten, let down and particularly very angry with this federal government. But the passion the people of Lilydale have for the construction of the tower remained. Not a week went by without my office being contacted by residents of Lilydale for advice on the progress of the tower. It was impossible to visit the town without this issue being raised again and again. I am very pleased to inform the House that, in spite of the federal government actions, or inaction, the tower is finally going ahead. What a victory for this wonderful community—a small local town attempting to gain what many of us take for granted.
During the last year my office has been in regular contact with the ABC on the progress of the tower construction. I wish to note for the record my personal thanks to Craig Todd and Denise Musto of the ABC, who have worked so professionally and so tirelessly on this issue. But my real congratulations go to the community of Lilydale, who have worked so hard in gaining this for their community. The tower will be operational later than they expected, and certainly much later than they deserved, but through their hard work the tower will soon be delivering to this terrific town the quality of TV signal it so richly deserves.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Bass Electorate: Lilydale Television Transmission Tower</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—The current inquiry into the education of boys by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, chaired by the honourable member for Forde, has created a great deal of interest in the public arena. Over 200 submissions have been received and they continue to be received on a day by day basis.
At the beginning of the inquiry, a most important and controversial fact was provided by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. It stated that, 20 years ago, the differential between boys' and girls' attainments was less than one percentage point. That ought to be the case, too, as intrinsically the capabilities of boys and girls should be similar. However, the Commonwealth department also reported that current differentials varied by as much as 20 percentage points in favour of girls. If that is an accurate figure, then the lack of progress of boys is most worrying indeed.
At the public hearings, the most impressive witnesses were principals, teachers and students. By contrast, the least impressive witnesses generally came from administration, in both the public and private sectors, as well as about 50 per cent of the people from academia. Fortunately, people like Dr Ken Rowe, the principal research fellow from the Australian Council for Educational Research, Dr Katherine Rowe, senior consultant physician, department of general paediatrics at Royal Melbourne Hospital, Professor Faith Trent, and Malcolm Slade, research fellow from the education faculty at Flinders University, were among several academics who made extremely positive and sensible contributions. I would also include in that list Professor Peter Hill from the University of Melbourne, as well as several others. 
Successful schools in boys education may have chosen different means in closing the gap between boys' and girls' attainments in literacy but the framework was remarkably similar: apply diagnostic testing to establish the depth of the problem; devise an appropriate curriculum to remedy the gap; apply active and structural learning techniques; remember that boys identify more with the teacher than the subject; monitor the results; and give accurate feedback.
Schools like Eagleby State School, in the seat of the member for Forde in Brisbane, in a low socioeconomic area, and schools like Roseville in affluent Sydney, proved that the gap could be lowered in four years to a negligible measurement, irrespective of socioeconomic status. These schools' practices flew in the face of the orthodoxy and propaganda espoused by educational bureaucrats in this country. These schools used quantitative as well as qualitative research. They used analysis as well as synthesis. They used both active and passive learning. They used both structured and unstructured learning. They fostered expression as well as constraint. They practised spontaneity as well as uniformity. They were consistent; they were thorough; they planned; they measured. In other words, they encouraged success for both boys and girls. They did not dud the boys with a girl friendly only or feminised approach to curriculum and they also were not deluding themselves on actual attainments of girls which would not stand any analysis whatsoever. The tabling of this report later in the year will create considerable discussion indeed. (Time expired)

The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 contains amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. These amendments arise from unanimous recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the conduct of the 1998 election. The federal opposition supports the bill. Most, if not all, of the measures outlined in this bill arise from recommendations put forward by the Australian Electoral Commission to the joint standing committee. They include sensible measures to make it easier for people to enrol and vote while overseas, to allow Senate groups to change candidates when their circumstances change, and to tighten up the registration of political parties. 
There are a range of other measures in this bill covering the handling and return of deposits from candidates, the initialling of ballot papers and the sort of abbreviations registered parties can use for their names. All of these measures will help in the administration of the Electoral Act by the AEC. Unlike the government, the Labor Party has confidence in the AEC to administer the Commonwealth electoral system in a professional, independent and responsive fashion. The attacks on the AEC by government members during the joint standing committee's so-called inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll have not gone unnoticed by the opposition. However, it is good that we are getting back to some constructive measures in relation to our electoral laws. 
We have been distracted for far too long by the government's witch-hunt through the now discredited joint standing committee inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll. It has been of concern to the Labor Party for some time now that this government has invested such a huge amount of public time and money into an inquiry by the joint committee that very quickly became a witch-hunt directed at the Labor Party. Its real political purpose has never been to properly investigate or to properly assess the integrity of the electoral roll.
It is now widely acknowledged in the community and the media that, under the stewardship of the member for Sturt, the joint committee has become a completely biased forum whose proceedings are governed by the short-term political interests of the Liberal Party. Unlike the government and the member for Sturt, the Labor Party thinks that the role of the joint committee is to inquire into and report on matters relating to electoral laws and practices and their administration. Labor members serve on the committee so that they can serve the parliament and their constituents. The member for Sturt clearly thinks that it has a different purpose; he prefers to use the committee to serve the Liberal Party's political objectives. Their real political purpose has never been to properly investigate the issues arising from Queensland or to properly assess the integrity of the electoral roll. 
Ultimately, the member for Sturt will defend his actions in this chamber, I have no doubt, as chair of the committee by saying that he was just following orders. The brief for government members on the committee was, after all, to do all they could to drag any of the mud from the Queensland situation down to Canberra. That plan has not exactly worked wonders for the Liberal Party here or in Brisbane.
When one looks at this bill, it is interesting to note that not one of the recommendations from the Liberal Party to the joint standing committee's review of the 1998 election has made its way into this piece of legislation—such is the government's lack of confidence in the contribution of the Liberal Party to reforming the electoral system in a constructive way. It would appear that the Liberal agenda is to weaken the integrity of the electoral system by making it harder for disadvantaged members of our community to enrol and harder for them to vote. Not content with distorting the franchise through these methods, they also want to weaken the transparency and accountability of the system of disclosing donations by massively raising the threshold for disclosure from $1,500 to $10,000. 
Although we are supporting this bill, we are well aware of the regressive agenda of the Liberal Party in relation to electoral matters. We await with some interest their second piece of legislation. In conclusion, the opposition supports the legislation put forward by the government, although it has other views about the conduct of some members of the government with respect to electoral matters.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—Far from my being here following orders, the member for Melbourne has demonstrated that he was sent in here by Senator Faulkner to follow orders and continue the process of discrediting the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters rather than actually addressing the concerns and failings that were created by the Labor Party and accepting responsibility for the mess that the Labor Party has created through its own institutionalised corruption. The member for Melbourne has followed his orders. I intend, however, to give a much more thoughtful speech on the issues to do with electoral matters which are covered by the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001.
—Probably slightly longer, too!
—And slightly longer, too. The cornerstone of our democracy is the presumption that our electoral rolls are free from distortion and manipulation. Accurate electoral rolls give us confidence that democracy works because, regardless of whether you are the richest or poorest person in Australia, at the ballot box we are all equals because we all have just one vote. But in recent times, evidence has emerged that this is not always the case. The Labor Party likes to portray itself as being the great egalitarian. The Australian public, however, have been shocked by revelations that some members of the Labor Party consider themselves more equal than others. The one-person, one-vote principle is a non-negotiable tenet of our system of democracy, but it seems that some people in the Labor Party believe that they are above every other Australian and have manipulated the system to effectively give themselves more than one vote at the ballot box. 
These revelations have shattered and undermined the Australian public's confidence in our democracy and system of government. The Australian community have repeatedly seen evidence of enrolment fraud and manipulation by Labor factional operators for the purposes of political power games. It is important to point out that the practice of electoral roll fraud and manipulation does not appear confined to a narrow section of the Labor Party. Indeed, evidence of electoral roll fraud has recently seen the resignation of several Labor members of parliament, including Peter Beattie's former deputy premier, Jim Elder, and former Queensland ALP state secretary Mike Kaiser. 
We have seen the conviction of three former Labor Party members and the jailing of one for crimes relating to the Electoral Act. The Special Minister of State and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters are now charged with the responsibility of working to restore the public's confidence in the accuracy and integrity of Australia's democratic process. In order to fix the problems, it is important to understand the nature of the flaws in the current system.
I would like to take the opportunity of this debate to consider some of the facts and allegations that have emerged which demonstrate the shortcomings of the current electoral system so that we can address those problems with effective legislation like the legislation before us today. The former Labor member for Hinkler Brian Courtice has given the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters a very instructive account of the culture of electoral rorting that exists in the Labor Party. In his evidence to the joint standing committee, the former Labor member for Hinkler described the existence of a Labor Party slush fund designed to finance fraudulent enrolments. He said:
I was an organiser with the AWU from August 1986 until I was successful at the 1987 federal election. I was employed by Errol Hodder, then the state secretary. When I received my first fortnightly pay I was surprised that $20 a week was deducted automatically. I asked the district secretary. He said, `It's for our social club. All the officials have this amount taken out of their pay every fortnight.' I said, `That will buy a lot of drinks,' because there were about 40 AWU state officials. He said, `No, don't ask any questions. It is our social fund. It just protects and looks after us.' I didn't ask any more questions. My understanding is that about $60,000 is raised each year through this levy ...
He also said: 
I don't know Karen Ehrmann, but the sad thing is she is in jail for doing what she was told to do, and we all know who the hell told her to do it. So far, only the truck driver bringing the whisky across the border has been put in jail. Al Capone is still sitting behind his bloody desk. Everybody knows that. William Patrick Ludwig. It is indisputable.
The Labor former member for Hinkler went on to describe the inherent practice of electoral fraud in the Labor Party. He said:
What they had to gain was to get a safe seat in a safe place to vote for the AWU faction to enshrine their political power ... 
At another point in his testimony, the former member for Hinkler described the culture of intimidation, threats and standover tactics exercised by Bill Ludwig, the AWU boss and a factional heavyweight—some would say `the' factional heavyweight—in the Labor Party. He said:
The plain and simple fact is this man rang up people and threatened them over the election of the Prime Minister of this country. He even followed one federal member into a toilet at the airport and threatened him.
These sorts of stories of threats and intimidation in the Labor Party are not a new phenomenon. Former Hawke and Keating minister the Hon. Peter Baldwin was viciously and savagely bashed about 20 years ago after he tried to expose Labor Party branch stackers. It has long been accepted that the assailants were from an opposing faction of the Labor Party. 
In September 1999, Labor Party rank and file member Samir Bargshoon walked out of the Arch Bar nightclub in the Western Sydney suburb of Liverpool after a few drinks. What the police later described as `unknown assailants' set upon the 36-year-old, stabbing and bashing him with knuckledusters. Three weeks earlier, Bargshoon had appeared on Nine's Sunday program where he had claimed that systemic branch stacking was rife in Liverpool's Labor Party branches. 
—What's that got to do with the electoral roll? 
—It has a lot to do with the electoral roll because, as you would know, member for Melbourne Ports, the evidence we received before the electoral matters committee is that the practices that have been breaching the electoral roll have come about as a consequence of the motivation of internal party mechanics and preselections in the Labor Party because you have a requirement that people have to be on the electoral roll in order to vote in your preselections. That is why it is important with respect to the electoral roll.
Opposition members interjecting— 
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! The member will address his remarks through the chair.
—In February of this year, Quentin Dempster, on the ABC Stateline program, exposed more instances of intimidation and threats by Labor Party factional players. The segment that went to air described the existence of a support group in New South Wales for ex-Labor political staffers. According to the program, the group meets each Tuesday evening at a small church in Balmain in the inner suburbs of Sydney. The members of the group are former staffers to several state and federal Labor members of parliament. Happily, in the Liberal Party there is no support group for former staff members who feel intimidated and threatened as a consequence of Liberal Party activity.
At the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission hearings, former state Labor member of parliament Grant Musgrove admitted involvement in electoral roll rorting in the southern outskirts of Brisbane, including the area which is in the federal seat of Rankin. Another senior Labor figure, Warwick Powell, also confessed to similar electoral roll rorting offences covering the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane at a time when he was working for the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd. Bermingham's testimony to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—
—Smear, smear!
—Well, listen. Bermingham's testimony to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral matters makes it quite clear that he does not know whether the current members for Rankin and Griffith had any knowledge of the fraudulent enrolments that occurred among their membership, but the fact is that the current electoral system has created the conditions that allow these sorts of confidence sapping allegations to be made. It is the challenge for us as parliamentarians to address these intrinsic flaws.
The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has heard allegations of false enrolments in the federal seat of Fisher in Queensland, as well as reports of organised fraudulent enrolments occurring on Bribie Island to the north-east of Brisbane. We have heard evidence that former district returning officers of the Australian Electoral Commission have detailed their own experiences of discovering improper enrolments and their concerns about how widespread it is. We have been made aware of the concept of floating members who transfer their enrolment from electorate to electorate for the purposes of gaining extra votes in a preselection. But evidence of fraudulent electoral manipulation is not confined to Queensland. In the last six months, allegations have surfaced of illegal enrolments by Labor Party members in the New South Wales seat of Robertson. The allegations were reportedly made by Belinda Neal, a former Labor senator, who would be well known to us, and wife of New South Wales state Labor minister—and sometime tax expert—John Della Bosca. Belinda Neal was surprisingly defeated in Labor preselection for that seat. 
In Victoria, Labor Senator Stephen Conroy has been named before the electoral matters committee as being involved in the operation of an Australian Workers Union slush fund. There are clearly some very serious concerns that the electoral roll has become a mere plaything for people with political ambitions. At a period when we should be trying to rebuild the public's faith in politicians and the electoral process, the Labor Party has undermined parliament's credibility. It is indicative of Labor's `win at all costs' attitude.
Labor has not made a genuine attempt to restore the public's confidence in the electoral process. The Labor Party, and in particular Senator Faulkner, have taken every opportunity to obstruct the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and have failed to make a constructive contribution to the work being done by the coalition and Democrat members of that committee. In doing so, Senator Faulkner and some of his Labor mates have employed the same standover tactics on the committee that they use in their internal party relationships.
—The member for Melbourne Ports interjects about the workings of the committee. He knows as a former member of the committee—who, for some strange reason, was removed from the committee and replaced by Robert McClelland—that the Labor Party has used every possible mechanism, procedural and otherwise, to try to discredit the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and to try to stop it from doing its work. Obviously we know why that is. It is because, on the ledger of electoral roll fraud which is being uncovered by the electoral matters committee, the ledger for the Labor Party severely outweighs that for any other side of politics.
Tragically, the Labor Party would rather bury their head in the sand. They would rather discredit the committee and not take responsibility for the damage they have done to the electoral process than accept responsibility and help clean up the mess that the Labor Party have created as a consequence of the sort of allegations that we have seen in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and, sadly, in South Australia—although the member for Port Adelaide, of course, is on the side of the angels in terms of the Labor Party in South Australia because he has supported the member for Enfield, Ralf Clark, in his attempts to clean up the Labor Party there. 
Nevertheless, evidence has come forward that in at least four states the Labor Party have been undermining the electoral roll in Australia. I would have hoped that Senator Faulkner and his comrades on the electoral matters committee would have tried to help clean up the mess rather than obfuscate and put up every hurdle possible to try to stop the electoral matters committee doing its work. They even went to the point of denying the committee leave of the Senate to be able to meet during parliamentary sitting times. That was simply a mechanism for trying to stop the committee taking evidence from AEC officers, who had been flown from Brisbane to give us evidence. That is the sort of measure they will go to to try to stop this committee from doing its work.
It is an accepted fact that an electoral roll will never always be completely correct. Occasionally some people in the community innocently and unintentionally forget to change or vary their enrolments. There is an onus on the Australian Electoral Commission and on us as legislators to restore the public's confidence in the operations of the Australian Electoral Commission. The electoral roll must not only be beyond repute but also be seen to be beyond repute.
There have been recent reports that in the Ryan by-election this month 2,137 personally addressed letters sent by the Liberal Party, based on information supplied by the Australian Electoral Commission, were returned. This would indicate that the voters who are enrolled at these addresses no longer live there and raises doubts as to their bona fides. We have all been there, as members of the lower house, when we have thousands of pieces of direct mail returned. In other words, about four per cent of the voters in the Ryan electorate appear not to have had a prima facie right to vote in the Ryan by-election. As the honourable members of this place would appreciate, four per cent can turn a result in a seat and could well have influenced the result in a close election.  
We cannot do as the Labor Party would have us do—that is, simply sweep these concerns under the carpet. There need to be some minimal procedures introduced into the electoral process. But, at the same time, we cannot afford to disenfranchise Australians from the democratic process. This is particularly problematic in the case of younger Australians who, generally speaking, appear to be reluctant to participate in the natural process. Is it any wonder, given the recent publicity over the convictions of Labor Party rorters?
There are already mechanisms in section 100 of the Electoral Act that encourage younger Australians to participate in the electoral process. For example, 17-year-olds are allowed to provisionally enrol in anticipation of turning 18 and being entitled to vote at elections following their 18th birthday. We cannot ignore the fact that the requirements for electoral enrolment are often less onerous than those for gaining membership at the local video shop. Indeed, the Australian Electoral Commission imposes higher standards in the ballots it conducts on behalf of some trade unions than it does in the election of federal governments.
The changes in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 presently before the House are the first in a series of steps to be taken by the coalition government in restoring the public's confidence in the electoral roll and our system of democracy. This bill contains technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The provisions of the bill arise from the government-supported recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report entitled The 1998 Federal Election.
It should be noted that these amendments are technical in nature and the recommendations upon which they are based were supported by all members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It is therefore anticipated that the bill will be given a timely passage, thereby allowing the Australian Electoral Commission sufficient time to implement the amendments prior to the next federal election. I hope the same treatment will be accorded the second amendment bill when the government brings that down, which I am sure will also go even further towards restoring people's faith in the integrity of the electoral system.
The coalition government is determined to restore the integrity of the electoral roll. I commend this bill to the House as a first step in the process of—hopefully with other bills that are brought in during this year—restoring people's faith in the integrity of the electoral roll.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—Unfortunately, the member for Sturt has demonstrated part of the reason why his electoral inquiry is not taken all that seriously. In rising to support the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001, I am very upset to hear the member for Sturt say that he had perceived that the Australian public's confidence in the Australian electoral system was shattered. This is an example of the kind of exaggeration that has undermined the credibility of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and undermines the very nature of some of the claims he is making here today. He gave us a vast and complicated story about the former member for Hinkler, but neglected to mention that the member for Hinkler was involved in a very vicious internal union ballot that perhaps coloured the nature of the remarks the former speaker was making.  
He talked about the federal seat of Ryan and the fact that four per cent of people on the roll there were not entitled to a vote. If the member for Sturt is reflecting the current government's thinking that electoral rorting was the reason that the poor old Howard government did not win the Ryan by-election, they are living in what the Germans call `Wolkenkuckschein'—cloud cuckoo land. The Australian people have very solid reasons for rejecting the current Australian government. At the election in Ryan for the first time in years the seat—incredibly—has been lost by the Liberal Party, the wealthiest seat in Brisbane. It is an indictment of the current government that the member for Sturt stands up and argues that the seat of Ryan was lost because of electoral rorting. 
Unfortunately, his committee has particularly discredited itself in recent days, compared to when Mr Nairn was the chairman of the committee, by its refusal to call the minister for sport, Jackie Kelly, before the committee. Four times the current chairman has used his casting vote to deny the committee, including the Democrats, of whom he spoke so highly, the right to call before the committee the minister to question her about very dubious electoral matters in Penrith. 
As Senator Faulkner pointed out last night to Mr Crosby, the Director of the Liberal Party, who was appearing before the committee, there is an Australian Federal Police investigation into this matter. Most fair-minded people, I think, would argue that if the Australian Federal Police are looking into it, this ought to be something that from a political point of view and from the point of view of the integrity of the electoral roll, an electoral rorts inquiry could look into. But no—the member for Sturt wants to use his casting vote again and again in an unprecedented way on this committee to prevent such an interview or meeting with the minister for sport. 
We have to remember, as Senator Faulkner has pointed out, that in December, without any warning, the former Queensland Liberal leader Dr David Watson failed to front the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. He was scheduled to address the Queensland Liberal Party submission on the electoral roll and he did not appear. The member for Sturt, the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, has cancelled further scheduled meetings of the committee because, I believe, the government realises that this inquiry has backfired on the coalition. 
Labor presented at the previous hearings of the committee a very detailed presentation by Mr Gary Gray and then by Mr Tim Gartrell. We had a number of suggestions which were considered by the previous chairman and by the previous committee under Mr Nairn in a much more non-partisan way. They were considered, and various aspects of them taken up. Unfortunately, we regard the current committee as so politically biased and loaded that it is hardly worth the National Secretary of the Liberal Party appearing before it, because the decisions, the attitudes, are already cast in stone. No information can be given to this committee that would allow matters to be considered in a non-partisan way that would improve the integrity of the electoral roll. 
I was particularly concerned at the earlier submission of the Liberal Party by Mr Lynton Crosby. His performance last night with Mr Pyne leads me to have strong doubts still about their attempts—and the member for Sturt has perhaps made a prediction that these things are going to come before us in another bill presented after this one—to deny younger people, and people who shift around, their right to vote. In the Australian electoral system we have a compulsory voting system. It is incumbent upon us as democrats on all sides of parliament to do everything we can to see that the largest number of people are on the electoral roll.
For instance, the size of my electorate, with around 90,000 voters, is typical of most electorates in Australia. We have 30,000 people transit through the area. In one electoral cycle there is a very high turnover area of people living in apartments and flats. The Electoral Commission, in cooperation with my office, does everything it can to see that these voters have their correct addresses. I think that to have addresses that are not correct for only four per cent of the people in Ryan—if that is what the member for Sturt alleges, and if that figure is in fact correct—is actually quite a good achievement, given that there are probably around 90,000 voters in that electorate too. The point is that we need to do everything we can to see that these voters have the right to vote when it comes to an election because of the compulsory voting system. 
The proposals that Mr Crosby advanced were that we should not permit younger people who are coming on to the electoral roll for the first time to use the five days after the election is called to register to vote. I think that would be a terrible indictment on Australian democracy if we allowed that. As I understand it, at the last election some 65,000 first-time voters—17- and 18-year-olds—used the opportunity of the five days after the declaration of the poll to present and to enrol to vote. I think that is a great and important achievement for Australian democracy. Similarly, some 350,000 people used the same period of time to register their correct address. You have to remember that it is not electoral rorting that is behind the mentality of most ordinary Australians who change their address, as the member for Sturt and Mr Crosby from the Liberal Party seem to imply in their submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters—and I will come back to that in a minute—but the fact that politics is not at the front of their mind.
I understand that the systems now used by the Australian Electoral Commission to track people to get their correct address are becoming more and more sophisticated. There are positive suggestions being taken on board in this legislation that will help with that. Apart from targeted doorknocking, which I understand the Electoral Commission have done very extensively—for instance, in Queensland where there have been two tranches of doorknocking involving more than 100,000 voters each time—the Electoral Commission are trying to track people via the motor registries and other databases where people often give their new address before they give it to the Electoral Commission. People do not register with the AEC, I repeat, not because they are trying to rort the electoral role but simply because politics is not at the front of their mind and it is perhaps more important to give their address to a licensing authority before they alert the Electoral Commission.
The other aspect of the extraordinary activities of the member for Sturt and his `house unAustralian activities committee'—as he has tried to turn the committee into—that I believe should be paid attention to is the context of electoral fraud in Australia. The Australian Electoral Commission in their submission to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters pointed out to us that, prior to the allegations in Queensland, there had been some 71 cases of proven electoral fraud in the last decade. The point about that is that in the last decade, as I asked the chairman of the AEC, the Australian people have voted six times: once in a constitutional convention, once in a referendum and in four elections—that is, 12 million voters have made their democratic rights known six times. That adds up to, by my simple arithmetic, 72 million votes. Even if we add Senator Ferris's example of the cat that was fraudulently enrolled for a brief period of time in 1990 in the seat of Macquarie, that brings us to 72 proven cases of electoral fraud—one case per million over the previous decade. 
In my view, the Australian electoral system is in a lot finer shape than the American electoral system, for instance, which had so many problems attendant on the presidential election. I believe it should be seen in that context. The Queensland government addressed the particular problems in Townsville by having the equivalent of a royal commission, an investigation that had powers to imprison and gaol people. We have not yet heard the final recommendations of the Shepherdson inquiry, which was a responsible way of dealing with the outbreak that took place in Queensland. But there is no evidence whatsoever that there were sufficient numbers of people in any electorate, even in the Queensland example cited at the Shepherdson inquiry, to have fundamentally changed any election in Australia. To say, as the member for Sturt has said, that the electoral rorting in Queensland has shattered the Australian public's confidence in the electoral system and then to make the absurd allegation that electoral rorting was the reason that the poor present coalition government lost the seat of Ryan is an exaggeration that discredits the committee, discredits serious investigation of the electoral roll and ruins non-partisan attempts to improve the integrity of the electoral roll. 
I was concerned about a number of things in the submission of Mr Lynton Crosby and the Liberal Party, particularly their submission on Queensland. It comes back to what I was saying before about the average Australian person's reasons for perhaps not registering their change of address for the electoral roll as quickly as they might, doing it with road traffic authorities or other people first—and that there is a very extensive and increasingly professional effort by the Australian Electoral Commission to track them via various databases. This submission by Mr Crosby involved thousands of pages of Queensland voters, 60 or 70 people per page, who the Liberal Party implied were involved in rorting the electoral roll in Queensland. These were ordinary Australians, ordinary Queenslanders, who had different surnames at the same address, perhaps Asian surnames where people could not tell the first name from the second name. Some places where more than four people were registered at one address were nursing homes with a large number of people registered at the one address or were student accommodation. It is a shame that Mr Crosby and the Liberal Party have implied that 130,000 Queenslanders were involved in electoral rorting. It certainly does not bring any credit to their submission.
The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 is supported by the opposition. It contains amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. These amendments arise from unanimous recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters. In the unanimity of those recommendations we have a clue to why the committee, particularly in its inquiry into electoral rorts, has worked so badly. The change in the nature of the committee under its previous chairman to its nature under the current chairman is manifest to anyone who attends the committee. The ability in this parliament to get legislation and ideas up does not necessarily depend simply on using your casting vote all the time. Using your casting vote four times may be a lot of fun in student politics—I was there once too, but that is 25 years ago. It is often better to try and make sure that all sides are catered for, particularly when you have had a reference from the Senate—people from the Senate are used to more even-handed discussion of issues and to being able to express their views, even though they may be in a minority. The unfortunate way the current committee is operated has meant that it is, in effect, totally broken down. That is why I suspect the coalition has pulled the plug on further hearings of the committee. I expect this inquiry to fade away with a nasty whimper.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—Since its standardisation through the Commonwealth electoral and franchise acts of 1902, Australia's electoral system has evolved into something that is exceptional in terms of inclusiveness, integrity and fairness, despite an occasional blight. While it is clearly not perfect and there is room for improvement, its substantial achievements in contributing to the strength of Australian democracy should not be overlooked. 
The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters provides parliament with recommendations for reform and improvement for its consideration. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 that is before us today is another step in the progressive and continuous improvement of Australia's electoral machinery. As the preceding speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports, said, it does have bipartisan support. It puts forward a number of technical measures to amend both the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act.  
The bill is the result of the committee's inquiries into the 1998 election and the amendments do have bipartisan support. It deals with a range of comparatively uncontroversial measures, and I wish to speak about some of those. I commend the measures to ease the process of enrolment and voting for those Australians who are living overseas at the time of elections. Honourable members will recall that citizens who cease to reside in Australia because of their career or employment, or the career and employment of their spouse, and who intend to return to Australia within six years, may enrol to vote. In many of these instances, these people will need a postal vote to exercise their voting rights. Currently, an application to enrol must be witnessed by someone who is on the electoral roll or who is eligible to be on that roll. 
To obtain a postal vote or to vote using a postal vote overseas, the application or the certificate must be signed by an authorised witness. People authorised to witness these forms include other Australian citizens, Commonwealth public servants, justices of the peace from Australia or other Commonwealth countries, or the officers of the naval, military or armed forces of other Commonwealth countries. Ministers of religion or medical practitioners living in a Commonwealth country may also witness the form. This list of authorised witnesses is extensive but there are many circumstances in which Australian citizens may not be able to locate a witness, particularly if they are resident in a non-Commonwealth country. 
The amendments proposed in this bill offer an alternative to this. In lieu of the authorised witness, electors will be able to lodge a certified copy of those parts of their passport containing the country and date of issue, the number of the passport, their name, date of birth, signature and photograph. They must also write to explain why they were unable to find an authorised witness. These provisions will make our voting system more accessible by offering Australian citizens an alternative when they apply to enrol or vote by post from outside Australia. A certified copy of the passport will maintain the integrity of the system while facilitating the exercise of democratic rights. It is particularly important for Australians not living close to Australian embassies or consulates or who are living outside the Commonwealth. It is a step forward in terms of a more accessible and inclusive voting system.
The bill will amend the act to correct an anomaly. Currently, under section 94A, electors who enrol overseas are eligible to do so for up to two years after they have left Australia. However, under section 94, if electors are enrolled when they leave Australia, they have only one year to apply as overseas electors. The bill proposes to amend section 94 so that voters currently enrolled also have two years to apply to become overseas electors. 
The bill also proposes to add greater clarity to the nomination process. Currently, the act provides that a political party may nominate someone to replace a candidate who dies or withdraws his or her nomination before the close of nominations provided that it is an individual nomination. The law is silent when nominations are so-called bulk nominations. This may seem to be a minor matter, but as somebody who has been responsible for bulk nominations, this sort of issue caused a great deal of concern, stress and sweat late at night. 
Two issues are essentially involved. The first is whether the bulk nomination can be amended or whether it has to be withdrawn and resubmitted. In the past, the only practical solution was the withdrawal and resubmission of the full bulk nomination. The bill allows for the amendment of the bulk nomination. It is, as I said, a technicality but not having it could have very substantial consequences. You can afford to do lots of things wrong in politics but one thing that you cannot afford to do is to have invalid nomination forms. 
The second issue relates to timing. The deadline for bulk nominations has been set to 24 hours before that of individual nominations. While this is a sensible administrative practice, particularly for the Electoral Commission in seeking to reduce the demands on it, it does leave a period of exposure for parties using bulk nomination. The question is: what if a candidate dies or withdraws in the 24 hours between the deadline for bulk nominations and the close of nomination? Because the act is currently silent on this, there would be doubt about the validity of any amendment to the bulk nomination made in this last period. The proposed amendments clarify this issue and make it clear that the amendment may be made anytime in the 24-hour period until the close of nomination. As I said, these apparently technical changes are very important in clarifying the situation and in ensuring that people can act with security in lodging nominations, which is the first step to being elected—you just need to make sure that it is not your last. In an effort to clarify the rules governing the lodgment of group or individual voting tickets for Senate elections, the bill proposes a technical amendment to the act which allows those who have lodged a voting ticket to amend, withdraw or replace a ticket by giving written notice to the AEC. Currently this is only implied, and the amendment will make the situation explicit. This is a logical clarification of the act.
Finally, the bill will give divisional returning officers or the Australian Electoral Commission the power to refuse to include on the roll inappropriate names. In recent years, there has been a trend for people to use names for electoral, political or commercial purposes. This was clearly never the intention of the act. It was not the intention of the parliament to give candidates free publicity for their particular cause or for their business. In the last election, there were candidates named Mr Prime Minister-expletive deleted-the Family Court and Legal Aid and Mr Justice Abolish Child Support and Family Court. In the recent Ryan by-election, one of the candidates was named Mr Nigel David Freemarijuana of the Help End Marijuana Prohibition Party. In Victoria, Mr Prime Minister-expletive deleted-the Family Court and Legal Aid took the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages to court when he refused to register the name on the basis that either it was not a name or it was offensive in nature. The court decided in favour of the registrar on the basis that a name could not be a grammatical string and it could not be divided into a first name and a surname.
This amendment will maintain appropriate standards for elections and ensure that people who wish to run for public office do not turn themselves into walking, talking election slogans. Of course, these decisions will be appealable both to the AEC and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the bill proposes to extend the current Electoral Act to cover these new sections. In conclusion, I believe that the amendments proposed to the Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act continue the tradition of finetuning and clarifying our electoral system. It is a very important electoral system and, despite the disputes that break out over how good it is, I believe that we need to keep these things in perspective.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I am pleased to support the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 this morning. As I am sure has been pointed out, it contains technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, arising from the unanimous recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters titled The 1998 Federal Election. I am pleased that these recommendations, which have unanimous support, have been put before the parliament. I think they will add value to the electoral system, which, as other members have pointed out, is very important when we are balancing needs in a democracy. I do, however, want to make a number of observations about other recommendations in the report. In particular, I refer to the recommendation regarding redistributions. The report rightly observes: 
It has become obvious during this inquiry that there is considerable unawareness—
I would perhaps have said `lack of awareness'—
about the process of redistributions and the level of public consultation throughout the process.
I think that is true. I have been through a process where my electorate has undergone a redistribution. At the next federal election the Northern Territory will be split into two seats. Those two seats will be called Solomon, which will encompass Darwin and Palmerston, and Lingiari, which will encompass the rest of the Northern Territory and the Christmas and Cocos islands. In that context, in the context of this report, and in the spirit of the recommendations that are being discussed here this morning, I took part in a public debate on the question of the redistribution in the Northern Territory. 
In order to provide suggestions for names for the two new electorates, we formed a public committee. We contacted every voter in the Northern Territory and provided them with a document which gave them an opportunity to suggest names for the two new electorates. I am happy to say that the committee, of which I was not a part, and as a result of the nomination of 150 different names from the wider community in the Northern Territory, came up with a list of five names which I included in my submission to the Electoral Commission on the question of boundaries. I am happy to say that those five names included the two that were nominated by the Electoral Commission. That is important in the context of public education, because I sought to involve the community in giving their views on the names which should be put forward. I did not seek to impose my view on what either name should be.
I was pleased to see the outcome. There was some controversy about the name `Solomon' because the individual concerned was someone who had lived, in contemporary terms, what could be called a topical life in terms of his attitudes towards people of other races. Whilst you and I, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure would be at great variance with him on those views, the fact is that none of us can sit in this place—certainly as members of the Labor Party, or as members on the conservative side of politics—and not recognise that, at the turn of the last century and during the decades prior to that, anti-Aboriginal sentiment in this country was rife. It is reflected in the nature of our Constitution, which does not properly recognise indigenous Australians. The anti Asian immigration debate was a major factor; thus the white Australia policy was first aired in the early 1900s.
It is not surprising that this gentleman Solomon should reflect such views. Nevertheless, they would be abhorrent today. But despite that debate, his name is retained in the seat of Solomon. Lingiari, of course, is named after one of the people instrumental in securing land rights for indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. He was the leader of the walk-off at Wave Hill where, in dispute with Lord Vestey, Aboriginal stockmen and their families walked off the property and set up a camp near Wattie Creek that now is a community at Daguragu. His family members and other relatives still live there and it is, I think, great for the Australian community that we should have a seat named after Mr Lingiari. I applaud that decision.
I want to make some observations, however, about the redistribution. I know that it is not for this place to seek to amend the recommendations on redistribution, but I am concerned because I think this redistribution has come up with the wrong result. I just make an observation. We are talking about a second seat in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory seat is currently 1.33 million square kilometres or thereabouts. It includes all of the Northern Territory, the islands off the coast, Croker Island, Groote Eylandt and Bathurst Island, plus, of course, in the Indian Ocean, Christmas and the Cocos Islands. It came as a surprise to me that in undertaking this redistribution, the recommendations were to have one electorate of something less than 300,000 square kilometres—Darwin and Palmerston—and the other 1.3 million square kilometres for the rest. You come from a rural electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker, so you would understand as I do the difficulties in mounting coherent arguments in terms of unifying the community when we have got so many illustrations of a prescriptive urban-bush divide. We have got, as a result of this redistribution, writ large now in the Northern Territory an urban-bush divide, something which has hitherto not existed, and I think that is a great pity.  
When I made submissions to the Electoral Commission, I thought they were very well thought out and to the point. We proposed to the redistribution committee that they divide the electorate basically down the middle and give us two electorates which were demographically and geographically similar so that we would not have this artifice of the divide between the city and country but rather two electorates which would share common characteristics, still be within the quota limits and have areas roughly the same. I am sure you could see the merit in that, Madam Deputy Speaker. Instead of having one electorate of 300 square kilometres which contains the urban populations of Darwin and Palmerston and another of 1.3 million square kilometres which contains all the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and the other urban centres, plus Christmas and Cocos islands, we would have had two electorates, one of which would have been on the east of the Stuart Highway and the other effectively on the west of the Stuart Highway reflecting the same attributes. That seemed to be a bit beyond the comprehension of the conservative political parties in this country and they were not prepared to comes to terms with it. 
Unfortunately, it is political self-interest which has driven that argument because clearly it is a view—one which I do not share, incidentally—that as a result of this redistribution, one seat will be notionally Labor and one seat will be notionally Liberal or conservative. It is true that on the basis of past election results, that appears to be the case. But frankly, I do not believe it to be the case. 
It is my strong view that, if we were to create two electorates which were more marginal than they currently are under the new boundaries, we would get a fairer redistribution. That was not accepted by the electoral redistribution committee or by the conservative political parties. As a result, we have created two electorates which have vastly different interests and vastly different population bases. It seems to me that we have lost an opportunity. I hope that, when there are future redistributions as there will be inevitably—and there will never be more than two seats in the Northern Territory, let us be clear about that—we look at drawing those boundaries in a radically different way.
I made the point in my submissions that there was every potential for the Northern Territory to revert back to one seat in some subsequent redistribution, as has happened in the ACT. You will recall that there were three seats in the ACT and that, as a result of a subsequent redistribution, as the population was below the quota it reverted to two seats. In the context of the Northern Territory, that is important. We have noticed over recent times that the population of the Northern Territory is changing. Over the last two years, there has been a net loss in terms of the migrant population of 2,132 people in the Northern Territory. People are moving out of the place at a great rate of knots. The sustaining characteristic of the Northern Territory population base at the moment is the birth rate of the indigenous population. We are going to see in the future, as a result of the way in which the population is moving, an increase in the proportion of the population who are Aboriginal Australians compared with the rest, and that is because of natural population increase. Currently, because of the policies of the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, we are seeing the population declining in terms of those people who hitherto were moving into the Territory. We are losing those people. 
We have seen a radically different population base as a result of large movements of Defence Force personnel into the community. But we need to understand that more people are leaving the Northern Territory than are arriving. Bearing in mind what I have said about the natural population increase, there can only be one conclusion: ultimately, if this trend continues, we will end up with a population curve which, in terms of the redistribution quota, will go down against the national increase and we will revert to one seat. I hope that does not happen, and I am sure that we can take steps in this place to ensure that it does not. But there is, theoretically at least, a potential for it and, if it  happens, we will be in the same position we are in now. I would have thought, as I pleaded to the redistribution committee, that it would be much fairer that we have two seats now which are roughly similar.
The way that the boundaries have been redrawn ignores the community of interest arguments that exist in the Northern Territory. When we went to the redistribution committee hearing, the committee was good enough to produce maps on the basis of my representations. The maps demonstrated clearly that within the quota constrictions it was statistically possible to develop two electorates that would fit the criteria and meet the objective needs of the Northern Territory and not, as has been done now, provide us with very different communities of interest between the cities of Darwin and Palmerston and the rest of the Northern Territory. What we should be doing—and it is a position that I put at the time—is aiming to create unity within the Territory community. My view is that the redistribution will ultimately create division and that we will be left—as you are left, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, in your electorate and as is the case elsewhere in Queensland—with people in the bush arguing against the people in the city, and where the interests of the people in the bush will be seen as different from—and against—the interests of the people in the city, and vice versa.
I do not think that is in the national interest, yet it suited the CLP in the Northern Territory and, dare I say, the coalition parties, to support propositions which will inevitably have the result of exacerbating things and being a catalyst for those divisions. What we will see in the issues that are going to be debated by the respective members of those two seats is a clear economic and social division. That is not in the community's interest. It was not an argument that was accepted by the redistribution committee, and it was not an argument that was accepted by the coalition parties in this place or by the CLP in the Northern Territory
Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, I do not want to put you on the spot, because you cannot respond, but I know that you and your colleagues, as members of the National Party, are vitally aware of these issues. Given where we are in the political cycle, I would have thought that even the most casual observer would put aside their political self-interests in what is less marginal or more marginal seats and, in this environment where we are doing a redistribution, talk about what is in the best interests of the nation.
Frankly, it is a lost opportunity. Instead of having a unified approach of accepting the importance to Darwin and Alice Springs of regional interplay between communities outside Darwin and Alice Springs, and the important focus of Darwin as the civil and commercial centre, the transport hub for the whole of the Northern Territory, so that they have linkages which are interdependent—instead of accepting that argument, we have seen presentations which say we should divorce that argument from our analysis of what is important in terms of redistributions in the Northern Territory. Frankly, I think we have failed the Northern Territory community. At least, I have not, but I believe the electoral redistribution committee has, and I think the submissions from the CLP also have, and I am very concerned at the potential for this to cause future division in the Northern Territory.
It is no surprise to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that one of the other issues which is writ large is the difference between the interests of indigenous Australians and the people who live in Darwin. The bulk of the Northern Territory's indigenous population live outside Darwin. The people who live in Maningrida, and those other places, whilst they depend on Darwin, live in very different conditions from the people of Darwin. And we have had debates in this place about things such as petrol where I have been able to demonstrate that. 
I am strongly of the view that this was an opportunity for a redistribution which would have given us two seats based on the current population, or the then population of the Northern Territory, which would have been fair to the people of the Northern Territory. I am sure that, come the next federal election, both seats will be keenly fought. There are those who have made the judgment that one is Labor and one is conservative; I do not share that view. It would have been far better for the people of Australia had we agreed on a view that the best way to divide the Northern Territory electorates would be one that is fair to everyone. In my view the redistribution does not deliver that outcome.
As I said at the outset, I am pleased to be able to support this legislation. I hope that, at some future point, we will revisit this issue of redistributions, in particular the redistribution of the Northern Territory. When the redistribution committee comes to look again at the redistribution, if we have not fallen below the quota, I will argue very strongly for what I put last time: a redistribution which is fair and equitable to all Territorians and which is in the best interests of the people of Australia, not to the cause of self interest.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—As all honourable members know, the government is committed to electoral reform and we have introduced a number of bills which seek to implement these very important changes to make sure that we have integrity of the electoral roll. It is important that our electoral system is effective and honest, because this is fundamental to the credibility of Australia's democracy. To this end, the government has driven electoral reform on a range of fronts, and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 is part of that. 
I have listened very carefully to a number of the speeches made by Labor members concerning this bill and, in particular, I noted very carefully the comments just made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. There is no doubt that when electoral redistributions are to be made, all members of parliament, regardless of their political allegiance, take a very keen interest. The drawing of those boundaries can determine whether a political career is prematurely truncated, and as a consequence people may not have the opportunity to continue to serve the people of their particular electorates.
All political parties look at the terms of reference and make submissions to the Electoral Commission. We have an independent Electoral Commission—but, listening to the member for the Northern Territory, one would think that he was suggesting that the Electoral Commission was in bondage to the attitudes of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. The general process, broadly speaking, begins with submissions being invited from political parties and members of the public. Those submissions are received and then considered before the Electoral Commission ultimately drafts boundaries. Those draft boundaries are announced and published. There is a period for consultation and for objection. So it is an open and transparent process. I suppose that all political parties, when looking at redistributions, endeavour to put in submissions in the interests of the community at large. There is no doubt that in the Northern Territory the parties put in submissions like that too, but, in addition, political parties probably could be forgiven for also having one eye on their electoral fortunes.
Section 66(3)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 refers to matters which the Electoral Commission shall give consideration to in determining the boundaries of each proposed electoral division. They are: 
(i)	community of interests within the proposed Electoral Division, including economic, social and regional interests;
(ii) means of communication and travel within the proposed Electoral Division;
(iv) the physical features and area of the proposed Electoral Division; and 
(v) the boundaries of existing Divisions in the State or Territory;
Obviously, the last point did not refer to the Northern Territory because at this stage it only had one division. But the member for the Northern Territory appeared to be arguing that the Electoral Commission should have produced two divisions which had a community of interest with each other, whereas the Electoral Act requires that the Electoral Commission produce electoral boundaries with communities of interest within the particular electorates. It is not possible within a state or territory for all electorates to have identical communities of interest, so the Electoral Commission obviously sought, in its independent judgment, to produce two divisions in the Northern Territory to replace the existing division, and to ensure that those two divisions each had communities of interest and that the divisional boundaries conformed with the requirements of section 66(3)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
The member for Melbourne Ports suggested that the claims of electoral rorting were exaggerated. I think that Australians expect that any allegation of fraud should be dealt with vigorously. It is important and fundamental to our democracy that there be integrity of the electoral system. It is important that people, when they vote on polling day and when the results are announced, can be confident that the declared results of the election represent what was, on the day, the collective will of the people. That is why this government is determined to make sure that all allegations of fraud are fully investigated. A substantial portion of the community is disillusioned with the political process, and it is important that we get those people back so that they feel they have a stake in Australia and have confidence in the electoral system. That is why the government is not going to apologise for investigating all allegations of electoral fraud very, very vigorously.
The government continues its efforts to obtain the cooperation of the states. There is a need for the states to proclaim complementary regulations and legislation to support Commonwealth legislative initiatives, and some proposed reform is currently being hindered by the states. Quite frankly, I believe that, in the national interest, those states ought to look at expediting their favourable consideration of the Commonwealth's requests.
The member for the Northern Territory also claimed that there was inadequate public consultation on electoral distributions or names. As I have said before, a redistribution is announced, submissions are called for, there is a period when people can lodge objections, and the committee then considers the objections and submissions and comes up with a proposal. The proposal is made public, a period of time is allowed for people to lodge comments on the objections, the committee considers those and then may hold public hearings—one was held in Darwin—and then the committee makes a final decision and publishes it. Quite frankly, the comments made by the member for the Northern Territory in this area, as in so many other areas on so many other bills, have absolutely no veracity at all.
The member for Sturt spoke in a very competent and erudite way about electoral reform and electoral systems. He indeed ought to be commended on the job that he is doing as chairman of the committee which is currently investigating certain matters which have been referred to it. The committee has also heard evidence about electoral rorting by the Australian Labor Party in 1987 in the electorate of Fisher—and those allegations helped to bring about the current inquiry. 
The member for Melbourne claimed that Liberal Party recommendations from the 1998 election report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters have not been put in this bill. Largely, there is some accuracy in what he says, but the reason is that the recommendations have been split into two bills and the second one is currently being drafted. These recommendations have been split into two bills because those amendments which are considered only technical in nature ought to be dealt with speedily through parliament and be in place for the next federal election. While we are hopeful that the other matters will be in place for the next federal election, the second bill will contain recommendations which are more reform in nature—they might be a little more controversial—and we would not want the technical amendments, which we hope will enjoy the support of everyone, held up while the other matters are being debated.
As I stated at the time of the introduction of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001, this bill contains technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The amendments arise from the government's support of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report entitled The 1998 federal election. Timely passage of the bill would allow the AEC sufficient time to implement the amendments prior to the next federal election. The amendments, when proclaimed, will result in improvements to the conduct of federal elections and the electoral system generally. Further legislative reforms, as I said before, are planned for the future. The government notes that all members of the joint standing committee support these amendments and trusts that swift passage of the bill will be the result of this.
I call upon all honourable members to note the worthwhile provisions in this bill to improve the integrity of the electoral process, including the technical improvements I mentioned before. I specifically note, however, that such useful reforms as the measures to improve verification of the identity of those enrolling or voting overseas; dealing with names for enrolment that may be fictitious, frivolous, offensive or obscene; providing that abbreviations of a party name be based on that name; and other useful amendments will result in better functioning electoral system initiatives that I hope will be supported by all honourable members.
In closing, I commend the bill to the chamber and I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001 seeks to increase the Commonwealth's core funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation with effect from 1 July. I indicate from the outset that the opposition will be supporting the legislation in line with our continuing commitment to a viable and forward-looking wood and paper industry.
As the actual provisions of the bill are straightforward, my contribution essentially will concentrate on the history, current functions and funding arrangements for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. The corporation is, in fact, a product of Labor's 1992 national forest policy statement, as was the wood and paper industry strategy of 1995, the national regional forest agreements process and plantations 2020—all of them have their genesis in the previous Labor government's activities.
That national forest policy statement set out an ambitious medium-term policy blueprint for the forestry industry, as agreed between the Commonwealth and all states and territories. It sought to address in a balanced way both industry development and conservation requirements and was jointly developed by the Australian Forestry Council, and the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council in consultation with relevant stakeholders. I have to say—and I think the member for McMillan will be aware of this—that unfortunately over the past two to three years the industry has not been characterised by any endeavour at a federal level to cooperate with the various state governments around this country. The federal minister has essentially found himself in conflict not only with a variety of state Labor governments but also with the Western Australian and Victorian coalition governments on various occasions. 
The final statement was signed by all the participating governments, with the exception of Tasmania, at the Council of Australian Governments meeting that was held in Perth in December 1992. Tasmania subsequently agreed to become a signatory on 12 April 1995. One of the 11 national goals of the NFPS concerned research and development. The goal of that element of the then NFPS was to increase Australia's national forest research and development effort and to ensure that this effort was well coordinated, efficiently undertaken and effectively applied. Section 4.10 of the NFPS went on to state:
An enhanced, better coordinated and better focussed research and development effort will be essential if the Governments' vision and goals for Australian forests and forest industries are to be achieved. Further research is needed in a number of broad subject areas: forest ecosystems and biological diversity; resource evaluation and inventory; the ecological and environmental impact of forest disturbance and management regimes; forest protection, covering disease, pests and fire; silvicultural techniques; forest productivity; wood processing and utilisation; product development; economic and marketing aspects; and other non-wood aspects of forests, such as wildfire management, recreation, and cultural and heritage values.
This overall research agenda was obviously ambitious and all-encompassing. The R&D section of the statement, on pages 33 and 34, went on to say:
The Commonwealth government, in partnership with the forest industries, will establish the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, the charter of which will be to identify priorities and to commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into a broad range of issues relating to wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing. Among these issues will be the impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture, and management of native forests and plantations; the commercial and economic aspects of wood production; and research of relevance to the wood products industries. The new Corporation will be encouraged to ensure effective communication of research results to scientists, industry, land managers and the wider community through a scientific journal and more widely distributed magazines. It will also administer the Forestry Postgraduate Research Award Program.
The Commonwealth Government will support plantation research through the new Corporation. Research into commercial wood production on farms will be dealt with by the new Corporation in cooperation with the joint agroforestry research and development program developed by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation. Where appropriate, the State Governments and industry will support this.
Subsequently, legislation in the form of amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 was introduced by the former Labor government to establish the R&D corporation. Following the passage of this amending legislation, the corporation commenced operations in January 1994—just over seven years ago.
The charter of the R&D corporation is to invest in research for the forest and wood products industry and to facilitate the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of the results of the R&D activities in which it invests. I stress that the corporation is essentially an investor in research and development. Unlike the CSIRO, the various cooperative research centres, universities and certain state forestry agencies, it is not an agency that conducts research and development. In its activities, the corporation seeks both to address market failure, in terms of the observed tendency for individual firms to underinvest in R&D activities—I think we are quite aware that over the last two to three years that reached crisis point, not only in forestry but in the broader Australian industry—and to promote the public good in terms of producing outcomes that benefit society as a whole. The corporation is based in Melbourne and has a small secretariat of six full-time staff who are answerable to a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation.  
In its first seven years of operation, the corporation has been funded by a combination of means. Firstly, the timber industry contributes through a levy on unprocessed wood produced in Australia and a charge on all imports of unprocessed and certain primary processed wood products. According to the corporation's most recent annual report, these two industry levies totalled some $2.7 million in 1999-2000. To date, the Commonwealth's core funding has been on the base of $1 for every $2 of the industry levy payments. This approach was originally adopted because part of the forests and wood products industry was seen to be of a primary industry nature and part was viewed as essentially manufacturing. On the other hand, I acknowledge that the Commonwealth's contribution to all other research and development corporations established under the 1989 act was on a dollar for dollar basis.
During the consultation process for the government's forest and wood products industry action agenda, the industry lobbied for the Commonwealth contribution to be increased so that it was on a dollar for dollar basis. Following cabinet consideration on this action agenda, Minister Tuckey announced, on 5 September 2000, that the Commonwealth contribution would be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis with effect from 1 July this year. The bill that we are considering today seeks to give effect to that announcement. The exact budget impact of the proposed change in core Commonwealth funding will depend on the actual level of the industry levy payments in future years. This in turn depends on both the industry's volume of production on which the levy is based and on the rate of the levy applied to that production level. The government estimates that the likely level of additional government funding will be approximately $1.6 million a year.
I am happy to indicate the opposition's support for this modest but welcome increase in core funding. We do so because we are committed to a viable and productive wood and paper products industry and we recognise the importance of research and development in contributing to that objective. I note that we are also committed to continuing active involvement by the Commonwealth in forest policy and industry development. 
In endorsing the increase in funding to the R&D corporation, I note that it has also been in receipt of significant amounts of other Commonwealth funding since its establishment. The most significant sources of this other funding have been project funding under Labor's wood and paper industry strategy—WAPIS—and under the farm forestry component of the government's Natural Heritage Trust. Over the two most recent financial years for which data is available to me, 1998-99 and 1999-2000, my office has calculated that WAPIS funding to the corporation totalled over $2½ million and NHT funding totalled $700,000. In other words, over those two years Commonwealth project funding exceeded $3.2 million, while Commonwealth core funding, linked to the industry levies, was just on $3 million. 
Thus, in welcoming the increase in funding provided for in this bill, I stress that we should not overlook the importance of Commonwealth project funding to the corporation in recent years. Indeed, the opposition will be closely examining the forthcoming federal budget to see whether that level of project funding is likely to continue to be available to the corporation in the years ahead. Apart from the fact that the NHT has another year to run, until June 2002, to date there has been no indication to this effect from the government.
In concluding my contribution to the debate, I note that this measure constitutes the sole initiative—the Robinson Crusoe—thus far under Minister Tuckey's forest and wood products industry action agenda. It is much heralded and there is much rhetoric about it, but this is the sole financial contribution that we have had to it. I have referred on other occasions to the drawn-out, almost tortuous, nature of the action agenda process. The minister first announced his intention to develop an action agenda, with much fanfare, way back in December 1998; not 1999 or 2000, but 1998. At the time he promised everyone that the final strategy would be completed in June 1999. That is when it was going to be finished. That deadline passed without any sign of this so-called action agenda being ready. A further 17 months later, something happened—17 months after the schedule. Something happened, not 17 months after the original announcement but 17 months after the original supposed deadline.  
After much toing-and-froing and sustained pressure from the opposition for the establishment of a proper industry council, the final version of the action agenda was eventually released by the government in November last year. What was originally supposed to take the minister only seven months to complete actually took him a full two years. Owing to the inactivity of the previous industry minister, who had said, `All of this industry assistance and industry development is a total waste of time,' I have to admit that the minister had a pretty difficult legacy when he took over the portfolio.
In the event, the action agenda did not set out a detailed funding strategy on the Commonwealth's behalf—unlike Labor's wood and paper industry strategy of 1995. In fact, Minister Tuckey's plan contained only one funding commitment, and that is the measure addressed in this bill. After two years plus, after the industry is expectant, waiting aghast for change, development and assistance, the only financial initiative is the one we have in this bill. This is sum toto, the end; that is the action agenda.
I recently received an answer from the minister to a question on notice seeking clarification of the funding for the action agenda. The minister's answer indicated that funding for other action agenda measures will be considered by cabinet as part of the 2001-02 budget process, taking into account the recommendations of his recently appointed advisory council. He has told us there is a commitment and he said it will be in the budget process, but I am afraid the track record is pretty sad. The level of inactivity in regard to industry assistance in this field is extremely abysmal, given the minister's rhetoric over the past two years about our trade deficit in wood and paper products, which, of course, as the Deputy Speaker and all those present will know, has severely worsened in the interim. Despite all the speeches, all the rhetoric and his professed commitment to the timber industry, the inactivity has got worse. I can promise the minister  that the opposition will be closely examining the forthcoming budget to see just how much funding the coalition is willing to devote to its action agenda.
—Does that mean you are going to pass it?
—The member opposite, who of course was a very prominent attendee at the TCA conference last month, stayed for quite a while compared to the minister. She would have noted the very strong message that the industry is now giving this government: they are sick of the name-calling; they are sick of the rhetoric; they are sick of the attacks and of the blues between state and federal governments; they do not want to hear from the federal government and federal members.
—They want the RFA legislation passed and you know that.
—We will come to that in a second. They do. Very clearly they want the RFA legislation passed. The industry made it very clear to the minister that they just do not want to hear any more of this slagging off, these constant attacks on whoever he is fighting with, whether it is the Victorian Liberal minister, a Queensland Labor minister, Richard Court or the other Liberal ministers over there that held CALM before. They are sick and tired of it. They want industry assistance. They want money for exit from the industry. They want money for people to be retrained and to be given alternative employment. The industry made that very clear. They have made it clear to us as a party and as an opposition. They made it clear at their conference. They gave a message to Mr Tuckey in regard to the need for assistance. 
—Are you going to vote for it?
—The member opposite asks the Labor Party's view in regard to the RFA legislation. As I announced at that conference, in the aftermath of Western Australia, Labor's fundamental need to block this legislation has disappeared. It is very clear that our reasons for opposing this legislation have disappeared. 
I hope that is a very firm message. I think the situation in WA was doubly sad because WA typified the kind of problems the minister is starting to now run into with his credibility. He knew quite clearly from day one that the WA coalition government could not sustain every job in the industry. Quite frankly, he can attack ex-Premier Court, he can attack the Leader of the National Party over there, he can attack half the Liberal Party in the state caucus, he can do a Katter all he wants, attacking his own party the whole time, but those people faced up to the realities, where he misled the industry. He misled the workers in WA, saying that it was sustainable. Quite frankly, the reality now is that the industry over there want federal assistance. They want help. They no longer want to hear attacks by Wilson Tuckey on a new state Labor administration or its Liberal predecessors.",REPS,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—I rise to speak in support of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001. Australia's forestry industry and wood and paper industries turn over more than $11.5 billion per year and contribute around 1.9 per cent of this nation's GDP. They employ about 82,500 people, including more than 62,000 people in manufacturing and processing wood and paper products. Australia has 863 hardwood mills and 256 softwood mills. There are also 21 pulp and paper mills and 28 veneer and panel board mills. Australia produces about 83 per cent of its sawn timber needs; 36 per cent comes from native forests and 64 per cent comes from softwood plantations. Plantations are expected to supply 70 per cent of all Australian consumption of sawn wood by 2015.
Much of the employment in the industry is concentrated in regional and rural areas such as my own electorate of McEwen where the industry is often the predominant employer in the local community—communities which rely on such activity for their livelihoods. Throughout the entire history of the timber industry there has always been a very strong bond between the industry and the community in which it is located and the industry has always been a major contributor to those communities. To give an example from the history within my region, at the end of the First World War, the Narbethong Sawmill Company donated for a raffle enough timber to provide a home for a soldier, and his family, coming home from the war. Today, more often than not, these businesses will also sponsor the local footy and cricket clubs and they respond quickly to community emergencies. Not only are they important in an economic sense in respect of providing employment; they are also an integral part of the social fabric that keeps small towns alive and vibrant.
Generations of the same families have worked for the same employer developing a sense of loyalty that is reciprocated by employer and employees alike. The industry has a rich and varied history in my electorate. In my community of Healesville there were 14 sawmills at the turn of the century employing over 200 people. The fact that there is now only one sawmill is testimony to how the industry has changed. 
Recently the Minister for Forestry and Conservation visited two sawmills in my electorate. A more accurate description of those sawmills would be value added production centres. They demonstrate first-hand how many in the industry have made large capital investments in upgrading plant and equipment, signalling their commitment to greater efficiencies, the production of higher value added product and, once again, a commitment to the local communities in which they operate.
In 1999-2000, Australia imported a total of $3.8 billion worth of mainly paper and high forestry and wood products. The total value of exports was $1.6 billion, including $586 million worth of woodchips, $443 million worth of paper and paper products, and $264 million worth of round and sawn wood products. As can be seen from these figures, Australia has a significant trade imbalance in the area of value added forest and wood products. In the global market where trade barriers are falling and capital is flowing more freely, Australia should be placing itself in a position where it becomes a net exporter of value added forest and wood products. Industry should be competitive in export markets, not only when the Australian dollar is low but at all times, and it must be able to match it with global players in world markets.
This bill will go a long way towards redressing this imbalance and encouraging innovation and research and development in the industry. In a country such as ours, we should not be a net importer of value added wood products. Industry must be encouraged and provided with the right environment in which to develop and become internationally competitive.
Through this bill the Commonwealth funded Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation will now match industry levy contributions to forest research and development dollar for dollar. The Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation funds research into production, processing and marketing links in the industry chain.
Sadly, the previous government decided not to match industry research and development dollar for dollar, instead choosing to amend the act and only contribute one dollar for every two dollars, making it different from all other R&D corporations. This compounded the problem for the industry, as many participants are small businesses who find it difficult to adequately source sufficient capital in order to undertake R&D activity. This also further demonstrates the opposition's ignorance of the real issues facing small business and their total lack of understanding or comprehension of the importance of the timber industry to regional and rural areas. Their continued failure to pass the regional forest agreement legislation is additional proof of this. In spite of what the shadow minister said in the previous speech, to this point of time they still have not given a commitment to pass the regional forest agreement legislation.
The opposition's history of industry policy has been proscriptive and restrictive, with little understanding of the real issues that affect business and the investment environment in which it needs to operate and no understanding that people's jobs are dependent on industry having opportunity for growth. Industry policy needs to be about complementing industry and creating an environment in which industry can grow and be entrepreneurial because, at the end of the day that is the only way that everyone benefits.
The timber industry is characterised by many family owned businesses, and they have found it difficult to fund R&D under the previous formula. This, of course, has hampered many such businesses in capitalising on the benefits that flow from such investments. A Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation which guarantees a dollar for dollar funding commitment will now provide these businesses within the industry with an excellent opportunity to develop a real and lasting competitive and comparative advantage. 
There are of course participants in the industry who have already taken the lead in areas of value adding and research and development. I would mention J.L. Gould of Alexandra, Neville Smith Timber Industries from Seymour and Ron Reid Industries of Yarra Junction in my electorate. All of these companies have implemented wide-ranging improvement programs. As well as upgrading their processing area, they have also extended the capacity of their drying process by installing the latest in kiln and reconditioner technology. Gould employs 100 people in Alexandra, Neville Smith employs 60 people in Seymour and Ron Reid employs 18 people in Yarra Junction. Each of these businesses has invested millions in their industry research and development, but most importantly they have invested in the employees who work in their businesses. They are demonstrating a commitment to enhancing the industry through better production processes, reducing wastage and turning it into quality product that enhances their cash flow. Dockings that were formally disposed of locally as firewood are now being turned into quality grade chips and sold to Australian Paper.
What this highlights is the importance of the value chain. The minister referred to this in introducing this bill to the House: the whole of chain approach to industry planning and development. Each link in the chain can play a valuable role in enhancing the product. These links further down the chain benefit each process, and the finished product will be of a higher quality and worth considerably more. We must support the strengthening of this chain if we are to have a positive impact on reversing the trade imbalance that currently exists and on ensuring that employment in regional areas continues.
This imbalance can be reduced through replacing imports and by creating a long-term competitive advantage for the industry which results in developing and increasing exports. If research and development activities are carried out by small individual businesses, the end result of that R&D is likely to be limited and not provide increased opportunities for new markets. This type of fragmented R&D effort is unlikely to produce the range and depth of benefits to strategically benefit industry. The economies of scale are not present for many of the small businesses that are currently in the industry, and it is unfair to criticise such members of the industry for lack of innovation when they are faced with such obstacles. With such a precious resource, we must strategically work to ensure that the maximum value is derived from the use of this product. Already the government has signalled its commitment to innovation through its $2.9 billion innovation policy. This will be complemented by dollar-for-dollar research and development funding through the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. In the 21st century, we are going to see dramatic new uses for wood, and this will provide a greater outlet for quality products in more profitable markets.
The November and December editions of the National Forest and Timber Newspaper spoke about the biological revolution presenting marvellous opportunities for the forest industry. Designer wood will be attuned to the market from its genetic inception. In particular, the Southern Tree Breeding Association has entered into partnership with scientific research institutions to develop state-of-the-art breeding technologies for use on plantations. This promotes more plantation of better quality and with less wastage. The benefits with respect to tree improvement will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue per year for the economy for plantation estates.
Wood biotechnology means that the timber industry can employ this new technology in its tree breeding and planting. It means that it will move science into environmental management, innovation into wood processing, logic into the specifications of wood and fibre products, growth in education, training and research, and profit into markets for wood and fibre products. This all adds up to more secure employment for current and future workers in the timber industry. This once again reinforces the importance of the value chain and how each link in that chain benefits the timber industry. The flow-on effects and the results are overwhelmingly positive.  
The timber industry faces strong competition from other types of materials such as plastics and metal. However, if the industry can overcome these threats, opportunities are there for it to vastly improve its export performance and help redress the trade imbalance. BIS Shrapnel, in a recently completed study of the moulding and millwork suppliers in industry, notes that an increasing supply of local plantation timber over the next decade will create export opportunities in the United States, Europe and Asia. Timber moulders have the potential to improve levels of exports and import substitution, but only if they are more actively involved in promoting the attributes of wood, such as the durability of its products, its insulation properties and its aesthetic values. The markets are certainly there. US imports of moulded wood products increased by 177 per cent in the eight years to 2000 to an annual value of almost $1 billion. Currently, Chile is the largest supplier of wood mouldings to the US. Wouldn't it be great if Australia could start eating into that market?
The global forest and paper industry represents a supply chain of $750 billion. From plantations right through to value adding processing, each link in the chain can play a valuable role in furthering the productivity and competitiveness of the industry. In order to capitalise on this potential, all the participants must have access to new and developing technology. This bill recognises this requirement. It seeks to actively promote and create an environment in which the industry can be competitive, both locally and internationally, and it will commence from 1 July this year. That is why industry representatives from my electorate that I have spoken to about this legislation give it their full support. As Ron Reid, of Yarra Junction, said just this morning, `This will give more security to the industry.' I commend the legislation to the chamber.",REPS,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001. Essentially, the legislation provides for a change in the nature of funding for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation which would allow for an increase in Commonwealth funding from $1 for every $2 raised from the industry levy to $1 for every dollar raised from the levy. The opposition welcomes that. The shadow minister for forestry and conservation, the member for Reid, Mr Laurie Ferguson, made that plain in his remarks.
We also understand that this industry is a critical one for rural and regional Australia, and that it craves certainty. I will pick up some of the remarks that have been made by the shadow minister for forestry and conservation in response to an interjection from the member for McEwen a little earlier. She talked about the RFA bill, which we have all given much consideration to and have talked about quite a bit in this place previously. The member for McEwen said how important that was. In responding to the interjection, the member for Reid said that, to a large extent, the reasons for Labor's opposition to the RFA bill have been removed. He also made these remarks when he addressed the national conference of Timber Communities Australia on 10 March in Lilydale, Victoria. I commend the member for Reid for his remarks on this issue and welcome this step forward in relation to the debate. I am sure he would not mind if I quote some of the remarks that he made in addressing that conference. His remarks were very well received by the delegates to the conference. This is an extract from what he had to say:
I suggest that there is limited value in constantly replaying old battles.
He was talking about some of the old battles in forestry. He continued:
Our shared challenge is to see if we can discern a way forward. 
The member for Reid went on to say:
In certain respects the prospects for doing so have very much improved since the Western Australian State election. The need to empower the Commonwealth Parliament to formally disallow RFAs has now rapidly diminished as an issue. Future progress lies in the reintroduction of the RFA Bill, which the Government set aside as long ago as December 1999. The Commonwealth Minister can no longer offer or receive secret undertakings in respect of Western Australia. Whether Canberra likes it or not, it has no choice but to deal with the elected State Government. That means we now feel less anxiety about the disallowance issue. However, we do certainly feel that there can be far better reporting to the Commonwealth Parliament on the progress of the overall RFA process, and in each State and RFA region. 
Providing all key players approach the matter in a positive and constructive fashion the prospect for securing bipartisan passage of Commonwealth RFA legislation is extremely good. For my part I can assure you that I will make every effort to secure such an outcome. I would hope that others would do the same. Together we must move swiftly to provide the industry with the certainty we all desire.
These were the comments which the member for Reid, the shadow minister for forestry and conservation, made on 10 March 2001 at Lilydale, Victoria, in relation to the RFA Bill. I endorse completely his remarks in relation to the bill and, in particular, support his call for some bipartisanship in relation to this issue. I know that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation is at the table at present, and I know that he would have heard those remarks reported back to him from people involved in the timber industry and from those delegates who attended the Timber Communities Australia National Conference.
It is a very sincere offer which the member for Reid is making to the minister—to cooperate and to find a way forward in relation to the RFA Bill—and this is what people want to see. They want to see cooperation. They do not want to see finger pointing, they do not want to see disagreement between those of us in the federal parliament who are in the Labor Party and those who are in the Liberal Party; they want to see us, together, find a way forward. I know that in the past there have been a lot of partisan games played in relation to the way that forestry policy has been managed, but I very much believe that that is just old politics. That is not the politics which people in timber communities want to see. They want to see cooperation, security, serious industry policy and ways forward which will see more value adding, secure long-term jobs and growth in the timber industry, which is so important to so many parts of rural and regional Australia. That is our approach. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation will take on board the remarks which I am making and which the member for Reid made in his contribution to debate in relation to this bill.
There have been quite a few developments in my electorate in relation to the forest industry. We have had some substantial concerns raised about the sustainable yield figures which have been prepared by DNRE in Victoria. I have some very grave concerns in relation to the way DNRE have handled this issue and to DNRE's competence in producing these figures. We have all been very much disappointed by the way they have conducted themselves, and it has created a whole lot of uncertainty in the timber industry in my electorate.
Given that this was the situation, though, it was my view that we needed to get a message out to people that this was a matter which needed to be dealt with seriously, just explaining to people that there was a lot of effort being put in by the state government and by stakeholders to deal seriously with this issue. To that end, I called a public meeting, which we held at the Neerim South Community Hall, the J.D. Algie Memorial Hall. We had people there from right across central and west Gippsland. I invited the 12 or 13 timber companies in the district to come; to their credit all of them did come, and they shut down their timber mills for a period of time so that all of the workers and their families could come as well. That meeting was to discuss the best way to deal with the DNRE figures in relation to sustainable yield.
So who did we have there? We had Michael O'Connor, from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union; Graeme Gooding, from the Victorian Association of Forest Industries; Ian Maxfield, the state member for Narracan, in the area most affected; Rosemary Barker, the chief of staff to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation in Victoria; all of those timber companies; and the council. And I was there chairing the meeting, to which some 350 people came, and heard reports back to them as to what the state of play was. 
What came out of that meeting was a very unambiguous statement and a very clear conviction, from all of those people I have just mentioned, that we want to move this issue forward to make sure that not one job is lost, not one timber mill is closed as a result of this issue. This is the approach that people want to see. They want to see us all come around the table together, agree on the principles of keeping jobs in country towns and commit to the future of this industry and the people who rely on the industry for their livelihoods.
So we had this meeting, which was very positive. I think people went away from that meeting feeling that they had given a very clear indication to the state government that this was an issue which profoundly affected them and their community and something which they took very seriously. At the same time, there was a very clear statement from me and other decision makers in our district that we were very much backing the community and the industry and were working collectively to make sure that there was a positive outcome for the industry and for the communities which depend on the industry. That was one small example in my electorate of the way forward in relation to dealing with issues on the forest and forest products sector. People want to see that cooperation and people want to see action being taken by governments to achieve those ends which they view as being important—mainly long-term secure jobs, a growing and thriving industry and support for those people who depend on that industry in those country towns.
The state government moved very quickly in relation to this issue. The state Minister for Environment and Conservation, Sherryl Garbutt, last week announced that key stakeholders had agreed to a strategic framework to progress the renewal of native timber harvesting licences in Victoria. That is very welcome. The framework will be headed by a peak strategy group which will receive information on volumes of timber available for harvesting in Victoria from an expert data reference group and a licensing working group—also a very welcome development. 
The peak strategy group will comprise the secretary of DNRE, Ms Chloe Munro, and representatives from the Victorian Association of Forest Industries and from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. This is what people want to see. They want to see a government involving key decision makers in this type of process. We do not want a process that stands away from the people who are going to be most profoundly affected by any decision which the state government make in terms of the renewal of licences and how they deal with these sustainable yield figures.
Now we have a process headed by the most senior person in DNRE, Ms Chloe Munro. We have a process which has her at the same level as Michael O'Connor from the CFMEU, who obviously represents the workers from the industry, and Graeme Gooding from the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, who is obviously representing the industry. The workers have a clear point of contact in that whole process, and obviously the industry and the timber mills have a clear point of contact in Graeme Gooding, who heads up the Victorian Association of Forest Industries.
The expert data reference group will be chaired by the Professor for Sustainable Forestry at the Southern Cross University in Lismore—Jerry Vanclay. This group will advise the peak strategy group on all timber resource related issues and is expected to report within three months. I think most people would agree that having Professor Vanclay's group provide independent expertise to examine the validity of the current timber resource data is vital to ensure that the decisions made by the state government in relation to licence renewals are based on the best possible and most accurate information. 
So this is a welcome development. I commend the state government for getting on with it and dealing seriously with this issue. I think it is really a credit to the people of central and west Gippsland that, when I called this meeting, we had such a large and overwhelming response, despite the fact that it had to be organised at very short notice—I think we gave people something like less than two weeks notice. I was very pleased, when I arrived and helped set up the hall, to see just how many people had made the effort.
I spent a bit of time in those communities in my electorate which depend upon the timber industry for their livelihood. These people have great spirit and great courage and they are working in a very hard industry. It is a tough industry. Everyone understands that the workers, the timber millers, have family involved, and they understand that it is a tough industry. But it is also an industry which has a fantastic future. We need to ensure that the industry heads in the direction of increased value adding. We need to give it resource security and provide the support it needs in terms of incentives for value adding in industry policy. Through the legislation which we are discussing today we will see a greater focus on research and development. I welcome the legislation that we are dealing with today which will see an increase in funding, small though it is, to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation.
As I mentioned before, this debate has been characterised by a lot of rhetoric for at least 10 years, and probably for a long time before that. I appeal today to those people on the other side of politics who represent timber communities and to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who is at the table now, to put aside their partisanship and get on with dealing with those issues which are important to people in those communities. I think we owe them that. We owe them a serious response to the issues which they are confronting. We have on the table a very serious offer which has been made by the member for Reid in relation to the RFA bill—to deal with the bill constructively, find a way forward and try and find some agreement so that we can get the legislation in place and provide that security for people in the industry. The member for Reid mentioned very starkly and plainly that a lot of people who attended the national conference of Timber Communities Australia raised that as an issue with him, which they saw as a very important issue. To his credit, he has been prepared to listen to that feedback and to make that offer to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, which is something that I welcome.
There is no doubt that these timber towns, these small country towns which depend on the timber industry, really do need our support and encouragement in terms of providing appropriate incentives for research and development and value adding in those timber mills. In my electorate, I have got a number of small timber mills which have not focused enough on value adding. When I go to those communities and see how dependent they are on the timber mills, having regard to how many people in the town work there, I can observe that not enough has been done at those timber mills in relation to value adding. 
We have got a lot of great success stories in my electorate in terms of value adding. Companies in my electorate have led the industry when it comes to value adding and the development of export markets. That is exactly what we want to see. Most of us who represent electorates where there is a vibrant timber industry understand that ours is unquestionably one of the most progressive timber industries in the world. We must look at ways in which we can encourage the timber industry in our nation to face the world, better understand the export opportunities which exist in terms of our products, and provide that security and encouragement for them to get on with value adding and increasing investment in their timber mills and operations. 
I welcome this bill. It is a step in the right direction. It is a small matter that we are discussing today—the increase in the government's commitment from $1 for every $2 raised to a dollar for every dollar raised. Nonetheless, it is a welcome development. The Minister for Forestry and Conservation now has on the table a very serious and sincere offer from the shadow minister for forestry, the member for Reid, in relation to the RFA bill, and more generally in relation to matters to do with the forest industry. It is up to him as to how he responds. I know that people in my electorate who depend on the timber industry for their livelihoods will be hoping that he will respond in a mature manner and will take that offer seriously. I look forward to hearing the remarks of the minister for forestry, and I commend the bill to the chamber.",REPS,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2001-03-28,"—in reply—In summing up this debate, might I first thank all of the speakers for their commitment to and support of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001, which should never have had to come to this House. When the Labor Party first decided that there would be a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, they should have made sure that it had exactly the same arrangements as other primary industries— and that, of course, is dollar for dollar government contribution towards research. Let me say that it took this government to take that initiative and, in fact, to have two industry meetings to make sure that, in progressing the FWPRDC, we did so in a manner that was acceptable to industry. One of the arrangements arising from those meetings is that some of the small log processors and preservers and people like that will now pay a lower levy more compatible with their activities within the industry.
The other factor, of course, is that this is a case of the Howard government putting its money where its mouth is. The member for Reid, the spokesman on forestry for the opposition, says that he wants to be checking the next budget to see what additional commitments we might make. He does not have to; he just has to read what it is about at the moment. He might have taken a note of the 2000 selection round of successful applications by the research sector for what is known as cooperative research centres, where real big bucks are expended by this government in one of the better ways that has ever been devised to promote the knowledge nation and research and development within our nation: that is, by forming a cooperative research centre between industry, academia and the government. In the last rounds of announcements, as I recollect there were 19 very substantial grants made and two of them have gone to the forest products industry for very proactive and very forward thinking projects. The first is a CRC for functional communication surfaces, which might sound a bit frightening—one might think it is a computer or involves the Internet. No, it is recognising that paper is still the major form of communication in human society, and nobody should know that better than the member for McMillan.
—Hear, hear!
—Yes, you know it, but you do not support it. We will come to that in due course. We are not talking about public meetings. We are talking about what you do in this parliament, and when the RFA legislation came on you ducked out of the place. You left the parliament.
 (Mr Nehl)—The minister will address his remarks to the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.  
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order! it is well known that I was assisting the Swifts Creek community in East Gippsland at the time of the RFA bill and dealing with a timber mill closure.
—There is no point of order. The minister has the call.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The thing is that an issue outside his electorate was more important than an issue that above all else related to the pulp and paper industry. But what I am talking about here is in fact a $14 million grant of government moneys, over seven years, $2 million a year, to assist the key participants in Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT to get ahead with getting Australia to the top market—the highest value paper products. This is it: the research program will deliver well over $300 million per annum of ongoing benefits to the Australian economy by the development of novel products in the area of high value print media, printed packaging and paper products, security printing and banknote printing; advance writable and rewritable substrates for the communication printing, packaging and supply chain industries; new processes and materials for evolving coating and printing technologies; and postgraduate engineers and scientists for the paper, packaging, surface, information and printing industries. That, again, is putting your money where your mouth is. We do not want to make pie bags—we will make them—but we want to take Australia to the top of the paper industry. And the member for Reid asked what my action is doing!
And then there is the second grant to the CRC for Innovative Wood Manufacturing. Who were the participants? Victoria appears again. I wonder if the member for McMillan knows that these things have even happened. When he had his public meeting, I wonder whether he told people about these initiatives. Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania will receive $16 million over seven years. What is it for? The program focuses on the fundamental properties of microwave energy and its influence on wood modification—a new approach to drying that has been borrowed, I might add, from the Russians, who found they needed a way to unfreeze their trees before they could saw them up. Here we could have a continuous chain of wood drying. I have seen the project in Victoria. I wonder if the member for McMillan has visited it.
This program also focuses on the relief of growth stresses in logs and sawn timber. Of course, the member for McMillan just gave us a little lecture on resource—and I want to come back to that. One of the challenges for industry is using smaller logs. If you try to saw a log on just one side when it is relatively immature, it will bend like Robin Hood's bow. So you have to have the technology and knowledge to overcome that problem if you are going to access that sort of resource which, typically, now goes to woodchips. And here we are, funding scientific research in that particular area.
The program also looks at surface engineering of machine wood for enhancing adhesion and long-term retention of and bondability for surface coatings. One of the huge problems for our hardwood sector is finding appropriate glues. Maybe that problem will be solved with the way in which we deal with the wood surface—and here it is, listed. There is also the design and manufacture of high value furniture and wood products from microwave modified wood. We know we can actually expand this wood, soak it in fibreglass type resins and produce a piece of wood that is stronger than steel. And, lastly, this program will focus on the design durability of wooden components. The only reason the member for Reid said he would be looking at what we might be doing next is that he did not know what we were doing.
The action agenda is very much alive and well and is making progress on all of the significant factors. Why is that? The member for McMillan might be interested to know that the representative of the trade union movement who is on that particular wood products council demanded of me, and with my absolute support, that it not be another body of industry representatives—the lobbyists. He said, `Wilson, you've got to have the top quality CEOs from the businesses involved.' I said, `You're right, Trevor.' They are the people who are there. The first they said to me was, `We don't want you to put money in the budget. We want you first to smooth the road as a government. We want you to guarantee resource.' 
The member for McMillan said that resource is important. The RFAs provide resource but RFAs, as we have discovered, are not worth the woodchips they are printed on until governments have the courage to legislate to guarantee the signature of the Prime Minister or the Premier. Where has that happened? It has happened in Tasmania. The member for McMillan, having previously abandoned the bipartisan approach, now thinks that it might not be a bad idea—but I will come back to that. In Tasmania there is a bipartisan approach and that is why, amongst other things, they receive such large moneys from the Commonwealth: because they stuck to their guns. They did not run off and hide. They went and stood together, Labor and Liberal, and fought for a fair deal for Tasmania's forest products industry, because they believe in people's right to employment. On the day that the federal parliament passes the RFA legislation there will be a discipline on future governments of whatever political persuasion to keep the promises so made, because compensation will have to be paid.
We have just been told the background to Labor's walking away from their own 1992 national forest policy statement, which guaranteed that the Commonwealth would implement RFA legislation. They walked away from it because there was a political opportunity in Western Australia. How was the Western Australian RFA put together? It was put together according to Labor's national forest policy statement. It was a statement that was confirmed by the then Premier of Western Australia. There, clearly on the front page, is her signature—none other than the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. She has probably forgotten it, but the fact is that she confirmed that that is the way Western Australia and the Commonwealth should go ahead. 
That process was followed implicitly. And what did it deliver? It delivered an above-required forest reserve system—it delivered, for instance, 300,000 cubic metres of jarrah sawlogs a year and 170,000 cubic metres of karri sawlogs a year from the remaining forest—that was designated to meet the social impact and the economic impact criteria, which are the two other legs of Labor's national forest policy statement. 
What else did they do? As a government we did not just accept those quantities, as described in this case by CALM, the DNRE of Western Australia. We put two of the best academics in Australia to work on this issue. More importantly, we used a Victorian person and an ACT person. Why did we do that? We did it because they are academics in the two leading schools of forestry in Australia—undisputed. The member for McMillan says, `We are going to have a wonderful committee now in Victoria to look at resource.' So they ignore the University of Melbourne and go off to the Southern Cross University—if you drove through its campus and blinked, you would not see it. Why has Minister Garbutt gone and got a professor from Lismore, or wherever it is, when living within Melbourne is the very best school of forestry in Australia? The message is that the Victorian government does not stand behind its own academic institutions. 
—Rubbish!
—He says, `Rubbish!' Why didn't you take on Ferguson, the recognised professor at that particular university? I will tell you why. It was because you knew what he would say. At our request and at the request of the Wombat Forest Protection Society, along with Dr Turner, he has already done an assessment in one area where we did not trust the then Kennett government. And you tell me not to fight with state governments. Marie Teehan went to the press and told me to butt out. That is my position—I have never ever put party politics into the forest debate. That has been your job, and you have done it.  
—That is absolute nonsense.
—Well, of course. So all of a sudden you can support the RFA bill when Geoff Gallop has won government in Western Australia—on a policy of what? I want to get back to those quantities. How were those quantities confirmed? We got Professor Ferguson. We believe in the Melbourne University. Apparently, the state government of Victoria does not. We got Dr Turner. Then, to guarantee to the people of Western Australia that it was fair and above board with a couple of eastern staters on it, we invited the Environmental Protection Agency of WA to nominate a third party. And they did. It was a person called Noel Fitzpatrick. 
There is a piece of paper that says that those three people confirmed those wood quantities were sustainable; the resource was there to guarantee jobs for everyone. Why have we had a collapse in resource? Firstly, my colleague Richard Court lost his nerve and removed from the resource base a large area of land. Then Gallop has come along—the absolute rent seeker—and decided to take away all of the jarrah resource, the land where it has to be found. What is he going to achieve from that? He has contracts to meet, just as the Victorian government has, for another six years, notwithstanding all the hoo-ha of the member for McMillan calling a public meeting to scare the hell out of everyone six years before it can happen.
The reality is that the Western Australian government has got contracts to meet. It does not want to put up any money to buy people out of those contracts, so what is it going to do? It is going into regrowth area preserved for the future of the industry and is taking out three trees instead of one to meet those contracts. That is what it is going to do. At the end of that, goodness knows what will happen, but predictably the industry will collapse for lack of resources.
The member for Reid wants me to say all the wonderful things we are going to invest in when we still do not know whether Labor will back legislation in the House. We will give them the chance, but we expect them to vote for it as it is, because it is a simple process of saying that the parliament in Canberra will back its promises to the forest industry with money. That is all it says. It does not say anything else. Tasmanian senators have stood up in the Senate and supported an amendment that says, `We, the senators of Tasmania, are not to be trusted, and all deals done between the Tasmanian parliament and the Commonwealth government should be vetted by senators of all other states, because we're not to be trusted on our own.'
What an amazing situation! That is what it is all about. It was a device so that the member for McMillan could have a public meeting, put his hand over his heart and say, `We're still for the RFA, we're still for our NFPS policy, but we just have a couple of modifications.' Those modifications would have guaranteed that not one RFA would have ever been concluded because the Senate was never going to agree to them. They are the issues that need to be considered when these people stand up and suddenly offer the olive branch. Bipartisanship started in 1992, unlike what is said by the opportunists that now occupy the opposition benches. You would remember, sir, that when Prime Minister Keating came up with the NFPS we supported it. Every state Premier, from the various political parties, has their signature there, including the current member for Fremantle. The only party throughout Australia that has stuck with it, at this point, is us—the federal coalition. And the honourable member opposite says, `Don't fight with state governments.' I fight with them on behalf of the people who live in his electorate. I do not have any sawmills in my electorate, but I stand by them when the member for McMillan goes scurrying away on the day. 
The Swift Creek sawmill had been closed down for months, if not years. The federal parliament has had listed on the Notice Paper for a long period of time that there be a vote on the RFA legislation—and the member for McMillan chooses that day to duck out of town. He then decided that he needed a bit of publicity, so he swapped seats with a lady and said, `I'll sit in Melbourne for a week.' I congratulate him because he got publicity for it. He sent this lady to his electorate to talk to the workers. I bet she did not tell them she voted against the RFA legislation. That is in black and white in the Hansard record.
These people talk about looking after workers. You cannot saw wood if you have got no wood. You cannot value add wood if you have got no wood. That is what our commitment is. I am waiting for Sherryl Garbutt to agree that we can pay that $2 million plus to various sawmills, loggers and others. Do you know why she does not want to pay it out? There are two reasons: the first reason is that the people who are going to get the money are not part of a unionised workplace and the second reason is that she wants the money for exit money. She has told me that—in other words, buying people out of their jobs. What are you going to do? Are you going to give a three-fingered sawmiller a job in a restaurant, serving at tables? They want jobs in the timber industry. There is sufficient resource there. When Sherryl Garbutt's committee has finished its deliberations, if it tells her there is not enough wood in the areas in which her government said there was enough wood, it is her job to find some more wood. There is plenty of it there; that is my message. (Time expired)
