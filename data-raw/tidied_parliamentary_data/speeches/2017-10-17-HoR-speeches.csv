Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:01):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017. Dumping occurs when goods exported to Australia are priced lower than their normal value, which can undercut the local market and manufacturers. It can include foreign subsidisation by a government in the form of financial aid, income or price support for goods exported to Australia. Dumping itself is not a prohibited practice under the World Trade Organization agreements, but antidumping duties can be imposed when dumping could cause or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian industry.


Australia's antidumping system is an important part of Australia's trade and industry policy, which is consistent with the WTO trade rules and Australia's international trade agreement obligations. Given the potential impact on local workers and manufacturers, Labor, when in government, established the Anti-Dumping Commission in July 2013. The commission is responsible for administering the system and advising the minister for industry whether duty should be imposed on goods found to have been dumped or subsidised. Measures imposed by the commission guard our local industries against unfair and uncompetitive trade practices, such as injurious dumping and subsidisation.


The bill before the chamber amends the Customs Act to address loopholes in Australia's antidumping system that allow foreign exporters to exploit the duty rate review process and then recommence injurious dumping for up to 18 months without any remedial duties in place. At a time when Australia's manufacturers are struggling with high energy costs because of the lack of leadership and poor policy direction from this government, we need to make sure that Australia's manufacturers are not faced with another challenge by being undercut by dumped foreign goods. Given this, Labor will support this bill before the chamber today.


Antidumping measures allow local businesses to be more competitive. In my electorate of Blair, I am acutely aware of the potential impacts of dumping on local businesses, including Capral Aluminium and their plant at Bundamba and G.James Glass & Aluminium in Ipswich. I've spoken about both companies in this place on numerous occasions when antidumping legislation has been before the chamber and how significant they are to my local economy. Both companies mean that local mums and dads can have meaningful work and make a living as they raise their families in the Ipswich and Somerset regions. Capral Aluminium is Australia's largest manufacturing distributor of aluminium profiles and employs over 900 workers in Australia, including 300 at their Bremer Park facility in my electorate of Blair in South East Queensland.


When I last spoke about Capral in this place, in 2012, I spoke about how their plant was operating at only 50 per cent capacity. Since then Capral said, in May 2016, that the 'recent success of the anti-dumping campaign has resulted in a significant increase in volume' and their 2016 annual report revealed production volume had risen 9.7 per cent across the company. I'm proud that changes introduced by Labor in office have led to an increase in jobs for Capral. Capral continue to demonstrate a commitment to training in my local community. In 2016, they trained 60 new production and warehouse workers to a certificate III in competitive systems training at the Bremer Park facility.


They are not alone in being a prominent business based in my electorate in Ipswich. G. James Glass & Aluminium is one of Australia's leading manufacturers of aluminium windows and aluminium doors. They are celebrating their 100th year of operation in 2017. It is vital to support Australian business and make sure that the anti-dumping regulatory environment continuously adapts to keep up with the strategies and behaviours of exporters to prevent injury to Australian industry and companies like Capral and G. James Glass & Aluminium. 


Labor's commitment to Australian jobs and manufacturing was bolstered by the recent announcement of the Australian Manufacturing Future Fund. A future Shorten Labor government will invest $1 billion in Australia's advanced manufacturing to support Australian industries, grow Australian businesses and create Australian jobs. This is because Labor always support innovative Australian manufacturing firms who want to grow their businesses and create jobs. We understand that local businesses need assistance to modernise and move into high-value production to make them globally competitive. While it's true under this government businesses have closed and jobs have been sent overseas, Labor will invest in Australian businesses and create Australian jobs.


The legislation before the chamber responds to concerns that foreign exporters are gaming the system and recommencing injurious dumping after their 12-month review. There have been claims that foreign exporters are doing this by suspending exports or exporting low, subcommercial volumes at high prices in the period immediately following the imposition of anti-dumping duties. A foreign exporter can request a review of measures after a period of 12 months if they believe that the variable factors, including export price and normal value, have changed. If a company has gamed the system by purposefully exporting low volumes at high prices or ceased exporting entirely then it's difficult for the Anti-Dumping Commission to determine an appropriate, reliable export price. As a result, this often means the duty is revised to a lower rate or no rate at all. The gaming allows foreign exporters to dump sizable amounts of cheap, overseas products, such as aluminium extrusions and aluminium products, into the local market for a further 18 months with no remedial measures in place.


The amendments within this bill will help the Australian regulatory system. Given this apparent gaming in the market and the risk and severity of the impact it can have on local manufacturers and local jobs, administrative improvements to the review processes are required. We commend the government for this. This bill incorporates new methodologies for the review of measures to assist the Anti-Dumping Commission in determining an export price where no goods have been exported or goods have been exported at low volumes. The new methodologies are set out in the bill.


The specific methods will enable the minister to consider alternative information to determine the export price. This will reduce the capacity of exporters to subvert Australia's anti-dumping regime. Specific methods in the bill will apply as follows for: all reviews of measures for which an application or request is made following the date of commencement of the legislation; reviews for which an application has been lodged or requested by the minister prior to the commencement of the legislation; and reviews that have commenced prior to the commencement of the legislation but for which a decision hasn't quite yet been made.


The purpose of this retrospective application is to avoid applying a disproportionately low duty to reviews already underway, reducing the further exposure of Australian industry to injurious dumping from exporters. I note the bill's explanatory memorandum states that due to the variable frequency of antidumping reviews the revenue impact is difficult to quantify. Regardless, however, of the financial impact, Australian jobs are really critical and Australian businesses are important. 


In government, Labor made significant changes to strengthen the antidumping system. That is why we took a commitment to the last federal election to ensure Australia's antidumping system had the right powers and penalties in place. We promised to ensure Australia's antidumping system was operating effectively and committed to work with the Anti-Dumping Commission to accelerate enhancements to the system. The Turnbull government's bill is consistent with Labor's policy at the last election and we thank them for that. We thank them for catching up to Labor's lead in relation to this area. I take the opportunity to thank the assistant minister for following Labor's lead on banning importations across a whole range of areas and impacts. The government could, however, follow Labor's lead in relation to the importation of highly flammable polyethylene cladding, to protect Australians from dangerous fires in their homes and workplaces. 


The bill before the House was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for an inquiry that reported on 6 October 2017. As the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, I am more than aware of the Turnbull government's consistent failure to consult with stakeholders about legislative changes which may affect them. We believe in genuine consultation in this area. I note all Australian industry representatives made submissions to the Senate inquiry and they all supported the proposed introduction of measures to strengthen Australia's antidumping scheme. BlueScope Steel stated in their submission: 


It became obvious that a new strategy had been employed by a large number of these exporters to exploit a 'gap' within the existing review of measures process. This strategy was simply to withdraw from exporting to Australia for 12 months and then request a review of their imposed measures. The outcome of such a strategy was to effectively guarantee a new interim anti-dumping duty of 0 %.


As a consequence, BlueScope has witnessed an immediate recommencement of exports from those countries, increasing within three months of the minister's decision by over 300 per cent, in conjunction with a price drop of around 15 per cent. This was a huge undercut to local manufacturers, the local economy and local jobs. The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, AMWU, concluded:


This legislation improves Australia's anti-dumping system by ensuring a more transparent and efficient review mechanism to avoid circumvention.


The CFMEU supported that as well. The AMWU indicated it remains 'open to further changes to the antidumping system to ensure injurious dumping is stamped out'. 


Given the feedback by industry and by trade unions, it is important that we support this legislation. Indeed, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee recommended the bill be passed. I commend the work of Senator Kim Carr, the shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, for the extensive consultation in relation to the legislation before the chamber. We have consulted with a whole range of organisations about this matter. I urge the Turnbull government to follow our lead and consult widely and wisely in relation to this, as we have done. 


It is clear that this bill would help close the gap in the antidumping system that has been gamed by foreign exporters. In these circumstances, we support the legislation. While antidumping measures might not be the everyday topic of conversation over a water cooler or at a barbecue, it is extremely important to the livelihood of Australia's local manufacturers and the livelihood of their workers. On this side of the chamber, we will always fight for workers. A Shorten Labor government will put middle- and working-class Australians first. We support the legislation and thank the government for following our lead.

Mr TED O'BRIEN

 (
Fairfax
) (
12:14
):  I would like to thank the opposition for standing with the government on this measure. It is often said that failures are orphans and successes have many fathers, and it is no surprise that we have here a terrific measure being introduced by the government for which the opposition wish to take credit. That's okay, Mr Speaker. At the end of the day, the opposition do look to the Turnbull government to get things done and we are paving the way in all areas, not least of which is this area of international trade. We are ensuring that those companies that are exposed to trade here in Australia, because either they trade internationally or their competitors or substitutes for their goods or services also come from international markets, are looked after. That's what the Turnbull government do, and we're delighted that the opposition recognise the good work that we're doing and so much wish to be part of it. They seek to take the credit, and good on them for attempting to do so.


There are few more contentious issues to be had around the topic of international trade than the issue of dumping and the measures governments right around the world have exercised for a century or more to combat it. The simplest definition of dumping is the sale by an exporter of a product in another country for less than it is sold at home. In other words, a company sells a product for a certain price at home and then exports it to another market and undercuts the domestic price significantly, thereby 'dumping' it into the other market. This has been a highly contentious element of international trade for many hundreds of years because it has the clear potential to do significant damage to businesses, industries and potentially entire economies. Dumping has become increasingly important over the past few decades as the volume of international trade has increased at exponential rates.


Over the past 20 years or so, measures to control dumping have expanded and come into more widespread use right around the world. The motivation of governments to take action to control dumping is quite straightforward: it's a defence mechanism. The motive of the exporter, or the dumper, might well be predatory. An offending exporter may seek to price other exporters out of a particular market in a recipient country. It may want to have that market to itself or it may want to kill off a local industry in the market so it can supplant it, beat off potential competitors and establish a monopoly or at least a dominant position in that market. Alternatively, the exporter may simply have overcapacity in its home market and, rather than slow down production, may wish to export the excess of its inventory so that it can keep its production line rolling on. Of course, potentially this will end up having a devastating effect on the like industry and competitors in the recipient market. Whatever the motivation—predatory or even strategically benign—the impacts in the importing recipient country can be significant and generally negative for local businesses and jobs. To compete with dumped products, a local business may well, at the very least, have to drop its own prices to maintain market share and production, possibly to levels below even the cost of production. That is obviously a dead end for any business and potentially fatal for an enterprise if such an imbalance persists.


At the other end of the spectrum, however, you could argue that consumers in a recipient country might be better off, at least in the short term, whether the dumped product is finished retail or maybe an input into a manufacturing supply chain. If it is a finished product then it is cheaper than the locally produced product, and maybe that's a straightforward benefit to the consumer. If the dumped product is a cheap or at least less expensive input into a manufacturing supply chain, that might help the manufacturer boost his or her profits and use those profits to reinvest. Some free market fundamentalists, who don't understand the true meaning of free trade, will describe antidumping measures as protectionist because they will concentrate on those last couple of points. They will start to argue, 'You know what, even if it is dumping, it ends up being cheaper product for the recipient marketplace.' However, what these fundamentalists clearly do not understand is that unfair free trade is in fact an oxymoron.


Rational national governments with an eye to history and a firsthand knowledge of the dangers of dumping, both potential and real, differ from these fundamentalists. This government, the Turnbull government, is indeed a rational government, as all Australian governments have been on this issue, at least since Federation. Measures to control dumping have been in place in Australia from the beginning, from Federation, 1901. Ever since, they have been updated and revised regularly by governments—I have to say, in the spirit of the previous speaker—of both persuasions, with the measures in this bill, the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, being the latest but inevitably not the last iteration of a very important defensive measure. For more than a century, these measures have never been abandoned or even sidelined. Through war, depression, boom and bust, this basic defence of the Australian economy has been maintained.


Very significantly, when Australia was a signatory to the first real international attempt to promote free trade, via the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1948, which was aimed largely at reducing tariffs so we could expand trade globally, the ability of the original 23 member states to undertake remedial action against dumpers was very actively pushed for and accepted. Tariffs came down, free trade was significantly expanded, but anti-dumping measures remained in place. In the various iterations of GATT, right up to the Uruguay Round of 1994, which led to the establishment of the WTO, the World Trade Organization, in the following year as the successor to the GATT, that right was deliberately retained and is still there, accessible to all of the now 159 member states of the WTO. In the context of defending ever freer, ever fairer global trade, they're using it. This is not some passive measure that is never used. In 2015-16 alone, 45 WTO members initiated 267 anti-dumping investigations: India, 66; the US, 51; Pakistan, 21. Australia initiated 18, mostly in the steel and aluminium sectors, with the vast majority involving Asian exporters.


There is a critical juxtaposition here. GATT, now the WTO, is all about liberalising trade. The anti-dumping provisions contained in this bill, principally via special duties on dumped goods, are in keeping with that aim, despite the claims of the fundamentalists, by ensuring that tree trade is not distorted or undermined by dumping practices, that indeed it's given the opportunity to be fair, that there's a fair playing field. We need to ensure that this government, and indeed future governments, remain vigilant in that task. Becoming increasingly wise to the manoeuvres used by dumpers to achieve this has led the Australian government to enhance and be ever more specific about the measures needed to keep our playing field level.


For example, one tactic now covered by this bill is that an exporter of a product that is subject to an anti-dumping duty will have another exporter, a different company, whose similar dumped product has a lower duty set against it, do the exporting for them. Another tactic is called country-hopping, where the exports will be diverted through a country that does not have anti-dumping penalties in place, and again, the government is on top of that one. A third trick is to slightly modify your product beyond the specifications of a product that has attracted the anti-dumping duty, even though it is effectively one and the same, and that avenue of circumvention has now too been blocked. We're also addressing other behaviours that seek to disguise dumping practices, including the assembly of products in third countries.


You see, the fundamentalist free traders will no doubt attack this measure, in the same way that they have attacked any form of constraint on dumping over a very long period of time, but they won't win with this government. They won't win with this argument. Free trade, to be worthy of that description, has to be fair. It is essential that the G20, which has recently endorsed this view, maintains the strength of its opposition to dumping, as has the WTO. In the communique following the most recent meeting of the G20 in Hamburg, in July, it was noted that the group would:


… continue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognise the role of legitimate trade defence instruments in this regard.


That was said by the G20 against the backdrop of a deep and abiding commitment to, certainly, free trade but indeed also to fair trade.


Australia has long maintained exactly that approach. In our most recent free trade agreements we've ensured that that principle has been enshrined. In all these arguments we have had, we stick to that fundamental principle that free trade has to be fair trade. As a practitioner myself of international trade, across everything from agriculture through to high technology, I have seen dumping measures, and in fact I've been on the receiving end of them, both in the Australian market and in international markets. We need to remember that as a country, not unlike as a company, you prosper by leveraging your core strengths, by leveraging what you are good at. If one market happens to have a competitive advantage over another, then so be it. That is the way the free market economy operates. But dumping actually does not recognise any core competency of one marketplace over another, of one player over another. It is a clear market distortion and manipulation and it is for that reason that we, together with the opposition, need to hold firm on anti-dumping measures. For this reason I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (12:27):  I would like to thank the member for Fairfax for his contribution. I note that, as he said right at the outset, success has many parents. Of course, I would like to thank the member for Blair for his support; however, I'm not going to quite let go through to the keeper some of the comments that were made, especially in regard to us—or me in particular as the minister responsible—following Senator Carr's lead. I would like to thank the industry for coming to me some three or four months ago to highlight that we had a deficiency in our system. I also would like to thank my senior colleagues, especially the Attorney-General and his department for working so closely with us to draft so quickly a remedy to this problem. The problem, put simply, was that the system as it sat had functioned fine, but no system lives in a vacuum and people operating under the confines of that system, especially when there is dumping involved, and financial gain off the back of that and obviously financial detriment to industry domestically, are forever looking for loopholes—loophole-mining—and they found one. They found that, if they stayed out of the market for a period of time, instead of the duty assessed and attached to it they would revert back to a price that was far more beneficial to them, and, as a result, place Australian industry, and ultimately Australian jobs, at risk. This was brought to my attention strongly by major industrial employers in this country.


So, with the help of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and his office, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister's office, we worked very quickly and collaboratively to come up with some legislative changes that will fix this loophole. I would like to thank the shadow minister for his help and any help he may have had in working with the Senate Economics Committee, on their side of the fence, on the fair dinkum front, and for following our lead to ensure that these changes were implemented as quickly as was physically possible.


Because the shadow minister opened this door, I will as well make reference to his thoughts that he wished I would follow my opponent in the Senate on building cladding. I am not a fan of unconstitutional laws. There is a problem, of course, when you rush something out and you don't do your homework and don't think about how our system of governance actually works. If you are to ban cladding and put in place legislative changes that penalise people, then as a federal government, because of our Constitution, you can only do that to federal instruments—that is, companies. If we want to go down the building regulation side, sadly—and I wish it wasn't this way—property rights in this country lie with states. Sole traders or partnerships that are working, as they do, predominantly and largely in the building sector are subject to state laws, not Commonwealth laws. 


That said, the problem is complex and we are working through it in a measured fashion. I will have a lot more to say on it—and my state and territory counterparts, who are in charge of compliance and enforcement in the building space. And, again, my shadow minister in the other place had trouble understanding how the National Construction Code actually works. The National Construction Code came about in 1944 when the states and territories agreed with the federal government to jointly administer our construction codes. My shadow minister is of the understanding that we administer the National Construction Code. We do not. We do it in conjunction with our state and territory counterparts. He has had some very derogatory things to say about the code itself, which is sad, because all that does is shake confidence. In the overwhelming majority of examples, our state and territory counterparts are doing the right thing and enforcing the law the way that it is written.


I will say, also, while I have the opportunity—and the member for Fairfax used this exact term, and I said it across the desk to my shadow minister—that we on this side have obviously been, for almost five years, very keen on free trade. However, as the minister responsible for this portfolio, I know it is extremely important that free trade should be fair trade. Why? Because if it's not, Australian jobs will be put at risk.


I do want to quickly say that at the moment, sadly, manufacturing in this great country is getting a dud rap. There is so much happening, and not just the transitioning from traditional blue-collar jobs to more advanced manufacturing. You have heard a lot said about manufacturing employment over the last week, and you'll hear a lot more in the next week, no doubt, as events unfold in South Australia and Victoria. In the last 12 months there has been a net increase of 15,100 jobs in the manufacturing sector in this country; 6,300 of those have come in Victoria and 3,700 in South Australia, with the rest spread around the country.


There are many, many good transition stories. I was at the University of South Australia recently with SMR Automotive, who were traditionally a component supplier to Holden. They are now, with a collaboration that's occurred through a Cooperative Research Centre project—a CRC-P—working with the University of South Australia. They've come up with a new plastic adhesive. The traditional rear-view mirror and side door mirror on the car is now made with their groundbreaking plastic technology. This is a world first—patented and implemented here. They've just signed in excess of $75 million worth of global deals. In South Australia and Victoria the transition that is occurring in the motor industry is from being builders of entire cars to becoming part of a global supply chain. SMR is the classic example of that, and it is but one. I have travelled around Victoria, including Deakin University—the carbon hub there, and the carbon revolution that is happening there. One of the companies in the seat of the member for Corangamite had a 25-person team in Germany in R&D. They have moved those 25 people back here to Australia to do their research and development.


I thank the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for its recent consideration of the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, particularly its recommendation that this bill be passed by the Senate. The government will respond to the report they issued during that debate because an effective antidumping system is an essential part of this government's commitment to free and fair trade. The antidumping system is complex. This requires us in government to maintain constant vigilance to ensure it keeps up with the changing nature of international trade as well as the ability to act rapidly when significant issues arise, and this was quite clearly one of those. The government continually monitors the efficiency and effectiveness of the antidumping system and consults closely with Australian industry in evaluating the need for further improvements. 


I thank the chamber for considering this bill. It will assist in maintaining the integrity of our antidumping system and provide relief and certainty for Australian industry being injured by dumped or subsidised goods and, most importantly, look after, ultimately, Australian jobs. I commend this bill to the House.

As the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, I am more than aware of the Turnbull government's consistent failure to consult with stakeholders about legislative changes which may affect them. We believe in genuine consultation in this area. I note all Australian industry representatives made submissions to the Senate inquiry and they all supported the proposed introduction of measures to strengthen Australia's antidumping scheme. BlueScope Steel stated in their submission: 


It became obvious that a new strategy had been employed by a large number of these exporters to exploit a 'gap' within the existing review of measures process. This strategy was simply to withdraw from exporting to Australia for 12 months and then request a review of their imposed measures. The outcome of such a strategy was to effectively guarantee a new interim anti-dumping duty of 0 %.


As a consequence, BlueScope has witnessed an immediate recommencement of exports from those countries, increasing within three months of the minister's decision by over 300 per cent, in conjunction with a price drop of around 15 per cent. This was a huge undercut to local manufacturers, the local economy and local jobs. The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, AMWU, concluded:


This legislation improves Australia's anti-dumping system by ensuring a more transparent and efficient review mechanism to avoid circumvention.


The CFMEU supported that as well. The AMWU indicated it remains 'open to further changes to the antidumping system to ensure injurious dumping is stamped out'. 


Given the feedback by industry and by trade unions, it is important that we support this legislation. Indeed, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee recommended the bill be passed. I commend the work of Senator Kim Carr, the shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, for the extensive consultation in relation to the legislation before the chamber. We have consulted with a whole range of organisations about this matter. I urge the Turnbull government to follow our lead and consult widely and wisely in relation to this, as we have done. 


It is clear that this bill would help close the gap in the antidumping system that has been gamed by foreign exporters. In these circumstances, we support the legislation. While antidumping measures might not be the everyday topic of conversation over a water cooler or at a barbecue, it is extremely important to the livelihood of Australia's local manufacturers and the livelihood of their workers. On this side of the chamber, we will always fight for workers. A Shorten Labor government will put middle- and working-class Australians first. We support the legislation and thank the government for following our lead.

Mr TED O'BRIEN

 (
Fairfax
) (
12:14
):  I would like to thank the opposition for standing with the government on this measure. It is often said that failures are orphans and successes have many fathers, and it is no surprise that we have here a terrific measure being introduced by the government for which the opposition wish to take credit. That's okay, Mr Speaker. At the end of the day, the opposition do look to the Turnbull government to get things done and we are paving the way in all areas, not least of which is this area of international trade. We are ensuring that those companies that are exposed to trade here in Australia, because either they trade internationally or their competitors or substitutes for their goods or services also come from international markets, are looked after. That's what the Turnbull government do, and we're delighted that the opposition recognise the good work that we're doing and so much wish to be part of it. They seek to take the credit, and good on them for attempting to do so.


There are few more contentious issues to be had around the topic of international trade than the issue of dumping and the measures governments right around the world have exercised for a century or more to combat it. The simplest definition of dumping is the sale by an exporter of a product in another country for less than it is sold at home. In other words, a company sells a product for a certain price at home and then exports it to another market and undercuts the domestic price significantly, thereby 'dumping' it into the other market. This has been a highly contentious element of international trade for many hundreds of years because it has the clear potential to do significant damage to businesses, industries and potentially entire economies. Dumping has become increasingly important over the past few decades as the volume of international trade has increased at exponential rates.


Over the past 20 years or so, measures to control dumping have expanded and come into more widespread use right around the world. The motivation of governments to take action to control dumping is quite straightforward: it's a defence mechanism. The motive of the exporter, or the dumper, might well be predatory. An offending exporter may seek to price other exporters out of a particular market in a recipient country. It may want to have that market to itself or it may want to kill off a local industry in the market so it can supplant it, beat off potential competitors and establish a monopoly or at least a dominant position in that market. Alternatively, the exporter may simply have overcapacity in its home market and, rather than slow down production, may wish to export the excess of its inventory so that it can keep its production line rolling on. Of course, potentially this will end up having a devastating effect on the like industry and competitors in the recipient market. Whatever the motivation—predatory or even strategically benign—the impacts in the importing recipient country can be significant and generally negative for local businesses and jobs. To compete with dumped products, a local business may well, at the very least, have to drop its own prices to maintain market share and production, possibly to levels below even the cost of production. That is obviously a dead end for any business and potentially fatal for an enterprise if such an imbalance persists.


At the other end of the spectrum, however, you could argue that consumers in a recipient country might be better off, at least in the short term, whether the dumped product is finished retail or maybe an input into a manufacturing supply chain. If it is a finished product then it is cheaper than the locally produced product, and maybe that's a straightforward benefit to the consumer. If the dumped product is a cheap or at least less expensive input into a manufacturing supply chain, that might help the manufacturer boost his or her profits and use those profits to reinvest. Some free market fundamentalists, who don't understand the true meaning of free trade, will describe antidumping measures as protectionist because they will concentrate on those last couple of points. They will start to argue, 'You know what, even if it is dumping, it ends up being cheaper product for the recipient marketplace.' However, what these fundamentalists clearly do not understand is that unfair free trade is in fact an oxymoron.


Rational national governments with an eye to history and a firsthand knowledge of the dangers of dumping, both potential and real, differ from these fundamentalists. This government, the Turnbull government, is indeed a rational government, as all Australian governments have been on this issue, at least since Federation. Measures to control dumping have been in place in Australia from the beginning, from Federation, 1901. Ever since, they have been updated and revised regularly by governments—I have to say, in the spirit of the previous speaker—of both persuasions, with the measures in this bill, the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, being the latest but inevitably not the last iteration of a very important defensive measure. For more than a century, these measures have never been abandoned or even sidelined. Through war, depression, boom and bust, this basic defence of the Australian economy has been maintained.


Very significantly, when Australia was a signatory to the first real international attempt to promote free trade, via the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1948, which was aimed largely at reducing tariffs so we could expand trade globally, the ability of the original 23 member states to undertake remedial action against dumpers was very actively pushed for and accepted. Tariffs came down, free trade was significantly expanded, but anti-dumping measures remained in place. In the various iterations of GATT, right up to the Uruguay Round of 1994, which led to the establishment of the WTO, the World Trade Organization, in the following year as the successor to the GATT, that right was deliberately retained and is still there, accessible to all of the now 159 member states of the WTO. In the context of defending ever freer, ever fairer global trade, they're using it. This is not some passive measure that is never used. In 2015-16 alone, 45 WTO members initiated 267 anti-dumping investigations: India, 66; the US, 51; Pakistan, 21. Australia initiated 18, mostly in the steel and aluminium sectors, with the vast majority involving Asian exporters.


There is a critical juxtaposition here. GATT, now the WTO, is all about liberalising trade. The anti-dumping provisions contained in this bill, principally via special duties on dumped goods, are in keeping with that aim, despite the claims of the fundamentalists, by ensuring that tree trade is not distorted or undermined by dumping practices, that indeed it's given the opportunity to be fair, that there's a fair playing field. We need to ensure that this government, and indeed future governments, remain vigilant in that task. Becoming increasingly wise to the manoeuvres used by dumpers to achieve this has led the Australian government to enhance and be ever more specific about the measures needed to keep our playing field level.


For example, one tactic now covered by this bill is that an exporter of a product that is subject to an anti-dumping duty will have another exporter, a different company, whose similar dumped product has a lower duty set against it, do the exporting for them. Another tactic is called country-hopping, where the exports will be diverted through a country that does not have anti-dumping penalties in place, and again, the government is on top of that one. A third trick is to slightly modify your product beyond the specifications of a product that has attracted the anti-dumping duty, even though it is effectively one and the same, and that avenue of circumvention has now too been blocked. We're also addressing other behaviours that seek to disguise dumping practices, including the assembly of products in third countries.


You see, the fundamentalist free traders will no doubt attack this measure, in the same way that they have attacked any form of constraint on dumping over a very long period of time, but they won't win with this government. They won't win with this argument. Free trade, to be worthy of that description, has to be fair. It is essential that the G20, which has recently endorsed this view, maintains the strength of its opposition to dumping, as has the WTO. In the communique following the most recent meeting of the G20 in Hamburg, in July, it was noted that the group would:


… continue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognise the role of legitimate trade defence instruments in this regard.


That was said by the G20 against the backdrop of a deep and abiding commitment to, certainly, free trade but indeed also to fair trade.


Australia has long maintained exactly that approach. In our most recent free trade agreements we've ensured that that principle has been enshrined. In all these arguments we have had, we stick to that fundamental principle that free trade has to be fair trade. As a practitioner myself of international trade, across everything from agriculture through to high technology, I have seen dumping measures, and in fact I've been on the receiving end of them, both in the Australian market and in international markets. We need to remember that as a country, not unlike as a company, you prosper by leveraging your core strengths, by leveraging what you are good at. If one market happens to have a competitive advantage over another, then so be it. That is the way the free market economy operates. But dumping actually does not recognise any core competency of one marketplace over another, of one player over another. It is a clear market distortion and manipulation and it is for that reason that we, together with the opposition, need to hold firm on anti-dumping measures. For this reason I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (12:27):  I would like to thank the member for Fairfax for his contribution. I note that, as he said right at the outset, success has many parents. Of course, I would like to thank the member for Blair for his support; however, I'm not going to quite let go through to the keeper some of the comments that were made, especially in regard to us—or me in particular as the minister responsible—following Senator Carr's lead. I would like to thank the industry for coming to me some three or four months ago to highlight that we had a deficiency in our system. I also would like to thank my senior colleagues, especially the Attorney-General and his department for working so closely with us to draft so quickly a remedy to this problem. The problem, put simply, was that the system as it sat had functioned fine, but no system lives in a vacuum and people operating under the confines of that system, especially when there is dumping involved, and financial gain off the back of that and obviously financial detriment to industry domestically, are forever looking for loopholes—loophole-mining—and they found one. They found that, if they stayed out of the market for a period of time, instead of the duty assessed and attached to it they would revert back to a price that was far more beneficial to them, and, as a result, place Australian industry, and ultimately Australian jobs, at risk. This was brought to my attention strongly by major industrial employers in this country.


So, with the help of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and his office, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister's office, we worked very quickly and collaboratively to come up with some legislative changes that will fix this loophole. I would like to thank the shadow minister for his help and any help he may have had in working with the Senate Economics Committee, on their side of the fence, on the fair dinkum front, and for following our lead to ensure that these changes were implemented as quickly as was physically possible.


Because the shadow minister opened this door, I will as well make reference to his thoughts that he wished I would follow my opponent in the Senate on building cladding. I am not a fan of unconstitutional laws. There is a problem, of course, when you rush something out and you don't do your homework and don't think about how our system of governance actually works. If you are to ban cladding and put in place legislative changes that penalise people, then as a federal government, because of our Constitution, you can only do that to federal instruments—that is, companies. If we want to go down the building regulation side, sadly—and I wish it wasn't this way—property rights in this country lie with states. Sole traders or partnerships that are working, as they do, predominantly and largely in the building sector are subject to state laws, not Commonwealth laws. 


That said, the problem is complex and we are working through it in a measured fashion. I will have a lot more to say on it—and my state and territory counterparts, who are in charge of compliance and enforcement in the building space. And, again, my shadow minister in the other place had trouble understanding how the National Construction Code actually works. The National Construction Code came about in 1944 when the states and territories agreed with the federal government to jointly administer our construction codes. My shadow minister is of the understanding that we administer the National Construction Code. We do not. We do it in conjunction with our state and territory counterparts. He has had some very derogatory things to say about the code itself, which is sad, because all that does is shake confidence. In the overwhelming majority of examples, our state and territory counterparts are doing the right thing and enforcing the law the way that it is written.


I will say, also, while I have the opportunity—and the member for Fairfax used this exact term, and I said it across the desk to my shadow minister—that we on this side have obviously been, for almost five years, very keen on free trade. However, as the minister responsible for this portfolio, I know it is extremely important that free trade should be fair trade. Why? Because if it's not, Australian jobs will be put at risk.


I do want to quickly say that at the moment, sadly, manufacturing in this great country is getting a dud rap. There is so much happening, and not just the transitioning from traditional blue-collar jobs to more advanced manufacturing. You have heard a lot said about manufacturing employment over the last week, and you'll hear a lot more in the next week, no doubt, as events unfold in South Australia and Victoria. In the last 12 months there has been a net increase of 15,100 jobs in the manufacturing sector in this country; 6,300 of those have come in Victoria and 3,700 in South Australia, with the rest spread around the country.


There are many, many good transition stories. I was at the University of South Australia recently with SMR Automotive, who were traditionally a component supplier to Holden. They are now, with a collaboration that's occurred through a Cooperative Research Centre project—a CRC-P—working with the University of South Australia. They've come up with a new plastic adhesive. The traditional rear-view mirror and side door mirror on the car is now made with their groundbreaking plastic technology. This is a world first—patented and implemented here. They've just signed in excess of $75 million worth of global deals. In South Australia and Victoria the transition that is occurring in the motor industry is from being builders of entire cars to becoming part of a global supply chain. SMR is the classic example of that, and it is but one. I have travelled around Victoria, including Deakin University—the carbon hub there, and the carbon revolution that is happening there. One of the companies in the seat of the member for Corangamite had a 25-person team in Germany in R&D. They have moved those 25 people back here to Australia to do their research and development.


I thank the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for its recent consideration of the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017, particularly its recommendation that this bill be passed by the Senate. The government will respond to the report they issued during that debate because an effective antidumping system is an essential part of this government's commitment to free and fair trade. The antidumping system is complex. This requires us in government to maintain constant vigilance to ensure it keeps up with the changing nature of international trade as well as the ability to act rapidly when significant issues arise, and this was quite clearly one of those. The government continually monitors the efficiency and effectiveness of the antidumping system and consults closely with Australian industry in evaluating the need for further improvements. 


I thank the chamber for considering this bill. It will assist in maintaining the integrity of our antidumping system and provide relief and certainty for Australian industry being injured by dumped or subsidised goods and, most importantly, look after, ultimately, Australian jobs. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (13:30):  In his message to new citizens, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection writes:


People of all backgrounds and religions strengthen our country and only together, united will our future be as strong as our present and past. 


So why is the government making it so difficult for people to become Australian citizens? Two weeks ago, I received an email from the Community Services Directorate of the ACT government telling me that one of the two upcoming citizenship ceremonies on 12 October had been cancelled. The email read, 'Due to a decline in the number of citizenship candidates, the afternoon ceremony at 1.30 pm has been cancelled.' The number of people seeking Australian citizenship in the ACT hasn't declined; it hasn't stalled. It's the process that has stalled—the process. 


Each week my office gets phone calls and emails from people wanting updates on their citizenship applications—applications that are sitting idle in the department, waiting to be processed. This is the system that the Turnbull government has put in place. It's told citizenship aspirants they don't need to bother to apply, that applications received after 20 April will not be processed. This is absolutely outrageous. Citizenship shouldn't be about politics. It should be about who we are as a modern nation, and these attacks by the government are a direct attack on Australia as a multicultural nation. (Time expired)

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (15:14):  Few things better encapsulate the out-of-touch attitude of this Prime Minister and this government towards ordinary Australians than the issue of broadband and their second-rate copper NBN. You only have to look at the answers in question time yesterday to appreciate the scale of just how far removed this Prime Minister is from the lived reality being experienced by consumers every day, from all age groups, from all walks of life, in every part of the country. Three themes have come out from this government: the preference for spin before the lived experiences of consumers; peddling the fallacy that their NBN, on their watch, is on track and on budget; and continuing the blame game and buck passing—the failure to take responsibility even into their fifth year in government.


In stark contrast, those of us on this side of the House have been listening to consumers. When it comes to broadband as an essential utility, this out-of-touch government favours spin above the consumer experience. We know how important it is for consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole to get world-class broadband to every part of the country.


Looking at every measure on which this government set itself—faster, sooner and more affordable—they have failed on every single count. The evidence is crystal clear. It was supposed to be delivered by 2016. As at 31 December, 7 million premises were still waiting. They promised they would deliver it for $29 billion, and it's blown out to $50 billion. And it's not faster. All you need to do is have a look at the level of complaints that are coming in at record scale from consumers right around Australia. They talked a big game about how their second-rate version would be cheaper. Yesterday, the Prime Minister tried to assert the same. But we've actually known since 2014—thanks to the minister at the table, the Minister for Urban Infrastructure—that the claims that they made when they were in opposition about the cost of Labor's NBN were just wrong. We only need to look at The Sydney Morning Herald on 18 February 2014, where the minister at the table admitted:


… the Coalition's claim that Labor's NBN would cost more than $90 billion … was wrong.


   …   …   …


When asked if the $90 billion estimate was a ""political figure"" floated to win votes, Mr Fletcher admitted that figure was also wrong.


You don't need to look very far to see the complete disregard this government has and how they've absolutely taken their out-of-touch approach to the next level. Have a look at the Prime Minister only days ago, when he was asked about the NBN on radio. The Prime Minister said: 


I think we've got this in hand.


Neil Mitchell said:


But Prime Minister people tell me it is not in hand. Every time we raise it the board is full of people complaining.


We have the cost blow out of $20 billion, a roll-out schedule three years behind the promised delivery time and Australia slipping from 30th to 50th in the world in the international broadband rankings. We've had a 150 per cent increase in TIO complaints about NBN faults. There has been—wait for this—a 1,075 per cent blow out to $640 million in the copper remediation bill.


Those opposite will like to favour the spin, but those of us on this side know the sheer despair that is being felt by Australians for their inability to access broadband and, when they can access it, it's unreliability—the fact that it simply doesn't perform to task. I have one story—we've all heard it—of students who can't download what they need for their school work or their tertiary education. They park outside the public library just to get the free wi-fi or go to McDonald's to be able to access some broadband.


People understand this. It's something for which those opposite give very little credit: the consumers of Australia understand what they should be getting and what they would have been getting under Labor's superior model. People go around the world—I get this all time—and come back and say, 'I was in a remote part of Cambodia, and I had the best internet I have ever had compared to my own home.' The government is completely oblivious to the lived experience of consumers.


Those opposite also purport to be the champions of small business. Let's have a look at what the Council of Small Business Australia had to say in July:


… its members are frustrated and ""shocked"" with slow connections and poor service under the National Broadband Network, with the problems causing many businesses to suffer substantial losses.


Peter Strong from COSBOA said what the public was told about the NBN was 'not the reality'. He said:


When people think NBN, they think fast internet but then they sign up and find they are getting slower speeds than they were before. We were told it would be so fast it would shock us. It has shocked us but not because it’s fast.


Mr Strong also said that members had reported problems with dropouts and patchy service. 


The New South Wales Business Chamber reported that 43 per cent of the 850 businesses it surveyed said they were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the NBN. This is from a government that purports to be the champion of small businesses. This survey from the New South Wales Business Chamber reported it is costing small businesses an average of $9,000 through delays, disruptions and loss of sales. An article in the Newcastle Herald noted that the owner of a Newcastle post office has been without phone and internet for nine days and is out of pocket thousands of dollars and is sick of waiting. The article states:


Australia Post Edgeworth owner Paul Roddenby said his connection was fine until a national broadband network (nbn) technician visited on October 5 for work not requested by the shop.


""He did something, then he said he’d be back in five minutes, and he never came back. It hasn’t worked since,"" Mr Roddenby said.


Since then, the Australia Post outlet has had no phone, not internet and no answers.


Well, you don't have to look very far for the lived experiences and frustrations of the consumers of Australia with this government's inferior copper based network. 


There are Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman complaints about faults on the NBN jumping by 147.8 per cent. Complaints about slow internet speeds are soaring by 48 per cent, and fibre to the node remains a key source of dissatisfaction. You only have to look at the top 10 postcodes for complaints about the NBN and—what a surprise!—seven of them are in fibre-to-the-node areas. Even NBN's own survey data shows that consumers rate the copper NBN below every other technology, at only 41 per cent advocacy. We've even had the NBN CEO forced to concede that this government's 30-year business case doesn't set aside any funding to upgrade the copper network. This means the current business case assumes Australians are going to be stuck on copper until 2040! 


On top of this, we've seen nearly a tenfold increase in Australians seeking to pay—themselves—to switch their NBN connection from copper to fibre. And we had the Prime Minister, before the 2013 election, promise that individuals would have the option of paying somewhere between $2,250 and $3,000 to switch from copper to fibre. But NBN revealed the average quoted cost today has been $15,800 greater than what the Prime Minister promised. You don't need to take it from me. In fact, even the government's own MPs are criticising it. The member for Mallee bemoans the rollout of faceless NBN. The Guardiansaid: 


… the Mallee MP said he had seen problems with the rollout first-hand as his constituents struggled to make their services work, and he had been forced to dedicate one of his electoral officers to dealing with the complaints. 


So there is a dose of reality from at least one member on that side of the chamber. 


When it comes to copper or coal and you hear this Prime Minister talk about engineering and economics, you know it's a farce. You know he has failed. You know that this copper NBN is letting down Australians. (Time expired)

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (15:24):  It takes a certain kind of doctrinaire, political commissar-like insistence to roll out this tedious line that we hear from Labor communications spokespersons in the face of the quantitative evidence that the rollout is continuing and the rollout is going well. 


We had an MPI on 17 September 2015 brought by the Labor opposition. There were 1,291,000 premises able to connect at that time. They came back and had another go on 21 October 2015—1,374,000 premises able to connect; 10 February 2016, 1,719,000 premises able to connect. But wilfully turning their minds from the evidence, they came back and had another go on 3 May 2016, when there were 2,428,000 premises able to connect. Then, of course, the member for Blaxland was pleased to be relieved of the terrible job of being Labor's shadow communications spokesman, trying to find gloom as the broadband light increasingly shone over the nation. That job fell to the member for Greenway. On 11 October 2016, she rolled out her first matter of public importance debate on the NBN. By that time, the number of premises able to pass had continued to relentlessly increase to 3,207,700. She had another go on 22 November 2016—again, wilfully turning her mind from the clear evidence that the rollout was continuing relentlessly and that more and more premises around the country were able to connect. By that point: 3,231,397 premises. Evidently feeling a bit depressed by the evidence that the NBN rollout is continuing remorselessly, she hasn't been back to the well until today. It's almost a year since the last time she had a go, but the numbers have continued to inexorably increase. The number of premises now able to connect is 6,188,166. In fact, some 35,000 premises a week are being connected to the NBN. 


This is a very large-scale rollout. It is a project which is complex, which covers the nation and which is being delivered notwithstanding the hopeless, chaotic mess that we inherited from the Labor Party when we came to government in 2013. If you are a Labor shadow minister for communications, it seems that you come up with your own version of the prayer of St Francis of Assisi—where there is light, let me find darkness; where there is hope, let me counsel despair; where there is sustained and impressive progress on a very large-scale rollout, let me assert chaos continually and in the absence of evidence.


Let's have a look, in detail, at some of the extraordinarily misleading statements consistently made by the Labor Party and the shadow minister. We saw a shining example yesterday. The shadow minister asked a question about a survey by the reputable internet survey company Akamai which she asserted shows that Australia is behind Kenya. What was her dazzling piece of logic for making this argument? She said that the almost two per cent of people in Kenya who are able to connect to a broadband network should be compared to the result in Australia of a network which is designed to ubiquitously serve the entire population. What an entirely misleading characterisation of that survey but, sadly, entirely consistent with the rhetorical approach we see from the Labor Party, because what they know is that their record on this project is an embarrassing catalogue of ineptitude.


They had six years on the NBN, and they wasted nearly two years on a plan which they couldn't deliver. They had to ignominiously and embarrassingly walk away from it. They came up with a new plan in April 2009, which supposedly was going to be done in conjunction with the private sector. But that didn't happen. A year later we discovered that the private sector wasn't interested in participating. What was the hopeless, pathetic, incompetent record that they left when they scuttled out of government? Barely 50,000 premises around the country were able to connect—barely 50,000 premises after six years of government and spending $6 billion. I remind the House, as I have just pointed out, that we are connecting 35,000 a week. That's 35,000 a week against 50,000 in six years. I'd call one record pretty good. I'd call another a catalogue of rank incompetence and ineptitude. Yet, bizarrely, the shadow minister keeps turning up and wanting to debate this issue yet again, for reasons that are mystifying. 


Let's look at the facts about Dobell. We had some questions from the member for Dobell yesterday. She asked about the Rudolf Steiner school in Fountaindale. I can inform the House that the facts are that there needs to be a fixed-line lead-in so that that school can be connected. NBN has scheduled a crew to complete that work next month. Let me respond to the question she asked about constituents in Wyreema Road in Warnervale. The infrastructure has been installed in that street, the work is underway to integrate into the NBN core network, and NBN is aiming to make services available to all premises in Wyreema Road by December of this year. These are the facts. 


But let me point out another fact about the electorate of Dobell. Do you know how many premises were connected to the fibre network, the fixed network, in Dobell when this incompetent rabble left office? Zero. After four years, your electorate had zero premises connected to the fixed network. Do you know how many premises are able to connect in the electorate of Dobell today? That number is 86,500. Of those who are able to connect, there are 57,898 premises connected. I say to the member for Dobell: yes, you have identified a couple of instances where people are not connected, and I have just been able to demonstrate when they are going to be connected, but I also say to you that there are 57,898 connected. Let's do a little comparison. One government delivers zero. One government delivers 57,898. I'd suggest that those from the party that formed the first government are really on a hiding to nothing when they pursue this issue.




Mr Hill:
  Yes, he's right. He's speaking the truth—he is self-aware!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton

Mr FLETCHER:
  What is Labor's plan to deliver the NBN? That's a very good question. The shadow minister is very good at complaining. She does a very poor job of telling Australians what her plan is. But let's have a look at the plan that was put forward by the Labor Party for the 2016 election, because I think that's the best evidence we have of the continued narrative of rank incompetence from these people, who have a dismal track record on broadband and no proven capacity to deliver. The promise of the previous shadow minister, the member for Blaxland, at the 2016 election was that they were going to connect two million more premises to fibre than the coalition was promising, and it was going to cost not one dollar more. It's an economic miracle! That is the kind of thing that Swannie's economic brain might have come up with. What did The Australian Financial Review have to say about this ripper plan? It said:


A lack of considered detail bedevilled the NBN under Labor. The fact the party doesn't want to give any details about its new plan—or more accurately, a reinstatement of the old NBN—and not talk about the cost, makes this policy look like the last: an expensive joke.


It was a pretty accurate assessment, because when it comes to delivering a broadband network, this mob on the opposite side of the House have form, and their form is hopeless, rank, embarrassing, chaotic incompetence. That's your track record. We've seen nothing from the shadow minister and we've seen nothing from the opposition that suggests they are going to be anything else. We are getting on and delivering the National Broadband Network.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (15:34):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it takes a certain kind of genius, doesn't it, to spend $50 billion on an infrastructure project which is supposed to improve communications in this country, only to see speeds go down and prices go up? This is the stuff that those guys over there say is all going very, very well: $50 billion to see speeds go down and prices go up. That's the experience of Australians right around the country. In fact, from Longman to Logan, from Rankin to Capricornia, right around the country, people are saying the very same thing: 'Do not let these guys near the NBN. They have stuffed up everything they've touched.' The minister was given 10 minutes to explain how they are going to fix this mess. And what was their killer point? What was their killer point? Labor didn't finish the NBN project on the same day that it started it! We didn't finish it on the same day that we started it. That's their killer point. If that is all they've got to defend themselves, Australia is in a world of pain and trouble. 


We have got a project that is failing from beginning to end, with connections failing and bad technology. The CEO of the NBN has himself conceded that they stuff it up one in 10 times. One in 10 times, they are stuffing it up. Can you imagine running a hamburger store where one in 10 customers come back with food poisoning? You'd be run out of business pretty quickly. But they think, and this government thinks, that, if you stuff it up one in 10 times, things are going all right. If you want to see the blood drain from government members' faces as quick as anything, just look at them when the Prime Minister says, 'We've got it; it's all going okay,' because they know themselves it's not going okay. They know that there are big problems. 


Businesses are losing thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars. I see the member for Capricornia in the chamber today, and I'm glad she is. Perhaps she'll have something to say to defend the small businesses in her electorate which are losing thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars because of the failed NBN project in Central Queensland. And it doesn't stop there in Rockhampton and right throughout Central Queensland. Up and down the coast, small businesses and premises are saying the very same thing. They need a champion in seats like that who say they are going to do something about the NBN project, instead of these apologists over there who simply haven't got the answer. 


Tomorrow the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is going to release a report, and it is not going to be good news for you mob over there. It is not going to be good news for that mob over there, because, in the last report we saw, there was a 53.6 per cent increase in the complaints about broadband. I guarantee you the jump tomorrow is going to be even greater than that. Those members opposite might think that's okay. But I just want to leave you with one fact: the telecommunications industry receives over 112,000 complaints a year. That is four times—four times—the number of complaints that the finance and banking industry receives, and you all know what the feeling out there in the electorate is about a royal commission into the banking and finance industry. Why do you think that 'business as usual' is going to be okay? The mob are coming after you. You're doing nothing about it, and they're coming after you. 


We've got the ideas for reform. We know what we've got to do. This mob over here have got to improve the rollout and ensure the Australian people are getting the best technology available. We need a tough cop on the beat to ensure that people aren't involved in the NBN ping-pong that you guys are involved in—apologising and blaming but not taking responsibility for anything. We need a tough cop on the beat and we need a set of laws that provide people with the guarantees and the regulations for a decent broadband service, not the outdated system that we have in place at the moment. 


So I challenge all those members opposite: do the right thing, get behind your own constituencies and demand a decent broadband service for rural and regional Australia and right around the country, instead of apologising for the rank failure that your NBN project has been. We shouldn't be spending $50 billion on this project to see services go backwards.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (15:39):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance regarding the National Broadband Network. Who could forget that famous flight when Senator Conroy and Kevin 747 jetted off into the sunset on the prime ministerial jet, and I guess champagne was flowing, and canapes were being served, and the NBN was being hastily conceived on the back of a beer coaster! The NBN was planned by Senator Conroy and Kevin 747 on the back of a beer coaster! They didn't know how much it would cost. They didn't really know why they were doing it. They didn't know what the outcome would be. All they wanted was a headline, and a very expensive headline it would be.


We had the promise of this mystical network that was going to be unaffordable to Australian telecommunications consumers. We had promise after promise by Labor and a total lack of delivery. Who could forget the trial in Hobart? The towns of Smithton, Midway Point and Scottsdale were going to become economic powerhouses under the supercharging of Kevin's NBN, but it didn't happen. Smithton, Midway Point and Scottsdale are nice little towns, nice places, but still not supercharged by the NBN. The NBN under Labor certainly set a record. It set a record by missing every target that it ever set for itself. It missed every single target. We had a situation where the massive cost of this was going to push up the price of broadband out of the reach of Australian consumers.


This government takes a much more realistic approach. We are about delivering a mix of technologies that are appropriate. We are about delivering an appropriate investment that's going to meet this nation's telecommunications needs and going to deliver the high-speed broadband that is required, but in the context of budget responsibility. Labor doesn't have any notion of budget responsibility. If Labor's plans were implemented, the cost to consumers would increase by $43 every month.


When you look at the break-up of the customers to the NBN, it's very interesting. Where are most people connecting? Are they taking the high-flying packages? Are they having a cost-doesn't-matter approach to hooking up to the NBN? I can say that they are not. Some 28.5 per cent of consumers are on a package that is 12 megabits or less; 55.6 per cent of consumers are on a package that's 25 megabits; 4 per cent—only 4 per cent—are taking a 50 megabit package; and less than 0.01 per cent are adopting a package over 100 megabits. So, we have a situation where 84 per cent of consumers are taking up plans that are 25 megabits or less.


Under the government's NBN rollout, we are seeing massive improvements in the telecommunications experience for people in regional and rural areas. Those on the fixed wireless network are very happy with the quality of the service that they are achieving. Under the Sky Muster program, we are increasing data limits. We are making it more flexible for those people outside the reach of the fixed line and the wireless footprint. It is all about making an investment that is appropriate.


In this House today, we have had a lot of discussion on power prices. One of the key factors that has driven up power prices is an inappropriate investment in the poles and wires, making power unaffordable to so many households. In exactly the same way, an inappropriate investment in the NBN would have made broadband services unaffordable to Australian households as well. This government is about an appropriate investment, an investment that is absolutely sound from a financial point of view and an investment that will deliver the sort of flexibility that is needed to achieve Australia's broadband needs. We are approaching this in a sensible, well-managed way. Labor missed every target it set for itself. Their rollout was an absolute disaster. (Time expired)

 (Dobell) (15:44):  How many complaints would an electorate office expect to receive about the NBN in one year? One hundred?

  More.

  Two hundred?

Ms McBRIDE:
  Higher: my office has dealt with upwards of 450, and counting, in the last 12 months about the NBN. These complaints commonly fall into four categories: poor experience getting connected, slow internet speeds, being stuck between the retail service provider and NBN—the NBN ping-pong—and technology not meeting consumer expectations. I've heard from businesses that estimate losses of tens of thousands of dollars, from families whose children can't finish their homework, from elderly people isolated and at risk without landlines. I've heard from people frustrated by this blame-shifting between the NBN and their provider. I couldn't put it better than Neil Keele. This is what he said to me, plain and simple:


It's total crap.


The Central Coast is one of the first regions for the full-scale rollout, and there are now five technologies in the mix. We are a guinea pig for the NBN, and there are serious problems with the fibre-to-the-node technology and with the government's handling of the rollout. But I have breaking news. After writing to the minister for 12 months, I have my official response here.




Ms Madeleine King:
  You're lucky!




Ms McBRIDE:
  I know; I'm very grateful! Wait for this:


That nbn has made terrific progress in serving your community is undeniable.


I don't know how 'terrific progress' stacks up against the TIO 2016 annual report, where four of the top 10 postcodes for complaints about the NBN across the country were from the Central Coast. That is now code for 'terrific progress'. I am going to make a bold prediction today. The next report, which we know is due out tomorrow, will be another damning indictment of the rollout—I know this because I hear it every day—but I'm keen to hear it described as 'terrific progress' and 'undeniable'. In the past month alone, I have heard from Michelle in Fountaindale, whose NBN service was disconnected following a storm in February which brought down the overhead lines. She was without a phone line or internet for eight months, but when the NBN came to fix it, they could offer only a temporary solution. With a bit of indulgence, I have here a picture of the 'TEMP NBN'. Thank you for your indulgence.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  I warn the member for Dobell. Her indulgence is wearing thin.




Ms McBRIDE:
  You would have quickly seen the cable ties where it was connected to the fence. What about Geoffrey from Tacoma, who was switched to an NBN service earlier this year that never worked? Let's hear the NBN's response:


This address was indeed connected to the nbn network in January 2017 but there were numerous service issues and so following a detailed investigation by nbn; it was deemed that the address is not feasible for nbn service. Accordingly, the address was rolled back in our system as not available for nbn service as on 30 May 2017.


I don't know if that's code for terrific or if that's just damn fabulous, but NBN have now taken him off the network, and he has a node in front of his house. Should I go to Henry or should I go to Ken? What about the Steiner School? The shadow minister has been with me to the Steiner School; they presented at the joint standing committee; and we have had commitment after commitment that this school will be connected, but right now, what's ready for service? I was delighted to hear today that the cemetery behind the school is, and the school can still not connect. I am sure that the residents of Wyreema Road in Warnervale will be thrilled with the minister's response:


Regarding your constituents in Warnervale, I presume that you were referring to residents in Wyreema Road, for whom you made a representation last year.


I can advise that infrastructure has been installed in their street, and work to integrate this into nbn's core network is underway.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2017-10-17,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:49):  We were enjoying that contribution, too, I can assure you. I could have enjoyed listening to Ken and Derek. Being a roving complaints bureau, as the opposition are becoming as they travel around the country, scurrying around looking for unhappy people, is one way of surviving through the long and dreary years of opposition—wandering around seat by seat, conducting NBN crisis meetings, where you put on some scones and wait for people to filter in, popping their ALP membership card above their head and sitting in the front row, being given a complaint to read out, and then away they go. We had one of these in my electorate of Bowman, where not a single genuine complaint was elucidated for NBN Co.


I'm not saying there are no genuine complaints. The TIO data is absolutely correct. We need to break up the complaints according to the amount of Australia that's connected. If you are going to double the footprint of NBN, then, self-evidently, you are going to double your complaints. If you have twice as many people connected to NBN, self-evidently there will be twice as many complaints. In fact, complaints per population are falling—a very inconvenient truth for the opposition.


The other great concern of our good friends on the other side is that they promised the gold-plated monorail to every home—the super-fast government-run broadband, where everyone got the same colour curtains, and the same length, and it was all going to happen the day after they planned it. They got to the end of their six-year tenure and, of course, just 200,000 houses were NBN-ready. That sounds like a pretty significant number. Fifty thousand had been connected after six years and multiple failed starts. Fifty thousand sounds like a great number. There we were with 50,000 divided by 150 electorates. That's only 300 households per federal electorate. It's worth repeating: the 50,000 who were connected represent only around 300 households per electorate—that's two streets.




Ms Rowland:
  No complaints in Bowman!




Mr LAMING:
  I will take that interjection from the other side. No, after six years nothing had been done in my electorate of Bowman—zero. With an average of two streets connected after six years, you need to pick this up and ask yourself, in the counter-factual, had Labor continued with their plan how many of the complaints you hear today about our NBN would you have heard for Labor's NBN, where only 10,000 dwellings a year were being connected? They might have upped it to 50,000, but the reality is that it's not 300,000. You need to remember that every complaint you have about the coalition's NBN represents a complaint you'd have had with Labor's NBN, where they basically would drip-feed the nation with fibre to the home and virtually no competition in retail provision. That is quite an important statistic. If they haven't studied economics—and that's everyone on the other side, except one guy who went to ANU and did it through the sociology department—what they won't understand is that with competition between 140 providers you are going to get a drop in price and an increase in data availability. And that drop in price is around $40 a month. Those packages you see from Telstra and Optus are $40 a month cheaper than if you had government provided fibre to the home and no competition in the price at which it is provided.


Take my electorate of Bowman: sure, we'd love a faster rollout, but there are only two potential pathways here. There is the technology mix being used by Scandinavia and by most of the developed world, outside of city states like Singapore, Hong Kong or Seoul, where population density is around 17,000 humans per square kilometre and different forms of economics do stack up. But that's not the case in Australian cities, where Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide have around 1,200 to 2,000 residents per square kilometre. There simply are not enough people paying internet bills to justify fibre to the premises. In Brisbane, where there are 1,200 humans per square kilometre, or in my mainland electorate of Redlands, where there are only 700 humans per square kilometre, there is simply a lot of money paid in rod and roping and not enough customers to pay for the service. That's why the simple premise of the coalition's approach is that we will roll out fibre when it is economically justifiable to do so. That lies at the heart of Labor's approach. They were going to roll out fibre, but six to eight years more slowly. They were going to roll out fibre at $20 to $30 billion more than the country had to spend on it. They can go all around the country collecting complaints, but they cannot escape that brutal reality.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (15:54):  It was going to be a game changer, but now all we have is something that is hurting small businesses, hurting the economy, increasing inequality and continually falling short. We were promised big things, very big things, but it has been the fizzer of all fizzers—and, no, I'm not talking about the Prime Minister; I'm talking about the NBN. The government's turning a blind eye to this mess, and my community for one is totally over it. My office, like the member for Dobell's, has had hundreds of emails and mobile phone calls because businesses and individuals have no internet and no landline, all because of the NBN rollout. If they live in one of the many areas in the electorate of Macquarie which have a poor mobile phone signal, they're calling from the top of their street, on tippy-toes, hoping to get a bit of signal. 


The most insulting part of all is the insistence by this Prime Minister that nothing is wrong—the delusion that all is well and that the only shortfall is that NBN Co needs to improve its PR and retailers need to lift their game. He maintains copper is king. In fact, we know copper is second-rate. I can't believe the Prime Minister doesn't know the mess he's created. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman clearly knows—it's been a job-creator for them. This is the PM for innovation, but he simply put the NBN in the too-hard basket, along with renewable energy and the rest of his values. In the meantime, communities are suffering as they receive an internet service that is often worse than what they already had. 


The experience that I've had in the Blue Mountains part of my electorate is set to be repeated in the Hawkesbury, where, in densely populated suburbs full of small, medium and large businesses, like in McGraths Hill, people will have to make do with fibre to the node, long stretches of copper. Places where the internet could help bridge the divide in accessing mental health services, employment and education—places like Wilberforce and Freemans Reach—will have to make do with FTTN. In fact, there is a one-kilometre stretch in Wilberforce where at one end they're getting fixed wireless, about halfway along they're getting fibre to the node and a few hundred metres down the road they're getting fibre to the curb. How inequitable is that? This is total digital inequality. 


It's hard to know where to start when talking about the experience faced by the communities of the upper Blue Mountains with their rollout of FTTN. Let me share a few cases. There are an endless number of them. Terry lives in Leura in the Blue Mountains. Leura went fibre-to-the-node live in August 2016. Terry's been unable to connect ever since. The NBN has identified that there are a number of premises within the FTTN footprint that are unable to receive a connection. Surprise, surprise. They say: 'We're currently investigating options to deliver an NBN solution for these premises. Although we're committed to delivering a fast broadband service as soon as possible, we can't provide a time frame at this stage.' But what we do know is that Leura is going to have its landlines switched off in February 2018. There are no guarantees that these people will even be connected by then. 


Nick lives in Lawson. Lawson went live with fibre to the node in August 2016 and Nick switched over. In February this year, Nick's speeds dropped and he logged a fault with his service provider. In September—I think that's about seven months later—NBN was saying it was an issue with the service provider, and the service provider was saying it was an NBN issue. This is something we have all heard multiple times. Nick was persistent; he kept at it. NBN has finally determined that it was a problem with the copper in the street after all—who'd have thought it?—and they have brought about the repairs. Finally, Nick's NBN service is working properly again. 


Tim lives in Wentworth Falls. This story will be familiar. Despite a node being only 75 metres from his property, he can't connect, because according to NBN the lines that Telstra has handed over to them are not necessarily direct. So it's not in a straight line. His property cannot be connected to NBN as NBN has identified a high loss of signal on this specific line due to—guess what?—the length of copper. In short, the government have completely blown a chance to make a real difference to the lives of Australians, and they'll go down as the people who took us back to the Dark Ages.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:59):  One of the great historical obligations, burdens or duties of every coalition government that comes to office is to clean up the complete mess they have been left with by the previous Labor government. Where would you like to start? How about the issue of border protection? Look at Labor's border protection mess that this coalition government has to clean up. Hundreds of children locked up in detention camps by the Labor government were let out by the coalition government. There is the issue of trade. We saw the mess Labor created, the delays of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, fixed up and repaired by the coalition. Defence is another policy area of complete and utter disaster from the Labor Party. Again, the coalition government comes in and fixes up the mess. And energy costs. What a mess the Labor Party left us. Under their governance, there was a 100 per cent increase in electricity prices. In six years under the Labor Party we saw a 100 per cent increase in electricity prices. 


It is exactly the same with the NBN: another complete Labor mess that the coalition has to come in and fix up. And what do Labor contribute? They put their hands up and go, 'You haven't fixed up our mess quickly enough.' They have created all this mess in every portfolio you can imagine, and their complaint is, 'You haven't fixed up our mess quickly enough.' Let's look at some of the mess they left us with the NBN. We know that in 2013 there were only 51,000 premises connected—that is, one in 50 across the nation. So far, we've got that down to one in two. Then we saw the hopeless budget and time overruns. And who can remember Labor's NBN promotion they did on the internet? They invited consumers or householders to go on the internet and have a look at a map of where the NBN rollout was. This map had colours that would fade away—so when you clicked on the map to try and focus on your street, to see when you would be connected, the map that Labor put up would fade out. Residents had no idea whatsoever. 


We knew that people would be waiting another six to eight years if we did not fix the mess the Labor Party left us. That is what households in Australia would be waiting for if the coalition did not clean up that Labor mess. And it would have cost another $30 billion. The changes the coalition have been forced to make to clean up this mess that Labor left us on the NBN have saved the Australian nation $30 billion and six to eight years. This is what we inherited in policy area after policy area after policy area, and the only contribution we can get from the Labor Party is, 'You didn't fix our mess up quickly enough.' 


I would like to take this opportunity to give a quick update on my electorate of Hughes—down in the beautiful south of Sydney—to show how we're progressing with the NBN rollout. So far, 44 per cent of the electorate is connected or has passed, and we have 32 per cent of premises that have taken up the NBN. Close to one-third of households in my electorate already have the NBN working in their premises. We have another 48 per cent under construction and ready to go, to be rolled out. My electorate will be complete by the middle to end of next year. There are some suburbs which have waited a long time for the NBN. We know Grays Point will be 1 May 2018. We know Hammondville, Pleasure Point, Sandy Point and Voyager Point are areas that have had difficulty with telecommunications for many years, and the NBN will be rolled out on 1 June 2018. Kirrawee, Chipping Norton and Moorebank will also be rolled out on 1 June 2018. Bundeena and Maianbar, down at the national park, are also areas that have waited a long time for improvements in their communications. We'll have that done next year. (Time expired)

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (16:05):  I am very happy for the member for Hughes in the luck he has had with his community getting the NBN halfway through next year, whereas my community has to wait at least until the end of 2019. It's lucky for some, I suppose!


The Prime Minister has made many bold statements about the coalition's NBN, including that it's one of the greatest corporate turnarounds in Australia's history, it will be delivered for $29.5 billion and everyone will have access to it by the end of 2016. Of course, that's not the case. Unfortunately, unlike his colleague the member for Mallee, he has not been bold enough to acknowledge the truth, which is that the NBN rollout has become ridiculous. Like so many of us, the Nationals member for Mallee has to have one of his electoral office staff working nearly full-time to talk with constituents and help them deal with the implementation of the NBN to their homes and their businesses. The member for Mallee, on this point, is right: the rollout of the NBN is ridiculous. It's ridiculous because at the end of 2016 more than seven million premises were still waiting for access to the NBN. It's ridiculous because this multi-technology NBN mess has suffered a budget blowout of $20 billion. Instead of the $29.5 billion delivery cost, it's costing nearly $50 billion. And some of that is paying for 15 million metres of copper! I can hardly believe the things I hear. It's ridiculous because the reality of his corporate turnaround claim is soaring complaints from customers left languishing and constituents still waiting to be connected.


The Prime Minister scrapped Labor's world-class fibre-to-the-premises NBN. It was an innovative infrastructure project and it was a challenging project. It would have delivered the optical fibre technology needed to provide our businesses, our students—all of us—with the tools necessary to compete in the 21st century global economy. Instead, he has left people with a second-rate NBN—it's third- or fourth-rate if I'm honest—that is slower and more expensive, and that's for those who are lucky enough to have access to it.


Only last month I held a meeting in Baldivis with my colleague the member for Greenway, the shadow minister for communications. At this meeting we heard from a roomful of local residents about how their lives are being affected by substandard or non-existent internet access. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the local community needed no prompting to let us know the problems they're having with this abysmal NBN. The Prime Minister should acknowledge how frustrated people are in not being able to work, study or communicate effectively thanks to his inferior version of the National Broadband Network. The stories we heard brought home the impact that living in a communications black hole is having on people's lives. We heard how FIFO parents are not able to keep in touch with their children when they are working far away on-site. We heard how people have to drive to fast-food restaurants to get access to internet so they can check their emails and so their children can go online and do their assignments for school. We heard how people who, in a world with internet connectivity, should be able to log in, work from home and check their emails on a weekend instead have to get in their car and drive 45 minutes to the office. It's a disgrace in 2017 in a community only half an hour to 45 minutes from the Perth CBD.


Not only this but many people in this community of Baldivis—and in Port Kennedy and at some places in Safety Bay—have no mobile phone coverage. They have to leave their home to make phone calls. It's a disgrace! Many people cannot connect to ADSL, as there are not enough ports available. And, thanks to the delay in the NBN rollout—as I said earlier, to the end of 2019—




Mr Littleproud:
  What about the Mobile Black Spot Program?




Ms MADELEINE KING:
  We don't get the Mobile Black Spot Program, thanks very much! And we've never had money in Brand. Luckily for you Nationals, you get your pork-barrelling money—



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Ms MADELEINE KING:
  You do, don't you. You can just be quiet and take your money while my community has no mobile coverage—so good on you!


No new ports are available. These people don't have the internet, they don't have ADSL, they don't have the NBN and they don't have mobile phone coverage. It's a disgrace! I'm really glad one of the Nationals can joke about this!



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Ms MADELEINE KING:
  It sounds like you are. In my community this is an important matter. People are disappointed. They are angry. We don't have to stoke their anger at this government and its substandard NBN. The member for Greenway will back me up on this: we just have to listen to them. The Prime Minister should come and visit us. I don't know the last time a Liberal Prime Minister walked down to Rockingham. I have never seen one and never heard of one. I barely see a Liberal there. I don't know who is running against me next time, but they won't have much luck. Anyway, come and have a chat and try to fix your NBN.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa) (16:10):  The theatrics that we see here today are a pathetic attempt to conceal the pathetic plan that we were left when we took government—Labor's plan to create a so-called NBN. It was a never-never scheme for Australians. It was one of those grandiose plans that Kevin Rudd decided to come up with that had no substance—made up on the back of an envelope. The reality is we are delivering. We are delivering the tools of the 21st century for every community, particularly my community of Maranoa.


In the electorate  of Maranoa, which takes up 45 per cent of Queensland, we are delivering telecommunications through a coordinated and sensible approach. In fact, it is this government that has, for the first time in this nation's history, appointed a regional telecommunications minister. When we talk about inequality, we are making sure that we deliver real outcomes for people in rural and regional Australia. Sixty-one per cent of the NBN has been rolled out across my electorate of Maranoa already, not only through fibre-to-the-node but through fixed wireless and through the Sky Muster satellite. 


We are delivering to households and are making sure, for the first time in this nation's history, that we have designated data plans for children who are receiving distance education. It is abhorrent to think that, until this government came into power, we were letting young children in outback stations go without the tools they needed to get a proper education. We have delivered that because we know what it is to deliver on inequality. We know what it is to make sure, no matter what your postcode is, that you get a proper education, and we are delivering on that. Couple that with the announcement by Minister Nash, only in the last month, that we are going to double the data for those people on Sky Muster. This is also about allowing them to trade and take advantage of those trade agreements that we have put in place as a government. This is something we should be very proud of. When you talk about wanting to go and find Ma and Pa Kettle from every community, let me tell you that nearly 14,000 households have been put onto the NBN in Maranoa. We have had 35 inquiries over the last 12 months. That is 0.2 per cent in terms of the complaints we've had about the NBN. This is a nation-building project. I grant you, there will be some complaints. But when you look at that percentage you can see that this is nothing more than a Labor fallacy, hiding behind the fact that they failed to plan properly. We are delivering for the people of rural and regional Australia.  


We are coupling that with a mobile phone black spot program. For the first time in this nation's history, we, as the Australian government, have put our hands in the pockets of government and gone out and invested in telecommunications, particularly in rural and regional Australia, where the commercial tension is not there for telcos to go and build on their own. The reality is we have put over 500 towers in, and we continue to roll these towers out throughout rural and regional Australia, in particular, because those are the tools of the 21st century that we need. We need to have mobility in what we are doing in our day-to-day practices, because we are the economic engine room of this nation. The electorate of Maranoa contributes more to the GDP per capita than Townsville, Toowoomba or the Gold Coast. That's without taking into account the significant energy that's being created in the electorate of Maranoa through the three coal-fired power stations. 


It is quite interesting, on a day of such momentous occasion when we are tackling energy prices, that the matter of public importance is something on the NBN. It goes to show that Labor is bereft of ideas and policies. They play behind theatrics and lie to the Australian people. The reality is we are delivering. We are delivering now on energy policies and also on telecommunications, to make sure that we have the tools that we need to take advantage of the trade agreements that we've made. It is something this government does quite proudly, because a government's responsibility is to put an environment and infrastructure around its people. We have done that. We have done that with the trade agreements and also with the small business tax cuts—that is the environment. But the infrastructure is the connectivity that we are undertaking. We are making sure that we are rolling the NBN out, and on time—not six to eight years later, as this mob on the other side would have achieved. The reality is that this is real delivery. We are making sure that we empower the Australian economy and the Australian people to be their very best.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:15):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: report 11 of 2017.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr GOODENOUGH:
  by leave—The role of the committee is to examine recent bills and legislative instruments for compatibility with Australia's human rights obligations. In doing so, the committee aims to enhance understanding of and respect for human rights in Australia and ensure that human rights issues are appropriately considered in legislative and policy development.


I note that a number of the bills examined in this report are scheduled for debate this week, including bills in relation to anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing; crimes legislation on sexual crimes against children and community protection; customs antidumping; social services and welfare reform; and Treasury amendments including housing tax integrity, foreign acquisitions and vacancy fees, and an Australian financial complaints authority. A number of the bills scheduled for debate were assessed from the outset as not raising human rights concerns and others have been examined in more detail to assess compatibility.


More generally, in the current report, the majority of new bills considered—20 in total—were assessed as either promoting human rights, permissibly limiting human rights or not engaging human rights. The committee is also seeking further information in relation to four bills and has provided a further four 'advice only' comments to legislation proponents. This report also contains the committee's concluded examination of nine bills and instruments. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, the committee has concluded that three of these bills and instruments are likely to be compatible with international human rights law.


This process of liaising with the legislation proponent to identify relevant information is an example of the benefit of the inclusive human rights scrutiny dialogue model. I encourage all legislation proponents when drafting statements of compatibility to draw upon any previous dialogue to ensure that the information that accompanies proposed legislation is comprehensive. Statements of compatibility accompany each piece of legislation that is tabled in parliament and contain the relevant minister's consideration of any human rights issues that may arise. These statements are critical to the work of the committee in its scrutiny task.


Finally, I note that the committee's work is one mechanism to encourage ongoing consideration of human rights in the development and passage of legislation. As announced today, Australia has been appointed to the UN Human Rights Council and will take its seat from January 2018. I'm sure that this will be another important space for Australia to engage with human rights issues at a global level. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation.


With these comments, I commend the committee's Report 11 of 2017 to the House.

Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (16:19):  I rise to speak on this package of industrial chemicals legislation. I'll keep my remarks brief, but I was moved to participate in this debate as some elements of the bills which relate to animal welfare are quite significant and, I believe, warrant acknowledgement.


As previous speakers have touched on, including the member for Makin, the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 and related bills establish the legislative framework for the Australia Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, which will replace the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. The latter scheme, NICNAS, is currently responsible for regulating the introduction of industrial chemicals in Australia, whether by importation or manufacture. Under the new scheme, a risk based approach to the regulation of industrial chemicals will be implemented. Significantly, this means that there will be less emphasis on pre-introduction assessment of lower-risk new chemicals and a greater focus on post-introduction evaluation and monitoring. Whilst the government is telling us that this approach will enable the regulator to focus on higher-risk chemicals and that it will encourage businesses to use lower-risk chemicals, I think greater assurance is needed as to whether the right balance has, in fact, been struck.


These reforms are extremely complex, and much of the technical detail will be enacted through regulations yet to be drafted. But there are a number of concerns as to whether the reduction in cost to businesses has been prioritised over health and environmental outcomes. The process that has brought this bill to the House for consideration is also extremely concerning, from our perspective, given that the bills were introduced whilst consultation was still ongoing. Even stakeholders from industry, who are broadly supportive of the bill, accept that further consultation will be needed, and many have highlighted technical concerns which still need to be resolved.


As we've heard from the previous speakers in the debate, the bills were referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The Senate inquiry process was going to be rushed as well, with the closing date for submissions being a mere seven days after the opening date. Given the complex nature of these bills, this narrow time frame for consultation was manifestly inadequate, and I'm pleased that the Labor senators were successful in their push for extensions of time for submissions and to for enough time to be allowed for a public hearing to be held. During those public hearings, a wide range of stakeholders, including unions and health and environmental groups, all flagged significant concerns. These related mostly to the focus on the reforms on the reduction of red tape and the failure to convince them that, in pursuing this reduction in red tape, health and environmental outcomes would not be compromised.


One area of particular concern to my constituency in the electorate of Wills has been the apparent loopholes in this proposed legislation identified by a number of animal-welfare groups, which is, to be direct, well below the standards set by the Ethical Cosmetics Bill 2016, which Labor introduced over a year ago. The animal-welfare sector raised these concerns—specifically, that the ban on the use of animal-test data for cosmetics has been drafted to be very narrow. In its current form, it seemingly contains a loophole which would allow animal-test data to be used where industrial chemicals are introduced for multiple end use. I'm pleased to note that Labor intends to introduce several amendments to tackle significant stakeholder concerns and improve these bills, in particular in relation to the animal-welfare concerns that have been raised. Labor's amendments will ensure that the cosmetics animal-testing ban applies to all introductions for cosmetic use, thereby closing the loopholes that I've referred to.


There are a number of further amendments we propose to move. They include requiring an annual post-introduction report with the name, volume and date of introduction of the industrial chemical for chemicals introduced via the exempted introduction category. Labor notes assurances given by the minister that the government will continue the work of the regulator to evaluate unassessed chemicals on the register and to ensure that the regulator tracks and reports on the status of actions taken by risk managers in response to recommendations from the regulator. We believe that our package of amendments will not be onerous on industry but will actually provide a more balanced approach with better health, environment and animal-welfare protections.


It is important to highlight that the government has dropped the ball in prosecuting the case for these reforms. While this type of legislation can be complex and often quite exhausting to examine, it is of the utmost importance that the legislation is passed in an acceptable form, given that the consequences of failure in the chemical regulatory system can be extremely severe.


I commend to the House the amendments moved by the member for Makin, which recognise the concerns relating to cosmetic testing on animals and go some long way to reshaping this legislation with due consideration to the concerns raised by all of the stakeholders.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (16:25):  It is my pleasure to speak on this bill. I will, however, be quite brief on this. It is important that we take notice of the bill that is before the House and discuss it in detail and give it the respect and consideration that it is due before this chamber. The bill that is currently before the House is the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. The minister, in introducing the bill to the House, went through in great detail the key parts of the bill. So there are probably only a couple of points that I would like to add today. I will quote from the second reading speech, because it's important:


Industrial chemicals play an essential role in everyday life—they are in paints and petrol, and are used in the production of a wide range of consumer goods and products such as cosmetics, dyes, cleaners and plastics. They are also an integral part of Australian industry and are extensively used in mining, manufacturing, and the building and construction industry. But they can also present risks to human health, worker safety and the environment that require management through fit-for-purpose regulation. 


I would like to associate myself with the minister's second reading speech for this bill, and I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:27):  I am privileged in that many schools in my electorate of Mackellar choose to send their students to visit Parliament House. It is a real pleasure to meet these young kids—our future leaders of Australia—show them around Parliament House, and talk about what it is like to be a member in this place. Importantly, it gives me an opportunity to find out what matters to them and what would make a difference to their lives. I get the usual replies: they would like to see more skate parks, and they would certainly like to see less homework. I'm sure that is nothing new to other members in this place. But I'm asked one question particularly often, and that is around the testing of animals when creating cosmetic products. 


The reality is that Australians haven't been testing their cosmetics on animals for a very long time. What we have done in the past is used information from animal tests done overseas when evaluating whether a specific product or ingredient is safe for us to use. The average Australian uses at least seven cosmetic products a day. That is a lot of products and ingredients to manufacture, test and bring to market. Indeed, some of my colleagues don't look this way naturally; it's the cosmetics they use every morning that help them look as good as they do now.  


Even Australian-made products often use chemicals imported from different parts of the world. So it is all well and good to say, 'We don't test on animals here' but, if we use the data from overseas tests to evaluate the products we allow to market, isn't that implicitly allowing tests in the first place? That is why we are here today. This government is finally putting the regulatory framework in place to make sure we stop using any data derived from animal tests when deciding whether these cosmetic products are fit for Australian use. At the same time, we are streamlining the approval processes so that Australian businesses that manufacture, import and sell cosmetics can spend more time growing their businesses than jumping through regulatory hoops.


We are making sure that Australian consumers get as much choice in the products they want while knowing that we have not allowed these products to be tested on animals in order to be on the shelves. Currently, chemicals in Australia are regulated under a number of schemes. If a chemical is not for a therapeutic, agricultural, veterinary or food use, it is considered an industrial chemical under the existing scheme. This will not change for the new scheme. When a business wishes to introduce a medium- to high-risk industrial chemical in Australia, it will need to provide information, including data, so that the regulator can make an assessment of the risks of that chemical and provide information to promote their safe use. This maximises protections for both Australian consumers and our environment.


Our commitment to banning cosmetic testing on animals was cemented in the 2017-18 budget. The Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 is the first step. We are creating the regulatory framework so that animal test data will no longer be used to support the introduction of chemicals used exclusively as cosmetic ingredients. We are replacing the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme with the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme and a new inventory. Six categories of introduction will be created, proportionate to the level of risk to human health and safety or the environment. Transparency will be increased, putting more choice in the hands of Australian consumers. Businesses can rest assured that the system by which the regulator evaluates any chemical is responsive, flexible and transparent. Data derived from an animal test from 1 July 2018 will be banned and disregarded when used by companies to support the introduction of a cosmetic ingredient.


We are also making sure that our framework aligns with the highest international standards. The marketplace for these ingredients is global, so harmonising the rules around them will help businesses and increase protection for consumers. It has the added benefit that the different regulators can exchange information and assessment—something that can be done only if the standards are of comparable quality.


As a Liberal, I am particularly supportive of the light-touch regulatory approach we are taking. Ham-fisted, one-size-fits-all regulations—those often favoured by my colleagues opposite—have a tendency to backfire when taken out of the Canberra bubble and applied to the real world. There is no need to apply the same regulatory burden on businesses using the lowest-risk chemicals as those choosing to use higher-risk ones. Introducers will be required to apply for assessment only for higher-risk chemicals. Overall, assessments are expected to reduce from three per cent to approximately 0.3 per cent of all new chemicals introduced. Ultimately, we are lessening annual reporting and making the introduction process much simpler and faster by providing same-day registration for introducers. This will reduce industry's annual regulatory burden by around $23 million. Companies introducing chemicals will now also be able to use relevant international risk assessments to a much greater extent, reducing double-ups and having an added benefit of adjusting our regulations to international standards—only, of course, if the risks are no higher than those we would accept here. All these changes, particularly this new stepped approach to the regulatory burdens, will encourage businesses to veer towards lower-risk chemicals. They will encourage products to be reinvented and improved—once again, more and better choices for Australian consumers.


When it comes to public and worker health and safety regulations, these reforms will continue to maintain Australia's high standards for protecting the community, workers and the environment. The executive director will be able to impose conditions on new, higher risk chemicals and refuse to allow a chemical to be introduced. He will also have more flexibility to rapidly respond to risks from new chemicals or chemicals already on the market. Modern enforcement tools will be available, and used, to ensure compliance and identify noncompliance.


I mentioned transparency a little earlier, and I come back to that. By linking the inventory listings to assessment statements, we are making more appropriate information than ever before available to Australian consumers so they can find out about the risks of any particular industrial chemical and make informed decisions. Of course, we must also protect our businesses' ability to compete in the market, so confidentiality will be protected by the use of partially masked names or use where appropriate. 


Under our legislation, committed to and introduced by the Turnbull government, no section of the inventory will be confidential any longer. Thanks to the work of the Assistant Minister for Health, the member for Lyne, Dr David Gillespie, there is overwhelming support for this legislation from both sides—from animal welfare groups and from the industry. We are leading the charge, enacting legislation that has taken the European Union 10 years to legislate. We will get it done in one year.


So what's the problem? As always there is the one outlier, one black swan, one group that wants to make the perfect the enemy of the good, supported by the Greens; they would rather we end up with nothing. No masked data here. And then there is the Labor Party, refusing to come to the table and ban what Australians overwhelmingly condemn as cruel practices—because why would they help us achieve anything? Once again, they are playing politics with public policy that would actually benefit Australians. Using their traditional fear tactics, these groups are trying to scare constituents into believing their ideological opposition has merit. They claim our bill has a massive loophole that cosmetic companies will mercilessly exploit—that the companies will test their chemical ingredients on animals by listing them as multiple-use chemicals; they will sneak animal testing data past the regulator and ignore our safeguards. 


This proposition is ridiculous. Cosmetic companies want to make money by selling things to people; therefore, they want to make things people will like. Why would they pursue a method of testing that is, firstly, more expensive; secondly, less appealing to the consumer; and, thirdly, more complex to achieve? In reality, the trend has been moving towards cruelty-free products for years. Most companies know their target market. They want to provide products that reflect the desire of Australian consumers to purchase cruelty-free cosmetics. People like to buy them.


The legislation specifically mentions chemicals solely for use in cosmetic products, because scientists agree that we need a safety mechanism to protect Australian consumers. It allows data provided from animal tests to be used solely as a last resort, to make sure chemicals that are used across multiple disciplines, like baby wipes or fragrances and detergents, are not harming us or our environment. These include, by the way, chemicals found in products such as paints, fabric dyes and household cleaners.


This added safeguard is all the more important when you think about the multitude of chemicals we can be exposed to each day. On any given day you could wash your hands, use a cologne or perfume, wash your face using a cleanser, and there you go: that's three chemical exposures racked up in a single day. If there is any data out there that proves any of the chemicals used in any of these products is unsafe for us to use, we would be harming our own people if we were to not take that into account. We are talking about preventing side effects ranging from skin irritations to more serious consequences of repeated exposure, like fertility and developmental issues and cancers—the list goes on and on. It doesn't mean we will allow any of that data to prove a chemical is safe to use, but, if it proves it is unsafe, how can we not protect consumers from harm?


How do people in this place not support this? How are the Greens so stuck in their own parallel universe of ideological superiority that they would rather we do nothing, disregarding what Australian consumers actually want, allowing this practice to continue implicitly, rather than supporting our package, with the added protection for consumers when it comes to multi-use chemicals? This is a good bill. It's a good reform. It's what the stakeholders, the industry and, most importantly, hardworking Australians want. Let's get it done, then I can go back to the schools in my electorate and tell them that politicians in Canberra don't just live in a bubble. They listen and they act.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (16:41):  Before I start, I thank the member for McPherson for jumping to her feet and filling the gap while we were waiting for the member for Mackellar to come in. The Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 is an important bill. It's a bill that fast-tracks industrial chemicals, and that has benefits. It assists some of those companies that are producing particular industrial chemicals to get their product onto the market quickly so that they can compete with overseas competitors. So it's a good thing. But we need to ensure that we fill some of the gaping holes that are in it. We heard the member for Makin say earlier that he will be moving some amendments and that there are some flaws in the bill, even though this side of the House will be supporting most of it.


The things that are lacking in this bill are, basically, the ability to create a register that tells us where the chemicals are being used, who is using the chemicals, how much of the chemicals are being used, and at what times over a period of time. Currently, companies must maintain records, so we are asking: why not just pass that record on for future governments, for future agencies, to be able to tackle any issues that perhaps arise in the future? Looking back in history, there are many products that were deemed to be very safe, but today we know of their long-term massive health effects on human beings. One of them that comes to mind, and I am sure everyone is aware of it, is asbestos. For many years we used this particular product in everything from buildings to paints—you name it—thinking it was safe. Then, years later, we discovered it was a very unsafe product and actually kills people. Another one is tobacco. For many years people thought it did no harm to your health—even though it is a different type of chemical to the ones we are talking about here—but we now know that it, too, kills people.


For us to get to the results and a final admission of danger to human life, it took many years. With asbestos, even today it can be in the body for years before tests show someone is affected. Therefore, we are saying there should be some form of register with an agency. There could be issues to do with ensuring that that register is used to track when issues do come up, when things go wrong in the future—and let's hope they don't—so that they can go back and know who has worked with that particular product, what sort of work has been done, where it has happened and what needs to be done.


A great example of this really important issue, something that resonates with many in the community, includes former firefighters and others in my electorate. My electorate has the airport in the middle of it, and firefighters use dangerous chemicals. For many years they were testing foams for emergency use at the airport. They were all told it was safe many years ago. They were told it was safe; they wore safety equipment. But now we know that it was very unsafe. These chemicals have seeped into the ground. They seep into the bloodstream of people working with them. I'm really glad that ABC's Four Corners recently raised this issue. They raised the issue of contamination around airports and RAAF bases all around Australia. Today we know that people who worked with those chemicals have had some adverse effects.


I first raised this matter in this place early last year, following a visit to my electorate office from some very concerned firefighters who had worked with chemicals at Adelaide Airport. We know it's not just limited to Adelaide Airport; there's Edinburgh in the northern suburbs of Adelaide; there are many RAAF bases around the country; and there are many airports around the country and in fact around the world that use this particular product. This particular constituent was a retired firefighter. He had 35 years of experience at Adelaide Airport as a firefighter and he was very concerned that when he was working there, in his younger days, this product was deemed to be safe, and then he found out later that it was not. Because it was in a confined area, they know where it was used, where the testing was done, where they did their emergency training and therefore where it has seeped into the ground, so they could contain it. 


Many constituents and firefighters are asking for a greater government commitment to develop and to implement a testing and monitoring regime for some of these people. They have raised it with me on many occasions. They've raised it with the government on many occasions and through the firefighters union that covers them. I hope one thing today that these speeches do is raise this issue which has affected many people that worked with this foam in airports around the country and in RAAF bases that did training for fighting fires. It's an ongoing issue of contamination for defence and aviation sites around Australia—and the impact it is having on people in defence and aviation sites. Even residents around these areas are now concerned. But, as I said, because this particular product was used in one area, we know where it was tested and we know where they used it for their emergency training. We know exactly where it is. You can imagine the concern if this particular product was used all over the place—and it was used in many other products—and we didn't know where it was. 


This legislation will create a register that's with a government agency. It will tell us where the chemicals have been used, what they've been used for and who has used them, for future reference. It has been said that that may be an onerous job for the industries and the companies that use these particular products, but they already must maintain a record of where they are using it, who is using it et cetera, so why not pass it on? It would be a very simple thing to do. We heard the member talk about ideology and things before. This is nothing to do with ideology. It is about common sense.


The particular substances that were used had great qualities in terms of doing the industrial work that was required. They had the ability to repel oil, grease and water and put out fires. They've been used in firefighting foams and chemicals and many other products around the world. In addition, these foams containing these chemicals have been deployed on fires at traffic and railway accidents, and even at building fires. It's not just those metropolitan areas; it is country and rural areas as well that have an issue with this particular product.


The foams have been used for nearly 50 years on defence and civilian facilities and in airports in Australia due to their effectiveness in extinguishing liquid fuel fires. Firefighters trained every day on airport facilities with these chemicals. Today we know that there have been some tests and that their blood has been tested. Some people have fairly high levels of this particular chemical in their systems. But unfortunately there are no regular checks. The levels may be safe today, but we don't know what the future holds for these people. There should be some form of regular testing for them so we can tell exactly how their health is going and how they are doing with this chemical that we know causes harm to humans. It also impacts our waterways, our groundwater and our oceans. It's not just firefighters and those who work with it; all of us are affected by these particular chemicals.


We heard the member for Mackellar talk about animal testing. There is a loophole in the legislation for a company that wishes to produce a product, if it's for cosmetic testing. We know that there are no animal products that should be used because we also know, as the member for Mackellar said, that companies really want to sell the product to consumers, who don't want to be turned off by hearing about animal testing, et cetera. But the loophole nevertheless exists, if a company wanted to circumvent this particular 'no animal testing' law. If it's for cosmetics, yes, there is no animal testing. But if you are producing a chemical or a product for industry, then you can use animal testing. It's no secret that on this side of the House we would stop animal testing altogether if we could. There is a loophole there and that has to be looked at as well so companies cannot circumvent the legislation that currently exists.


To put it in a nutshell, the bill establishes a legislative framework for the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, or the AICIS, and that will replace the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. It'll regulate the introduction, whether by importation or manufacture, of industrial chemicals. There's a cost recovery principle, which will be retained in the new scheme. The new scheme implements a risk-based approach to the regulation of industrial chemicals. Significantly, there will be less emphasis on the pre-introduction assessment of lower-risk new chemicals and a greater focus on the post-introduction evaluation and monitoring.


As I said at the beginning, I don't think we have a problem with the concept of the bill. It does assist companies to fast-track the industrial chemicals that they're producing. There are benefits for them, and it ensures that they're competing with overseas companies that are producing the same sorts of products. This is a good thing. But we just want to ensure that some of the small loopholes that are there are filled so that we don't go through what we've already been through over the years with a range of other products that we thought were safe. We had human beings who had been working with these particular products for years and it was being denied that there was anything wrong happening to them because of the product they worked with. We saw that with asbestos. We saw the massive court cases that took place, with people fighting and saying, 'No, it had nothing to do with your bad health today.' What we must do is maintain a good register so that, in years to come, if there are any issues with a worker who has worked with these products, we know where to find them and how to track them down so we can give them the assistance that may be required.


Many new products come on the market. They are deemed safe and they look good, but we don't know what the results will be for years. I mentioned two of them very quickly—asbestos and this foam, which has an effect in my own electorate and many electorates around the country that have airports. They are both products that people worked with, that they thought were safe and that did good things. But, in the end, we found out that, for all the good they did in putting out oil based fires and liquid based fires, they also did a lot of damage to the environment and massive damage to human beings. But because those were contained within the airports around the country, we know the people who worked there and we know the geographic land area where these chemicals were used. So we want to ensure that that takes place. We want to ensure that that loophole is closed to keep people safe when they're working with products.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:55):  I wanted to make a few brief remarks about this bill, the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. There will be a more lengthy contribution from the Greens, particularly Senator Rhiannon, when it reaches the other place. I want to make a couple of remarks about the issue of animal testing in cosmetics, which is dealt with in this bill. There have been a number of organisations—in particular, the cruelty-free campaign, Animals Australia and the Animals Justice Party but also many others—that have campaigned for some time, with the full support of the Greens, for a ban on cosmetics that have been tested on animals. There are great companies in Australia like the Lush brand and many others that are already cruelty free because they know people in Australia want to be assured their cosmetics haven't been tested on animals. Many, many people have done some very, very good work on that.


There have also been people in this place from across the political spectrum who have also wanted to see that change. On the government back benches some have spoken up, including in this debate, saying that that's a change we need to see. It's a change that the Greens have called for and pursued for quite some time. So, to the extent the government is taking a first step towards addressing that, that is welcome, but, as is often the case with many of the things that come from this government, it's not as good as it seems. It comes bundled up in something that has nothing to do with the issue of animal testing and, in fact, seeks other reforms that could potentially jeopardise those very good reforms. As has been said many times during the debate, there are loopholes in the government's proposal around animal testing. They are loopholes that do need to be fixed. That will be dealt with further when the matter comes to the Senate.


Also of concern is that, as I am briefed by the various people who have been campaigning for that, there is a deal of concern that the government has wrapped up a measure around animal testing in amongst something much, much broader that goes towards changing the way that industrial chemicals more broadly are regulated and in a way that has nothing to do with cosmetics and nothing to do with animal testing. But, under the guise of talking about animal testing, the government may well be attempting to get through a bunch of other changes that might actually mean that people are more at risk from harmful chemicals.


We've heard from some of the other members in this debate the kinds of risks that people currently face when it comes to industry. One of the ones I'm particularly familiar with is the risk that firefighters face. If there was a fire in this building at the moment, most of us would run one way—out—and the firefighters would run in. They run into rooms where things are burning and creating a huge amount of toxic smoke. In your average home, there are tens of thousands of chemicals that have been used to make the plastics that surround your TV set, that go into the couch, that are in the carpet or that are in the paint. When those chemicals burn, we now know that they, in many instances, produce cancer-causing smoke. If you're a firefighter, no matter how good your equipment is, you've got to be able to breathe, and breathing out to let the heat out of your body also means that air comes in.


As a result, even with the best equipment in the world, the best PPE—personal protective equipment—in comes toxic smoke into your system. Firefighters have told me that you could be scrubbing yourself for a couple of days after a big job and still be seeing black gunk coming out of your skin, out of your system. We now know that a lot of that is cancer causing. As a result, firefighters find themselves with much, much higher rates of cancer than their counterparts. Firefighters tend to start in the job being healthier than the average human specimen. After five years, they could find themselves having twice the risk of getting leukaemia, for example. That's the kind of risk we're asking them to face, because they go into environments where they're faced with chemicals. But we also know that they're exposed to industrial chemicals through their training. 


We're now seeing some of the consequences of the use of chemicals called PFOS and PFOA at Defence bases. We have also seen them being used in firefighting training areas for some time, most notoriously in Fiskville in Victoria, where a lot of the chemicals that were used, the PFOS and PFOA, as well as others, found their way not just into firefighting systems but into the water, and they have contaminated the ground. Every major airport around Australia has a firefighting base on it, as it should have. The aviation firefighters spend a lot of time training so that they can get to a plane should a tragedy ever befall it or if a plane catches on fire. They have to be able to get there quickly and know exactly what they're doing, so they spend a lot of their time training. Quite like the Defence bases and Fiskville, a lot of the training done at airports uses firefighting foams containing chemicals that were banned elsewhere in the world and that were only relatively recently banned in Australia. The firefighters do a lot of training, using a lot of foam. Those chemicals seep into the ground and then into the watertable. 


At the Gold Coast Airport, those chemicals are now finding their way into the water system. The Gold Coast Airport abuts a broadwater, just south of the border, and a creek. We know that the government intends to dig up part of that and extend part of the Gold Coast Airport. Worryingly, we are hearing that these industrial chemicals, which relate to the subject of this bill, are sitting in the soil, potentially having leached into the water. When you dig that up to extend the length of the runway, more of them are going to come out and find their way into the water system. As a result, they will potentially put at risk not only all the people who've worked there but everyone around the area who catches fish and eats it, plus the wildlife in the area and in the waterway itself. 


So we've got a very, very long way to go with industrial chemicals in this country. If the government were serious about health and welfare on that front, we'd be using this bill as an opportunity to rein in what is going to be a level of scandal that's going to require a royal commission to deal with Defence sites and airports, and other training grounds, where we've used chemicals that have put people's lives at risk and that are continuing to put people's lives and the environment at risk. Sadly, that nettle isn't being grasped, despite all the warnings, but it is something that is going to come back and rightly bite this place and the governments that have made decisions in the past to allow the significant use of those chemicals. 


To come back to the question of cosmetic testing on animals, which is covered in this bill, I want to applaud the groups I mentioned before for their tireless campaigns, resulting in some partial step from the government towards addressing this issue. But we do need to fix it and we do need to ensure the government isn't trying to use that good move and the goodwill of the Australian people, who want to make sure that their cosmetics haven't been tested on animals, to try and get other legislation through. And we need to explore, when the matter goes to the Senate, whether there's a way of making sure we get good bits of legislation without letting through some of those other nasties that the government might be trying to get through and, if we get the good bits, that they actually do the job, by closing the loopholes, and that we don't just allow something to go through that ticks the box under the appearance of it having been done and we never come back to the issue again—and in fact then find that there are loopholes big enough to drive trucks through. That's the approach the Greens will be taking when this bill goes to the Senate.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Health) (17:05):  I'd like to thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 and the other five associated bills—the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 2017, the Industrial Chemicals (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017, the Industrial Chemicals Charges (General) Bill 2017, the Industrial Chemicals Charges (Excise) Bill 2017, and the Industrial Chemicals Charges (Customs) Bill 2017.


These six bills realise a longstanding acknowledgement, spanning several governments, that reform to the regulation of industrial chemicals was required. The bills create a new regulatory scheme in Australia, to be known as the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme. The reformed scheme was developed through many years of consultation with the stakeholders, and I thank them for their dedication and the time involved in this process. I'm confident that the new regulatory scheme strikes the right balance between benefitting the community as well as businesses.


This scheme will maintain Australia's high standard of human and environmental protection while seeing regulatory efforts made more proportionate to the risk. This means that the regulator will be able to focus its regulatory efforts on assessing the higher-risk chemicals where the greatest regulatory oversight is needed. By ensuring that this regulatory effort is proportionate to risk, we are removing unnecessary barriers to the introduction of very low risk chemicals in an effort to promote safer innovation. This should have the effect of encouraging these cleaner, greener chemicals while continuing to protect the Australian people and environment from any harmful effects from industrial chemicals.


The member for Makin has raised concerns around the use of the exempt category. These concerns are misplaced. The subjectivity he's objecting to is what exists now under the current NICNAS. Under the current regime, 97 per cent of chemicals are being introduced under an exemption category where the introducer determines that there is no unreasonable risk. The new scheme actually sets clearer, more objective criteria to ensure that the continuing protection of human health and the environment is paramount. The exempted category will contain only chemicals that are considered very low risk, including polymers of low concern, and chemicals introduced for the purposes of research and development, provided that their introduction meets the definition of R&D and some volumetric thresholds are met.


We have also heard calls for increased reporting for chemicals in the exempt category. It is not the reporting of these chemicals that will protect health and the environment but the new strengthened evaluation framework that we are introducing. This allows the regulator to respond quickly and initiate evaluations as soon as concerns about a chemical arise. This includes new, stronger powers to gather information. We're also strengthening the regulator's power to place conditions on certain chemicals, including new powers to refuse entry into the Australian market in certain circumstances and powers to remove chemicals that are already being used.


I should also emphasise that there are clear obligations on introducers to keep records of the information they have used to demonstrate their category of introduction, and the regulator will be able to audit these records and take appropriate and proportionate actions to ensure continued compliance by all introducers across all categories of introduction, including the lowest-risk categories. These strengthened monitoring and compliance powers, consistent with those used by other regulators, will ensure continued protections for the Australian people. This will ensure that workers, the public and the environment remain protected from any potential harmful effects of industrial chemicals.


Another concern that was raised was that the Industrial Chemicals Bill does not include any reference to continuing the Inventory Multi-tiered Assessment and Prioritisation framework, known as IMAP. IMAP was developed as a practical way to accelerate the review of over 30,000 unassessed chemicals that have been on a public list, known as the national inventory, since the NICNAS arrangements commenced in 1989. The excessively prescriptive evaluation process in the existing law had resulted in very few evaluations of these chemicals being completed. IMAP is widely considered to be an example of a very successful collaboration between government, industry and non-industry stakeholders, and has resulted in over 7,500 chemicals being assessed since 2012. I'd like to assure the Australian community that we will continue to prioritise these chemicals for systematic evaluation. So we are building on the success of IMAP with a new, more flexible and responsive framework in the Industrial Chemicals Bill that gives the regulator the flexibility needed to tailor an evaluation to address an issue or a chemical of concern. This framework will allow us to more effectively evaluate industrial chemicals in commerce in Australia and will lead to clear regulatory outcomes, which could include the removal of a chemical from use. This, I note, cannot be done through the current IMAP process or the current act. We will use this framework to continue to assess those unassessed chemicals on the national inventory.


The reforms also provide greater transparency for both industry and the public, with each assessment and evaluation undertaken by the regulator from 1 July 2018 being published on the regulator's website, providing all stakeholders with important risk and safety information. Every new listing on the inventory will be linked to its assessment statement, outlining any measures recommended to mitigate known risks. We will also track and report on the status of actions taken by the national and jurisdictional risk managers in relation to any risk management recommendations made by the regulator. This reporting will provide timely access to information, which will be of greater benefit to industry and the community. For business, the risk based approach to regulation will remove unnecessary regulatory burden and, along with improved IT systems, will provide the opportunity for industry to self-categorise lower risk chemicals against—and I state this—criteria that we, the regulator, establish. This will reduce costs for business and ultimately for consumers. It will also remove the barriers to introduction of cleaner and greener chemicals which would benefit the Australian community and environment. Higher risk chemicals will continue to be assessed by the regulator before they can enter commerce in Australia.


Many Australians have expressed concerns about the welfare of animals and have called for a ban, like that seen internationally, on the use of animals when establishing the safety of cosmetics. At the same time, there is an international trend away from using animal testing for chemical research, including for ethical reasons. Developments in technology are enabling a reduction in reliance on animal testing as, for example, computer modelling becomes more sophisticated and reliable. As a result, very few industrial chemical introductions rely on animal test data to support assessments of risks to human health and safety or the environment. For this reason, the scheme established by this bill is specifically designed to not rely on animal test data except as a very last resort, where it's absolutely necessary to protect human health and the environment.


I am pleased to say that these important pieces of legislation include the government's commitment to introduce a ban on the use of animal testing for cosmetics. As in Europe, the new scheme recognises that we must continue to protect Australian workers. Also as in Europe, the new scheme allows the limited use of data from animal tests for chemicals that have other industrial uses in addition to use in cosmetics. Since the bill was introduced, there have been some calls to extend the scope of the ban—to include chemicals with other industrial uses in addition to a cosmetic use. 


Amendments introduced by the opposition today promise to close some perceived loophole. But the amendments actually create loopholes. This is because they were written by people who have not sought to understand how the Australian regulatory system works. 


We have spoken to key animal justice organisations that are keen to be part of creating Australia's ban on the use of new animal test data to support the introduction of chemicals used as cosmetic ingredients. I thank all of them for working with us to get the best outcomes for animal welfare.


The proposal from the opposition is not consistent with the regulatory framework in Europe and would place Australian industry at a disadvantage. Animal test data that are permitted for use in Europe for assessing multi-use chemicals could not be used here, even if the data showed risks to worker health and safety. This is not a regulatory arrangement that the government could support. Those proposed amendments will not result in an improvement in animal welfare outcomes and would likely result in some chemicals being considered of lower risk than would otherwise have been determined, which places human and environmental health at risk. Members may be interested to know that we received written confirmation just today from the European Chemicals Agency that Australia's proposed ban is consistent with that of the European Union. 


Industrial chemicals form a multibillion dollar international market in which Australia is both an importer and an exporter. This new scheme provides alignment with the schemes of Australia's trading partners, and greater acceptance of assessments made by comparable international regulators. This will support Australian industry to become more competitive internationally, providing not only jobs, which everyone wants, but safe jobs for Australian workers. The new scheme is a proportionate approach to the regulation of industrial chemicals that will promote innovation in Australia and incentivise the introduction of safer chemicals into Australia.


The member for Makin referenced the huge number of jobs in Australia linked to the industrial chemicals sector. We have heard from key industry players that those jobs are at risk if Australia doesn't reduce the burden placed on the sector by our outdated regulation. This is apparent when we consider that other Western nations with markets far larger than Australia's are miles ahead of us in how they treat very low risk chemicals. The Australian community can be confident that Australia's high standard of protection of health and safety for people and the environment will be maintained in this new regulatory scheme. Thank you.

I appreciate the response the minister made to the House in the summing up of these bills. It is complicated legislation. I also thank the minister for the time he spent with me discussing many aspects of the bills. I don't accept all of the minister's explanations, and I made it clear in my address to the House why we still have some concerns. 


The first matter is the issue of both the IMAP process and the risk managers. I accept the letter that the minister sent to Catherine King, our shadow minister for health, and the commitments made by the minister and, through him, by the government in respect to the continuation of the IMAP process and how we will respond to the risk managers in terms of the assessments that were carried out and what actions resulted from them. We accept that and we thank the minister for his response. 


With respect to the exempted chemicals and the animal welfare data, we do still have some differences. Regardless of my personal view or those of any others who made submissions, the Parliamentary Library paper on this states:


Record keeping requirements in the new scheme do not require introducers of chemicals to inform AICIS of which chemicals they have introduced in the 'exempted introductions' category (the lowest risk category), only whether they have introduced chemicals in this category. This means that there will be no complete Government record of the industrial chemicals introduced into Australia.


I accept the minister's comments that this is currently not the case and that it wasn't in the previous scheme. We can learn from the previous scheme, which may not have been perfect. What we're saying is, as a result of having learnt from that scheme, let's make it better. 


Secondly, there will be many more chemicals under the new scheme that will go through the exempted pathway. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that the government ought to maintain a register of some kind that, at some stage, if necessary, it can refer to. It will also assist the director of the department, in the ordering of audits that he or she might feel appropriate, to know what is actually coming in. It's in the public interest—it's in the government's interest—to have that register maintained. I fail to understand—given the current reporting arrangements and the fact that all of the companies that will introduce the chemicals already have to maintain a register of those chemicals so that if they get audited they can produce those documents—why that same information cannot be provided to government. I suspect most people in the community would ask the same question. 


With respect to the animal welfare material, there is no reason we should put in place any particular system, whether it be the EU system or anyone else's, as the benchmark of what we should be aspiring to. I don't accept the minister's comments that this is the standard we should aspire to and that this legislation does that. What I say to the minister is that the policy now written into this legislation falls well short of the coalition's own election policy of 2016. Again, I quote the library paper:


During the 2016 election campaign, the Coalition announced that, on re-election, it would implement a:


… policy to ban the testing of finished cosmetic products on animals in Australia, the testing of cosmetic ingredients on animals in Australia and the sale of cosmetic products and ingredients that have been tested on animals outside of Australia.


I believe this legislation does have a loophole, and whether it will be used or not we can only speculate, but it does have a loophole. What we're simply saying on this side of the House is that that loophole ought to be closed and it can be. I want to requote the statistics with respect to the number of chemicals that were brought into Australia in 2014-15 in the brief time I have: 4,269 chemicals were introduced solely for cosmetic use, with only three of those using animal test data; and for multiple uses, there were 2,889, with only 11 using animal test data. This affects a miniscule amount of introducers; so, therefore, why not close the loophole rather than leaving it open? The justification from the minister is simply not persuasive. I believe that what we're asking for is not unreasonable and, can I say, there are a lot of animal welfare supporters who would support our position on this.

 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Health) (17:25):  I would like to thank the member for Makin for his comments. Just a brief word about the current system and the exempt category. Many of the opponents who have formed this opinion were of the mistaken understanding that this is creating an exempt category. As I mentioned in my speech, there is already an exempt category where 97 per cent of the chemicals that come into Australia are in the exempt category. What happens under the current scheme, though, which this new scheme is going to replace, is that it's very subjective. The introducers decide what is classed as exempted. We have changed that. There are very strict, objective criteria—not subjective and under the control of the introducer, as in, 'Trust us, we know this will be safe.' The regulator, or the executive director, sets exact criteria that they have to match. Many of these are very low volume substances that are in research and development, and some of them have very safe profiles because they are established chemicals that are known to be very safe and they are meeting the criteria that the new scheme sets.


The other comment that the member for Makin made is that we should make it better. Well, indeed, that is exactly the intention of this new objective set of criteria—to make the system better. Because no longer will they be able to just bring something in and say, 'Trust us.' In fact, if you look at some of the responses across the five community consultation papers, many of the industry people thought, 'You're making it harder for us.' As the member for Makin has told me in our six consultations—that's good, if you are getting pushback from industry. So, I am very confident that that exempt category will be a very tight category, and they will have to meet all those criteria. Then the second thing that's making it better is that the executive director has much more power to investigate, remove and assess immediately when there is any concern. Part of the system is currently very slow and laborious to get some intervention by NICNAS. For the regulatory and civil penalties, there are much stronger enforcement, investigation and assessment powers so that the community and the general public can be reassured that the regulation is tighter but it's proportionate to the risk. There's even a touch of paranoia in some of the comments that have been circulating in correspondence coming in and out of our office about the animal testing. 


That's the last thing I would like to make a comment on. This is a major improvement. Ninety-nine per cent of animal testing for cosmetics—going forward from 2018, if you are bringing in a chemical purely for cosmetics, it won't be allowed. However, in the 1 per cent of cases where it's really important to know that chemical which is used in multiple things—because not every product has one chemical in it, and most products have lots of chemicals, and it's very important for people who are exposed to chemicals. As I mentioned to the member for Makin, in my career as an industrial cleaner and a hospital cleaner I was exposed to hundreds of solvents and various industrial solutions that had very little product information.


The jurisdictions have a place in this as well. It is a very robust system that we have. In an attempt to get absolute philosophical purity, those opposite are going to miss out on achieving a 99 per cent improvement and better regulation to prevent unnecessary testing on animals. This is better than jurisdictions across the Tasman Sea. As I mentioned, we have confirmation that we're in keeping with what they do in the European Union. We are as good as any other jurisdiction. I commend the bill to the House.

"Khalil, Peter, MP",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (16:19):  I rise to speak on this package of industrial chemicals legislation. I'll keep my remarks brief, but I was moved to participate in this debate as some elements of the bills which relate to animal welfare are quite significant and, I believe, warrant acknowledgement.


As previous speakers have touched on, including the member for Makin, the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 and related bills establish the legislative framework for the Australia Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, which will replace the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. The latter scheme, NICNAS, is currently responsible for regulating the introduction of industrial chemicals in Australia, whether by importation or manufacture. Under the new scheme, a risk based approach to the regulation of industrial chemicals will be implemented. Significantly, this means that there will be less emphasis on pre-introduction assessment of lower-risk new chemicals and a greater focus on post-introduction evaluation and monitoring. Whilst the government is telling us that this approach will enable the regulator to focus on higher-risk chemicals and that it will encourage businesses to use lower-risk chemicals, I think greater assurance is needed as to whether the right balance has, in fact, been struck.


These reforms are extremely complex, and much of the technical detail will be enacted through regulations yet to be drafted. But there are a number of concerns as to whether the reduction in cost to businesses has been prioritised over health and environmental outcomes. The process that has brought this bill to the House for consideration is also extremely concerning, from our perspective, given that the bills were introduced whilst consultation was still ongoing. Even stakeholders from industry, who are broadly supportive of the bill, accept that further consultation will be needed, and many have highlighted technical concerns which still need to be resolved.


As we've heard from the previous speakers in the debate, the bills were referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The Senate inquiry process was going to be rushed as well, with the closing date for submissions being a mere seven days after the opening date. Given the complex nature of these bills, this narrow time frame for consultation was manifestly inadequate, and I'm pleased that the Labor senators were successful in their push for extensions of time for submissions and to for enough time to be allowed for a public hearing to be held. During those public hearings, a wide range of stakeholders, including unions and health and environmental groups, all flagged significant concerns. These related mostly to the focus on the reforms on the reduction of red tape and the failure to convince them that, in pursuing this reduction in red tape, health and environmental outcomes would not be compromised.


One area of particular concern to my constituency in the electorate of Wills has been the apparent loopholes in this proposed legislation identified by a number of animal-welfare groups, which is, to be direct, well below the standards set by the Ethical Cosmetics Bill 2016, which Labor introduced over a year ago. The animal-welfare sector raised these concerns—specifically, that the ban on the use of animal-test data for cosmetics has been drafted to be very narrow. In its current form, it seemingly contains a loophole which would allow animal-test data to be used where industrial chemicals are introduced for multiple end use. I'm pleased to note that Labor intends to introduce several amendments to tackle significant stakeholder concerns and improve these bills, in particular in relation to the animal-welfare concerns that have been raised. Labor's amendments will ensure that the cosmetics animal-testing ban applies to all introductions for cosmetic use, thereby closing the loopholes that I've referred to.


There are a number of further amendments we propose to move. They include requiring an annual post-introduction report with the name, volume and date of introduction of the industrial chemical for chemicals introduced via the exempted introduction category. Labor notes assurances given by the minister that the government will continue the work of the regulator to evaluate unassessed chemicals on the register and to ensure that the regulator tracks and reports on the status of actions taken by risk managers in response to recommendations from the regulator. We believe that our package of amendments will not be onerous on industry but will actually provide a more balanced approach with better health, environment and animal-welfare protections.


It is important to highlight that the government has dropped the ball in prosecuting the case for these reforms. While this type of legislation can be complex and often quite exhausting to examine, it is of the utmost importance that the legislation is passed in an acceptable form, given that the consequences of failure in the chemical regulatory system can be extremely severe.


I commend to the House the amendments moved by the member for Makin, which recognise the concerns relating to cosmetic testing on animals and go some long way to reshaping this legislation with due consideration to the concerns raised by all of the stakeholders.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (16:25):  It is my pleasure to speak on this bill. I will, however, be quite brief on this. It is important that we take notice of the bill that is before the House and discuss it in detail and give it the respect and consideration that it is due before this chamber. The bill that is currently before the House is the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. The minister, in introducing the bill to the House, went through in great detail the key parts of the bill. So there are probably only a couple of points that I would like to add today. I will quote from the second reading speech, because it's important:


Industrial chemicals play an essential role in everyday life—they are in paints and petrol, and are used in the production of a wide range of consumer goods and products such as cosmetics, dyes, cleaners and plastics. They are also an integral part of Australian industry and are extensively used in mining, manufacturing, and the building and construction industry. But they can also present risks to human health, worker safety and the environment that require management through fit-for-purpose regulation. 


I would like to associate myself with the minister's second reading speech for this bill, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2017-10-17,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:27):  I am privileged in that many schools in my electorate of Mackellar choose to send their students to visit Parliament House. It is a real pleasure to meet these young kids—our future leaders of Australia—show them around Parliament House, and talk about what it is like to be a member in this place. Importantly, it gives me an opportunity to find out what matters to them and what would make a difference to their lives. I get the usual replies: they would like to see more skate parks, and they would certainly like to see less homework. I'm sure that is nothing new to other members in this place. But I'm asked one question particularly often, and that is around the testing of animals when creating cosmetic products. 


The reality is that Australians haven't been testing their cosmetics on animals for a very long time. What we have done in the past is used information from animal tests done overseas when evaluating whether a specific product or ingredient is safe for us to use. The average Australian uses at least seven cosmetic products a day. That is a lot of products and ingredients to manufacture, test and bring to market. Indeed, some of my colleagues don't look this way naturally; it's the cosmetics they use every morning that help them look as good as they do now.  


Even Australian-made products often use chemicals imported from different parts of the world. So it is all well and good to say, 'We don't test on animals here' but, if we use the data from overseas tests to evaluate the products we allow to market, isn't that implicitly allowing tests in the first place? That is why we are here today. This government is finally putting the regulatory framework in place to make sure we stop using any data derived from animal tests when deciding whether these cosmetic products are fit for Australian use. At the same time, we are streamlining the approval processes so that Australian businesses that manufacture, import and sell cosmetics can spend more time growing their businesses than jumping through regulatory hoops.


We are making sure that Australian consumers get as much choice in the products they want while knowing that we have not allowed these products to be tested on animals in order to be on the shelves. Currently, chemicals in Australia are regulated under a number of schemes. If a chemical is not for a therapeutic, agricultural, veterinary or food use, it is considered an industrial chemical under the existing scheme. This will not change for the new scheme. When a business wishes to introduce a medium- to high-risk industrial chemical in Australia, it will need to provide information, including data, so that the regulator can make an assessment of the risks of that chemical and provide information to promote their safe use. This maximises protections for both Australian consumers and our environment.


Our commitment to banning cosmetic testing on animals was cemented in the 2017-18 budget. The Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 is the first step. We are creating the regulatory framework so that animal test data will no longer be used to support the introduction of chemicals used exclusively as cosmetic ingredients. We are replacing the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme with the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme and a new inventory. Six categories of introduction will be created, proportionate to the level of risk to human health and safety or the environment. Transparency will be increased, putting more choice in the hands of Australian consumers. Businesses can rest assured that the system by which the regulator evaluates any chemical is responsive, flexible and transparent. Data derived from an animal test from 1 July 2018 will be banned and disregarded when used by companies to support the introduction of a cosmetic ingredient.


We are also making sure that our framework aligns with the highest international standards. The marketplace for these ingredients is global, so harmonising the rules around them will help businesses and increase protection for consumers. It has the added benefit that the different regulators can exchange information and assessment—something that can be done only if the standards are of comparable quality.


As a Liberal, I am particularly supportive of the light-touch regulatory approach we are taking. Ham-fisted, one-size-fits-all regulations—those often favoured by my colleagues opposite—have a tendency to backfire when taken out of the Canberra bubble and applied to the real world. There is no need to apply the same regulatory burden on businesses using the lowest-risk chemicals as those choosing to use higher-risk ones. Introducers will be required to apply for assessment only for higher-risk chemicals. Overall, assessments are expected to reduce from three per cent to approximately 0.3 per cent of all new chemicals introduced. Ultimately, we are lessening annual reporting and making the introduction process much simpler and faster by providing same-day registration for introducers. This will reduce industry's annual regulatory burden by around $23 million. Companies introducing chemicals will now also be able to use relevant international risk assessments to a much greater extent, reducing double-ups and having an added benefit of adjusting our regulations to international standards—only, of course, if the risks are no higher than those we would accept here. All these changes, particularly this new stepped approach to the regulatory burdens, will encourage businesses to veer towards lower-risk chemicals. They will encourage products to be reinvented and improved—once again, more and better choices for Australian consumers.


When it comes to public and worker health and safety regulations, these reforms will continue to maintain Australia's high standards for protecting the community, workers and the environment. The executive director will be able to impose conditions on new, higher risk chemicals and refuse to allow a chemical to be introduced. He will also have more flexibility to rapidly respond to risks from new chemicals or chemicals already on the market. Modern enforcement tools will be available, and used, to ensure compliance and identify noncompliance.


I mentioned transparency a little earlier, and I come back to that. By linking the inventory listings to assessment statements, we are making more appropriate information than ever before available to Australian consumers so they can find out about the risks of any particular industrial chemical and make informed decisions. Of course, we must also protect our businesses' ability to compete in the market, so confidentiality will be protected by the use of partially masked names or use where appropriate. 


Under our legislation, committed to and introduced by the Turnbull government, no section of the inventory will be confidential any longer. Thanks to the work of the Assistant Minister for Health, the member for Lyne, Dr David Gillespie, there is overwhelming support for this legislation from both sides—from animal welfare groups and from the industry. We are leading the charge, enacting legislation that has taken the European Union 10 years to legislate. We will get it done in one year.


So what's the problem? As always there is the one outlier, one black swan, one group that wants to make the perfect the enemy of the good, supported by the Greens; they would rather we end up with nothing. No masked data here. And then there is the Labor Party, refusing to come to the table and ban what Australians overwhelmingly condemn as cruel practices—because why would they help us achieve anything? Once again, they are playing politics with public policy that would actually benefit Australians. Using their traditional fear tactics, these groups are trying to scare constituents into believing their ideological opposition has merit. They claim our bill has a massive loophole that cosmetic companies will mercilessly exploit—that the companies will test their chemical ingredients on animals by listing them as multiple-use chemicals; they will sneak animal testing data past the regulator and ignore our safeguards. 


This proposition is ridiculous. Cosmetic companies want to make money by selling things to people; therefore, they want to make things people will like. Why would they pursue a method of testing that is, firstly, more expensive; secondly, less appealing to the consumer; and, thirdly, more complex to achieve? In reality, the trend has been moving towards cruelty-free products for years. Most companies know their target market. They want to provide products that reflect the desire of Australian consumers to purchase cruelty-free cosmetics. People like to buy them.


The legislation specifically mentions chemicals solely for use in cosmetic products, because scientists agree that we need a safety mechanism to protect Australian consumers. It allows data provided from animal tests to be used solely as a last resort, to make sure chemicals that are used across multiple disciplines, like baby wipes or fragrances and detergents, are not harming us or our environment. These include, by the way, chemicals found in products such as paints, fabric dyes and household cleaners.


This added safeguard is all the more important when you think about the multitude of chemicals we can be exposed to each day. On any given day you could wash your hands, use a cologne or perfume, wash your face using a cleanser, and there you go: that's three chemical exposures racked up in a single day. If there is any data out there that proves any of the chemicals used in any of these products is unsafe for us to use, we would be harming our own people if we were to not take that into account. We are talking about preventing side effects ranging from skin irritations to more serious consequences of repeated exposure, like fertility and developmental issues and cancers—the list goes on and on. It doesn't mean we will allow any of that data to prove a chemical is safe to use, but, if it proves it is unsafe, how can we not protect consumers from harm?


How do people in this place not support this? How are the Greens so stuck in their own parallel universe of ideological superiority that they would rather we do nothing, disregarding what Australian consumers actually want, allowing this practice to continue implicitly, rather than supporting our package, with the added protection for consumers when it comes to multi-use chemicals? This is a good bill. It's a good reform. It's what the stakeholders, the industry and, most importantly, hardworking Australians want. Let's get it done, then I can go back to the schools in my electorate and tell them that politicians in Canberra don't just live in a bubble. They listen and they act.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (16:41):  Before I start, I thank the member for McPherson for jumping to her feet and filling the gap while we were waiting for the member for Mackellar to come in. The Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 is an important bill. It's a bill that fast-tracks industrial chemicals, and that has benefits. It assists some of those companies that are producing particular industrial chemicals to get their product onto the market quickly so that they can compete with overseas competitors. So it's a good thing. But we need to ensure that we fill some of the gaping holes that are in it. We heard the member for Makin say earlier that he will be moving some amendments and that there are some flaws in the bill, even though this side of the House will be supporting most of it.


The things that are lacking in this bill are, basically, the ability to create a register that tells us where the chemicals are being used, who is using the chemicals, how much of the chemicals are being used, and at what times over a period of time. Currently, companies must maintain records, so we are asking: why not just pass that record on for future governments, for future agencies, to be able to tackle any issues that perhaps arise in the future? Looking back in history, there are many products that were deemed to be very safe, but today we know of their long-term massive health effects on human beings. One of them that comes to mind, and I am sure everyone is aware of it, is asbestos. For many years we used this particular product in everything from buildings to paints—you name it—thinking it was safe. Then, years later, we discovered it was a very unsafe product and actually kills people. Another one is tobacco. For many years people thought it did no harm to your health—even though it is a different type of chemical to the ones we are talking about here—but we now know that it, too, kills people.


For us to get to the results and a final admission of danger to human life, it took many years. With asbestos, even today it can be in the body for years before tests show someone is affected. Therefore, we are saying there should be some form of register with an agency. There could be issues to do with ensuring that that register is used to track when issues do come up, when things go wrong in the future—and let's hope they don't—so that they can go back and know who has worked with that particular product, what sort of work has been done, where it has happened and what needs to be done.


A great example of this really important issue, something that resonates with many in the community, includes former firefighters and others in my electorate. My electorate has the airport in the middle of it, and firefighters use dangerous chemicals. For many years they were testing foams for emergency use at the airport. They were all told it was safe many years ago. They were told it was safe; they wore safety equipment. But now we know that it was very unsafe. These chemicals have seeped into the ground. They seep into the bloodstream of people working with them. I'm really glad that ABC's Four Corners recently raised this issue. They raised the issue of contamination around airports and RAAF bases all around Australia. Today we know that people who worked with those chemicals have had some adverse effects.


I first raised this matter in this place early last year, following a visit to my electorate office from some very concerned firefighters who had worked with chemicals at Adelaide Airport. We know it's not just limited to Adelaide Airport; there's Edinburgh in the northern suburbs of Adelaide; there are many RAAF bases around the country; and there are many airports around the country and in fact around the world that use this particular product. This particular constituent was a retired firefighter. He had 35 years of experience at Adelaide Airport as a firefighter and he was very concerned that when he was working there, in his younger days, this product was deemed to be safe, and then he found out later that it was not. Because it was in a confined area, they know where it was used, where the testing was done, where they did their emergency training and therefore where it has seeped into the ground, so they could contain it. 


Many constituents and firefighters are asking for a greater government commitment to develop and to implement a testing and monitoring regime for some of these people. They have raised it with me on many occasions. They've raised it with the government on many occasions and through the firefighters union that covers them. I hope one thing today that these speeches do is raise this issue which has affected many people that worked with this foam in airports around the country and in RAAF bases that did training for fighting fires. It's an ongoing issue of contamination for defence and aviation sites around Australia—and the impact it is having on people in defence and aviation sites. Even residents around these areas are now concerned. But, as I said, because this particular product was used in one area, we know where it was tested and we know where they used it for their emergency training. We know exactly where it is. You can imagine the concern if this particular product was used all over the place—and it was used in many other products—and we didn't know where it was. 


This legislation will create a register that's with a government agency. It will tell us where the chemicals have been used, what they've been used for and who has used them, for future reference. It has been said that that may be an onerous job for the industries and the companies that use these particular products, but they already must maintain a record of where they are using it, who is using it et cetera, so why not pass it on? It would be a very simple thing to do. We heard the member talk about ideology and things before. This is nothing to do with ideology. It is about common sense.


The particular substances that were used had great qualities in terms of doing the industrial work that was required. They had the ability to repel oil, grease and water and put out fires. They've been used in firefighting foams and chemicals and many other products around the world. In addition, these foams containing these chemicals have been deployed on fires at traffic and railway accidents, and even at building fires. It's not just those metropolitan areas; it is country and rural areas as well that have an issue with this particular product.


The foams have been used for nearly 50 years on defence and civilian facilities and in airports in Australia due to their effectiveness in extinguishing liquid fuel fires. Firefighters trained every day on airport facilities with these chemicals. Today we know that there have been some tests and that their blood has been tested. Some people have fairly high levels of this particular chemical in their systems. But unfortunately there are no regular checks. The levels may be safe today, but we don't know what the future holds for these people. There should be some form of regular testing for them so we can tell exactly how their health is going and how they are doing with this chemical that we know causes harm to humans. It also impacts our waterways, our groundwater and our oceans. It's not just firefighters and those who work with it; all of us are affected by these particular chemicals.


We heard the member for Mackellar talk about animal testing. There is a loophole in the legislation for a company that wishes to produce a product, if it's for cosmetic testing. We know that there are no animal products that should be used because we also know, as the member for Mackellar said, that companies really want to sell the product to consumers, who don't want to be turned off by hearing about animal testing, et cetera. But the loophole nevertheless exists, if a company wanted to circumvent this particular 'no animal testing' law. If it's for cosmetics, yes, there is no animal testing. But if you are producing a chemical or a product for industry, then you can use animal testing. It's no secret that on this side of the House we would stop animal testing altogether if we could. There is a loophole there and that has to be looked at as well so companies cannot circumvent the legislation that currently exists.


To put it in a nutshell, the bill establishes a legislative framework for the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, or the AICIS, and that will replace the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. It'll regulate the introduction, whether by importation or manufacture, of industrial chemicals. There's a cost recovery principle, which will be retained in the new scheme. The new scheme implements a risk-based approach to the regulation of industrial chemicals. Significantly, there will be less emphasis on the pre-introduction assessment of lower-risk new chemicals and a greater focus on the post-introduction evaluation and monitoring.


As I said at the beginning, I don't think we have a problem with the concept of the bill. It does assist companies to fast-track the industrial chemicals that they're producing. There are benefits for them, and it ensures that they're competing with overseas companies that are producing the same sorts of products. This is a good thing. But we just want to ensure that some of the small loopholes that are there are filled so that we don't go through what we've already been through over the years with a range of other products that we thought were safe. We had human beings who had been working with these particular products for years and it was being denied that there was anything wrong happening to them because of the product they worked with. We saw that with asbestos. We saw the massive court cases that took place, with people fighting and saying, 'No, it had nothing to do with your bad health today.' What we must do is maintain a good register so that, in years to come, if there are any issues with a worker who has worked with these products, we know where to find them and how to track them down so we can give them the assistance that may be required.


Many new products come on the market. They are deemed safe and they look good, but we don't know what the results will be for years. I mentioned two of them very quickly—asbestos and this foam, which has an effect in my own electorate and many electorates around the country that have airports. They are both products that people worked with, that they thought were safe and that did good things. But, in the end, we found out that, for all the good they did in putting out oil based fires and liquid based fires, they also did a lot of damage to the environment and massive damage to human beings. But because those were contained within the airports around the country, we know the people who worked there and we know the geographic land area where these chemicals were used. So we want to ensure that that takes place. We want to ensure that that loophole is closed to keep people safe when they're working with products.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2017-10-17,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:55):  I wanted to make a few brief remarks about this bill, the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. There will be a more lengthy contribution from the Greens, particularly Senator Rhiannon, when it reaches the other place. I want to make a couple of remarks about the issue of animal testing in cosmetics, which is dealt with in this bill. There have been a number of organisations—in particular, the cruelty-free campaign, Animals Australia and the Animals Justice Party but also many others—that have campaigned for some time, with the full support of the Greens, for a ban on cosmetics that have been tested on animals. There are great companies in Australia like the Lush brand and many others that are already cruelty free because they know people in Australia want to be assured their cosmetics haven't been tested on animals. Many, many people have done some very, very good work on that.


There have also been people in this place from across the political spectrum who have also wanted to see that change. On the government back benches some have spoken up, including in this debate, saying that that's a change we need to see. It's a change that the Greens have called for and pursued for quite some time. So, to the extent the government is taking a first step towards addressing that, that is welcome, but, as is often the case with many of the things that come from this government, it's not as good as it seems. It comes bundled up in something that has nothing to do with the issue of animal testing and, in fact, seeks other reforms that could potentially jeopardise those very good reforms. As has been said many times during the debate, there are loopholes in the government's proposal around animal testing. They are loopholes that do need to be fixed. That will be dealt with further when the matter comes to the Senate.


Also of concern is that, as I am briefed by the various people who have been campaigning for that, there is a deal of concern that the government has wrapped up a measure around animal testing in amongst something much, much broader that goes towards changing the way that industrial chemicals more broadly are regulated and in a way that has nothing to do with cosmetics and nothing to do with animal testing. But, under the guise of talking about animal testing, the government may well be attempting to get through a bunch of other changes that might actually mean that people are more at risk from harmful chemicals.


We've heard from some of the other members in this debate the kinds of risks that people currently face when it comes to industry. One of the ones I'm particularly familiar with is the risk that firefighters face. If there was a fire in this building at the moment, most of us would run one way—out—and the firefighters would run in. They run into rooms where things are burning and creating a huge amount of toxic smoke. In your average home, there are tens of thousands of chemicals that have been used to make the plastics that surround your TV set, that go into the couch, that are in the carpet or that are in the paint. When those chemicals burn, we now know that they, in many instances, produce cancer-causing smoke. If you're a firefighter, no matter how good your equipment is, you've got to be able to breathe, and breathing out to let the heat out of your body also means that air comes in.


As a result, even with the best equipment in the world, the best PPE—personal protective equipment—in comes toxic smoke into your system. Firefighters have told me that you could be scrubbing yourself for a couple of days after a big job and still be seeing black gunk coming out of your skin, out of your system. We now know that a lot of that is cancer causing. As a result, firefighters find themselves with much, much higher rates of cancer than their counterparts. Firefighters tend to start in the job being healthier than the average human specimen. After five years, they could find themselves having twice the risk of getting leukaemia, for example. That's the kind of risk we're asking them to face, because they go into environments where they're faced with chemicals. But we also know that they're exposed to industrial chemicals through their training. 


We're now seeing some of the consequences of the use of chemicals called PFOS and PFOA at Defence bases. We have also seen them being used in firefighting training areas for some time, most notoriously in Fiskville in Victoria, where a lot of the chemicals that were used, the PFOS and PFOA, as well as others, found their way not just into firefighting systems but into the water, and they have contaminated the ground. Every major airport around Australia has a firefighting base on it, as it should have. The aviation firefighters spend a lot of time training so that they can get to a plane should a tragedy ever befall it or if a plane catches on fire. They have to be able to get there quickly and know exactly what they're doing, so they spend a lot of their time training. Quite like the Defence bases and Fiskville, a lot of the training done at airports uses firefighting foams containing chemicals that were banned elsewhere in the world and that were only relatively recently banned in Australia. The firefighters do a lot of training, using a lot of foam. Those chemicals seep into the ground and then into the watertable. 


At the Gold Coast Airport, those chemicals are now finding their way into the water system. The Gold Coast Airport abuts a broadwater, just south of the border, and a creek. We know that the government intends to dig up part of that and extend part of the Gold Coast Airport. Worryingly, we are hearing that these industrial chemicals, which relate to the subject of this bill, are sitting in the soil, potentially having leached into the water. When you dig that up to extend the length of the runway, more of them are going to come out and find their way into the water system. As a result, they will potentially put at risk not only all the people who've worked there but everyone around the area who catches fish and eats it, plus the wildlife in the area and in the waterway itself. 


So we've got a very, very long way to go with industrial chemicals in this country. If the government were serious about health and welfare on that front, we'd be using this bill as an opportunity to rein in what is going to be a level of scandal that's going to require a royal commission to deal with Defence sites and airports, and other training grounds, where we've used chemicals that have put people's lives at risk and that are continuing to put people's lives and the environment at risk. Sadly, that nettle isn't being grasped, despite all the warnings, but it is something that is going to come back and rightly bite this place and the governments that have made decisions in the past to allow the significant use of those chemicals. 


To come back to the question of cosmetic testing on animals, which is covered in this bill, I want to applaud the groups I mentioned before for their tireless campaigns, resulting in some partial step from the government towards addressing this issue. But we do need to fix it and we do need to ensure the government isn't trying to use that good move and the goodwill of the Australian people, who want to make sure that their cosmetics haven't been tested on animals, to try and get other legislation through. And we need to explore, when the matter goes to the Senate, whether there's a way of making sure we get good bits of legislation without letting through some of those other nasties that the government might be trying to get through and, if we get the good bits, that they actually do the job, by closing the loopholes, and that we don't just allow something to go through that ticks the box under the appearance of it having been done and we never come back to the issue again—and in fact then find that there are loopholes big enough to drive trucks through. That's the approach the Greens will be taking when this bill goes to the Senate.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Health) (17:05):  I'd like to thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 and the other five associated bills—the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 2017, the Industrial Chemicals (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017, the Industrial Chemicals Charges (General) Bill 2017, the Industrial Chemicals Charges (Excise) Bill 2017, and the Industrial Chemicals Charges (Customs) Bill 2017.


These six bills realise a longstanding acknowledgement, spanning several governments, that reform to the regulation of industrial chemicals was required. The bills create a new regulatory scheme in Australia, to be known as the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme. The reformed scheme was developed through many years of consultation with the stakeholders, and I thank them for their dedication and the time involved in this process. I'm confident that the new regulatory scheme strikes the right balance between benefitting the community as well as businesses.


This scheme will maintain Australia's high standard of human and environmental protection while seeing regulatory efforts made more proportionate to the risk. This means that the regulator will be able to focus its regulatory efforts on assessing the higher-risk chemicals where the greatest regulatory oversight is needed. By ensuring that this regulatory effort is proportionate to risk, we are removing unnecessary barriers to the introduction of very low risk chemicals in an effort to promote safer innovation. This should have the effect of encouraging these cleaner, greener chemicals while continuing to protect the Australian people and environment from any harmful effects from industrial chemicals.


The member for Makin has raised concerns around the use of the exempt category. These concerns are misplaced. The subjectivity he's objecting to is what exists now under the current NICNAS. Under the current regime, 97 per cent of chemicals are being introduced under an exemption category where the introducer determines that there is no unreasonable risk. The new scheme actually sets clearer, more objective criteria to ensure that the continuing protection of human health and the environment is paramount. The exempted category will contain only chemicals that are considered very low risk, including polymers of low concern, and chemicals introduced for the purposes of research and development, provided that their introduction meets the definition of R&D and some volumetric thresholds are met.


We have also heard calls for increased reporting for chemicals in the exempt category. It is not the reporting of these chemicals that will protect health and the environment but the new strengthened evaluation framework that we are introducing. This allows the regulator to respond quickly and initiate evaluations as soon as concerns about a chemical arise. This includes new, stronger powers to gather information. We're also strengthening the regulator's power to place conditions on certain chemicals, including new powers to refuse entry into the Australian market in certain circumstances and powers to remove chemicals that are already being used.


I should also emphasise that there are clear obligations on introducers to keep records of the information they have used to demonstrate their category of introduction, and the regulator will be able to audit these records and take appropriate and proportionate actions to ensure continued compliance by all introducers across all categories of introduction, including the lowest-risk categories. These strengthened monitoring and compliance powers, consistent with those used by other regulators, will ensure continued protections for the Australian people. This will ensure that workers, the public and the environment remain protected from any potential harmful effects of industrial chemicals.


Another concern that was raised was that the Industrial Chemicals Bill does not include any reference to continuing the Inventory Multi-tiered Assessment and Prioritisation framework, known as IMAP. IMAP was developed as a practical way to accelerate the review of over 30,000 unassessed chemicals that have been on a public list, known as the national inventory, since the NICNAS arrangements commenced in 1989. The excessively prescriptive evaluation process in the existing law had resulted in very few evaluations of these chemicals being completed. IMAP is widely considered to be an example of a very successful collaboration between government, industry and non-industry stakeholders, and has resulted in over 7,500 chemicals being assessed since 2012. I'd like to assure the Australian community that we will continue to prioritise these chemicals for systematic evaluation. So we are building on the success of IMAP with a new, more flexible and responsive framework in the Industrial Chemicals Bill that gives the regulator the flexibility needed to tailor an evaluation to address an issue or a chemical of concern. This framework will allow us to more effectively evaluate industrial chemicals in commerce in Australia and will lead to clear regulatory outcomes, which could include the removal of a chemical from use. This, I note, cannot be done through the current IMAP process or the current act. We will use this framework to continue to assess those unassessed chemicals on the national inventory.


The reforms also provide greater transparency for both industry and the public, with each assessment and evaluation undertaken by the regulator from 1 July 2018 being published on the regulator's website, providing all stakeholders with important risk and safety information. Every new listing on the inventory will be linked to its assessment statement, outlining any measures recommended to mitigate known risks. We will also track and report on the status of actions taken by the national and jurisdictional risk managers in relation to any risk management recommendations made by the regulator. This reporting will provide timely access to information, which will be of greater benefit to industry and the community. For business, the risk based approach to regulation will remove unnecessary regulatory burden and, along with improved IT systems, will provide the opportunity for industry to self-categorise lower risk chemicals against—and I state this—criteria that we, the regulator, establish. This will reduce costs for business and ultimately for consumers. It will also remove the barriers to introduction of cleaner and greener chemicals which would benefit the Australian community and environment. Higher risk chemicals will continue to be assessed by the regulator before they can enter commerce in Australia.


Many Australians have expressed concerns about the welfare of animals and have called for a ban, like that seen internationally, on the use of animals when establishing the safety of cosmetics. At the same time, there is an international trend away from using animal testing for chemical research, including for ethical reasons. Developments in technology are enabling a reduction in reliance on animal testing as, for example, computer modelling becomes more sophisticated and reliable. As a result, very few industrial chemical introductions rely on animal test data to support assessments of risks to human health and safety or the environment. For this reason, the scheme established by this bill is specifically designed to not rely on animal test data except as a very last resort, where it's absolutely necessary to protect human health and the environment.


I am pleased to say that these important pieces of legislation include the government's commitment to introduce a ban on the use of animal testing for cosmetics. As in Europe, the new scheme recognises that we must continue to protect Australian workers. Also as in Europe, the new scheme allows the limited use of data from animal tests for chemicals that have other industrial uses in addition to use in cosmetics. Since the bill was introduced, there have been some calls to extend the scope of the ban—to include chemicals with other industrial uses in addition to a cosmetic use. 


Amendments introduced by the opposition today promise to close some perceived loophole. But the amendments actually create loopholes. This is because they were written by people who have not sought to understand how the Australian regulatory system works. 


We have spoken to key animal justice organisations that are keen to be part of creating Australia's ban on the use of new animal test data to support the introduction of chemicals used as cosmetic ingredients. I thank all of them for working with us to get the best outcomes for animal welfare.


The proposal from the opposition is not consistent with the regulatory framework in Europe and would place Australian industry at a disadvantage. Animal test data that are permitted for use in Europe for assessing multi-use chemicals could not be used here, even if the data showed risks to worker health and safety. This is not a regulatory arrangement that the government could support. Those proposed amendments will not result in an improvement in animal welfare outcomes and would likely result in some chemicals being considered of lower risk than would otherwise have been determined, which places human and environmental health at risk. Members may be interested to know that we received written confirmation just today from the European Chemicals Agency that Australia's proposed ban is consistent with that of the European Union. 


Industrial chemicals form a multibillion dollar international market in which Australia is both an importer and an exporter. This new scheme provides alignment with the schemes of Australia's trading partners, and greater acceptance of assessments made by comparable international regulators. This will support Australian industry to become more competitive internationally, providing not only jobs, which everyone wants, but safe jobs for Australian workers. The new scheme is a proportionate approach to the regulation of industrial chemicals that will promote innovation in Australia and incentivise the introduction of safer chemicals into Australia.


The member for Makin referenced the huge number of jobs in Australia linked to the industrial chemicals sector. We have heard from key industry players that those jobs are at risk if Australia doesn't reduce the burden placed on the sector by our outdated regulation. This is apparent when we consider that other Western nations with markets far larger than Australia's are miles ahead of us in how they treat very low risk chemicals. The Australian community can be confident that Australia's high standard of protection of health and safety for people and the environment will be maintained in this new regulatory scheme. Thank you.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (19:30):  In dealing with a foreign power like China, Australia needs to balance its commercial interests with its national security and democratic ethos. A recent report by the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States said:


In June 2017 the New York Times and The Economist featured stories on China's political influence in Australia. The New York Times headline asked ""Are Australia's Politics too Easy to Corrupt?,"" while The Economist … referred to China as the ""Meddle Country."" The two articles were reacting to an investigation by Fairfax Media and ABC into the extent of China's political interference in Australia, that built on internal enquiries into the same issue by ASIO and Australia's Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in 2015 and 2016. The media … concluded that Australia was the target of a foreign interference campaign by China ""on a larger scale than that being carried out by any other nation"" and that the Chinese Communist Party … was working to infiltrate Australian political and foreign affairs circles, as well to acquire influence over Australia's Chinese population.


According to a recent Herald Sun front page, donations amounting to $6 million over the last five years were made by the Beijing-influenced business front the APPRC. The head of the APPRC, Mr Huang Xiangmo, withdrew $400,000 from the opposition when Labor supported Australian naval patrols in the South Pacific.


Of course, we value Chinese Australians and investment from China, which is now our leading trading partner, but fears about prospective damage to Australian trade or investment by China must not deter us from clear-eyed opposition to Beijing's political intervention, such as its buying control of almost the entire local Chinese language press. The Foreign Investment Review Board reports that in the financial years 2010-11 to 2015-16 there was $169 billion of investment in Australia from China. Investment rose from $16.91 billion in financial year 2010-11 to $47 billion in financial year 2015-16. This is nothing to be alarmed about, but there are pitfalls to such investment.


In 2014 Australia's then Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull, proposed that the Chinese telco Huawei bid for the NBN. Australian agencies feared a Huawei-engineered technological back door to our secret communications. The proposal was dropped. Then a myopic Northern Territory government sold to Beijing interests a 100-year lease to the port of Darwin for a mere $500 million. After that 'own goal', former ASIO director-general David Irvine was appointed to the Foreign Investment Review Board. The FIRB then recommended against Beijing based investment in Ausgrid, Australia's largest electrical network, owned by the government of New South Wales. Striking the right balance, however, a state based interest in China won a 25 per cent interest in the successful bid of $9.7 billion for a 50-year lease of the Port of Melbourne. The $169 billion investment in Australia over the past five years is the big picture. It debunks the alarmism of comrades Drysdale and Denton in the Financial Review that 'opportunities will be squandered if Australian policy towards China is bungled'. Investors and traders from China are treated fairly and are not scapegoated. They are judged on commercial and national interests, the same as other investors.


Attempts to influence local academia are less easily countered. Even before Frances Adamson, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, put this issue on the front page, Professor Allan Fitzgerald, in an AFR essay 'Red pen on academic freedom', argued, 'Universities jeopardise intellectual integrity when they collaborate with Chinese institutions that do not share a commitment to liberal values or open inquiry.' It's a bit like Admiral Lord Nelson putting his blind eye to the telescope to claim that China is an upholder of international rules based order. Beijing flouts the international law peacefully sought by ASEAN to stop the militarisation of the South China Sea, where 60 per cent of Australian maritime trade transits.


Canberra's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will recommend, and I believe the parliament will endorse, the banning of foreign donations to parties. The Foreign Investment Review Board will continue to prevent imbroglios like the sale of the port of Darwin.


Finally, Beijing's interference in universities, think tanks, institutes and parties will be subject to media and parliamentary scrutiny. Nervous Nellies who advocate a hands-off policy for investments in China should be reassured that commercial arrangements will continue to prosper, but pro-Beijing academic and business interests should never override Australia's national security, firmly rooted in our ANZUS alliance and our deeply democratic ethos.

Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (16:02):  I rise to commemorate the life of Iraq's first elected president post the Saddam Hussein regime, Jalal Talabani, who passed away on 3 October. I want to express my deepest sympathies to the Talabani family, to the people of Iraq and to all the Kurds around the world. Jalal Talabani, commonly referred to as Mam Jalal, which translates as Uncle Jalal, was a larger than life political leader. He was the founder of one of the main Kurdish political parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the PUK.


For over 50 years he was a committed resistance fighter turned political leader who fought and advocated for democracy and the rights of his people. During the 1960s, Mam Jalal served as a Peshmerga, the name given to a Kurdish fighter, which translates as 'one who faces death'. Mam Jalal took charge of the Peshmerga battalions around Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk. In 1970, he married Hero Ibrahim Ahmed, herself a former guerilla fighter. He excelled on the battlefield as well as off it, with a sophisticated leadership style. He was fluent in Arabic, Persian, French and English as well as his native tongue of Kurdish. He joined the Kurdish Democratic Party, the KDP, at 14. But he broke with the KDP in 1975 while in exile and founded his own party, the PUK, to rival the KDP.


From the time of Saddam's accession to power in 1979 until the US-enforced no-fly zone in 1992, hundreds and thousands of Kurds in Iraq were killed by the Saddam regime. By 2003, the US had invaded Iraq, and Mam Jalal played a key role in fashioning Iraq's new interim constitution. He was President of Iraq from 2005 to 2014, including being re-elected in 2010. Critically, he stabilised post-Saddam Iraq and played a crucial role in fostering a more democratic and inclusive nation.


I had the great pleasure of meeting Mam Jalal when I was posted in Iraq in 2003-04 and negotiating and working with him on the Peshmerga's inclusion into the Iraqi defence and security forces and the new Iraqi Ministry of Defence. Mam Jalal was a genuinely warm and jovial person. We spent many days and nights at Sulaymaniyah under his protection and were fortunate to receive his generous hospitality. The feasts of delicious foods he prepared for us each time we met were very special and made those negotiations just a little bit easier. I think he was softening us up quite effectively. He was a very shrewd and gifted negotiator on behalf of his people. I also worked with his son, Qubad Talabani, the current Deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government, and he's carrying on the legacy of his father.


Mam Jalal was a giant figure of the 20th and 21st centuries, and his achievements for the Kurdish and Iraqi people will be long-lasting. He's no longer with us. His lifelong struggle to realise his dream of freedom for Kurds still shines brightly. As President of Iraq, he was a unifier. Whether Kurd or Arab Turkoman or Chaldean Assyrian, Sunni, Shia or Christian, he brought those people together. He will be missed and mourned by millions around the world for his passion, vision and achievement. For my part, I'll miss him and that twinkle in his eyes. We will miss this good man. May he rest in peace.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Deputy Nationals Whip) (16:32):  I rise to discuss the vital importance of international trade—particularly with our close ally Singapore—to Capricornia. Capricornia, in Central Queensland, holds a diverse and strong economy based on primary and mineral production. We are in many ways the backbone of Queensland's economy, providing billions of dollars in GDP and royalties each year, while generating the vast majority of the state's—and indeed the nation's—energy needs and growing high-quality food for customers the world over. Central Queensland is an absolute engine room, and we want to keep it that way.


While it is all very well and good to have a great product, it is equally important to be able to sell it. As a National within this coalition government, I am proud of what we are achieving in the sphere of trade. Liberalised trade has underpinned Australia's 26 years of continuous economic growth. Our free trade agreements are generating new opportunities for local businesses and creating jobs, something I am very passionate about. While Central Queensland is such an economic powerhouse, we are doing it tough at the moment. Since the end of the most recent mining construction boom, we've seen property prices fall, businesses go to the wall and many of the good, reliable jobs disappear. It is vital now, more than ever, that we continue to grow and develop our export markets so we can address this downturn in one industry with gains in another.


In 2015 the prime ministers of Australia and Singapore signed a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, CSP, to further integrate our economies, militaries, institutions and people. The CSP is broad-ranging in its scope and brings benefits to Australia across a range of sectors and throughout the country, including rural and regional Australia. Investment from Singapore has the potential to help unlock opportunities in Australia's north. Northern Australian communities like Rockhampton, Sarina and Clermont stand ready to be the beneficiaries of stronger trade, tourism and investment links with Singapore.


The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement is a massive economic asset in a broader national sense, particularly for Central Queenslanders. Central Queenslanders understand trade and realise just how important it is to have open trade with our Asian neighbours like Singapore. Singapore and Australia are such natural partners, sharing centuries of history together both as part of the British Empire and as two countries committed to free trade and open markets. Singapore is in many ways a doorway to Asia, a real key trade market through which so much of South-East Asian economies rely. In 2016, two-way trade between Australia and Singapore amounted to $23 billion. Singapore is our largest trading partner in ASEAN and the seventh largest overall. The free trade agreement with Singapore promises to boost competition for Australian exporters by addressing behind-the-border barriers, delivering new access and greater certainty to service suppliers.


Central Queenslanders, perhaps more than most Australians, are well aware of our close relationship with Singapore as we play host to thousands of Singaporean military personnel each year. Exercise Wallaby is on the Shoalwater Bay military training grounds in my electorate of Capricornia. As we speak, roughly 4,000 Singaporean troops, airmen and seamen are joining Australian troops for vital training, war games and live-firing operations. This exercise provides a welcome boost to the local economies of cities and towns like Rockhampton and Yeppoon, particularly for businesses in transport and logistics, accommodation, retail, dining and entertainment.


The Singaporean influence cannot be underestimated in our community and is undoubtedly another string to the bow of Central Queensland's economy. This benefit is set to become a real game changer for our region, as Singapore is set to dramatically increase its presence. Under the plan, Singapore will not only more than triple the number of personnel they send to Australia but also expand the time for which they will be here. Singapore is also investing $2 billion into improving the training, infrastructure and prioritising local businesses for the works at two training sites in Queensland, one of which is Shoalwater Bay. This will mean roughly a $1 billion investment in training infrastructure that will remain Australian, and will do what I am absolutely committed to—that is, creating jobs.


The amendments tabled for this free trade agreement are an important addition to what has been a monumentally beneficial agreement between two of the region's great nation's since its acceptance under the Howard government in 2003. Moving forward, a greater range of Australian businesses will be able to utilise SAFTA to better tap into the Singapore market. These amendments place an emphasis on our burgeoning services industries, a sector easily overlooked when it comes to international export but one with significant export appeal. New opportunities for education as an export exist through increased recognition of tertiary qualifications obtained at Australian universities in law, medicine and allied health—again, excellent news for Central Queenslanders studying through one of the country's finest education facilities and its largest external study university, CQ University. These changes will allow local universities to be far more competitive in the global market for education. I firmly believe education is one of the great opportunities for our economy as the growing middle class of South-East Asia looks for educational products to help deliver their children the edge in life they need to succeed in the modern world. The process will also make it easier for our great Australian universities like CQ University to set up campus in Singapore. Up until now, they've not been able to call themselves a university.


The opportunity for Australian companies to tender for valuable procurement contracts with the Singapore government is an exciting opportunity, particularly for the myriad of Central Queensland businesses with skills transferrable across the globe. This increased opportunity, teamed with a marked reduction in red tape, should see relationships, and therefore trade, between our two great countries continue to grow well into the future. Red-tape reduction will come in many forms, especially with regards to certifying origin. Exporters will be able to self-certify, rather than paying through the nose for a third-party certifier to tell them what they already know.


Another key aspect of the amendments deals with international business travel. An enormous number of Australians travel to Singapore for business for varying reasons—some for a day, some for a month and others end up making their lives there—and the same can be said for many Singaporeans in Australia. It is vitally important where we have such high numbers of expats from each country that we have guaranteed access for Australians to work and stay in Singapore, while keeping security and safety paramount. As far as Central Queensland is concerned, the stronger our ties with Singapore, the better. We see so much benefit from our already strong relationship that more can only be a good thing.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:41):  I rise to support the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017, which is part of a suite of measures designed to facilitate trade and investment between our nations. The proposed legislation will simplify administration and reduce compliance costs for traders operating under the agreement by introducing new product-specific rules of origin for goods that are imported into Australia from Singapore. This is simpler than the existing 50 per cent content rule that requires businesses to record all production costs. Goods which satisfy the new rules of origin in the amended agreement will be able to enter Australia at preferential rates of customs duty.


Procedures for claiming the preferential treatment will be modernised and traders will now be able to self-certify that their goods meet the rules of origin. These procedures will also provide exporters with flexibility to continue to have goods certified by third parties. The new rules will operate as an alternative framework for goods claimed to be the produce or manufacture of Singapore for a transitional period of three years, after which the framework for produce or manufacture of Singapore will be repealed, and only eligible goods that are determined in accordance with the new rules of origin will be subject to preferential rates of customs duty.


The amended agreement will enter into force after the governments of both Australia and Singapore have completed their respective domestic treaty approvals processes, having exchanged notes confirming the completion of their respective domestic procedures. At this time both countries are working cooperatively to facilitate the entry into force on 1 December 2017.


In 2016 Australian investment in Singapore reached $61.5 billion, while Singaporean investment in Australia amounted to $99 billion. In terms of services, Singapore is our third-largest trading partner, with international services amounting to $10 billion annually. Singapore is our 11th-largest trading partner in terms of merchandise trade, with combined imports and exports totalling $12.6 billion in 2016.


I attended the Australia Singapore Exchange Conference, which was held at Suntec City in Singapore between 28 September and 1 October. Delegates from Australia travelled to Singapore to network with representatives of the Singaporean business community, the objective being to strengthen the trade and investment relationship between our nations. The Australian Deputy High Commissioner to Singapore, Ms Kate Duff, was in attendance. I would like to acknowledge the visionary and proactive work of the organising committee, in particular Mr Roy Yeo, Faith Tay, Paul De La Cruz, Nicholas Tay, Clinton Cheng, Yang Ping, Sim Lai Ngin, Chong Rong Rong, Shaun Aw, Helen Qin, Lily Phua, Denise Twigger and Jon Szeto. Mr Yeo and his dynamic team are committed to developing stronger business links between Singapore and Australia.


I was pleased to participate in pre-conference visits with two local chapters of Business Networking International—a tour of the Beyonics Advanced Manufacturing facility; a visit to the Singapore Cruise Centre to see the passenger facilities for the cruise ship industry; and a visit to the Metro department store chain, which stocks a number of Australian-sourced items, such as canned abalone, honey and cosmetic products.


I delivered the keynote address at the conference, promoting sectors of the Western Australian economy that are attractive for Singaporean investment, including mining, resources, and energy; hospitality and tourism; retail and wholesale; property development and land subdivision; agriculture, food processing, agribusiness, fisheries; and the development of northern Australia.


The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement is in the process of being comprehensively updated, with a greater focus on services and improved exchanges in the areas of innovation, science, education and the arts. Under the upgraded arrangements, Australian industries, including education, law, financial and professional services, will gain improved access to Singaporean markets. Australia and Singapore will establish a framework to support mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Exciting new updates will provide greater certainty for Australian lawyers and law firms operating in Singapore. Australia has locked in existing opportunities in the legal sector, including the ability for Australian lawyers to practise Singapore law and to work in international commercial arbitration. There will also be scope to have Australian qualifications recognised by Singapore, giving lawyers, engineers, accountants and medical professionals greater certainty to practise in Singapore.


Singapore will also recognise Australian tertiary qualifications, including juris doctor degrees, as well as those in allied health, such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, from a number of Australian universities. Finance firms will also be able to provide a range of services on cross-border transactions with Singapore. This includes investment advice, portfolio management services and brokerage services for insurance of maritime, aviation and transport-related risks. Australia will raise the Foreign Investment Review Board screening threshold for private Singaporean investment in non-sensitive sectors from the current $252 million to $1,094 million, consistent with the approach taken in the Trans Pacific Partnership and North Asian free trade agreements.


Australia will locate one of its five start-up landing pads in Singapore to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. This initiative will support emerging Australian technology companies to gain a foothold in Singapore and the wider Asian market. Furthermore, the Singapore-Northern Australia Agribusiness Development Partnership will involve an ongoing program of activities focused on encouraging and attracting Singaporean investment to develop northern Australia.


Singapore and Australia have made commitments on work rights on a reciprocal basis: Australians will enjoy longer lengths of stay for independent executives, contractual service suppliers and their families, up from two months to three years. Longer lengths of stay will apply for intracorporate transferees and their families, up from two years to three years with a new maximum stay of 15 years. A more streamlined process will be implemented to facilitate temporary entry and work permits for Australian professionals and business people. Similarly, Singaporeans will have exclusive access to a new long-term, multiple entry visa option by 1 January 2018, making it easier to travel to Australia for business and pleasure. The Visitor (Subclass 600) visa will allow travellers, with just a single application, to visit Australia for up to three months at a time over a six-year period. The new visa option was announced during the Prime Minister's official visit to Singapore and will further strengthen ties between our countries. There are currently an estimated 7,578 Singaporean students studying in Australia. In terms of tourism, 709,000 Singaporeans visited Australia in 2016 and about one million Australians visited Singapore. 


Located at the heart of Asia, Singapore offers Australian businesses access to global markets. Strategically located to serve the Asia-Pacific, one of the world's fastest-growing regions, Singapore's well-established business infrastructure, global connectivity and trade linkages enable investors to access the approximately four-billion-strong Asian market within a radius of seven hours flight time. Singapore continues to be well regarded as a AAA-rated economy with strong growth potential and a sound and stable location for business expansion and investment.


The 2018 ASEAN summit will be held in Australia, with Singapore as the chair. Australian businesses, including firms in my electorate, will benefit from greater access to the Singaporean market through increased trade and investment. Australian companies are already winning high-value contracts with the Singapore government in sectors such as road transport, construction and engineering. This legislation is part of a suite of measures designed to facilitate trade and investment between our nations. It seeks to achieve this by simplifying administration and reducing compliance costs. The future looks promising, with improved cooperation and stronger ties between our nations. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:52):  The 2003 Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement was the second free trade agreement that Australia entered into. The benefit of the institution of that agreement was that Australian imports into Singapore became tariff free. In June 2015, there was a comprehensive strategic partnership signed between Singapore and Australia, and one of the priorities under that partnership was to undertake a third review of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


I'm very hopeful that this free trade agreement will build on the already strong trade relationship that exists between Singapore and Australia. The two-way trade between our nations in the 2014-15 financial year was $28 billion. I'm hopeful that this revision will help us to build on that trade. One of the benefits of this revision will be to continue to increase free trade between the two countries by working on removing some of those behind-the-border impediments to trade—some of those non-tariff trade impediments. I hope that this free trade agreement will have that benefit. Labor supports trade liberalisation. I think we've all made it very clear that we would prefer to be working towards multilateral trade liberalisation through the World Trade Organization. Nonetheless, and despite some misgivings about the preferential nature of bilateral agreements and whether they improve net trade or are simply diversionary, this is an agreement that we hope will have some mutual benefits for Singapore and Australia.


I wanted to speak on these Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement bills specifically because, in relation to previous legislation and on previous occasions, I have raised concerns about investor-state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements, particularly bilateral trade agreements. Everyone in this room would be aware of the difficulties that have arisen in relation to investor-state dispute settlement provisions, including a case against Australia in respect of our tobacco labelling. Tobacco labelling was one of the most significant pieces of public health improvement in recent decades, and I'm pleased that Australia was successful in fending off an ISDS-based complaint about cigarette and tobacco labelling.


It is of interest to most people that we ensure that our national sovereignty is not impeded or eroded through the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in free trade agreements. I have long been a critic of ISDS provisions, so I did want to make a couple of observations about the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement does contain an ISDS provision, one of the investor-state dispute settlement provisions which are obviously provisions that allow for investors, if they invest in one of the countries involved, to then go to an arbitration process to seek to have their rights as against the country determined in the event that the country does something that causes harm or loss to that investor. The ramifications for sovereignty in those cases are obvious, and so I maintain my criticism of ISDS provisions. I wanted to acknowledge that there has been some improvement in the ISDS provision in relation to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Those improvements go to some of the public criticisms that have been made of investor-state dispute settlement processes internationally over a number of years. It is encouraging to see that there's an acknowledgement in this agreement that there do need to be limitations on ISDS provisions.


In this revision of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement there are more explicit safeguards protecting the Australian government's right to regulate in relation to public interest and public welfare, including some explicit rights to regulate in relation to protecting public welfare when it comes to matters relating to health. Obviously tobacco labelling is an important example of that, but you can imagine all sorts of other areas in which it might be in an investor's interest to consider action against a sovereign government in relation to health regulation in that country. So it is pleasing that that is there. Similarly, it is pleasing that there is an explicit provision regarding the environment and our government's right to legislate and regulate in respect of environmental matters.


Members will also be aware that one of the arguments sometimes used in investor-state dispute settlement is that a particular policy of a nation effectively represents indirect expropriation of an investor's property. There's a provision in this revised agreement that deals with that, and it says that mere government regulation, provided it is not discriminatory, will not be considered to be indirect expropriation of the investor's property other than in rare circumstances, and that is very positive as well.


Finally, government action that might be considered to be inconsistent with an investor's expectations should not be considered to be a breach of the minimum standard of treatment obligation in the free trade agreement, which again is a positive thing. We want governments to be able to act in the best interests of the nation without having to worry about being pulled into some sort of secretive international arbitration process and have legislative authority overridden because of wanting to uphold free trade agreements. It is positive to see that there is some acknowledgement of those problems.


When I say 'acknowledgement', it is quite pleasing to note that there are process-related improvements for the ISDS, not just substantive improvements. One process improvement that is really important is the requirement that those ISDS hearings be conducted in public, so the public can find out what happens—they are not the secretive behind-closed-doors ISDS provisions that we've come to expect in other free trade agreements. Similarly, there's some provision for ensuring a code of conduct for arbitrators, which is included in the agreement. Again, arbitrators have been criticised as being a bit like an international club that do their work in secret and it's a small number of people in the international arbitration field who are specific to investor-state settlement dispute procedures. Having a code of conduct for those people is an improvement.


This is not me saying it's great that we have ISDS provisions—I maintain my concerns about sovereignty and the erosion of sovereignty; however, I thought it was important to acknowledge there has at least been some movement in this new revised trade agreement in coming to terms with some of the real and genuine concerns and criticisms that people have had in relation to free trade agreement ISDS provisions.


There are other measures. There are measures in relation to creative arts, Indigenous cultural heritage and other cultural heritage, and tobacco-specific provisions. I don't wish to delay the chamber any further, but I wanted to put on record my continued concern in respect of investor-state dispute settlement provisions and my sense of encouragement that there is now some international acknowledgement of the improvements that need to be made.

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (17:00):  I'd like to thank the member for Griffith for her contribution. There's much merit in what she says—that this government would prefer multilateral agreements to bilateral agreements. However, we live in a world where it is very difficult to get the World Trade Organization to agree on a particular outcome. Indeed, farmers in India have been holding up an agreement with the World Trade Organization for nearly two decades now. ISDSs are also very important measures by which people can find ways to enforce free trade agreements. There are certainly process improvements and enhancements that we can make—there's no doubt about that—but to throw the baby out with the bathwater would be a regressive step. As I'm sure the member for Griffith agrees, it is important that we live in a world of law, not a world where might is right.


Free trade is the cornerstone of the Liberal tradition in Australia. It allows Australians to have access to a wide range of goods and services that would otherwise be unattainable for the average consumer. It allows Australians to project their business and professional expertise across borders. In short, it allows Australians to thrive, unencumbered by the constraints of protectionism that those opposite would introduce if they were given the chance. There has been no greater force in pulling people out of poverty than free trade. There has been no greater deterrent to war and conflict than free trade. It was the postwar regime of free trade and open markets that saw European nations rise from the rubble of war and re-emerge as competitive and developed economies. It is free trade that will help to sustain our economy into the future and ensure that Australians have the means to succeed in a free and democratic society.


This government has a mandate to secure the economic future of our country. As part of this commitment, we must modernise and adapt our trade agreements to better suit the dynamically changing demands of the global marketplace and to facilitate trade and business between our nations with greater efficiency. After all, it is this commitment that has helped to fuel over 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth. It was a Liberal government that implemented the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement in 2003, marking a new chapter in an economic relationship that has since proven to be of immeasurable benefit to both Australia and Singapore. Allowing Australian businesses to finally access the countless export opportunities in Singapore has elevated that country to becoming one of our largest trading partners. Australian businesses have chosen to invest heavily in the Singaporean economy. Likewise, our businesses have been on the receiving end of considerable Singaporean investment, totalling over $31 billion of foreign direct investment in 2016 alone. 


This bill will build on our existing economic partnership and create new opportunities for Australians and their businesses to thrive overseas. It will allow them to expand their footprint into South-East Asia, whilst cutting the red tape that has so often hindered entrepreneurial ambitions in the past. Singapore is not only a key economic hub in its own right; it is also a gateway into the rapidly expanding economies of Asia. With a burgeoning middle class that is set to more than double over the next decade, Asia should be of great interest to any Australian business seeking to increase its export opportunities. With existing infrastructure to support the expansion of our businesses into a lucrative market, Singapore is an ideal starting point for such ventures.


By addressing and mitigating behind-the-border barriers to trade, this bill will allow Australian businesses of any size to tap into increasing consumer demand in Asia, boosting our global competitiveness. We are increasing the threshold at which outbound investment into Singapore requires approval, from the previous $252 million, by four times. That means much faster investments requiring less hurdles. Ultimately, it means greater productivity and efficiency for our businesses, and more highly paid jobs and opportunities for all Australians. Another change we are implementing to the same end is simplifying the certification-of-origin process, meaning more time for Australians to spend doing business instead of in their business. Professional services contribute one-third of our total exports to Singapore, so this bill includes provisions to ensure that Australians are better able to offer their services in Singapore, with more and wider-spread recognition of Australian accreditation in fields like law, medicine and health. For Australians, this means they can now much more easily transition into life in Singapore, earn competitive wages and compete for lucrative private-sector and government contracts.


Those opposite constantly lament the cost of living in this country, yet, at the same time, they oppose our trade agreements at every corner. The one solution to rising prices has, time and time again, been proven to be free trade, but there they stand, steadfast in their opposition to measures that will actually help those they claim to represent. This is yet another example of Labor kowtowing to the demands of union leaders whose aims are motivated by the quaint idea that protectionism doesn't make our low-income earners less well off. This is nothing new. We have seen it before in many of our attempts to integrate with the global economy. We have seen it in our negotiations with China, we have seen it with our negotiations with Japan, we have seen it with our negotiations with South Korea, and I assure you that we will see it again here. After all, we know the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in the proven benefits of free trade. As he said himself, 'There is no such thing as fair trade.' If ever there was proof that those opposite don't believe in the future of Australia, here it is.


There are people in my own electorate of Mackellar that have experienced the other side, the dark side in which trade does not exist and free markets do not exist—and, guess what: neither do free people. They hail from countries like China, Cambodia, Vietnam, the former Soviet bloc and, sadly, many others. Having experienced what living under communism was like—or, dare I say, even economic socialism—they fled to Australia for this very reason. Take China, for example: plagued by a historic tradition of protectionism and insulation from global markets, its people were suffering from wide-reaching poverty, mass starvation and a stagnant economy. Once faced with a large, rural, poor population isolated from vital services and deprived of access to goods, economic liberalisation has pulled hundreds of millions out of poverty whilst allowing for equitable access to consumer goods and services. Through liberalisation of its economy, the quality of life increased exponentially for the average Chinese person, as has the opportunity for their businesses and investments around the world. China's integration into the global economy and the impact that this has had on its citizens is a testament to the nature of free trade, not as an economic policy benefitting only big business, but as a proactive approach to improving the lives of every citizen.


Their story is personal to me. It is reflected in my own. As I talked about in this very chamber during my first address to parliament, my grandparents fled the oppressive communist regime of the Soviet bloc. Economic isolationism was not just a term found in economic books; to them, it was a stark reality. It led to a suppression of free enterprise, competition and new ideas, but, importantly, it brought to the fore an incessant need for a pervasive state to control its own people. Coming to Australia was a dream come true. Finally they were in a society in which they could flourish, in which their ideas were given free reign and where ambition and hard work were rewarded. That is what free trade does: it gives people the power to decide over their own destinies.


Even in less extreme forms, excessive economic regulation hinders growth. It stifles the very creativity and need for self-expression in all human beings and it hurts the people whom it is meant to help. We celebrate value in all truly free and democratic countries. Free trade is the silver bullet to global poverty, achieving what countless charity drives and government aid packages could not. Free trade and economic liberalisation have improved living standards, created jobs and pulled the global community closer together. I use this metaphor from Thomas Friedman all the time, but it never gets old:


No two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war with each other.


Tightening our economic bonds with one another in this globalised world increases our threshold for going to war with those very nations. It makes war a more costly exercise and therefore a less likely one. In a world in which we find more and more similarities with one another, predominantly through building trade relationships, we are pushed and incentivised to work together to cooperate, but to build rather than destroy.


If history has taught us anything, it is that there is nothing to be gained from economic isolationism. Protectionism and excessive economic regulation has long been the mainstay of authoritarian governments whose main aim has always been to control their citizens rather than see them prosper.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (17:12):  You're not always sure why you're asked to add remarks, but you are asked to add remarks, and we'll see how they go.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  Indeed. I'm pleased to make a contribution to add some words of support and provide a bit of context for our support. I do so as the vice-chair of the Singapore-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group, along with my colleague, the member for Moore, Mr Goodenough, and also as someone who has a longstanding interest in good policy and the architecture to develop Australia's trade relations broadly, but particularly with South-East Asia. My former work, before I entered the parliament, was with the Victorian Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, working in the trade and engagement area. I've led trade missions to South-East Asia in a range of sectors. So I have a great personal interest as well as reflecting Labor's long and strong support for good trade policy and trade agreements.


I'll try to focus on the substance of the issues. I'm not inclined, with my head cold, to respond to some of the propaganda which we heard interspersed with some sensible comments that somehow the world is black and white and everyone on the side of truth and righteousness over there loves trade and trade agreements, and that somehow we're all Neanderthals who don't. If you look over the last few decades and, indeed, the history of this trade agreement, there's been strong bipartisan support from the Hawke-Keating government, which was not much loved by the parties opposite when they were in government, but, as the years go on, we hear more fond remarks from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister about the glory years of Hawke and Keating and their economic contribution to Australia.


To the context for this trade agreement, Australia sits at the bottom of a region of 4½ billion people—the fastest growing part of the world. The world's economic centre is returning to Asia faster than at any time in human history. Indeed, that's been the norm—that the economic centre of the world was around north of us. This is full of opportunity for us—and some threat, as we're seeing. Importantly, these opportunities have to be seized. Good outcomes don't just happen magically. They require sustained effort over many years by all sides—all parties of government at the very least, both in trade policy architecture, the day-to-day efforts, trade missions and Austrade's work and so on, and the deal-making. These agreements can be fine as far as they go, but, ultimately, it's up to Australian business to take advantage of them, particularly in the case of trading with South-East Asia, to make best use of that incredible resource which we have as a diverse country—our diaspora populations. There's an enormous amount of research that indicates that migrant diasporas, including a wonderful Singaporean diaspora, many in my electorate who settled from the 1970s and 1980s and who started businesses and are trading with Singapore now, and that those cultural networks and the trusted relationships, with families moving backwards and forwards, are also critical enablers to take best advantage of the trade architecture which may be in place from time to time.


With that broad context, I think to be fair of bipartisanship in aims and sometimes differing objectives, I would also make the point that bilateral agreements can be good as far as they go. But, in trade theory, they're always suboptimal to good multilateral agreements. I don't think any sensible economist would dispute that a broader multilateral agreement is going to give you a better outcome over the long term than a series of sometimes patchwork bilateral agreements. We are in an era where, for a range of reasons, good multilateral agreements improvements have been hard to come by. But that doesn't mean that every trade agreement is a good trade agreement. That's a really important thing to note—that it's too easy when we might raise legitimate concerns about aspects to then play the silly partisan game which we heard in question time again today that, all of a sudden, when you raise a query or a concern about a trade agreement, like we did with aspects of many that have gone in recent times, somehow, therefore, you're against free trade and you hate the whole thing, which is just nonsense.


As the committee that looked at this made clear—and Labor is supporting this legislation; it implements a couple of the key aspects to the new and improved agreement, as they say; the tariffs and customs changes—importantly, we did make some comments raising concerns about aspects of the agreement. And they're not new concerns. They're things which we've said for some years. They're things which we took to the last election. They're things which we've said in the parliament. They're things which we've said consistently in relation to other trade agreements. They go to good scrutiny. So the point that I made was that not every trade agreement is a good trade agreement. You don't sign a deal just because you can get one. You sign a deal when you're absolutely convinced in a transparent and robust way that it's in the national interest. To that effect, Labor maintain our concerns, as we provided in the additional comments to the main report, about the lack of transparency in negotiation and, importantly, the lack of independent economic analysis.


Amusingly, perhaps for those who watch the parliament and the workings of the parliament, strangely it's not just Labor that says that—it's not just Labor MPs. We've seen in this parliament alone two government-controlled committees—that's right; controlled by those opposite—publish reports which back up the points which we're making here in relation to this bill and this agreement. On the Indonesia-Australia investment relationship and trade agreement, the trade and investment growth committee only a few months ago issued a report that said there should be independent economic scrutiny of trade agreements. This is a good practice and a good policy—that you shouldn't just sign these things because you're the government and you can. If you believe what you say and you believe the advice that DFAT is giving you, then you should have the confidence to put them to some external scrutiny—expose the assumptions. It shouldn't be that controversial.


That committee recommended that any future Indonesia-Australia free trade agreement should be subject to independent scrutiny—for example, by the Productivity Commission or a similarly competent body. Indeed, there have been other committees controlled by the government that have signed up to the same principle. In supporting this legislation, which is necessary to give effect to some of the customs and tariff aspects of the agreement, we do maintain our concern about the lack of transparency in negotiation and the lack of independent economic analysis across these sorts of agreements.


The second point, and a consistent point we make, is that the SAFTA update will undermine Australia's migrant visa program by failing to apply labour market testing for contractual service suppliers. In plain English, that means that, under this new and improved government agreement, jobs in Australia will be able to be filled by workers from Singapore without being offered to Australians first. It doesn't mean we're against free trade or against economic growth to maintain that simple, firm principle that we shouldn't trade away labour market testing rights. It is a globalised world and we welcome that. Interconnectivity is great economically and it's great strategically. Countries who trade are less likely to end up in conflict in the broader region. That's all true.


There are a couple of things we believe shouldn't be globalised without proper scrutiny. One is labour market testing and people's jobs. The other is the ISDS clauses that we've got great concerns with. Notwithstanding our support for this legislation to give effect to this aspect of the agreement, we are concerned that, yet again, another agreement by this government weakens labour market protection for Australian workers. It's no great comfort when they say, 'Oh, well, there's a theory here that says we might grow the pie in a couple of aspects of the agreement.' That's fine, but you could be the one who loses your job because of the way this government approaches trade agreements with an ideological bent. It's not a controversial view. Many of their own members sign up to this unanimously committee after committee. I do not understand the blind ideology that stops them from accepting it's a reasonable proposition.


I should have mentioned at the start that there is continued bipartisan support for this. As was rightly said, the Howard government first signed this agreement in 2003 and it was updated by the Gillard government in 2011. The continued attention to updating the agreement is welcome. The final point I'd make is that ISDS clauses have been in the SAFTA. In a sense, there are changes which we welcome. There are some improvements to acknowledge the right and the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest, and that's been one of our serious concerns about ISDS clauses broadly. This agreement does acknowledge that governments have a right to regulate to ensure protection of public welfare, including health and environment; that non-discriminatory regulatory actions to safeguard public welfare objectives are okay; and that government's action, which may be inconsistent with an investor's expectations, does not constitute an agreement of the minimum standard of treatment obligations, even if it results in loss or damage to the investor.


These things form an important part of the context for the specific provisions of the bill in relation to the new rules of origin for goods imported from Singapore and the new procedure to claim preferential tariff treatment for goods that originate in Singapore, and the transitional provisions around that. In recognising that there are changes and improvements is also to concede that there are problems, therefore, in the other ISDS clauses which this government continues to have operative and pursue in other agreements.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:23):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017. If you go back to 1965, to the time when Singapore became a nation, you would have to say their prospects did not look good. Here was a small island nation with virtually zero natural resources and a small migrant population. At that time in 1965 it was almost the height of the Vietnam War. We had the North Vietnamese, the Communists, wanting to infiltrate the rest of the countries through South-East Asia. Back in 1965, there was still a legitimate argument about which economic system would provide the greatest prosperity for its citizens. Was it the Communist socialist model promoted by Russia and the North Vietnamese, or was it the free market capitalist model promoted by the West?


We ask today why Singapore is so successful, and there are two things. Firstly, Lee Kuan Yew spoke in his autobiography about the importance of America and Australia's intervention in the Vietnam War. He said: 


… the communist underground was still active in Singapore—


at the time of action in Vietnam—


America's action enabled non-communist Southeast Asia to put their own houses in order. By 1975, they—


the South-East Asian nations—


were in better shape to stand up to the communists. Had there been no US intervention—


of course, with Australia's support—


the will of these countries to resist would have melted and Southeast Asia would have most likely gone communist. The prosperous emerging market economies of ASEAN—


that we see today—


were nurtured during the Vietnam War years.


Singapore went down the track of free trade. They understood the importance of free trade—how that brings prosperity to your nation.


I was reading an article the other week and thought, 'This actually says everything that needs to be said about free trade.' It's by a gentleman called Allan Golombek. He said:


Imports are not a necessary evil; they are a necessary ingredient. Companies requiring inputs toward a finished product need to get the best price, quality, and service levels they can to compete. They need the widest potential network of potential suppliers. Being able to import—and therefore obtain the best possible terms and conditions from domestic and foreign suppliers—is crucial to being able to efficiently make products for export.


He continued:


In fact, the opportunity to import helps achieve productivity and prosperity more than the opportunity to export, because it does more to broaden choice. Importing widens the circle of potential suppliers competing to meet the needs of consumers and intermediate producers. It forces domestic companies to become more efficient and compete more effectively. It generates economies of scale, spreading production costs over a wider and larger market. It allows countries to utilize comparative advantage, importing goods and inputs from countries that are most efficient at making them. And it transfers knowledge, allowing importers to benefit from technological spillover.


That pretty much sums up Singapore's approach. And what have they achieved? One of the most successful and wealthiest societies on the planet.


We contrast that with those who decided free trade and free market capitalist policies are not the way to go. We look at a nation like Venezuela that, in contrast to Singapore, has more oil wealth than Saudi Arabia, but instead spurned free trade—that said capitalism is no good, that went for their thing of equality and social justice. What do we see in Venezuela today? A nation that once had a higher GDP than Australia—a nation that was once ranked fourth in the world with GDP—we now see in absolute collapse. Inflation there runs at 460 per cent. They have the world's worst economic growth at minus eight per cent. We see a nation where there are food riots and they slaughter the zoo animals for food. They have one of the highest murder rates in the world. Last year, there were over 21,000 murders in the nation of Venezuela, at a rate of 90 per 100,000. In contrast, Singapore had 16, at a rate of 0.3 per cent. In Venezuela, we see the re-emergence of diseases that were once eradicated—diseases like diphtheria. We see increases in child mortality. We see the final stages of socialism, where they even run out of toilet paper.


There cannot be a greater contrast—a greater example—between Singapore and Venezuela to show what is the greatest way to create prosperity for a nation's people and their economy, and yet we still have people in this parliament and state parliaments around this nation that argue against free trade. While the historical evidence of how it drives prosperity is there, we still have so many people who want to argue against free trade. Among all the wonderful things this coalition government has done, one of the best is the free trade agreements with China, with Japan and with South Korea, and now we can add this free trade agreement with Singapore to the list. 


I will go through some of the things that this free trade agreement will achieve. Firstly, it will enhance our education opportunities. There will be new opportunities, through increased recognition of tertiary qualifications obtained from Australian universities. In the legal field, it will be simpler for Australian lawyers and law firms operating in Singapore to obtain and retain accreditation. In the financial markets, Australian financial service providers will be able to provide services to Singapore, including banking, insurance, fund management, portfolio management and brokerage. Professional services will benefit.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (17:45):  I'm very pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017. Given that he is in the chamber, I really want to commend Minister Ciobo on his efforts in putting this Singaporean deal together—it is very important to have any amendment to the free trade agreement, or SAFTA, signed in an agreement. The free trade agreement is one of the pillars of our close relationship with Singapore. As a member for an electorate that exports some fine quality products and produce around the world, and services that will be available in Singapore as a result of this agreement, I acknowledge the work of the minister. The minister, having visited my electorate not so long ago, understands the capabilities and the capacity not only of my electorate but of those around Australia and the opportunities this agreement provides. 


As a trading nation, Australia relies on trade—there's no other way of putting it. Every new free trade agreement that we do brings another opportunity for those who provide goods and services, as this one does. I represent the amazing region of the south-west, and the Margaret River region in particular, and my electorate already exports to all areas of the globe and especially into Asia. Singapore is one of the main gateways for this fast-growing region. The OECD estimates the global middle class will swell to 4.9 billion people by 2030—two-thirds of whom are expected to reside in Asia, with China itself having one billion of that global middle class. 


SAFTA provides unprecedented access to Asian markets through the trade hub that is Singapore. Opportunities in the Margaret River region and throughout the south-west—as the minister is well aware, and he supported me strongly in achieving the necessary federal funding—have been boosted with the upgrade for the Busselton-Margaret River Airport to international status, with international and domestic freight. This is really a critical issue in my electorate. It opens up the whole of the south-west, not just the immediate Margaret River-Busselton area, to allow the export of products directly into Singapore and then onto Asia. It is an amazing transformative project and opportunity. My electorate has things like the wonderful wine that we're internationally known for, and Amelia Park's beautiful lamb and beef. We have that amazing and wonderful delicacy, marron, and Brad Adams down at Augusta has his ocean-grown baby abalone. Then there is the Margaret River Chocolate Company, which produces a handmade premium product, a wonderful delicacy. Vasse Virgin is producing some amazing olive oil, raw soaps and natural products. There are also the artisan cheeses and yoghurts. Then there are niche companies like the Margaret River Fudge Factory, which is an experience in itself, or Nauti-Craft, which recently won a national award for innovation. There are lots of opportunities.


We will see people coming to and from the region as a result of this free trade agreement and we will see even more opportunities. The SAFTA does a number of things, removing the tariffs on exports to Singapore across the board and giving market access for Australian exporters of services, particularly around education, the environment, telecommunications and professional services. I look at all the expertise we have in the irrigation space in the south-west. Harvey Water is a multiaward-winning provider of irrigation. It is a co-op run by local farmers. They've done extraordinary, groundbreaking work. I'm sure this is the sort of expertise that is transferable. That sort of expertise fits into the services space. There will also be opportunities in education—for Manea college, for example—and for telecommunication companies, law firms and insurance companies. When we get people coming into the south-west, into Busselton and the Margaret River region, through that wonderful airport, we'll be able to offer them a range of amazing experiences. 


The free trade agreement provides a more open and predictable business environment, exactly what businesses call for both in Singapore and in Australia. It includes competition policy, government procurement, intellectual property, e-commerce, customs procedures and business travel. This is just the beginning. These amendments are a key economic plank of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. This is another high-quality trade deal completed by the Turnbull government. It builds on the agreements with China, Thailand and South Korea and the Singapore agreement itself, delivering significant economic benefits and driving strong growth in the value of Australia's exports. I want to see more of those opportunities for businesses and my region of the south-west of Western Australia. I thank the minister for his efforts.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:52):  The Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 are the legislative changes required as part of the recent update to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 amends the Customs Act 1901 to introduce new rules of origins for goods that are imported into Australia from Singapore. It introduces new procedures to claim preferential tariff treatment for goods that originate from Singapore and it extends the record-keeping obligations that apply to goods exported to Singapore that are produced and manufactured in Australia to Australian-originating goods that are exported to Singapore. 


The second bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017, provides for duty-free access on entry into force of the amended agreement for most eligible goods. It inserts a new schedule 4A to provide for excise-equivalent rates of duty on certain alcohol, tobacco, fuel and petroleum products and it repeals provisions in schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act that provide for excise-equivalent rates on duty on certain alcohol, tobacco, fuel and petroleum products in line with the amended agreement, after the expiration of the three-year transition period. 


Labor supports these changes and, more broadly, we support the update to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The original free trade agreement was signed by the Howard government, with the Goh government, back in 2003, and it was first updated by the Gillard government in 2011. This is the second update to that agreement. Singapore is our seventh-largest trading partner, and last year we exported more than $10 billion in goods and services to Singapore. This update provides a framework for bilateral investments. It also recognises a number of Australian qualifications, which will provide more opportunities for Australian workers in the areas of education, law, e-commerce, telecommunications and professional services. They're all good things. The updated rules of origin will also help cut red tape for exporters and reduce compliance costs. The harmonisation of investor rules for the Foreign Investment Review Board should also help to increase business in both countries. All of that is good news. 


The updated agreement also restricts the use of ISDS mechanisms, and this is welcome. As part of the updated agreement, ISDS exemptions have been included for governments to regulate to ensure the protection of public welfare, including in areas of health and the environment. The ISDS provisions will not apply to tobacco control measures and Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare Benefits Schedule, Therapeutic Goods Administration and Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. Measures with respect to the creative arts, Indigenous cultural expressions and other cultural heritage will also not have ISDS provisions apply to them and, likewise, Australia's foreign investment policy, including decisions of the Foreign Investment Review Board. These are important protections; however, I take this opportunity to restate Labor's position: we believe that ISDS clauses should be removed altogether. Sovereign governments should be able to legislate in the national interest and should not be constrained by litigious companies or groups.


A part of the updated agreement that's not in this bill that we don't support is the removal of labour market testing for contractual service suppliers. I've made this point in this place and elsewhere a number of times. This is the sort of stuff that makes Australians angry. Before a company brings a worker in from overseas—an electrician, a carpenter or a mechanic—we think they should first have to go through the basic task of seeing if there is an Australian who can do the job. That's not what is happening here. The government is using trade deals to waive this with a number of different countries.


Despite all the talk from the Prime Minister that this wouldn't happen, it is happening. It also contradicts the government's announcement earlier this year that labour market testing would be mandatory for all temporary skill shortage visa applications. In April, the Prime Minister said:


If a job is able to be done by an Australian, it should be done by an Australian. Every nation is entitled to take that point of view, and we certainly do.


When they announced the changes to temporary work visas, he said:


It will require, in almost all circumstances, in the majority of cases, mandatory labour market testing.


But in the policy document that was also released that day there was a get-out clause. On page 3, it said that labour market testing will be mandatory unless an international obligation applies. That's what's being done here. It is what was done with the Chinese-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the South Korean agreement and the Japanese agreement. They have waived labour market testing in this update. If the government would adopt the same approach with the range of other bilateral and regional free trade agreements they're currently negotiating, the impact would be that around 75 per cent of those who come to Australia to work would do so without labour market testing happening first.


That objection stated, we support the update to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement and support this legislation. I told the Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister and the Singaporean trade minister that when they visited a few weeks ago. We are two countries with a long and important bond. We're both free and open economies. Our bureaucrats work together to open up our region for even more trade and investment. Our soldiers, sailors and air men and women train and fight together. Many Australians who fought and died in the Second World War lay forever in Singaporean soil. I hope this update will further cement the bonds between our two great countries and lead to more trade and investment.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (17:58):  I want to thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017. I thank the member for Blaxland for his comments. We have a good working relationship. I think that we have the chance to be motivated by common interest in terms of Australia's national interest; though. of course, we disagree from time to time on the best way that that national interest is served. That notwithstanding, I appreciate the contribution he made in this debate. Although I don't agree with all aspects of his remarks, I appreciate the nature in which he made them.


I particularly thank the members for Capricornia, Moore, Mackellar, Hughes and Forrest who made contributions. I think their contributions highlight the significance of the SAFTA and the opportunities that the coalition is creating for Australian businesses. I note that, across the board, coalition members are genuinely excited about what SAFTA represents.


This new comprehensive strategic partnership between Australia and Singapore does represent incredible potential to keep building on the strong trade and investment ties that exist between our countries. It represents incredible potential because of defence links that exist between Australia and Singapore, which have been further entrenched and help to bind together the work that Singapore and Australia will be able to do today. It represents incredible potential because of the way in which we have, for example, the CSIRO and A*STAR working collaboratively in innovative new areas. It represents incredible potential because of the great work that the landing pad that the coalition has instigated and put into effect in Singapore. It is now well and truly a breeding ground, for lack of a better term, for nascent Aussie businesses that are taking some of their first steps in the world.


For these reasons, I'm genuinely motivated by what I think is going to be a comprehensive and substantial trade and investment deal that will help to change and further develop for the positive the relationship between Australia and Singapore. They do represent a deepening of our bilateral relationship with Singapore. Given, of course, its modern services-based economy, it is, in many respects, a natural gateway for Australian businesses to those rapidly growing markets in South-East Asia. These are markets that we, of course, as a coalition government, have sought to further entrench through our China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, our Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and, of course, the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. Singapore is our fourth-largest export market for services. It's a very significant factor for Australia's largest service-driven economy. I note that roughly 76 per cent of the Australian economy is services based—roughly four out of five jobs—and yet, notwithstanding that fact, it only accounts for around 22 per cent of our exports.


SAFTA represents the embodiment of incredible potential when it comes to services exports for our nation. That's why we—and I want to pay credit to my predecessor, Andrew Robb, who started this process with Singapore—were so focused on making sure we put in place this comprehensive deal. The benefits from this deal were also made apparent to me when I travelled, together with the defence minister, Senator Payne, and the foreign minister, Minister Bishop, to what we call the Plus Three dialogue in Singapore only a matter of a month or two ago. I took with me a delegation of Australian businesses, all motivated and excited to make the most of this deal that we're putting through the parliament today. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement has mobilised people across a range of industries: agribusiness, those involved in innovation, those involved in higher education, and those involved in defence industries. I was particularly pleased to see Senator Ian Macdonald and the member for Capricornia come with us on that journey to accompany those businesses as well as a number of mayors from local communities, all of whom came to reinforce the message that this is a good deal for Australia.


I should also note that the member for Herbert's in the chamber. I note that the member for Herbert didn't make a contribution to this debate, and I find that extraordinary, frankly. I find it extraordinary because the member for Herbert represents Townsville, a region that is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The member for Herbert replaced the former member for Herbert, Ewen Jones, who certainly wouldn't have been silent about the incredible potential that the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement has for the township of Townsville. He wouldn't have been silent; he would have been talking about and advocating for the myriad benefits that Townsville will enjoy as a direct consequence of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. He would have actually had the wherewithal to contribute to a debate like this, knowing full well that this debate represents incredible potential for the people of Townsville.


In fact, the member for Herbert, in my view, should be condemned for not having the wherewithal to make a contribution to this debate. She should be condemned for not having the wherewithal to actually make remarks about what the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement will mean for her community. She should be condemned for not backing in Australian ADF personnel and not backing in Australian businesses, especially from her region, all of whom will, of course, stand to benefit as a consequence of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It is extraordinary that there's just a wall of silence from the member for Herbert. I want to encourage the member for Herbert to get mobilised, get active and get engaged with the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. If the member for Herbert wants to be an advocate for her community and wants to be someone who's taken seriously in this building, then it's probably important that she speaks about one of the single biggest issues that affects her community directly rather than just sitting, stony faced and mute. In fact, I think that to actually even be in the chamber while the debate is taking place and not contribute to it really reinforces that the member for Herbert has no interest in something like this—something which has such an impact on the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


Australia exported some $4.8 billion of services to Singapore in 2016, including some $2.2 billion of professional and business services. Since SAFTA was first signed in 2003, our bilateral trade relationship has grown by over 80 per cent and our bilateral trade relationship has grown by more than 350 per cent. The agreement to amend SAFTA underscores the importance each country places on further integrating our two economies and remaining open for trade and business in the face of what is, unfortunately, it sometimes seems, a more protectionist sentiment that prevails in some quarters.


These two bills implement legislation that will help bring the agreement into force as soon as possible and allow Australians to benefit from even greater access to global markets. The government will move two amendments to the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 in the Senate to address an inconsistency with the definition of 'harmonised system' that's currently contained in the bill. Since the agreement to amend SAFTA was concluded, the World Customs Organization has introduced an updated version of the harmonised system, and the government amendments will ensure Australia's domestic processes are completed in time to meet entry and to force deadlines.


The agreement to amend SAFTA is our most comprehensive update to a free trade agreement to date. Singapore has given Australia its best FTA treatment, putting our exporters on equal or better footing than our foreign competitors. I particularly want to acknowledge the excellent relationship with Minister Lim, Minister Balakrishnan and, indeed, Prime Minister Lee, all of whom have played a critical role on Singapore's side, as well as the work of the Singapore high commission. All have been mobilised and focused on making sure that this Singapore-Australia free trade agreement embodies the full potential of what is a wonderful relationship between Australia and Singapore.


The conclusion of such a high-quality deal reinforces the leadership of the coalition in delivering new opportunities for Australian businesses. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Deputy Nationals Whip) (16:32):  I rise to discuss the vital importance of international trade—particularly with our close ally Singapore—to Capricornia. Capricornia, in Central Queensland, holds a diverse and strong economy based on primary and mineral production. We are in many ways the backbone of Queensland's economy, providing billions of dollars in GDP and royalties each year, while generating the vast majority of the state's—and indeed the nation's—energy needs and growing high-quality food for customers the world over. Central Queensland is an absolute engine room, and we want to keep it that way.


While it is all very well and good to have a great product, it is equally important to be able to sell it. As a National within this coalition government, I am proud of what we are achieving in the sphere of trade. Liberalised trade has underpinned Australia's 26 years of continuous economic growth. Our free trade agreements are generating new opportunities for local businesses and creating jobs, something I am very passionate about. While Central Queensland is such an economic powerhouse, we are doing it tough at the moment. Since the end of the most recent mining construction boom, we've seen property prices fall, businesses go to the wall and many of the good, reliable jobs disappear. It is vital now, more than ever, that we continue to grow and develop our export markets so we can address this downturn in one industry with gains in another.


In 2015 the prime ministers of Australia and Singapore signed a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, CSP, to further integrate our economies, militaries, institutions and people. The CSP is broad-ranging in its scope and brings benefits to Australia across a range of sectors and throughout the country, including rural and regional Australia. Investment from Singapore has the potential to help unlock opportunities in Australia's north. Northern Australian communities like Rockhampton, Sarina and Clermont stand ready to be the beneficiaries of stronger trade, tourism and investment links with Singapore.


The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement is a massive economic asset in a broader national sense, particularly for Central Queenslanders. Central Queenslanders understand trade and realise just how important it is to have open trade with our Asian neighbours like Singapore. Singapore and Australia are such natural partners, sharing centuries of history together both as part of the British Empire and as two countries committed to free trade and open markets. Singapore is in many ways a doorway to Asia, a real key trade market through which so much of South-East Asian economies rely. In 2016, two-way trade between Australia and Singapore amounted to $23 billion. Singapore is our largest trading partner in ASEAN and the seventh largest overall. The free trade agreement with Singapore promises to boost competition for Australian exporters by addressing behind-the-border barriers, delivering new access and greater certainty to service suppliers.


Central Queenslanders, perhaps more than most Australians, are well aware of our close relationship with Singapore as we play host to thousands of Singaporean military personnel each year. Exercise Wallaby is on the Shoalwater Bay military training grounds in my electorate of Capricornia. As we speak, roughly 4,000 Singaporean troops, airmen and seamen are joining Australian troops for vital training, war games and live-firing operations. This exercise provides a welcome boost to the local economies of cities and towns like Rockhampton and Yeppoon, particularly for businesses in transport and logistics, accommodation, retail, dining and entertainment.


The Singaporean influence cannot be underestimated in our community and is undoubtedly another string to the bow of Central Queensland's economy. This benefit is set to become a real game changer for our region, as Singapore is set to dramatically increase its presence. Under the plan, Singapore will not only more than triple the number of personnel they send to Australia but also expand the time for which they will be here. Singapore is also investing $2 billion into improving the training, infrastructure and prioritising local businesses for the works at two training sites in Queensland, one of which is Shoalwater Bay. This will mean roughly a $1 billion investment in training infrastructure that will remain Australian, and will do what I am absolutely committed to—that is, creating jobs.


The amendments tabled for this free trade agreement are an important addition to what has been a monumentally beneficial agreement between two of the region's great nation's since its acceptance under the Howard government in 2003. Moving forward, a greater range of Australian businesses will be able to utilise SAFTA to better tap into the Singapore market. These amendments place an emphasis on our burgeoning services industries, a sector easily overlooked when it comes to international export but one with significant export appeal. New opportunities for education as an export exist through increased recognition of tertiary qualifications obtained at Australian universities in law, medicine and allied health—again, excellent news for Central Queenslanders studying through one of the country's finest education facilities and its largest external study university, CQ University. These changes will allow local universities to be far more competitive in the global market for education. I firmly believe education is one of the great opportunities for our economy as the growing middle class of South-East Asia looks for educational products to help deliver their children the edge in life they need to succeed in the modern world. The process will also make it easier for our great Australian universities like CQ University to set up campus in Singapore. Up until now, they've not been able to call themselves a university.


The opportunity for Australian companies to tender for valuable procurement contracts with the Singapore government is an exciting opportunity, particularly for the myriad of Central Queensland businesses with skills transferrable across the globe. This increased opportunity, teamed with a marked reduction in red tape, should see relationships, and therefore trade, between our two great countries continue to grow well into the future. Red-tape reduction will come in many forms, especially with regards to certifying origin. Exporters will be able to self-certify, rather than paying through the nose for a third-party certifier to tell them what they already know.


Another key aspect of the amendments deals with international business travel. An enormous number of Australians travel to Singapore for business for varying reasons—some for a day, some for a month and others end up making their lives there—and the same can be said for many Singaporeans in Australia. It is vitally important where we have such high numbers of expats from each country that we have guaranteed access for Australians to work and stay in Singapore, while keeping security and safety paramount. As far as Central Queensland is concerned, the stronger our ties with Singapore, the better. We see so much benefit from our already strong relationship that more can only be a good thing.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:41):  I rise to support the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017, which is part of a suite of measures designed to facilitate trade and investment between our nations. The proposed legislation will simplify administration and reduce compliance costs for traders operating under the agreement by introducing new product-specific rules of origin for goods that are imported into Australia from Singapore. This is simpler than the existing 50 per cent content rule that requires businesses to record all production costs. Goods which satisfy the new rules of origin in the amended agreement will be able to enter Australia at preferential rates of customs duty.


Procedures for claiming the preferential treatment will be modernised and traders will now be able to self-certify that their goods meet the rules of origin. These procedures will also provide exporters with flexibility to continue to have goods certified by third parties. The new rules will operate as an alternative framework for goods claimed to be the produce or manufacture of Singapore for a transitional period of three years, after which the framework for produce or manufacture of Singapore will be repealed, and only eligible goods that are determined in accordance with the new rules of origin will be subject to preferential rates of customs duty.


The amended agreement will enter into force after the governments of both Australia and Singapore have completed their respective domestic treaty approvals processes, having exchanged notes confirming the completion of their respective domestic procedures. At this time both countries are working cooperatively to facilitate the entry into force on 1 December 2017.


In 2016 Australian investment in Singapore reached $61.5 billion, while Singaporean investment in Australia amounted to $99 billion. In terms of services, Singapore is our third-largest trading partner, with international services amounting to $10 billion annually. Singapore is our 11th-largest trading partner in terms of merchandise trade, with combined imports and exports totalling $12.6 billion in 2016.


I attended the Australia Singapore Exchange Conference, which was held at Suntec City in Singapore between 28 September and 1 October. Delegates from Australia travelled to Singapore to network with representatives of the Singaporean business community, the objective being to strengthen the trade and investment relationship between our nations. The Australian Deputy High Commissioner to Singapore, Ms Kate Duff, was in attendance. I would like to acknowledge the visionary and proactive work of the organising committee, in particular Mr Roy Yeo, Faith Tay, Paul De La Cruz, Nicholas Tay, Clinton Cheng, Yang Ping, Sim Lai Ngin, Chong Rong Rong, Shaun Aw, Helen Qin, Lily Phua, Denise Twigger and Jon Szeto. Mr Yeo and his dynamic team are committed to developing stronger business links between Singapore and Australia.


I was pleased to participate in pre-conference visits with two local chapters of Business Networking International—a tour of the Beyonics Advanced Manufacturing facility; a visit to the Singapore Cruise Centre to see the passenger facilities for the cruise ship industry; and a visit to the Metro department store chain, which stocks a number of Australian-sourced items, such as canned abalone, honey and cosmetic products.


I delivered the keynote address at the conference, promoting sectors of the Western Australian economy that are attractive for Singaporean investment, including mining, resources, and energy; hospitality and tourism; retail and wholesale; property development and land subdivision; agriculture, food processing, agribusiness, fisheries; and the development of northern Australia.


The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement is in the process of being comprehensively updated, with a greater focus on services and improved exchanges in the areas of innovation, science, education and the arts. Under the upgraded arrangements, Australian industries, including education, law, financial and professional services, will gain improved access to Singaporean markets. Australia and Singapore will establish a framework to support mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Exciting new updates will provide greater certainty for Australian lawyers and law firms operating in Singapore. Australia has locked in existing opportunities in the legal sector, including the ability for Australian lawyers to practise Singapore law and to work in international commercial arbitration. There will also be scope to have Australian qualifications recognised by Singapore, giving lawyers, engineers, accountants and medical professionals greater certainty to practise in Singapore.


Singapore will also recognise Australian tertiary qualifications, including juris doctor degrees, as well as those in allied health, such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, from a number of Australian universities. Finance firms will also be able to provide a range of services on cross-border transactions with Singapore. This includes investment advice, portfolio management services and brokerage services for insurance of maritime, aviation and transport-related risks. Australia will raise the Foreign Investment Review Board screening threshold for private Singaporean investment in non-sensitive sectors from the current $252 million to $1,094 million, consistent with the approach taken in the Trans Pacific Partnership and North Asian free trade agreements.


Australia will locate one of its five start-up landing pads in Singapore to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. This initiative will support emerging Australian technology companies to gain a foothold in Singapore and the wider Asian market. Furthermore, the Singapore-Northern Australia Agribusiness Development Partnership will involve an ongoing program of activities focused on encouraging and attracting Singaporean investment to develop northern Australia.


Singapore and Australia have made commitments on work rights on a reciprocal basis: Australians will enjoy longer lengths of stay for independent executives, contractual service suppliers and their families, up from two months to three years. Longer lengths of stay will apply for intracorporate transferees and their families, up from two years to three years with a new maximum stay of 15 years. A more streamlined process will be implemented to facilitate temporary entry and work permits for Australian professionals and business people. Similarly, Singaporeans will have exclusive access to a new long-term, multiple entry visa option by 1 January 2018, making it easier to travel to Australia for business and pleasure. The Visitor (Subclass 600) visa will allow travellers, with just a single application, to visit Australia for up to three months at a time over a six-year period. The new visa option was announced during the Prime Minister's official visit to Singapore and will further strengthen ties between our countries. There are currently an estimated 7,578 Singaporean students studying in Australia. In terms of tourism, 709,000 Singaporeans visited Australia in 2016 and about one million Australians visited Singapore. 


Located at the heart of Asia, Singapore offers Australian businesses access to global markets. Strategically located to serve the Asia-Pacific, one of the world's fastest-growing regions, Singapore's well-established business infrastructure, global connectivity and trade linkages enable investors to access the approximately four-billion-strong Asian market within a radius of seven hours flight time. Singapore continues to be well regarded as a AAA-rated economy with strong growth potential and a sound and stable location for business expansion and investment.


The 2018 ASEAN summit will be held in Australia, with Singapore as the chair. Australian businesses, including firms in my electorate, will benefit from greater access to the Singaporean market through increased trade and investment. Australian companies are already winning high-value contracts with the Singapore government in sectors such as road transport, construction and engineering. This legislation is part of a suite of measures designed to facilitate trade and investment between our nations. It seeks to achieve this by simplifying administration and reducing compliance costs. The future looks promising, with improved cooperation and stronger ties between our nations. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:52):  The 2003 Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement was the second free trade agreement that Australia entered into. The benefit of the institution of that agreement was that Australian imports into Singapore became tariff free. In June 2015, there was a comprehensive strategic partnership signed between Singapore and Australia, and one of the priorities under that partnership was to undertake a third review of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


I'm very hopeful that this free trade agreement will build on the already strong trade relationship that exists between Singapore and Australia. The two-way trade between our nations in the 2014-15 financial year was $28 billion. I'm hopeful that this revision will help us to build on that trade. One of the benefits of this revision will be to continue to increase free trade between the two countries by working on removing some of those behind-the-border impediments to trade—some of those non-tariff trade impediments. I hope that this free trade agreement will have that benefit. Labor supports trade liberalisation. I think we've all made it very clear that we would prefer to be working towards multilateral trade liberalisation through the World Trade Organization. Nonetheless, and despite some misgivings about the preferential nature of bilateral agreements and whether they improve net trade or are simply diversionary, this is an agreement that we hope will have some mutual benefits for Singapore and Australia.


I wanted to speak on these Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement bills specifically because, in relation to previous legislation and on previous occasions, I have raised concerns about investor-state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements, particularly bilateral trade agreements. Everyone in this room would be aware of the difficulties that have arisen in relation to investor-state dispute settlement provisions, including a case against Australia in respect of our tobacco labelling. Tobacco labelling was one of the most significant pieces of public health improvement in recent decades, and I'm pleased that Australia was successful in fending off an ISDS-based complaint about cigarette and tobacco labelling.


It is of interest to most people that we ensure that our national sovereignty is not impeded or eroded through the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in free trade agreements. I have long been a critic of ISDS provisions, so I did want to make a couple of observations about the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement does contain an ISDS provision, one of the investor-state dispute settlement provisions which are obviously provisions that allow for investors, if they invest in one of the countries involved, to then go to an arbitration process to seek to have their rights as against the country determined in the event that the country does something that causes harm or loss to that investor. The ramifications for sovereignty in those cases are obvious, and so I maintain my criticism of ISDS provisions. I wanted to acknowledge that there has been some improvement in the ISDS provision in relation to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Those improvements go to some of the public criticisms that have been made of investor-state dispute settlement processes internationally over a number of years. It is encouraging to see that there's an acknowledgement in this agreement that there do need to be limitations on ISDS provisions.


In this revision of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement there are more explicit safeguards protecting the Australian government's right to regulate in relation to public interest and public welfare, including some explicit rights to regulate in relation to protecting public welfare when it comes to matters relating to health. Obviously tobacco labelling is an important example of that, but you can imagine all sorts of other areas in which it might be in an investor's interest to consider action against a sovereign government in relation to health regulation in that country. So it is pleasing that that is there. Similarly, it is pleasing that there is an explicit provision regarding the environment and our government's right to legislate and regulate in respect of environmental matters.


Members will also be aware that one of the arguments sometimes used in investor-state dispute settlement is that a particular policy of a nation effectively represents indirect expropriation of an investor's property. There's a provision in this revised agreement that deals with that, and it says that mere government regulation, provided it is not discriminatory, will not be considered to be indirect expropriation of the investor's property other than in rare circumstances, and that is very positive as well.


Finally, government action that might be considered to be inconsistent with an investor's expectations should not be considered to be a breach of the minimum standard of treatment obligation in the free trade agreement, which again is a positive thing. We want governments to be able to act in the best interests of the nation without having to worry about being pulled into some sort of secretive international arbitration process and have legislative authority overridden because of wanting to uphold free trade agreements. It is positive to see that there is some acknowledgement of those problems.


When I say 'acknowledgement', it is quite pleasing to note that there are process-related improvements for the ISDS, not just substantive improvements. One process improvement that is really important is the requirement that those ISDS hearings be conducted in public, so the public can find out what happens—they are not the secretive behind-closed-doors ISDS provisions that we've come to expect in other free trade agreements. Similarly, there's some provision for ensuring a code of conduct for arbitrators, which is included in the agreement. Again, arbitrators have been criticised as being a bit like an international club that do their work in secret and it's a small number of people in the international arbitration field who are specific to investor-state settlement dispute procedures. Having a code of conduct for those people is an improvement.


This is not me saying it's great that we have ISDS provisions—I maintain my concerns about sovereignty and the erosion of sovereignty; however, I thought it was important to acknowledge there has at least been some movement in this new revised trade agreement in coming to terms with some of the real and genuine concerns and criticisms that people have had in relation to free trade agreement ISDS provisions.


There are other measures. There are measures in relation to creative arts, Indigenous cultural heritage and other cultural heritage, and tobacco-specific provisions. I don't wish to delay the chamber any further, but I wanted to put on record my continued concern in respect of investor-state dispute settlement provisions and my sense of encouragement that there is now some international acknowledgement of the improvements that need to be made.

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (17:00):  I'd like to thank the member for Griffith for her contribution. There's much merit in what she says—that this government would prefer multilateral agreements to bilateral agreements. However, we live in a world where it is very difficult to get the World Trade Organization to agree on a particular outcome. Indeed, farmers in India have been holding up an agreement with the World Trade Organization for nearly two decades now. ISDSs are also very important measures by which people can find ways to enforce free trade agreements. There are certainly process improvements and enhancements that we can make—there's no doubt about that—but to throw the baby out with the bathwater would be a regressive step. As I'm sure the member for Griffith agrees, it is important that we live in a world of law, not a world where might is right.


Free trade is the cornerstone of the Liberal tradition in Australia. It allows Australians to have access to a wide range of goods and services that would otherwise be unattainable for the average consumer. It allows Australians to project their business and professional expertise across borders. In short, it allows Australians to thrive, unencumbered by the constraints of protectionism that those opposite would introduce if they were given the chance. There has been no greater force in pulling people out of poverty than free trade. There has been no greater deterrent to war and conflict than free trade. It was the postwar regime of free trade and open markets that saw European nations rise from the rubble of war and re-emerge as competitive and developed economies. It is free trade that will help to sustain our economy into the future and ensure that Australians have the means to succeed in a free and democratic society.


This government has a mandate to secure the economic future of our country. As part of this commitment, we must modernise and adapt our trade agreements to better suit the dynamically changing demands of the global marketplace and to facilitate trade and business between our nations with greater efficiency. After all, it is this commitment that has helped to fuel over 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth. It was a Liberal government that implemented the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement in 2003, marking a new chapter in an economic relationship that has since proven to be of immeasurable benefit to both Australia and Singapore. Allowing Australian businesses to finally access the countless export opportunities in Singapore has elevated that country to becoming one of our largest trading partners. Australian businesses have chosen to invest heavily in the Singaporean economy. Likewise, our businesses have been on the receiving end of considerable Singaporean investment, totalling over $31 billion of foreign direct investment in 2016 alone. 


This bill will build on our existing economic partnership and create new opportunities for Australians and their businesses to thrive overseas. It will allow them to expand their footprint into South-East Asia, whilst cutting the red tape that has so often hindered entrepreneurial ambitions in the past. Singapore is not only a key economic hub in its own right; it is also a gateway into the rapidly expanding economies of Asia. With a burgeoning middle class that is set to more than double over the next decade, Asia should be of great interest to any Australian business seeking to increase its export opportunities. With existing infrastructure to support the expansion of our businesses into a lucrative market, Singapore is an ideal starting point for such ventures.


By addressing and mitigating behind-the-border barriers to trade, this bill will allow Australian businesses of any size to tap into increasing consumer demand in Asia, boosting our global competitiveness. We are increasing the threshold at which outbound investment into Singapore requires approval, from the previous $252 million, by four times. That means much faster investments requiring less hurdles. Ultimately, it means greater productivity and efficiency for our businesses, and more highly paid jobs and opportunities for all Australians. Another change we are implementing to the same end is simplifying the certification-of-origin process, meaning more time for Australians to spend doing business instead of in their business. Professional services contribute one-third of our total exports to Singapore, so this bill includes provisions to ensure that Australians are better able to offer their services in Singapore, with more and wider-spread recognition of Australian accreditation in fields like law, medicine and health. For Australians, this means they can now much more easily transition into life in Singapore, earn competitive wages and compete for lucrative private-sector and government contracts.


Those opposite constantly lament the cost of living in this country, yet, at the same time, they oppose our trade agreements at every corner. The one solution to rising prices has, time and time again, been proven to be free trade, but there they stand, steadfast in their opposition to measures that will actually help those they claim to represent. This is yet another example of Labor kowtowing to the demands of union leaders whose aims are motivated by the quaint idea that protectionism doesn't make our low-income earners less well off. This is nothing new. We have seen it before in many of our attempts to integrate with the global economy. We have seen it in our negotiations with China, we have seen it with our negotiations with Japan, we have seen it with our negotiations with South Korea, and I assure you that we will see it again here. After all, we know the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in the proven benefits of free trade. As he said himself, 'There is no such thing as fair trade.' If ever there was proof that those opposite don't believe in the future of Australia, here it is.


There are people in my own electorate of Mackellar that have experienced the other side, the dark side in which trade does not exist and free markets do not exist—and, guess what: neither do free people. They hail from countries like China, Cambodia, Vietnam, the former Soviet bloc and, sadly, many others. Having experienced what living under communism was like—or, dare I say, even economic socialism—they fled to Australia for this very reason. Take China, for example: plagued by a historic tradition of protectionism and insulation from global markets, its people were suffering from wide-reaching poverty, mass starvation and a stagnant economy. Once faced with a large, rural, poor population isolated from vital services and deprived of access to goods, economic liberalisation has pulled hundreds of millions out of poverty whilst allowing for equitable access to consumer goods and services. Through liberalisation of its economy, the quality of life increased exponentially for the average Chinese person, as has the opportunity for their businesses and investments around the world. China's integration into the global economy and the impact that this has had on its citizens is a testament to the nature of free trade, not as an economic policy benefitting only big business, but as a proactive approach to improving the lives of every citizen.


Their story is personal to me. It is reflected in my own. As I talked about in this very chamber during my first address to parliament, my grandparents fled the oppressive communist regime of the Soviet bloc. Economic isolationism was not just a term found in economic books; to them, it was a stark reality. It led to a suppression of free enterprise, competition and new ideas, but, importantly, it brought to the fore an incessant need for a pervasive state to control its own people. Coming to Australia was a dream come true. Finally they were in a society in which they could flourish, in which their ideas were given free reign and where ambition and hard work were rewarded. That is what free trade does: it gives people the power to decide over their own destinies.


Even in less extreme forms, excessive economic regulation hinders growth. It stifles the very creativity and need for self-expression in all human beings and it hurts the people whom it is meant to help. We celebrate value in all truly free and democratic countries. Free trade is the silver bullet to global poverty, achieving what countless charity drives and government aid packages could not. Free trade and economic liberalisation have improved living standards, created jobs and pulled the global community closer together. I use this metaphor from Thomas Friedman all the time, but it never gets old:


No two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war with each other.


Tightening our economic bonds with one another in this globalised world increases our threshold for going to war with those very nations. It makes war a more costly exercise and therefore a less likely one. In a world in which we find more and more similarities with one another, predominantly through building trade relationships, we are pushed and incentivised to work together to cooperate, but to build rather than destroy.


If history has taught us anything, it is that there is nothing to be gained from economic isolationism. Protectionism and excessive economic regulation has long been the mainstay of authoritarian governments whose main aim has always been to control their citizens rather than see them prosper.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (17:12):  You're not always sure why you're asked to add remarks, but you are asked to add remarks, and we'll see how they go.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  Indeed. I'm pleased to make a contribution to add some words of support and provide a bit of context for our support. I do so as the vice-chair of the Singapore-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group, along with my colleague, the member for Moore, Mr Goodenough, and also as someone who has a longstanding interest in good policy and the architecture to develop Australia's trade relations broadly, but particularly with South-East Asia. My former work, before I entered the parliament, was with the Victorian Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, working in the trade and engagement area. I've led trade missions to South-East Asia in a range of sectors. So I have a great personal interest as well as reflecting Labor's long and strong support for good trade policy and trade agreements.


I'll try to focus on the substance of the issues. I'm not inclined, with my head cold, to respond to some of the propaganda which we heard interspersed with some sensible comments that somehow the world is black and white and everyone on the side of truth and righteousness over there loves trade and trade agreements, and that somehow we're all Neanderthals who don't. If you look over the last few decades and, indeed, the history of this trade agreement, there's been strong bipartisan support from the Hawke-Keating government, which was not much loved by the parties opposite when they were in government, but, as the years go on, we hear more fond remarks from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister about the glory years of Hawke and Keating and their economic contribution to Australia.


To the context for this trade agreement, Australia sits at the bottom of a region of 4½ billion people—the fastest growing part of the world. The world's economic centre is returning to Asia faster than at any time in human history. Indeed, that's been the norm—that the economic centre of the world was around north of us. This is full of opportunity for us—and some threat, as we're seeing. Importantly, these opportunities have to be seized. Good outcomes don't just happen magically. They require sustained effort over many years by all sides—all parties of government at the very least, both in trade policy architecture, the day-to-day efforts, trade missions and Austrade's work and so on, and the deal-making. These agreements can be fine as far as they go, but, ultimately, it's up to Australian business to take advantage of them, particularly in the case of trading with South-East Asia, to make best use of that incredible resource which we have as a diverse country—our diaspora populations. There's an enormous amount of research that indicates that migrant diasporas, including a wonderful Singaporean diaspora, many in my electorate who settled from the 1970s and 1980s and who started businesses and are trading with Singapore now, and that those cultural networks and the trusted relationships, with families moving backwards and forwards, are also critical enablers to take best advantage of the trade architecture which may be in place from time to time.


With that broad context, I think to be fair of bipartisanship in aims and sometimes differing objectives, I would also make the point that bilateral agreements can be good as far as they go. But, in trade theory, they're always suboptimal to good multilateral agreements. I don't think any sensible economist would dispute that a broader multilateral agreement is going to give you a better outcome over the long term than a series of sometimes patchwork bilateral agreements. We are in an era where, for a range of reasons, good multilateral agreements improvements have been hard to come by. But that doesn't mean that every trade agreement is a good trade agreement. That's a really important thing to note—that it's too easy when we might raise legitimate concerns about aspects to then play the silly partisan game which we heard in question time again today that, all of a sudden, when you raise a query or a concern about a trade agreement, like we did with aspects of many that have gone in recent times, somehow, therefore, you're against free trade and you hate the whole thing, which is just nonsense.


As the committee that looked at this made clear—and Labor is supporting this legislation; it implements a couple of the key aspects to the new and improved agreement, as they say; the tariffs and customs changes—importantly, we did make some comments raising concerns about aspects of the agreement. And they're not new concerns. They're things which we've said for some years. They're things which we took to the last election. They're things which we've said in the parliament. They're things which we've said consistently in relation to other trade agreements. They go to good scrutiny. So the point that I made was that not every trade agreement is a good trade agreement. You don't sign a deal just because you can get one. You sign a deal when you're absolutely convinced in a transparent and robust way that it's in the national interest. To that effect, Labor maintain our concerns, as we provided in the additional comments to the main report, about the lack of transparency in negotiation and, importantly, the lack of independent economic analysis.


Amusingly, perhaps for those who watch the parliament and the workings of the parliament, strangely it's not just Labor that says that—it's not just Labor MPs. We've seen in this parliament alone two government-controlled committees—that's right; controlled by those opposite—publish reports which back up the points which we're making here in relation to this bill and this agreement. On the Indonesia-Australia investment relationship and trade agreement, the trade and investment growth committee only a few months ago issued a report that said there should be independent economic scrutiny of trade agreements. This is a good practice and a good policy—that you shouldn't just sign these things because you're the government and you can. If you believe what you say and you believe the advice that DFAT is giving you, then you should have the confidence to put them to some external scrutiny—expose the assumptions. It shouldn't be that controversial.


That committee recommended that any future Indonesia-Australia free trade agreement should be subject to independent scrutiny—for example, by the Productivity Commission or a similarly competent body. Indeed, there have been other committees controlled by the government that have signed up to the same principle. In supporting this legislation, which is necessary to give effect to some of the customs and tariff aspects of the agreement, we do maintain our concern about the lack of transparency in negotiation and the lack of independent economic analysis across these sorts of agreements.


The second point, and a consistent point we make, is that the SAFTA update will undermine Australia's migrant visa program by failing to apply labour market testing for contractual service suppliers. In plain English, that means that, under this new and improved government agreement, jobs in Australia will be able to be filled by workers from Singapore without being offered to Australians first. It doesn't mean we're against free trade or against economic growth to maintain that simple, firm principle that we shouldn't trade away labour market testing rights. It is a globalised world and we welcome that. Interconnectivity is great economically and it's great strategically. Countries who trade are less likely to end up in conflict in the broader region. That's all true.


There are a couple of things we believe shouldn't be globalised without proper scrutiny. One is labour market testing and people's jobs. The other is the ISDS clauses that we've got great concerns with. Notwithstanding our support for this legislation to give effect to this aspect of the agreement, we are concerned that, yet again, another agreement by this government weakens labour market protection for Australian workers. It's no great comfort when they say, 'Oh, well, there's a theory here that says we might grow the pie in a couple of aspects of the agreement.' That's fine, but you could be the one who loses your job because of the way this government approaches trade agreements with an ideological bent. It's not a controversial view. Many of their own members sign up to this unanimously committee after committee. I do not understand the blind ideology that stops them from accepting it's a reasonable proposition.


I should have mentioned at the start that there is continued bipartisan support for this. As was rightly said, the Howard government first signed this agreement in 2003 and it was updated by the Gillard government in 2011. The continued attention to updating the agreement is welcome. The final point I'd make is that ISDS clauses have been in the SAFTA. In a sense, there are changes which we welcome. There are some improvements to acknowledge the right and the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest, and that's been one of our serious concerns about ISDS clauses broadly. This agreement does acknowledge that governments have a right to regulate to ensure protection of public welfare, including health and environment; that non-discriminatory regulatory actions to safeguard public welfare objectives are okay; and that government's action, which may be inconsistent with an investor's expectations, does not constitute an agreement of the minimum standard of treatment obligations, even if it results in loss or damage to the investor.


These things form an important part of the context for the specific provisions of the bill in relation to the new rules of origin for goods imported from Singapore and the new procedure to claim preferential tariff treatment for goods that originate in Singapore, and the transitional provisions around that. In recognising that there are changes and improvements is also to concede that there are problems, therefore, in the other ISDS clauses which this government continues to have operative and pursue in other agreements.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:23):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017. If you go back to 1965, to the time when Singapore became a nation, you would have to say their prospects did not look good. Here was a small island nation with virtually zero natural resources and a small migrant population. At that time in 1965 it was almost the height of the Vietnam War. We had the North Vietnamese, the Communists, wanting to infiltrate the rest of the countries through South-East Asia. Back in 1965, there was still a legitimate argument about which economic system would provide the greatest prosperity for its citizens. Was it the Communist socialist model promoted by Russia and the North Vietnamese, or was it the free market capitalist model promoted by the West?


We ask today why Singapore is so successful, and there are two things. Firstly, Lee Kuan Yew spoke in his autobiography about the importance of America and Australia's intervention in the Vietnam War. He said: 


… the communist underground was still active in Singapore—


at the time of action in Vietnam—


America's action enabled non-communist Southeast Asia to put their own houses in order. By 1975, they—


the South-East Asian nations—


were in better shape to stand up to the communists. Had there been no US intervention—


of course, with Australia's support—


the will of these countries to resist would have melted and Southeast Asia would have most likely gone communist. The prosperous emerging market economies of ASEAN—


that we see today—


were nurtured during the Vietnam War years.


Singapore went down the track of free trade. They understood the importance of free trade—how that brings prosperity to your nation.


I was reading an article the other week and thought, 'This actually says everything that needs to be said about free trade.' It's by a gentleman called Allan Golombek. He said:


Imports are not a necessary evil; they are a necessary ingredient. Companies requiring inputs toward a finished product need to get the best price, quality, and service levels they can to compete. They need the widest potential network of potential suppliers. Being able to import—and therefore obtain the best possible terms and conditions from domestic and foreign suppliers—is crucial to being able to efficiently make products for export.


He continued:


In fact, the opportunity to import helps achieve productivity and prosperity more than the opportunity to export, because it does more to broaden choice. Importing widens the circle of potential suppliers competing to meet the needs of consumers and intermediate producers. It forces domestic companies to become more efficient and compete more effectively. It generates economies of scale, spreading production costs over a wider and larger market. It allows countries to utilize comparative advantage, importing goods and inputs from countries that are most efficient at making them. And it transfers knowledge, allowing importers to benefit from technological spillover.


That pretty much sums up Singapore's approach. And what have they achieved? One of the most successful and wealthiest societies on the planet.


We contrast that with those who decided free trade and free market capitalist policies are not the way to go. We look at a nation like Venezuela that, in contrast to Singapore, has more oil wealth than Saudi Arabia, but instead spurned free trade—that said capitalism is no good, that went for their thing of equality and social justice. What do we see in Venezuela today? A nation that once had a higher GDP than Australia—a nation that was once ranked fourth in the world with GDP—we now see in absolute collapse. Inflation there runs at 460 per cent. They have the world's worst economic growth at minus eight per cent. We see a nation where there are food riots and they slaughter the zoo animals for food. They have one of the highest murder rates in the world. Last year, there were over 21,000 murders in the nation of Venezuela, at a rate of 90 per 100,000. In contrast, Singapore had 16, at a rate of 0.3 per cent. In Venezuela, we see the re-emergence of diseases that were once eradicated—diseases like diphtheria. We see increases in child mortality. We see the final stages of socialism, where they even run out of toilet paper.


There cannot be a greater contrast—a greater example—between Singapore and Venezuela to show what is the greatest way to create prosperity for a nation's people and their economy, and yet we still have people in this parliament and state parliaments around this nation that argue against free trade. While the historical evidence of how it drives prosperity is there, we still have so many people who want to argue against free trade. Among all the wonderful things this coalition government has done, one of the best is the free trade agreements with China, with Japan and with South Korea, and now we can add this free trade agreement with Singapore to the list. 


I will go through some of the things that this free trade agreement will achieve. Firstly, it will enhance our education opportunities. There will be new opportunities, through increased recognition of tertiary qualifications obtained from Australian universities. In the legal field, it will be simpler for Australian lawyers and law firms operating in Singapore to obtain and retain accreditation. In the financial markets, Australian financial service providers will be able to provide services to Singapore, including banking, insurance, fund management, portfolio management and brokerage. Professional services will benefit.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2017-10-17,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (17:45):  I'm very pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017. Given that he is in the chamber, I really want to commend Minister Ciobo on his efforts in putting this Singaporean deal together—it is very important to have any amendment to the free trade agreement, or SAFTA, signed in an agreement. The free trade agreement is one of the pillars of our close relationship with Singapore. As a member for an electorate that exports some fine quality products and produce around the world, and services that will be available in Singapore as a result of this agreement, I acknowledge the work of the minister. The minister, having visited my electorate not so long ago, understands the capabilities and the capacity not only of my electorate but of those around Australia and the opportunities this agreement provides. 


As a trading nation, Australia relies on trade—there's no other way of putting it. Every new free trade agreement that we do brings another opportunity for those who provide goods and services, as this one does. I represent the amazing region of the south-west, and the Margaret River region in particular, and my electorate already exports to all areas of the globe and especially into Asia. Singapore is one of the main gateways for this fast-growing region. The OECD estimates the global middle class will swell to 4.9 billion people by 2030—two-thirds of whom are expected to reside in Asia, with China itself having one billion of that global middle class. 


SAFTA provides unprecedented access to Asian markets through the trade hub that is Singapore. Opportunities in the Margaret River region and throughout the south-west—as the minister is well aware, and he supported me strongly in achieving the necessary federal funding—have been boosted with the upgrade for the Busselton-Margaret River Airport to international status, with international and domestic freight. This is really a critical issue in my electorate. It opens up the whole of the south-west, not just the immediate Margaret River-Busselton area, to allow the export of products directly into Singapore and then onto Asia. It is an amazing transformative project and opportunity. My electorate has things like the wonderful wine that we're internationally known for, and Amelia Park's beautiful lamb and beef. We have that amazing and wonderful delicacy, marron, and Brad Adams down at Augusta has his ocean-grown baby abalone. Then there is the Margaret River Chocolate Company, which produces a handmade premium product, a wonderful delicacy. Vasse Virgin is producing some amazing olive oil, raw soaps and natural products. There are also the artisan cheeses and yoghurts. Then there are niche companies like the Margaret River Fudge Factory, which is an experience in itself, or Nauti-Craft, which recently won a national award for innovation. There are lots of opportunities.


We will see people coming to and from the region as a result of this free trade agreement and we will see even more opportunities. The SAFTA does a number of things, removing the tariffs on exports to Singapore across the board and giving market access for Australian exporters of services, particularly around education, the environment, telecommunications and professional services. I look at all the expertise we have in the irrigation space in the south-west. Harvey Water is a multiaward-winning provider of irrigation. It is a co-op run by local farmers. They've done extraordinary, groundbreaking work. I'm sure this is the sort of expertise that is transferable. That sort of expertise fits into the services space. There will also be opportunities in education—for Manea college, for example—and for telecommunication companies, law firms and insurance companies. When we get people coming into the south-west, into Busselton and the Margaret River region, through that wonderful airport, we'll be able to offer them a range of amazing experiences. 


The free trade agreement provides a more open and predictable business environment, exactly what businesses call for both in Singapore and in Australia. It includes competition policy, government procurement, intellectual property, e-commerce, customs procedures and business travel. This is just the beginning. These amendments are a key economic plank of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. This is another high-quality trade deal completed by the Turnbull government. It builds on the agreements with China, Thailand and South Korea and the Singapore agreement itself, delivering significant economic benefits and driving strong growth in the value of Australia's exports. I want to see more of those opportunities for businesses and my region of the south-west of Western Australia. I thank the minister for his efforts.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:52):  The Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 are the legislative changes required as part of the recent update to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 amends the Customs Act 1901 to introduce new rules of origins for goods that are imported into Australia from Singapore. It introduces new procedures to claim preferential tariff treatment for goods that originate from Singapore and it extends the record-keeping obligations that apply to goods exported to Singapore that are produced and manufactured in Australia to Australian-originating goods that are exported to Singapore. 


The second bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017, provides for duty-free access on entry into force of the amended agreement for most eligible goods. It inserts a new schedule 4A to provide for excise-equivalent rates of duty on certain alcohol, tobacco, fuel and petroleum products and it repeals provisions in schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act that provide for excise-equivalent rates on duty on certain alcohol, tobacco, fuel and petroleum products in line with the amended agreement, after the expiration of the three-year transition period. 


Labor supports these changes and, more broadly, we support the update to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The original free trade agreement was signed by the Howard government, with the Goh government, back in 2003, and it was first updated by the Gillard government in 2011. This is the second update to that agreement. Singapore is our seventh-largest trading partner, and last year we exported more than $10 billion in goods and services to Singapore. This update provides a framework for bilateral investments. It also recognises a number of Australian qualifications, which will provide more opportunities for Australian workers in the areas of education, law, e-commerce, telecommunications and professional services. They're all good things. The updated rules of origin will also help cut red tape for exporters and reduce compliance costs. The harmonisation of investor rules for the Foreign Investment Review Board should also help to increase business in both countries. All of that is good news. 


The updated agreement also restricts the use of ISDS mechanisms, and this is welcome. As part of the updated agreement, ISDS exemptions have been included for governments to regulate to ensure the protection of public welfare, including in areas of health and the environment. The ISDS provisions will not apply to tobacco control measures and Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare Benefits Schedule, Therapeutic Goods Administration and Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. Measures with respect to the creative arts, Indigenous cultural expressions and other cultural heritage will also not have ISDS provisions apply to them and, likewise, Australia's foreign investment policy, including decisions of the Foreign Investment Review Board. These are important protections; however, I take this opportunity to restate Labor's position: we believe that ISDS clauses should be removed altogether. Sovereign governments should be able to legislate in the national interest and should not be constrained by litigious companies or groups.


A part of the updated agreement that's not in this bill that we don't support is the removal of labour market testing for contractual service suppliers. I've made this point in this place and elsewhere a number of times. This is the sort of stuff that makes Australians angry. Before a company brings a worker in from overseas—an electrician, a carpenter or a mechanic—we think they should first have to go through the basic task of seeing if there is an Australian who can do the job. That's not what is happening here. The government is using trade deals to waive this with a number of different countries.


Despite all the talk from the Prime Minister that this wouldn't happen, it is happening. It also contradicts the government's announcement earlier this year that labour market testing would be mandatory for all temporary skill shortage visa applications. In April, the Prime Minister said:


If a job is able to be done by an Australian, it should be done by an Australian. Every nation is entitled to take that point of view, and we certainly do.


When they announced the changes to temporary work visas, he said:


It will require, in almost all circumstances, in the majority of cases, mandatory labour market testing.


But in the policy document that was also released that day there was a get-out clause. On page 3, it said that labour market testing will be mandatory unless an international obligation applies. That's what's being done here. It is what was done with the Chinese-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the South Korean agreement and the Japanese agreement. They have waived labour market testing in this update. If the government would adopt the same approach with the range of other bilateral and regional free trade agreements they're currently negotiating, the impact would be that around 75 per cent of those who come to Australia to work would do so without labour market testing happening first.


That objection stated, we support the update to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement and support this legislation. I told the Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister and the Singaporean trade minister that when they visited a few weeks ago. We are two countries with a long and important bond. We're both free and open economies. Our bureaucrats work together to open up our region for even more trade and investment. Our soldiers, sailors and air men and women train and fight together. Many Australians who fought and died in the Second World War lay forever in Singaporean soil. I hope this update will further cement the bonds between our two great countries and lead to more trade and investment.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (17:58):  I want to thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017. I thank the member for Blaxland for his comments. We have a good working relationship. I think that we have the chance to be motivated by common interest in terms of Australia's national interest; though. of course, we disagree from time to time on the best way that that national interest is served. That notwithstanding, I appreciate the contribution he made in this debate. Although I don't agree with all aspects of his remarks, I appreciate the nature in which he made them.


I particularly thank the members for Capricornia, Moore, Mackellar, Hughes and Forrest who made contributions. I think their contributions highlight the significance of the SAFTA and the opportunities that the coalition is creating for Australian businesses. I note that, across the board, coalition members are genuinely excited about what SAFTA represents.


This new comprehensive strategic partnership between Australia and Singapore does represent incredible potential to keep building on the strong trade and investment ties that exist between our countries. It represents incredible potential because of defence links that exist between Australia and Singapore, which have been further entrenched and help to bind together the work that Singapore and Australia will be able to do today. It represents incredible potential because of the way in which we have, for example, the CSIRO and A*STAR working collaboratively in innovative new areas. It represents incredible potential because of the great work that the landing pad that the coalition has instigated and put into effect in Singapore. It is now well and truly a breeding ground, for lack of a better term, for nascent Aussie businesses that are taking some of their first steps in the world.


For these reasons, I'm genuinely motivated by what I think is going to be a comprehensive and substantial trade and investment deal that will help to change and further develop for the positive the relationship between Australia and Singapore. They do represent a deepening of our bilateral relationship with Singapore. Given, of course, its modern services-based economy, it is, in many respects, a natural gateway for Australian businesses to those rapidly growing markets in South-East Asia. These are markets that we, of course, as a coalition government, have sought to further entrench through our China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, our Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and, of course, the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. Singapore is our fourth-largest export market for services. It's a very significant factor for Australia's largest service-driven economy. I note that roughly 76 per cent of the Australian economy is services based—roughly four out of five jobs—and yet, notwithstanding that fact, it only accounts for around 22 per cent of our exports.


SAFTA represents the embodiment of incredible potential when it comes to services exports for our nation. That's why we—and I want to pay credit to my predecessor, Andrew Robb, who started this process with Singapore—were so focused on making sure we put in place this comprehensive deal. The benefits from this deal were also made apparent to me when I travelled, together with the defence minister, Senator Payne, and the foreign minister, Minister Bishop, to what we call the Plus Three dialogue in Singapore only a matter of a month or two ago. I took with me a delegation of Australian businesses, all motivated and excited to make the most of this deal that we're putting through the parliament today. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement has mobilised people across a range of industries: agribusiness, those involved in innovation, those involved in higher education, and those involved in defence industries. I was particularly pleased to see Senator Ian Macdonald and the member for Capricornia come with us on that journey to accompany those businesses as well as a number of mayors from local communities, all of whom came to reinforce the message that this is a good deal for Australia.


I should also note that the member for Herbert's in the chamber. I note that the member for Herbert didn't make a contribution to this debate, and I find that extraordinary, frankly. I find it extraordinary because the member for Herbert represents Townsville, a region that is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The member for Herbert replaced the former member for Herbert, Ewen Jones, who certainly wouldn't have been silent about the incredible potential that the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement has for the township of Townsville. He wouldn't have been silent; he would have been talking about and advocating for the myriad benefits that Townsville will enjoy as a direct consequence of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. He would have actually had the wherewithal to contribute to a debate like this, knowing full well that this debate represents incredible potential for the people of Townsville.


In fact, the member for Herbert, in my view, should be condemned for not having the wherewithal to make a contribution to this debate. She should be condemned for not having the wherewithal to actually make remarks about what the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement will mean for her community. She should be condemned for not backing in Australian ADF personnel and not backing in Australian businesses, especially from her region, all of whom will, of course, stand to benefit as a consequence of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It is extraordinary that there's just a wall of silence from the member for Herbert. I want to encourage the member for Herbert to get mobilised, get active and get engaged with the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. If the member for Herbert wants to be an advocate for her community and wants to be someone who's taken seriously in this building, then it's probably important that she speaks about one of the single biggest issues that affects her community directly rather than just sitting, stony faced and mute. In fact, I think that to actually even be in the chamber while the debate is taking place and not contribute to it really reinforces that the member for Herbert has no interest in something like this—something which has such an impact on the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


Australia exported some $4.8 billion of services to Singapore in 2016, including some $2.2 billion of professional and business services. Since SAFTA was first signed in 2003, our bilateral trade relationship has grown by over 80 per cent and our bilateral trade relationship has grown by more than 350 per cent. The agreement to amend SAFTA underscores the importance each country places on further integrating our two economies and remaining open for trade and business in the face of what is, unfortunately, it sometimes seems, a more protectionist sentiment that prevails in some quarters.


These two bills implement legislation that will help bring the agreement into force as soon as possible and allow Australians to benefit from even greater access to global markets. The government will move two amendments to the Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 in the Senate to address an inconsistency with the definition of 'harmonised system' that's currently contained in the bill. Since the agreement to amend SAFTA was concluded, the World Customs Organization has introduced an updated version of the harmonised system, and the government amendments will ensure Australia's domestic processes are completed in time to meet entry and to force deadlines.


The agreement to amend SAFTA is our most comprehensive update to a free trade agreement to date. Singapore has given Australia its best FTA treatment, putting our exporters on equal or better footing than our foreign competitors. I particularly want to acknowledge the excellent relationship with Minister Lim, Minister Balakrishnan and, indeed, Prime Minister Lee, all of whom have played a critical role on Singapore's side, as well as the work of the Singapore high commission. All have been mobilised and focused on making sure that this Singapore-Australia free trade agreement embodies the full potential of what is a wonderful relationship between Australia and Singapore.


The conclusion of such a high-quality deal reinforces the leadership of the coalition in delivering new opportunities for Australian businesses. I commend the legislation to the House.


Question agreed to.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:08):  It is with great sadness and respect that I rise in this place on what is first nation people's land and will always be first nation people's land. In doing so, I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land upon which we stand today, the Ngunawal people, and I would like to pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging.


North Queensland has recently lost a truly inspirational woman who was one of the towering figures of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Dr Scott was an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educator and social justice campaigner. She passed away in Far North Queensland at the age of 81 in September. She will be remembered as a trailblazer who changed Australia. She possessed a striking presence, always standing tall and proud, and often wearing her signature black hat—perhaps to lessen the glare of the spotlight in which she worked, even in her later years.


The granddaughter of a man who was brought from Vanuatu to Queensland in chains to work as a slave labourer in the sugar fields in the days of the blackbirding industry, Dr Scott lived by the words of her father: if you don't think something is right, then challenge it.


This motto would mark her life and her role at pivotal moments in the history of the nation. Finding friendships with the likes of Eddie Mabo, Faith Bandler and Joe McGuinness, to name just a few, Dr Scott was a tireless and determined fighter for equal rights for Indigenous Australians. Dr Scott was a remarkable woman who displayed the qualities of true leadership and passion. I was struck by her calmness and humility when I first met her in Townsville. Her tireless work throughout her life was truly instrumental to the key achievements in Australia's reconciliation journey to date. In the early sixties, Dr Scott was drawn to a life in political activism after witnessing discrimination in employment, housing and health care in the Townsville region. During that time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were considered minors and had few rights in Queensland. This is an embarrassing and shameful part of my region's history. But in the spirit of truth telling, we must acknowledge the reality and celebrate the progression that has occurred in recent years, largely due to the activism and tireless campaigning of this extraordinary woman and others who shared her passion.


It was through the realisation of inequality in Queensland that Dr Scott became the driving force behind the 1967 referendum. The referendum changed Australia's history forever when Australians voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the census and to allow the Commonwealth to make laws for them. Over 90 per cent of voters chose to delete the discriminatory references to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples that were at the time in the Australian Constitution. It is also worth noting that Townsville and Toowoomba were the only two cities in Queensland that voted no. Yet, this was only the beginning of the momentous achievements of Dr Evelyn Scott.


After the referendum there was a seminar held in Townsville and the purpose was to pressure the federal government of the time to use its new-found power in a way that was just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was here that Dr Scott met Faith Bandler and other southern activists. In 1971, Dr Scott joined the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, FCAATSI, as executive president. She used her role to lead the transformation of FCAATSI into an Indigenous-controlled organisation in 1973, when she then moved the headquarters of the organisation to Townsville and became the first general secretary. With the support of Josie Briggs, Dr Scott played an integral role in re-establishing the organisation as, essentially, an Indigenous body.


Dr Scott progressed further in her career by obtaining the role of chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The role proved to be particularly challenging at that time as the then federal government, under the leadership of John Howard, was cutting reconciliation funding. During the time of 1997 to 2000, Dr Scott accomplished some of her most important and memorable work. She led the council and the nation through a period where the government refused to apologise to stolen generations and where the budgets to several Indigenous organisations were significantly reduced. Her leadership through this time was integral. Through her lobbying efforts, she obtained the support for reconciliation among some of the country's leaders, which assisted in influencing every day Australians.


Through her direction, the council facilitated the people's Walk for Reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge as part of Corroboree 2000. I can remember seeing more than a quarter of a million people participate in this walk. To this very day, watching that march gives me goosebumps. This was a significant part of Australia's history that we can all vividly recount today. Its impact was substantial throughout the nation and will be remembered as the most significant mobilisation of people in Australian history. Dr Scott believed the reconciliation was, and remains, a people's movement that must involve all Australians. I believe this is one of her greatest successes.


In late 2000, the government's 10-year time frame was quickly drawing to a close. Once again, Dr Scott rose to the occasion and secured support for a new body, which we know today as Reconciliation Australia. Dr Scott wanted security that Australia's reconciliation journey would continue in the 21st century and the fight for the rights of our first nation people would remain. In acknowledgment of her contribution to the nation, Dr Scott was awarded two honorary doctorates. The first one was from the Australian Catholic University in 2000 for her work in reconciliation and the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and women. The second, in 2001, from James Cook University, was in recognition of outstanding service to the Queensland community and exceptional contribution to human wellbeing. In the same year, Dr Scott was made an Officer of the Order of Australia, General Division.


On Friday, 6 October, we said goodbye to Dr Evelyn Scott with a state funeral. Dr Scott is the first Indigenous woman to receive a state funeral in Queensland. The words of Dr Evelyn Scott that will always stick with me are:


There is only one race, the human race.


Rest in peace, Dr Evelyn Scott.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (18:15):  Today, I am very happy to be able to stand here and present the joint standing committee's report Provision of hearing services under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is an interim report and comes off the back of months and months of work by the committee. I'd like to thank the chair, the member for Menzies, and the deputy chair, Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga. I also thank all the people who presented evidence to our committee and ensured that we got a good outcome. It is anticipated that approximately 16,000 to 20,000 people with hearing impairments as their primary disability will join the NDIS by 2019-20. This will represent a small cohort within the scheme—less than three per cent of NDIS participants.


The introduction of the NDIS has had a disruptive effect on what is broadly recognised as international best practice in the support provided to the deaf and hearing impaired. In fact, we have managed to see successful numbers around the world with our infant screening tests. Hearing impairment has been reduced significantly in this country.


Some concerning issues emerged from our hearings and need to be resolved to ensure deaf and hard-of-hearing people continue to receive world-class services. In March 2017, the committee delayed finalising its report, pending the release of the NDIA key operational guidelines for access criteria to the scheme for deaf and hard-of-hearing people and the baseline reference packages to guide planned development for early intervention services. The NDIA indicated to the committee that it would release these guidelines and packages by the end of April 2017. While the NDIA released guidelines for access criteria on 1 September, 2017, the early intervention packages remain outstanding. Without definitive information about the early intervention packages, the committee cannot report and make considered recommendations. This is a cause of great concern for many families, the hearing sector and, obviously, our committee.


The committee has decided to release an interim report while it awaits the release of the packages. The interim report focuses on the access criteria to the scheme and the issues pertaining to access and delivery of early intervention services. Until now, there has been a clear lack of access criteria to determine eligibility to NDIS services for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. This has caused uncertainty for future access to services and supports, especially for newly diagnosed infants and children. The committee is relieved that clear guidance to determine access to the scheme has been articulated and publicly released by the NDIA. However, the committee is frustrated that it has taken so long. I assure you that many of the people giving evidence were equally frustrated.


Based on the evidence received to date, the recently released access criteria for early intervention requirements for deaf and hard-of-hearing people aged zero to 25 appear to be technically consistent with the current practices of Australian Hearing and are therefore broadly welcomed by stakeholders. With regard to the access criteria for those who are 26 years or older, the committee is concerned that the requirements may leave some people ineligible for the scheme, despite their need for reasonable and necessary supports. I will run through the recommendations in this report:


Recommendation 1


2.57 The committee recommends the NDIA monitors eligibility rates for adults with hearing impairments to build a clearer picture of the number and needs of the people who have been found ineligible for NDIS services and reports on its finding in 12 months.


Recommendation 2


2.58 The committee recommends the NDIA reviews immediately the cases of people with hearing impairment who were previously found ineligible and tests their eligibility against the revised guidelines.


Recommendation 3


2.59 The committee recommends the Australian, state and territory governments clarify and make public how they will provide services for people who are deaf and hard of hearing who are not participants in the NDIS.


Recommendation 4


3.83 The committee recommends Australian Hearing be formally appointed as the independent referral pathway for access to early intervention services under the NDIS and funded appropriately to take on this new role.


Recommendation 5


3.87 The committee recommends the NDIA ensures that the early intervention packages take a holistic approach to the needs of participants and include:


•   scaled funding, depending on need;


•   funding provision for additional services beyond core supports, depending on need; and


•   retrospective payment of the costs borne by approved service providers for the provision of necessary and reasonable supports between time of diagnosis and plan enactment.


Recommendation 6


3.90 The committee recommends the NDIA urgently finalise, publish and introduce the early intervention reference packages.


Many other MPs in this building would certainly be in the same position as me—and members of the committee certainly are—in taking on a lot of questions about the NDIS and exactly what's happening with it, and they are absolutely hoping to get the best outcomes for their constituents, particularly people who need those reasonable and necessary supports. So I'm hoping that this report that we put a lot of work into is actually accepted and looked upon favourably by this government and they are able to fund those things that need to be funded and continue with those recommendations that we have diligently sought to make.


This is an interim report. The committee is currently looking at other areas of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, including the transitional period and the early intervention, early childhood, approach. It is with great pride that I hand over the work that's been done by this committee on the biggest social reform that this country has seen since Medicare. It is an important and vital part of legislation for our country and for people who rely on it.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:22):  The revelations last week about what was happening on the cybersecurity front here in Australia in Defence contracts or what was not happening on the cybersecurity front just underscored the fact this government is failing in its most basic responsibility, and that is our national security. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security launched the Australian Cyber Security Centre's 2017 Threat Report in a speech at the National Press Club, and an extraordinary announcement was made. It was quite extraordinary—it was a little drop there but its consequences were significant. The extraordinary announcement was made that a small Defence contractor's network had been compromised last year—just a little oops there. What continues to amaze and concern me is that the compromise wasn't picked up by Australian cybersecurity authorities. Our authorities were tipped off by international partner agencies.


The fact is that an unknown hacker was able to steal 30 gigs of sensitive Defence data. That's a lot of very sensitive Defence data. Although the language that's been used around this by the government has been incredibly flippant in terms of the seriousness of this issue—it was commercially sensitive, according to some reports, and it was unclassified according to some reports—for the purposes of today's speech I'm basically underscoring the fact that the unknown hacker was able to steal 30 gigs of sensitive Defence data.


This sensitive data included information on major multibillion-dollar Defence projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter program, the P-8A surveillance craft project, the C 1-30 transport planes and several current naval vessels. As much as the government tries to downplay its significance, this was a serious breach with the potential for serious consequences. It is incredibly concerning that the Minister for Defence Industry is so flippant on an issue of national security. This is not about blame; this is about responsibility. The government is responsible for Australia's national security, and it should hang its head in shame for this breach in national security.


The Turnbull government is responsible for the cyber resilience of government agencies, and this responsibility extends to the contractors that government agencies employ. There are over 4,000 of these defence industry businesses in Australia, and many of them are micro or small. We know that small and medium businesses are especially vulnerable to cyber attacks. They have limited resources and limited time. I know because I used to be a microbusiness, and I know there are other small business people in here too. In my case I had no resources except me. You have limited time because you're going out there making money, you're marketing your business, you're out networking, you're doing your admin and your invoices and, in your limited spare time, it's nice to put you feet up and be with the family.


These businesses have limited resources and do not have much time to mitigate against cyber attacks. Unfortunately, as a result of that, they are a regular target for attacks. According to a 2016 report by cyber security firm Symantec, 43 per cent of cyber attacks are targeted against small businesses. This recent Defence data breach is a symptom of a much larger problem amongst small and medium businesses here in Australia. The government is failing to get the message across about correct security practices, and more needs to be done in communicating with and supporting small and medium businesses to help them improve their cyber security and their operating practices.


Last week we heard about the 'Alf's Mystery Happy Fun Time' hack, as it was dubbed by the Australian Signals Directorate. The name of the hack may be amusing, but it's a symptom of a very serious problem. Basic precautions like changing default passwords and installing security updates are, obviously, continuing to be ignored. The security of this hacked contractor system was laughable. The ASD revealed that the oversights were as glaring as having default 'admin' users and passwords—I think one of them was 'guest' as well. This is a contractor to Defence contracts worth billions.


Action must be taken. Our small to medium businesses need more support and clear communication from the government, and it needs to be from one voice and one point of truth. At the moment we have a spaghetti tree of different agencies involved in communicating and in governing cybersecurity. So it's very difficult for businesses to know where to go for help and information. There is a convoluted and confusing mish-mash of various agencies and organisations responsible for providing assistance and communication to businesses, and this needs to change fast. Instead of passing the buck, the Turnbull government ought to be sitting up and taking notice of the significant improvements that need to be made all the way down the line. Cybersecurity is a whole-of-supply-chain issue. One weak link is all it takes to expose sensitive information and introduce attack vectors into larger systems, as we heard last week.


Our policies to protect government agencies also need to extend down the chain. At the moment, not even the government agencies are adhering to their own cybersecurity requirements. Despite being required to comply with the protective security policy framework, we know that many government agencies continue to be noncompliant with the information security manual. This is mandated. A stern letter by ministers asking agencies to 'please comply' is not enough. There are still no ramifications for those who refuse to comply.


I've been calling on the government to take the cybersecurity of government agencies seriously since the release of the damning 2014 audit of cyber resilience, where no agencies were found to be compliant. We've got to get our own house in order. This has to be a priority, but this must also be extended further down the supply chain. There's currently no legislation or requirement on government contracts to have adequate cybersecurity measures in place. This recent breach is not the first and nor will it be the last, while the government continues to ignore this issue. The ASD already provides guidance for government contractors on how to secure their systems, so why isn't it mandatory? Government agencies like Defence must be able to ensure a basic cybersecurity standard has been met before they release sensitive information. How can the government and the Australian people trust that sensitive information is being secured if it's being handed over to private contractors with no minimum cybersecurity assurances?


Our US ally recognised this supply-chain threat long ago and has already taken steps to rectify it. In May this year, an executive order was passed, requiring all US government agencies to comply with a national cybersecurity standards framework. This includes cybersecurity risks facing the defence industrial base, including its supply chain. Not only have minimum cybersecurity standards been applied to government agencies and their supply chains, they have also been applied to critical infrastructure systems as well.


This is yet another glaring cyber risk that's been ignored by the Turnbull government. The draft Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill, released last week, is a joke. It doesn't require critical infrastructure operators to improve their cybersecurity. It doesn't require critical infrastructure operators to report on the current state of their cybersecurity. The Turnbull government cannot continue to turn a blind eye to cybersecurity. It's endangering our ability to work with our allies and endangering our national security. The Turnbull government needs to clarify what it is doing to ensure that those handling sensitive information have the proper security precautions in place. The government has to start taking cybersecurity seriously now. It's the government's responsibility. (Time expired)
