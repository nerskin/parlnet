"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-03-26,"—I rise to speak on the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 and to place on the record some of the concerns conveyed to me by the industry. I will be very explicit: the majority of my contact in relation to this legislation has been with the sector of the industry that we would term light aircraft— commercial pilots and those who fly freighters and carry goods both around Australia and internationally. In speaking briefly with representatives of the aviation industry involved with the larger commercial sector, they indicated that they are largely in support of the government's position, provided the amendments proposed by the government are passed and also those amendments circulated by Senator Lees.
The amendments I propose to the bill take into account what I believe is an anomaly in this piece of legislation that is structured to be effective for all transport—that is, all land based transport, including rail, trucking companies, cars and taxis, and sea transport. It is a very wide-ranging piece of legislation. Because of that, several sections of the legislation that cover all of those broad aspects will have impacts on the aircraft industry in a way that the industry believes is not in its best interests. It is not in the best interests of safety and it will not provide the industry with a secure position to work from.
An aircraft travelling around Australia and internationally has certain safety requirements that are specific to that aircraft. You would not expect the same requirements in relation to the maintenance of your motor vehicle that you drive on the ground as you would for an aircraft flying between 10,000 and 30,000 feet. Therefore, it is very difficult to have this broad-brush legislation that will cover cars, buses, trucks, trains, ships and aircraft structured in such a way that it does not impact individually on any one of those specific areas.
The purpose of my amendment is to amend the wide and intrusive powers of investigation contained in the bill, particularly in relation to private aircraft, when compared with the balanced approach taken in part 2A inserted in 1995 into the Air Navigation Act 1920 in relation to the investigation of accidents. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has already commented on one such aspect—namely, the power to enter special premises without a warrant and without the occupant's consent in relation to its open-ended application to vehicles. So we have a situation where a person who has had powers delegated to them could stop and enter a vehicle without a warrant and without the person's consent.
The Transport Safety Investigation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 follows this bill—and I am sure the Acting Deputy President will notify the Senate whether these bills are to be run concurrently or separately; I seek his advice on that issue—and I will speak briefly to both of the bills during my introductory remarks.
 (Senator Brandis)—Senator Harris, I am advised by the Clerk that the bills will be dealt with separately in the committee stage.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will then confine my remarks on the access to vehicles to the debate on the consequential bill. We have a situation where the statements made during interrogation by a person involved in or associated with an incident cannot be used against them in a court of law but can be used against any other person they happen to comment upon. Let us look at a situation where we have a pilot and a copilot who have returned from an aircraft, locked it down and secured it. They hop into a vehicle to drive home and immediately find themselves intercepted without a warrant. They are then taken off for interrogation. They have no right to remain silent; they must answer the questions. The evidence that they give cannot be used against them, but, if the pilot inadvertently makes a comment about the actions of the copilot, that information can be used in court against the copilot. Conversely, if during conversation the copilot makes a statement about an action of the pilot, that evidence, although it cannot be used against the copilot, can be used against the pilot. 
Where the government intends to remove the right to remain silent from legislation, the onus is upon the government to ensure that that cannot be misused. It could be misused by a person maliciously making a statement and creating an enormous mischief against somebody within an organisation whom they particularly did not like. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I direct a question to Senator Boswell: how does the government intend to ensure that its proposal for a person to lose their right to remain silent— they will be required to answer questions— cannot be used maliciously against another person? Because, as sure as night follows day, in the aviation industry—and in any transport industry, for that matter—there will be those who wish to adversely use this section that the government is proposing.
One of the amendments I will move in relation to access to aircraft would restrict that access to a situation where there has been an incident in which a person has died or suffered serious injury or an incident involving another aircraft not involved in the private operation. I want to stress very clearly that the amendment would allow an officer to obtain a warrant to enter an aircraft if there was a security problem or in a situation where, possibly through incorrect functioning of navigational equipment, there had been a near miss. This amendment would not stop any investigation of that type of accident. It would, though, provide the owners and operators of those aircraft with the secure knowledge that, if they comply with all of the regulations, nobody can forcibly enter their aircraft when it is locked and tied up at an airport. The industry needs that assurance, so I strongly recommend that government and opposition senators look very seriously at this amendment.
The amendment to clause 24 removes the open-ended references extending the offence to situations where an investigation has not been commenced and to omissions. These references operate to dilute the requirements of recklessness, as defined in division 5.4 of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act. As I said in my opening statements, these amendments have come from the light aircraft industry itself. All pilots who hit the start button and go through their checks are as aware of their responsibilities in relation to safety as each and every one of us are eminently aware of them, due to the amount of time that we spend in those same aircraft. The amendments are not there to take away, in any way, from the power of the authority to investigate genuine accidents, near misses or any situation brought about by possible instrument irregularities.
In closing, I bring to the Senate's notice section 5 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. It states:
This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, judges, and people of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding anything in the laws of any State ...
If we look at the development of that passage, the meanings behind it and why it is worded that way, it is very specific. I quote:
No difficulty is suggested by the words, “and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution.”
The words under the Constitution are words of limitation and qualification, so our Constitution limits the power of this parliament. It limits it to issues that are clearly defined. I quote further:
A law in excess of the authority conferred by the Constitution is no law; it is wholly void and inoperative; it confers no rights, it imposes no duties; it affords no protection. ... To be valid and binding—
that is, the law—
they must be within the domain of jurisdiction mapped out and delimited in express terms, or by necessary implication, in the Constitution itself. What is not so granted to the Parliament of the Commonwealth is denied to it. 
I repeat: 
What is not so granted to the Parliament of the Commonwealth is denied to it.
I quote further:
What is not so granted is either reserved to the States, as expressed in their respective Constitutions, or remains vested but dormant in the people of the Commonwealth.
This is the issue that we are facing on a regular basis in this chamber. The Commonwealth can only pass a law and have it operative if it is expressly within the defined power of the Constitution. Our Constitution clearly says to the Australian people: `We have the right to remain silent. We have the right not to incriminate ourselves.' Yet we have this preponderance of legislation by the government that would take away the right of a person to remain silent. I come back to what our founding fathers clearly stated when this section of our Constitution was put together:
To be valid and binding they must be within the domain of jurisdiction mapped out and delimited in express terms, or by necessary implication, in the Constitution itself. What is not so granted to the Parliament of the Commonwealth is denied to it. 
A law that is made in excess of the power of this parliament is totally void. It is up to the government to decide. If they wish to proceed with this piece of legislation—on the basis that they are removing a common law right and a constitutional right of a citizen of Australia to remain silent—they do so knowing full well that they will find themselves in the High Court of Australia and having a judgment made on whether that power is in excess of the constitutional power of this parliament. The amendments that I will move will remove the ability of the Commonwealth to cause a person to make a statement against their wishes. I commend them to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-03-26,"—I will make a few summing up comments and then respond to Senator Lees and Senator Harris. The Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 includes the best practice principles of independent no-blame safety investigation contained in the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the Navigation (Marine Casualty) Regulations 1912 and applies them consistently to aviation, interstate and international marine travel, and interstate rail travel. 
Senator O'Brien asked for an update of the negotiations with state and territory rail regulators. I inform him that the ATSB is at the final stage of negotiations with these bodies and that the negotiations have been handled in a very constructive way. I think he was asking, `At what stage are they?' They are at a very late stage. It is worth noting that the ATSB sought to ensure proper consultation on the bills with industry, including the AIPA, by providing, in September 2001, a copy of the draft bills and an explanatory memorandum and inviting AIPA to a half-day workshop on the bill. The bureau granted AIPA an extension of time to make a submission but, despite the ATSB's follow-up, AIPA did not provide comment on the bill until after the legislation was introduced last year. It is appreciated that AIPA now regards the bill, with the amendments agreed by the government, as an acceptable compromise. Industry support is important in maintaining improved future safety.
Amendments to the TSI Bill, with the consequential amendment bills, will be moved on behalf of the government. The amendments are made in response to matters raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The amendments also address some more minor matters and provide greater legal certainty on the operation of the bill in relation to an overseas investigation by the ATSB. The purpose of these amendments is to require occupiers of premises to be advised of their rights and obligations under the TSI Bill regarding entry and search of premises where the bill allows for it.
The amendments also seek to restrict the use of special premises powers to accidents and serious incidents, and require the executive directors to exercise those powers only to the extent that it is reasonable for the purpose of transport safety investigations. They provide a regime to protect the confidentiality of cockpit voice recordings—CVRs— where they are not designated as on-board recordings under the TSI Bill. They include within the scope of the TSI Bill investigations conducted by the ATSB on behalf of a foreign country, or ATSB participation in investigations led by foreign countries, to ensure that evidence that the ATSB investigators obtain during these investigations is protected by the confidentiality provisions of the TSI Bill. They make changes to clause 17 of the bill so that the clause requires the executive director to exercise his or her powers in accordance with international obligations under the international agreements in force from time to time and also with regard to other international instruments listed in the regulations. 
Although the government has stated that non-government amendments are not essential for the adequate protection of CVRs, the government is willing to agree to them. The TSI Bill is worthy of bipartisan support and the government will be appreciative of such support following acceptance of the amendments. The government acknowledges the work of the Senate and its committees in reviewing the bill and the work of the ATSB in the interests of future transport safety.
Question agreed to.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-26,"—I move:
That the committee does not insist on Senate amendments (1), (3), (4), (5) and (6).",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-03-26,"—On behalf of the Australian Labor Party opposition, I rise to speak to the message from the House of Representatives. The Labor Party will not agree with the message from the House of Representatives and will be voting to oppose it. The message we are dealing with relates to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This bill, which was introduced by the government, came about as a result of the courts and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission not yet resolving whether bargaining fees are an industrial matter. We are not certain at this time whether, in fact, bargaining fees are an industrial matter. If it is held that they are not, the proposed laws that were presented by the Liberal government become nothing more than a useless appendage to the act, because provisions in certified agreements dealing with bargaining bills would have no legal force.
The Labor Party takes the view that now is not the appropriate time to be considering this matter before the parliament when it is not clear what the legal position is in respect of bargaining fees and whether or not they have legal force. However, the Liberal government has presented a piece of legislation that effectively outlaws bargaining fees. The Labor Party takes the view that, in presenting the legislation to outlaw bargaining fees, the government was intervening unnecessarily in matters that are determined by the relevant parties to industrial provisions. It is up to the individuals involved—both employees and employers—to determine what are appropriate bargaining fees at an enterprise level. The same principle holds true in the issues relating to Australian workplace agreements. The Labor Party does not believe that, where the parties have agreed, government should be interfering in the agreements that are reached.
The government has entitled this bill the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. That is the description it has given the bill. We have seen a variety of other titles used for industrial relations legislation. We have had the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002—they are titles of other bills which come to mind. I want to say very firmly and clearly to the Senate that this bill is not about compulsory union fees; the bill itself speaks of `bargaining service fees'.
The position taken by the Labor opposition to this piece of legislation in the Senate was a positive one. We took that approach in conjunction with my Senate colleague Australian Democrat Senator Murray and successfully moved six amendments to the legislation. Without going into all the detail, the core of the amendments was to outline a process by which permissible bargaining fees would be allowed. The substantial detail of that is contained in the first amendment, which was carried by the Senate. It outlines a process whereby an organisation may charge a permissible bargaining fee if it is in connection with an agreement made under section 170LJ. The agreement's beneficiaries include those who have not made a contribution to the costs of reaching the agreement by means of paying a union membership fee. The permissible bargaining fee has to be explained in clear language, and in writing, to all employees in advance of the vote on the agreement, and I emphasise that a vote will take place on the agreement. 
In summary, the amendment provides that the details of the permissible bargaining fee and the services are set out in the agreement; all employees affected by the agreement are advised; a valid majority of persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the agreement must have genuinely agreed to the provision; the agreement provides for the method and timing of the fee to be paid; the independent Industrial Relations Commission is to be satisfied that the fee is fair and reasonable; and the agreement provides that new employees pay the fee only for a pro rata period of the agreement.
That is the substance of the first amendment and the six amendments that were successfully moved by Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats and supported by the Australian Labor Party. Amendment (2) provides for a tough provision if a false or misleading representation is made. There is some inappropriate irony in the fact that the government has decided to pick up the tougher enforcement provisions and accept them when they go to prohibiting bargaining fees, but it is not supporting the other five amendments which outline the process through which bargaining fees may be charged.
The Labor Party maintains its position. It thinks it has been positive and responsible in amending the bill in the way that has been advanced by Senator Murray. I was informed this morning that Senator Murray, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, is not going to insist on the amendments that were carried and, therefore, will be voting to accept the message from the House of Representatives. I ask, through you, Chair: is that correct, Senator Murray?
—To clarify, as a courtesy I advise the Labor Party that that will be so.
—Thank you. I thank the Temporary Chairman for his indulgence. I was advised correctly. I wanted to confirm that before I launched into a critique—I did not want to be unfair. It is a matter of grave disappointment to the Australian Labor Party that the Australian Democrats are going to back down and support the government's message and effectively support the bill that the government has presented to the other place and to the Senate. As I said earlier, the Australian Labor Party believes the amendments that were moved by Senator Murray— I emphasise that they were Senator Murray's amendments—were appropriate and well balanced. They made the current position, which is legally unclear, very clear. We had certainty as a result of the amendments that Senator Murray moved and which the Australian Labor Party supported. We are disappointed with the approach of the Australian Democrats.
As I indicated in my opening remarks, the Australian Labor Party, as true defenders of the protections and rights of workers in this country, will not be changing their position. We believe that it is appropriate and may be permissible for bargaining fees to be charged. There should be a clear process for that to occur, and it is wrong in principle to be interfering in agreements that are reached between employees—workers—and employers. Where they agree and where these arrangements are subject to a ballot in a democratic process, it is inappropriate for government to be interfering in this way. For the very clear reasons of principle that I have outlined to the Senate chamber this morning, the Labor Party will not be supporting the message. They will not be backing down and they will not change their position on this issue.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-26,"—I would like to make a couple of points in response to Senator Sherry and put the government's position on this message and the motion that I have moved. The government did consider the amendments made by the Senate and, in a spirit of trying to seek a compromise and a resolution to a measure that we believe is important, have indeed agreed to accept amendment (2) which was moved by Senator Andrew Murray when the bill was last in this place. We did look at the other amendments but believe in general that they cut across the policy objective of the legislation. 
On a political point, Senator Sherry claims that he and the Labor Party are the true defenders of workers. I think it would be more accurate and more truthful to say that they are the defenders—and indeed the true defenders—of unionised workers. We seek to ensure that union members and their rights are defended. We seek to defend those rights against union bosses who may not always think about their members—they may think about their own interests ahead of others'. Many union bosses do not, but some do. We also seek to defend the rights of non-unionised workers who have made a decision not to join a union for whatever reason is in their conscience at that time. We also seek to fight for the rights of people who would like to be workers, who would like to have a job and, if they get a job, who would then have that fantastic democratic right of deciding whether they want to join a union. My party and our government seek to defend the rights of all of those people.
In relation to Senator Sherry's eloquent term `a defender of rights', it is inappropriate to seek to defend the rights of one person in or out of the workplace ahead of those of others. We think that unionised workers have rights, non-unionised workers have rights and, very importantly, people who seek to enter the workplace have rights as well. The government—and I am sure we share this with all people in this parliament—would like to see as many people as possible who seek to enter the work force have the opportunity to do that and exercise the choices that are made available. We have, as I have said, sought to compromise to get this legislation through. We agree with that very successful Labor leader who said:
You can't put a tax on other members of the work force and the state can't require the collection of union fees from non-unionists.
That was a comment referred to by Laurie Oakes this morning in a column about Bob Carr's success as a Labor leader. It was said by Mr Carr in a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 October 1999. We believe in that. We believe that people should have the choice to join a union and that unions should have a well protected, well understood and strongly defended right to organise in the workplace. We believe that there is a need for unions to operate within a clear legal framework, to organise, to get members to join for good reasons and, in the great tradition of trade unionism, to defend the rights of those workers. But workers should not be coerced into joining. They should make a decision based on the fact that the union can actually provide a service which is of value to those members. Therefore, to require others who make the choice not to join to pay a fee anyway is a travesty of that principle that the government believe needs to be made clear in the law.
I welcome the amendment moved by Senator Murray, who has obviously also considered the various issues here. We appreciate the work he put into it. We appreciate that his amendment does in fact benefit the bill. It is an indication of the government's preparedness to find ways to improve our legislation and an example of how the Senate, in the great traditions of this place, can improve government legislation. As former senator Bob McMullan said at a function in Parliament House two nights ago, governments of both political persuasions sometimes fail in this place because they do not accept someone's idea if they did not think of it first. I think he is quite right about that. There is a natural tendency for governments to knock back amendments if they have not thought of them. In this area, we are happy to look at good ideas from anywhere around the chamber. Senator Nettle might be leaping to her feet to come up with another good idea for us. We are even happy to accept ideas from her. This is an indication of the fact that the government are prepared to compromise and are prepared to see their legislation improved.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-03-26,"—I will leap to my feet with perhaps a good idea that Senator Ian Campbell could take on board. I agree with the comment that he has just made, quoting the Labor Premier of my state, that people should not be coerced into joining a union. I think everyone in this chamber would agree with that, but that is not what this bill is about. This bill is about a fee for a service that trade unions provide in the workplace. The collective bargaining that trade unions participate in has been proven time and again to improve the pay and working conditions of people who are represented by their union. Those benefits do not just accrue to union members. They do not just accrue to people who support and recognise the value of collective bargaining by joining and becoming a part of their trade union. They also accrue to other workers in a workplace who have not paid their membership fee and become members of the trade union. 
This argument is about a service fee for those non-union members who receive the benefits of the collective bargaining that the union participates in, that the union negotiates with the employer on their behalf, on everyone's behalf, for improved pay and conditions. That is what the argument from this side of the chamber is about—that is, those people should pay a service fee to the trade union that provides them with a negotiating service that improves their pay and conditions in their workplace. That is what this bill is about. It is not about coercive union fees. There is a difference between paying a bargaining fee and joining a trade union. There are many other benefits that accrue from being a member of a trade union, apart from just the negotiating power that that trade union brings to an employment situation. Non-union members who pay a bargaining fee but who do not join the union do not get those benefits. They are simply being asked to pay a fee to cover the service the trade union is providing for them in their workplace. That is why the Greens will continue to support the rights of unions to charge bargaining fees to non-union members who accrue the benefits that the trade union achieves in their workplace.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-26,"—This is the fourth double dissolution bill I personally have had to deal with this year. I on behalf of my party, the Australian Democrats, have insisted on three of those, but I am not going to insist on this one. The question is: why? The three bills from the government that I on behalf of the Democrats, in conjunction with the Labor Party, insisted on all sought to change the law. We considered that the changes that were being sought by the government were not merited, and the majority of the Senate agreed with us, and therefore they are now double dissolution triggers. I am afraid, if there is a double dissolution election, three of those bills will be my fault!
So why don't I insist on this fourth one? Because it confirms the law. Yesterday the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—I am quoting from page 13202 of Hansard of Tuesday, 25 March 2003—said:
It is the government's view that the best current legal authority is that so-called bargaining agents fees are not permitted by the law as it stands. Nevertheless, despite the fact that these fees are not permitted by the law as it stands, on the best authorities, it is certainly the case that in a number of workplaces workers are being told that they have an obligation to pay. This is not the case, and it should not be done.
The Industrial Relations Commission in January 2003 determined that bargaining fee provisions should not be included in certified agreements. As Bills Digest No. 101 says, the January 2003 decision:
... in effect, supports the Government's position on this matter. Therefore the question may be asked as to whether the provisions of this Bill are required to prohibit bargaining fees, now that the AIRC has determined that the fees are non-allowable.
Two principles are at play here. One is that the majority of the Senate, as a result of our own advocacy—and we are very pleased they have agreed with us—do believe that the circumstances in which fee for service should apply need to be expressed in the law and that principle needs to be inserted in the law. That is my amendment, and the Labor Party—and I am very grateful to them for it—have adopted this as new policy, because it was not in their previous legislation, and they are in accord with the principle, and I think they are right. The more people who join in with that view the better. The government made it quite clear that they will not accept that policy, and there is nothing we can do about it. They control the House of Representatives.
Therefore, what is my position? My position is that if the law stands and if the purpose of this bill is to make the law more explicit—which I think it does—I do not believe that we should consider it as appropriate material for a double dissolution trigger. It would just be unnecessary, because the government's bill confirms the law. We do not agree with it. We think the law needs to be changed, but that is an entirely different circumstance to those we have thought of in the past. 
It should be recorded that the bill does have the merit of not preventing the voluntary contribution of such fees by nonmembers to unions, and the bill explicitly allows employer associations and unions to charge bargaining fees where such fees have been arranged under a contract for services. In that respect it is an advancement on existing practice and, in fact, will improve the capability of agreements being made where fees can be voluntarily agreed to by the parties concerned. I respect the Labor Party's opinion in this matter. In some respects I wish I could join in with them, but our principle with double dissolution bills has been that, if they change the law and we disagree with that change, we should stay firm, but since this bill just confirms the law we see no point to insisting on it.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ian Campbell's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Senator BRANDIS,",LP,2003-03-26,"—On 7 February, the High Court handed down its decision in ACCC v. Boral. The case has generated considerable public discussion. I acknowledge the contributions to that discussion of my colleagues Senator Ron Boswell, Senator Guy Barnett, the member for Moncrieff, Mr Steven Ciobo, and the member for Petrie, Ms Teresa Gambaro, all of whom have expressed serious concerns about the consequences of the Boral decision and, in particular, its impact upon small business. I wish to take this opportunity to add my voice to those concerns. In doing so, let me say something about the decision itself.
Boral was a case about the practice known as `predatory pricing'. Predatory pricing is not a term of art, nor is it defined in the Trade Practices Act. In layman's terms, it can be described as the commercial practice whereby one firm, with sufficient economic power to enable it to absorb the short-term losses, lowers its prices to such a level that smaller firms are unable to compete and are thus driven out of the market. The benchmark for whether a pricing strategy is predatory is often described by trade practices lawyers and economists as pricing below avoidable or variable cost.
Commonly, the consequence of predatory pricing is that, once the small firm is driven out of the market, the powerful firm is then able, free of competitive constraint, to raise its prices again. Sometimes, that conduct may produce the result that the large firm becomes so dominant that it can raise its prices above the level which would have been sustainable in a competitive market. So whatever short-term benefit might have been enjoyed by consumers during the period of price cutting will be negated by the capacity of the dominant firm to raise prices in an uncompetitive market in the long term.
So there are three losers from predatory pricing. The first are smaller firms which, lacking the capacity to absorb short-term, below-cost pricing, are driven out of business. The second are consumers. Although consumers might enjoy the benefits of price cuts in the short term, they are the long-term losers, since the effect of a successful predatory pricing strategy will be to remove competition from the market and allow the dominant firm to raise prices without constraint. The third loser will be the competitive process itself. By the cynical use of a technique which relies not upon true competition but rather upon the economic power of a large firm to absorb short-term losses so as to destroy its competition, the market will be made less competitive in the end.
Liberals have a strong commitment to free and competitive markets. But, as antitrust lawyers know, there is a variety of techniques, of which predatory pricing is one and price fixing and other forms of collusive conduct are others, by which true competition can be destroyed and competitive markets degraded into monopolies or cartels. It is the purpose of antitrust law in Australia, contained in part IV of the Trade Practices Act, to prohibit such practices and, therefore, to make competitive markets work properly, in the interests of free enterprise and to the ultimate benefit of consumers.
In the Boral case, the court was concerned with the market for concrete masonry products in Victoria. At the time the relevant events took place, in the early to mid-1990s, the Victorian building industry was in recession. Boral was one of the principal players in the market. One of its competitors was a small entrant to the market, C & M Brick, which had acquired a more efficient state-of-the-art plant and was therefore able to manufacture its product at a lower unit cost. Boral identified the growing market share of the more efficient C & M Brick as posing a major threat. Accordingly, in May 1995, Boral adopted a Strategic Business Plan, which was placed in evidence before the court. The Strategic Business Plan stated: 
Our aim throughout 1996-97 and 1997-98 is to drive at least one competitor out of the market ...
It is true that Boral had competitors other than C & M, but it is equally clear that it was C & M that Boral had in its sights. This is plain from another Boral strategy document, which was also produced in evidence, in which we find this statement:
The long-term solution to the market decline in Melbourne is for C & M to fail as a producer and one of the major producers to pick up the assets.
The assets referred to were C & M's plant and equipment. In order to give effect to its strategy, Boral quite deliberately engaged in the practice of pricing below variable cost. In this case, its strategy did not succeed. C & M Brick survived following an upturn in the market after 1996. Nevertheless, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission took action against Boral, alleging breach of section 46 of the Trade Practices Act.
Section 46 is the key provision of the Trade Practices Act aimed at misuse of market power. It provides, so far as is relevant to this case, that a corporation with a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor. It does not, in terms, prohibit predatory pricing. Nevertheless, until Boral, it was generally believed that predatory pricing was the very type of conduct at which section 46 was directly aimed.
The case was tried before Mr Justice Heerey of the Federal Court over 17 days in July and August 1999. His Honour found that Boral was indeed motivated by the purpose prohibited by section 46 and that it had sought to achieve that purpose by the strategy of pricing below avoidable cost. He nevertheless decided the case in Boral's favour because he considered that it had acted in response to competitive pressures, in particular resulting from the depressed condition of the Victorian construction industry in the early 1990s, and hence could not be said to have taken advantage of market power. He therefore considered that Boral's predatory pricing strategy was not caught by section 46.
The ACCC appealed to the full court of the Federal Court where, in February 2001, all three judges—Justices Beaumont, Merkel and Finkelstein—decided that Justice Heerey's approach was wrong. In a short parliamentary speech about complex legal issues, it is difficult not to oversimplify. But I hope it does justice to the full Federal Court's approach to say that they considered that the issues of predatory conduct and market power could not be looked at in isolation. The fact that a large firm like Boral was able to absorb substantial short-term losses in pursuing a commercial strategy of below-cost pricing, in order to drive a smaller competitor out of the market, was in their Honours' view itself indicative of the existence and use of market power.
As we know, Boral's appeal to the High Court was successful. Six of the seven judges, with Justice Kirby dissenting, decided that Mr Justice Heerey's approach was correct and that the three judges of the full Federal Court were wrong. I do not wish to spend my time today arguing that the High Court's decision was wrong, nor would this be the appropriate place to do so. In a sense, the question is academic: the High Court has declared what the law is, and that, from the point of view of the judicial branch of government, is the end of the matter. But it is not the end of the matter for the legislature, because the Boral decision has important policy consequences which the parliament must address.
In the first place, it gives section 46 a narrower range of operation than many people, in both the trade practices community and the commercial community, had hitherto thought to be the case. In particular, it means that section 46 does not prohibit the type of conduct in which Boral was engaged—that is, predatory pricing for the advertent purpose of forcing a smaller competitor out of the market—where the predator can claim that it was itself responding to competitive pressures. Yet if a large firm can engage in conduct of that kind, and for that purpose, it is difficult to see much scope for the operation of section 46 in prohibiting price predation. This is one of the unfortunate consequences of artificially isolating the question of whether prohibited conduct has been engaged in from the question of whether market power exists. 
It certainly gives the Australian law a markedly narrower operation than that recognised in the American antitrust jurisprudence developed under section 2 of the Sherman Act. I must say that I share the robust view of the two most distinguished American commentators, Professor Areeda and Professor Turner, who say simply:
A firm which drives out or excludes rivals by selling at unremunerative prices is not competing on the merits, but engaging in behaviour that may properly be called predatory.
A second consequence of the decision is that it tends to defeat the point of the amendment made to section 46 by the Trade Practices Revision Act 1986. That act altered the threshold for the operation of section 46 from a case where a corporation was `in a position substantially to control a market' to the present requirement that the corporation have a `substantial degree of power in a market'. As the then Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, said in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives on 19 March 1986, the purpose for which the amendment was made was to make clear that:
As well as monopolists, section 46 will now apply to major participants in an oligopolistic market and in some cases, to a leading firm in a less concentrated market.
Mr Bowen also made it perfectly clear that the amendment was being made:
... to ensure that small businesses are given a measure of protection from the predatory actions of powerful competitors.
Now, I appreciate that Mr Bowen's words are parliamentary language, not scholarly analysis or judicial exegesis. But the second reading speech does reveal, plainly enough, that parliament did intend section 46 in its current form to be operative at a lower threshold of economic power than the conduct of a dominant firm. It also, as it seems to me, declared that the measure was in some sense intended to be protective of the interests of small firms. That is a legislative objective which the courts ought to have regard to and which, I must say, the High Court signally failed to acknowledge in Boral.
Thirdly, the case raises a more fundamental issue about part IV of the Trade Practices Act. Is its purpose merely to prohibit the misuse of market power, or should its operation extend, more broadly, to prohibiting the abuse of economic power? I have always been of the latter view. So has the Howard government, which has used part IV as a vehicle to protect both firms and the public against the abuse of economic power by sections 45D and 45E. The circumstances in which those sections operate has nothing to do with market behaviour but everything to do with economic power.
Finally, I cannot let the opportunity pass to respond to some abrasive comments made by Mr Terry McCrann, denouncing my criticism of the Boral decision. Amazingly, Mr McCrann thought that the Boral case was not about predatory pricing. I can only assume that he had not read it. To this day, I shake my head in wonderment that a commentator could rush into print and be so totally, comprehensively and embarrassingly wrong. Perhaps it is a salutary reminder that, when it comes to complex issues of law, people like Mr McCrann would be safer to follow Gilbert and Sullivan's advice to the House of Lords and should `not itch to interfere in matters which they do not understand'.
But I am indebted to Mr McCrann for— no doubt unintentionally—giving the public debate about reform of section 46 a robust acceleration. I look forward to the government's response.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Small Business: Predatory Pricing</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-26,"—I indicated to Senator Evans that I had some further information on a question he asked yesterday. In relation to the question he asked today, I will read the relevant part:
There have been no reported communications problems between our F/A-18s and either coalition partners' aircraft or ground systems. Compatibility between systems has not been raised as an issue.
I seek leave to incorporate the rest of the answer that I have.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Does the Minister have any information on whether the RAF Tornado aircraft deployed to the Gulf are fitted with identification friend or foe (IFF) systems that are fully compatible with US systems?
As a prerequisite for participating in the operation, all coalition aircraft have IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) equipment that enables other units, both ground and air, to identify them as friendly. The RAF Tornados are no different. The incident that caused the RAF Tornado to be shot down could have been caused by a number of factors and this remains the subject of an inquiry about which it would be inappropriate to comment further.
Can the Minister provide an assurance that our F/A-18s have all necessary equipment to prevent such a horrific accident.
Our F/A-18s have the most modern IFF equipment that is compatible with all other coalition partners, including US ground-air missile systems such as Patriot. There are also operational procedures that can be followed in the case that this equipment becomes faulty during a sortie. In addition to compatible IFF equipment, our F/A-18s have the ability to interrogate other aircraft's IFF and determine whether they are “squawking” the correct IFF codes. Our F/A-18s are one of the few aircraft in the Gulf with this capability and therefore provide an added degree of safety for themselves and for other aircraft in the vicinity. Our F/A-18 aircraft have the best equipment and training available and that will minimise the risk of friendly fire accidents.
Can the Minister provide an assurance to the Australian community that IFF capability fitted to the F/A-18s is 100% compatible with the US missile defence systems?
The F/A-18 IFF system is completely compatible with the US missile defence systems.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-03-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
It has been less than a week since we invaded Iraq, and in that period it is fair to say that we are already facing a humanitarian crisis of major proportions. It has been less than a week and already we can see the impact in some of the consequences of this invasion. It is obviously too early to make finite judgments, but I think we can draw some early conclusions and try to learn from them. Firstly, we can say that this war is going to be longer and harder than the optimists in the US administration and in this government were telling the world it would be; secondly, we can see that resistance within Iraq is going to be stronger than these same people expected; and, thirdly, already we can see that the humanitarian consequences are grave, will become graver and could turn out to be a disaster. 
We can also see that, from this country's perspective, this government has not been adequately prepared for the hard war and is particularly ill prepared for the humanitarian problems its actions are creating. For instance, it is still working out who is running what. It is still working out who will be running the relief programs after this war is over. Operational details are still being bashed out. This first week's experience also alerts us to one major problem that has not been factored into this government's thinking or the thinking of the US administration—a problem that is on the horizon and a problem that could very well be with us for a long time. The fundamental question that needs to be addressed by this government, by the coalition and probably, in turn, by the global community is how the coalition will administer the regime change—a change which must now be seen as being more difficult to achieve and to maintain.
There is much greater resistance than the government expected. They expected that by now there would be some welcoming of the coalition forces. That has not happened. This greater resistance is an omen that this issue will not go away and that administration under a new regime will be much harder than has been factored into the coalition's thinking. We have to note that a coalition will have responsibility under international law to meet the humanitarian needs of all the inhabitants, not just the displaced. An occupying power must also provide security. Those two objectives will be a lot harder because of the signs of resistance shown within Iraq already. The signals are that any takeover of Iraq's administration and any maintenance of a new regime is going to be, as I say, a lot more bloody and repressive than the coalition thought. The coalition went in expecting that the red carpet would have been laid out by now, but it has not been. If there is one, it will be a carpet of blood red. As I say, a new regime will have enormous problems.
—You must have written this before you came in.
—Senator Ferguson shakes his head in disbelief—
—At what you are saying.
—but I think we should fear that what may happen is that we will end up with a new regime in the model that the world is so often used to seeing in South America—one of those repressive regimes that we have seen in El Salvador, Guatemala and those sorts of countries. This coalition did not even heed its own warnings. In 1996 current Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, said:
To have brought the Gulf war into the populous Iraqi capital of Baghdad ... would have put large numbers of Iraqi civilians and hundreds of thousands of our troops at risk of being killed.
That is what Vice President Cheney, as he is now, said just a few years ago. What is this coalition about to do? They are about to do just that. Unfortunately for the coalition, they are not ready to do it. They are outside the gates of Baghdad and they have not got the resources to go in. Some experts predict that it may take them two weeks before they are adequately equipped to go in, to maintain and to achieve what they want. For instance, the United Nations estimates that there could be 10 million civilians, including more than two million refugees and displaced persons, at risk of hunger and disease and in need of immediate assistance.
The dimensions of this problem have not been factored in by this government. Humanitarian problems are one problem. Humanitarian problems in the context of an easy access and easy takeover are one dimension. During a lunchtime briefing in the Parliamentary Library, it was Hugh White who said that we could reasonably expect that this is going to be a lot harder and a lot more difficult to achieve.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-03-26,"—Senator Bolkus conveniently quoted Hugh White when, in fact, there are a number of people who have made significant contributions to assessing the impact of this war on civilians and the length of the war. One thing that Senator Bolkus does not know, having come in here and read his prepared speech, is what resistance the government expected. He is not in a position to know anything of what the coalition of the willing or the government expected, so how can he come in here and make the claims he has made, along with other claims made by him and other members of the Labor Party, that there would be hundreds of thousands of casualties in the first week? I notice Senator Bartlett in the chamber, and I think he may also have suggested that the number of civilian casualties in the first week be up to the hundreds of thousands.
Senator Bolkus chose to quote some of the words that Vice President Dick Cheney used in 1991 about one of the reasons why the coalition did not move further into Baghdad and remove Saddam Hussein at that time. He said: `Because it would put a lot of people at risk'. Mr Deputy President, you and many other people in this chamber know that the technical ability of the weapons that are used in 2003 is simply beyond comparison with that of weapons used in 1991. We know, for instance, that the accuracy of the weapons being used today is far greater.
—They are really good on British jets, aren't they?
—Where are the hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties that you said there were going to be, Senator Carr? They have been so accurate that they are able to target Baghdad, bomb selected targets and still leave the lights, the power, the water and all the essentials for the people who are living in Iraq untouched. For all the bombing that has been done in Baghdad, they have still been able to keep the lights on all the time and keep power connected to the homes of the ordinary civilians. Sewerage and all of the other essential services have not been touched, due to the strategic and technical ability of the weapons that they have to fight Saddam Hussein with.
Senator Bolkus raised a number of issues. He said the coalition was not expecting resistance. Where Senator Bolkus gets his information from I do not know. Some commentators may have said that, but the only people who really know what was expected by the coalition when they made the decision to go into Iraq are those who have had all the intelligence made available to them by the military chiefs of staff who accept that intelligence and analyse it—that is, by those who plan the warfare that is to go ahead.
Senator Bolkus chooses to refuse to believe all the reports where those who are in command of the coalition say that the resistance they are meeting is what was expected and that things are still going to plan. Senator Bolkus does not believe that, because it does not suit his argument. We all know that, whenever a military action like this is undertaken, nobody can plan with certainty for what might eventuate, and so there are always a number of scenarios put in place— sometimes by those who are informed but, more often, by those who are uninformed. Senator Bolkus is one of those who is very ill informed. I am quite sure he has never been briefed by the intelligence agencies, the military chiefs or the people who have some understanding of the situation in Iraq today. We can certainly take most of his remarks with a pinch of salt.
When it comes to humanitarian needs, of course we are concerned. The Australian divers are currently making sure that they can get humanitarian aid through the port to those places where it is needed. I am thinking particularly of Basra and the port areas where the Iraqi forces have mined the entrance, making it impossible for humanitarian assistance to even get to those places. The Australian government has made a concerted effort. It has shiploads of wheat just off the coast, but we simply cannot deliver that humanitarian aid until such time as it is safe for vessels to get into the port. I am very pleased to say that the Australian diving team, which is highly regarded, has made it possible for that to happen very soon.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-03-26,"—I rise to speak about answers given by Senator Hill in question time today. We have heard a lot from Senator Ferguson in the last five minutes about the Iraqi population being unharmed by the acts of aggression of the coalition forces in Iraq. What remains unanswered is what response the government will make to the dire warnings that have been given, by bodies such as the World Health Organisation, about the major humanitarian crisis facing the population of Iraq and, in particular, the town of Basra. 
During the time I have available today, I will put before the Senate some of the facts that have emerged about the crisis looming in the town of Basra. The World Health Organisation, for one, has said that it is worried about the impact that the lack of access to potable and clean water will have on the health situation in Basra. The situation could deteriorate quickly. Dysentery and diphtheria could be major health problems. The WHO says:
In similar situations in Iraq in the past, diarrhoeal disease has accounted for between 25% and 40% of deaths during the acute phase of an emergency, and 80% of deaths in children under the age of two.
Women and children will be the most affected groups. Local employees of the United Nations have expressed particular concern about the city of Basra, where the lack of water that I referred to has raised the spectre of disease for up to 1.7 million residents, especially the 100,000 children under the age of five.
Members of the United Nations relief agencies have said that disease could affect up to tens of thousands of peoples in their homes, hospitals and care institutions, as they attempt to cope and find whatever water they can from the river and other sources. As is well known, the people in Basra are now drinking from the Shatt al-Arab River, which is full of untreated sewage. This is the reason for the serious health implications facing the people of Basra. UNICEF also spoke out about this issue, in its lead role as the agency for water in emergency situations. It said that this is the third day on which Basra has been reported to be without water—and this was two days ago—because of the frequent power cuts that have come about as a consequence of the acts of aggression in the area.
UNICEF spokespeople have said that not only are the population suffering from high rates of malnutrition but, in Basra, there is also the very real possibility of child deaths, not only from the conflict but from the additional effects of diarrhoea and dehydration to which I have referred. We have a most serious situation in Basra. The question that remains is: what is the Howard government doing about this? What is the government's response to the warnings that been provided by organisations such as UNICEF and the World Health Organisation? Given that Australia is one of three—a core element—of the occupying coalition forces in Iraq, we have to ask the government: what is it doing to ensure that full access is made available for international humanitarian organisations to restore safe water supplies to Basra to, hopefully, avert this looming crisis? The onus does fall on the occupying coalition forces in Iraq to meet their obligations to civilians under international humanitarian law.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has stressed that the United Nations is prepared to do all it can to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people. However, he has said that the UN will have only limited capacity to do so until security conditions allow for the safe return of its staff to affected areas. Until such time as this occurs, humanitarian assistance would have to be provided by the United States and its coalition partners, including Australia, in those areas under their control, consistent with their overall responsibility under international law.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-03-26,"—I would like to challenge some of the statements the previous speaker, Senator Kirk, made about Basra. Utterly ill-informed comments were made about Basra, laying the blame upon the coalition forces for the humanitarian crisis now occurring there. The truth of the matter is quite the opposite. What is happening is that the British troops have surrounded Basra, but the Republican Guard, or Saddam Hussein's elite militia, have been intimidating the Shi'ite Muslim community inside Basra—so much so that the British held off going into Basra. The British troops, the coalition troops, were not responsible, despite the previous speaker's assertion that they caused the humanitarian crisis inside Basra—that the water was cut off by them. 
—The British, wasn't it?
—Is that what you are asserting, Senator Carr? Are you asserting that? What you, Senator Carr, and the previous speaker may or may not know is that what is happening in Basra right now is a popular uprising against the Republican forces inside that city, so much so that it has forced the coalition to make it a military target. What that means is they are now going to go into Basra and liberate the Shi'ite Muslims, who have suffered, who have been massacred in the past by the regime, and who are currently being intimidated by the forces within Basra. To blame the coalition troops that stand outside Basra at the moment for any of the problems inside Basra is utter misinformation and mischief at its best.
—Who bombed the pumping station?
—Senator Carr keeps blaming the coalition forces. That has been the tone, for the whole week, from the opposition—twisting and turning, slipping and sliding, ducking and weaving, to make political gain from this war. It is quite legitimate that we should debate this matter. But once a decision was made in the United States, the American Senate passed a resolution supporting their President and their armed forces in their quest. The support was 100 per cent. In the House of Commons in the British parliament, a similar motion received 75 per cent support. There was, of course, the 25 per cent within the Labour ranks of extreme hard Left—the Carmen Lawrences, the Senator Webbers of the House of Commons—who would not support it.
If we proposed a similar motion in the Senate, do you think we would get a majority? The answer is no. That is the tone that the Labor Party bring to Australia's commitment to our armed forces. They are confused. We saw the confusion and the angst of the opposition in regard to this matter boil up when Senator Cook, unrestrained in his temper and rage, exemplified the confusion and the angst in the opposition ranks on this matter. On the Left you have the `no war' position led by Senator Lawrence and Senator Carr—no war at any cost. Forget the war on terror. Forget the protection of Australian citizens. It is no war at any cost. Forget about the liberation of the Iraqi people. On the Right, of course, you have the Senator Forshaws and the Senator Bishops who cannot accept that position. You have an opposition torn and in turmoil.
Time does not permit me to go through just how frustrated, how out of tune, the opposition are. In regard to the polls, they tell us to listen to the Australian people. They say, `If you listened to the Australian people and watched the polls you would not make this decision.' Well, the polls seem to have turned around. And now what are they saying? They are going to pay a very high price for their political opportunism and their desertion of the Australian troops.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-03-26,"—Senator Hill today said that innocent people are not our target. I am sure we all agree with that. Of course innocent people are not the target of anyone in war, and that is certainly the case, but the net result and something which he cannot deny is that the action that is being taken in Iraq at the moment results in innocent people being affected. We are facing a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions in Iraq. Once war began, like everyone else in this place I was hopeful of there being a very `short and sharp' campaign resulting in as few casualties as possible. Unfortunately, and I think it is very unfortunate for all of us but especially the women and children of Iraq, this seems less and less likely.
The people of Iraq are facing a crisis of horrific proportions. Prior to the invasion, 15 million Iraqis out of the 24 million people of that country depended on food rations through the oil for food program for their welfare. Iraq's water and sanitation system was on the verge of collapse because it was dependent on electrical supplies that were crippled during the 1991 air strikes. Eleven years after the Gulf War, it was estimated that one-third of the national power supply was still down and two-thirds of the houses connected to water were connected with untreated water. In cities, trucks that were used to empty the cesspits and septic tanks were no longer being used due to the lack of tyres, batteries and other spare parts; so sewage was flowing back into the homes. Forty per cent of the population of Iraq is under 15 years old and, as such, they are very vulnerable to waterborne and airborne diseases like diarrhoea and chest infections— 
—Respiratory infections.
—Thank you. This was known by all of us prior to the invasion of Iraq, but it is clear that the planning to provide the humanitarian aid was not undertaken. That is not just the view of commentators and politicians; it is certainly the view of aid agencies.
Prior to the invasion, humanitarian aid agencies expressed real concern about the lack of planning and coordination and provision of funds. In early March, agencies said that the US military had only recently given licences to aid agencies to provide humanitarian aid should a war break out. Also, planning for dealing with refugees was, according to Gil Loescher of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, `woefully inadequate' and agencies had tried to start to make contingency plans in countries such as Iran and Jordan.
Over the past two weeks, Senator Hill has regularly said that the principal responsibility for the suffering of the Iraqi people lies with Saddam Hussein. In the context of Senator Hill's comments, I would like to provide the Senate with some of the details of a report that was released in February of this year by the Medical Association for the Prevention of War. This study was called `Our Common Responsibility: The Impact of a New War on Iraqi Children'. It was written by the International Study Team with the intention of providing the international community, including the Security Council, the government of Iraq, and all of us with information that would encourage those entities to take into account the plight of Iraqi children when considering the alternatives to war and the continued weapons inspections. It is devastating for the women and children of Iraq that that advice was not heeded. The report says:
... Iraqi children are still in a significantly worse state than they were before the 1991 Gulf War .. because most of the 13 million Iraqi children are dependent on food distributed by the Government of Iraq, the disruption of this system by war would have a devastating impact on children who already have a high rate of malnutrition. The state of the physical well-being of Iraqi children thus makes them much more vulnerable to war today than they were in 1991.
War has done the children of Iraq no good. We did that in 1991; we knew that then and we have not heeded history. (Time expired)

I thank all my colleagues for doing me the courtesy of granting leave to move this motion. The motion is extensive; that is why we have circulated it, and I hope everyone has a copy. The terms of the motion reflect an agreement made at a meeting of party leaders and whips at lunchtime today. It addresses the fact that the government has a program of legislation that cannot, in any reasonable expectation, be concluded in the hours that we have already set down to meet, particularly as the Senate, quite appropriately, devoted almost all of last week to debating Australia's involvement in the Iraq conflict. We, effectively, have to do two weeks work in one week.
We very quickly reached an agreement with the Australian Labor Party and all the minor parties—the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents—on a program to sit until 10.30 tonight and until approximately midnight tomorrow night to deal with the program of legislation. The motion outlines the bills that the government needs. We have conceded a few that we can do without before Easter. Before giving a number of undertakings which should be on the record, on behalf of the government I thank the Australian Labor Party, the Democrats and the other parties for their cooperation on this. I know that some senators were offended by a press release I issued on the weekend about obstruction. I make it absolutely clear that the press release that I issued was in relation to the negativing of bills. I respect the right of any party in this place to do that, but could they respect my right to feel a little sense of frustration and, dare I say, anger about having bills negatived. We like having our bills voted for. We understand that the Senate will not always do that, and from time to time I will express my frustration at the government's program being stopped because of the Senate voting bills down.
I think it is appropriate to have a robust debate about the Senate's voting patterns on the bills. I in no way intend to reflect on the cooperation we have received from the opposition and other parties in the Senate in terms of getting the program dealt with in a sensible and practical way. The record over the past two or three years certainly has been of parties showing a willingness to cooperate with getting votes on bills. We have got to a stage where we tend to agree on a list of bills that need to be considered and voted upon. We have been able to do that over recent years with cooperation. I genuinely thank the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate and the other leaders and whips for facilitating that. I think we have reached a stage of maturity in this place where, regardless of how we feel about the particular measures on the program, we can at least give the Senate a chance to vote on them. Please forgive me for my frustration when sometimes the votes do not go the way I like. I think we all, as politicians, get upset when the votes do not go the way we like. That is politics.
The government's motion asks us to deal, as a Senate, with a range of bills which we have agreed. There is continuing negotiation over which bills can be considered during the Thursday lunchtime timeslot, which has become known as the non-controversial legislation timeslot. As has occurred in the past, if parties believe that some of those bills we are putting forward do need amendments or are controversial, then of course they will come out of that timeslot. This motion will not interfere with that.
Secondly, the government's intention is that the Senate will adjourn prior to midnight tomorrow night. I think it is actually quite doable. It is quite possible that we could adjourn quite a lot prior to midnight tomorrow night. For the sake of all of our health and the quality of the decision making that gets done, it would be desirable to move the program along and get out of here. I have put the outer limit at sitting until midnight. The downside, however, is that, if we have not finished by midnight and there is still a chunk of legislation to do, we would have to sit on Friday. Again, it is certainly something I do not want to do and I do not think anyone would want to do if we can avoid it. If, however, it is around midnight tomorrow night and we have a little bit to do, such as half an hour or an hour's work, I think most senators would agree—and I have the agreement of the opposition on this—that we would seek to wrap it up rather than come back to do it on Friday morning. That is the practical approach that the government bring to this. We are keen to conclude the business by midnight tomorrow night and, hopefully, significantly earlier than that. I reiterate my appreciation for the cooperation of all political parties and Independents represented in this place in achieving this agreement.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-03-26,"—The opposition has had negotiations with the government and the minor parties about ensuring that the legislative program of the Senate can be completed within the available hours that have been placed within this motion. I suspect that, with the cooperation of the Senate, which is usually forthcoming, those outstanding pieces of legislation can be dealt with.
Senator Ian Campbell made some additional remarks about the legislative program. Senator Ian Campbell can of course get a little bit irate about the opposition rejecting the bills on the program, but it should be borne in mind that that is by far the least usual action that is taken. My examination of statistics reveals that in fact bills rejected, as a percentage of bills considered from about 1996 to 2002, make up about two per cent, so perhaps Senator Campbell might be crying crocodile tears in relation to that issue. The percentage of bills referred, as an overall percentage, is about 33 per cent. Of that, there are not a significant number of bills that actually are referred, so I am not sure whether the view Senator Ian Campbell has adopted in relation to the matter of committees being overburdened is particularly accurate either.
In terms of bills rejected since 1996, you are only looking at something in the order of 27. What we do from the opposition's perspective is take a hard look at the policy behind the bill and some of the issues. If it is a bad policy, we will reject it rather than amend it. In most instances, the opposition will seek to amend it and these bills generally do pass. It is worth also noting the comments made about the reference of bills in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures in December 1988. Senator Ian Campbell might be concerned about the number of references that are made, but back then it was said:
The reference of bills to committees was envisaged as an essential part of the committees system established by the Senate in 1970.
I use the 1988 date because it is helpful to put it in perspective. It is still current, even if it was some time ago. The report also said:
When bills have been referred to committee in the past, results have been recognised as an improvement in the legislative process in that they have led to more effective legislation.
What the report also went on to say—which is the point that Senator Ian Campbell has, I think, missed in the debate; in fact he may have reversed it by accident, and I felt it was my duty to set that straight—was:
Moreover, governments appear to consider that the passage of legislation through the Senate is an unnecessarily protracted and painful process.
That seems to be the point Senator Ian Campbell has made. The report goes on to say:
There is often a large backlog of legislation in the Senate at the end of each period of sitting, a matter to which the committee was required to give its attention. Although this is usually regarded as a result of slowness on the part of the government and the Public Service in introducing legislation, there can be no doubt that it creates a government perception of dilatoriness on the part of the Senate in dealing with legislation.
It might be worthwhile also looking at your side of the argument; this is what the government said back in 1988. So it might be worthwhile looking at your own history to examine these reasons as well. The report also went on to say:
The supposed conflict between more thorough examination of legislation and expeditious enactment of government policy may be an imagined problem rather than a real one. The effect of examination of legislation and the greater expedition in legislating may be perfectly compatible goals. Intensive committee consideration of bills may help by revealing defects in proposed legislation. The consideration of bills by a number of committees may also speed up the overall legislative process because, while the consideration of each individual bill may be extended, a number of bills can be considered simultaneously. 
I invite Senator Ian Campbell to reflect on those remarks. Whilst he might feel aggrieved, he should complain only about those issues which deserve to be complained about. With respect, I think that the issues he has raised are without substance and that there is no complaint to be made.
I do have a complaint that has some substance and it would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to raise it. There are in the order of 21 failures by this government to respond to orders of the Senate. I have not had time to check whether that is a record, but this government has consistently and for a long period failed to respond to production of documents orders. On page 31 of the Notice Paper for today it sets out those 21 failures that I have referred to. These orders originate not only from the concerns of opposition senators but from senators from the minor parties as well. I took the opportunity of raising this with the government some time ago, and I think Senator Ian Campbell was in the room when I raised that the last time. This time I would like to impress upon Senator Ian Campbell that we are running short of patience in having those matters dealt with.
We are now going into an extended period where the government can take the opportunity to have those 21 failures addressed. I sincerely expect that the government will take that time to address those 21 failures and come back in May with 21 fulsome and accurate answers for those 21 outstanding orders. I am sure that the senators opposite do not need to be reminded that there are considerable procedural options. Unfortunately, we are now eating up government time to explain why this government has failed to properly ensure that the orders are met and that the production of documents and Senate procedures are adhered to. With due respect, Senator Ian Campbell, I think it is perhaps best not to complain about matters which do not have substance.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-26,"—I will not take too long, otherwise we will be chewing up more time than we would be saving by agreeing to motions like these, but I do think a couple of points need to put on the record. I would not necessarily say that the Democrats support this motion and these changes, but we are not going to oppose them. I think sitting late on a Wednesday night is particularly unfortunate. Whilst I have not been around this place as long as some, my experience has been that, in terms of extending sitting hours, Wednesday nights used to be seen as almost untouchable and were used only in very extreme circumstances. That convention seems to have declined in recent times because we have extended sitting hours on a Wednesday night a few times in the last year or so. That is unfortunate because you like to be able to rely on at least some consistency if you are accepting invitations for events or whatever. It is also unfortunate in terms of the health impacts of overwork on staff and senators— though I do not suppose that anyone cares about senators other than senators themselves. So I think this extension is a bit unfortunate and make a gentle suggestion that the minister, in thinking of these things in the future, might look at options other than extending Wednesday night sittings.
The Democrats always accept that there will be times when the government needs to extend hours to get legislation through, but, as I have said many times before when extensions of sitting hours have been proposed, the real problem is that the government is not providing an adequate number of sitting days. Last year we had the lowest number of sitting days in a non-election year for some decades; this year is the second lowest number of sitting days. That really is an inadequate number of sitting days to deal with the legislation, particularly given that the number of bills we deal with these days is much greater than it was in the past and we also have a more extensive committee system which actually adds to the workload.
I want to mention the statements made by Senator Ian Campbell not only today but also in a press release which he put out over the weekend. I understand the political reality of people wanting to make political points and create public perception. I am sure that the well-informed people we are blessed with in the press gallery here would not, for a second, fall for Senator Ian Campbell's spin. The suggestion that this Senate is somehow obstructive is one that I am sure our press gallery and media representatives around the nation are smart enough to realise is a complete furphy; nonetheless, this needs to be put on the record—and I think Senator Ludwig has done a good job with that so I will not repeat his words. The fact is that only an incredibly small percentage of bills are rejected by this Senate. In the case of some bills that have come up recently, the Senate has rejected them only because the government is bringing them up specifically to stack up double dissolution triggers. In some of these bills, the government is no longer making an effort to get improvements or consider amendments. 
The aspect of Senator Ian Campbell's statement that probably concerned me the most in some ways was that, beyond the usual tactic of pointing to bills that are opposed and saying, `That is obstructionist,' he quite clearly implied that referring bills to committees is being obstructionist. I think that, if anything, referring bills to committees is a way of trying to save the time of the Senate as a whole by considering issues outside this chamber in the committee process. I find it a very worrying precedent that referring bills to committees is now being perceived as an obstructionist action. I am not going to be completely disingenuous and suggest that that is not an occasional tactic that we all might use—to refer a bill to try to delay consideration of it—but it is not very common. Certainly, from the Democrats' point of view—and, I would suggest, from those of all sides—most of the time it is a genuine concern about the bill and an attempt to use that committee process to get more information to examine those concerns and see whether they are legitimate enough to need to amend the bill or, in extreme circumstances, oppose it. Any fair reading of the record would show that.
The vast bulk of references to committees are not attempts to obstruct the process. They are effective attempts to enhance the process. I am sure that Senator Campbell is not suggesting—although one is worried that people might infer it—that the very effective processes to refer bills that we have now established with the Selection of Bills Committee has worked quite well in a cooperative sense. For very short references people usually accept brief hearings and do not take up extended time except when a bill is particularly complex. That was proven again, just before Senator Campbell rose to speak, with the latest Selection of Bills Committee report. The dates there are fairly short for all of them, except for a private senator's bill—a very good one, I might add—of my own which has a longer date.
Indeed, in Senator Campbell's statistics he says that Labor, the Democrats and others have been the most negative and obstructionist opposition in modern times by referring another 501 bills to committees in the past seven years. To be honest, it is not just Labor, the Democrats and the other crossbenchers; it includes the government. Just today, unless I am completely misreading the signature on the bottom of the referrals, we had two referrals of bills to committees by the government. There are three bills in those two referrals. In effect, Senator Campbell is accusing his own people, his own whip, of being obstructionist today by referring those bills to committees. I think that, if anything, he at least owes Senator Ferris an apology for that slur on her motivation.
The other aspect is that, whilst I can understand the political point of Senator Campbell wanting to say we are being obstructionist by opposing bills, to say that we are uncooperative is not particularly helpful or in his interests when, quite clearly, the only way he gets motions like this through or gets the time he wants to get bills debated is by the cooperation of the Senate. It only takes one of us—as all of us know, to our occasional great frustration—if we really want to buggerise things around, to drag out things virtually indefinitely. Certainly two can literally do it indefinitely without any difficulty at all if they have the stamina. The government gets things through here only because of an enormous amount of cooperation of goodwill. Particularly at a time when a lot of heightened emotions about the conflict in Iraq and a lot of senators being opposed to the war make life extremely difficult for the government, it does not help to go making public statements saying that we are obstructionist, negative and basically uncooperative. I think I have made that point, and Senator Ian Campbell will hopefully take it on board. 
I have two other points. Firstly, I reiterate that the Democrats' view is that, rather than revisiting this sort of thing time and time again, the real answer is to have extra sitting weeks, to get back to the average number of sitting weeks that we used to have some years back—particularly, as I say, given that the number of bills has actually increased, sometimes quite significantly. The fact that we sat for only 63 days last year, three or four of which were condolence days or given to special business, which makes less than 60 days considering legislation, and that from memory we passed about 150 bills—although I might be wrong, but it was certainly more than two a day, on average—suggests that we are doing pretty well at churning through legislation. In fact, it is probably churning through at such great speed that one could suggest it is detrimental to the interests of the Australian people.
I would like to concur also with Senator Ludwig's comments about failures on returns to order, and those are mounting up enormously. I think that is an issue that the non-government parties need to look at a bit more closely in terms of whether we should take more specific action in response to those frequent contempts of the Senate. I know another one is due at four o'clock today. I do not know whether that order is going to be complied with or not. Obviously it has not been, as it is after four o'clock, but I recognise that that is because I have been speaking. It is an issue that is of growing concern to the Democrats, and certainly I would indicate an interest in discussing with the main opposition party whether there are prospects for taking some action that might indicate our displeasure in a more specific, clear-cut and concrete way that might more openly discourage the government from continuing along that line.
We will not oppose this motion. I hope that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is aware of the discussions that occurred in the leaders' and whips' meeting earlier today about needing to ensure that any crucial votes are not distorted by the absence of Independents, particularly. I have no doubt that it is not the government's intention, but we need to ensure, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate does his very difficult job of juggling all the legislation with a range of ministers all lining up to twist his arm in different directions, that we do not have one of those contentious votes that does not reflect the genuine will of the Senate because of an absence due to this unanticipated extension of sitting hours, at very short notice.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-03-26,"—I will be very brief. I ask for the Senate's indulgence to spare a thought for the Independents. For example, today I was up at 6.15 a.m., and my first meeting here was at 7.30 a.m. I had a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee meeting at 8.30 a.m., and then another meeting at 10 o'clock. That is not counting the representations that were fitted in, and listening to the various debates. I had another meeting at 12.15 p.m., and another at one o'clock. It is difficult as an Independent. I am concerned about the extension of hours and the pressures that that puts on our staff in particular, let alone us, as Senator Bartlett said. Nobody worries about us! But consideration for the staff is important. They do an extraordinary job under difficult circumstances, because we have to get through every piece of legislation. When hours are extended, if you are not there, somebody on staff is there monitoring what is going on.
I most wanted to raise my concern about the logjam. Always at this time—and also just before Christmas—there is a logjam of bills. There is a need to get those bills attended to, but I am concerned that this could react against proper consideration of legislation. For example, the medical indemnity matter is going to seriously affect the medical profession in my state of Tasmania, but I am more concerned about the patients. It is going to seriously affect patients in my state. If ever there was a measure that called for a committee reference, that is one. Yet the government goes to the opposition and says, `Unless we get this through today or tomorrow, there will be a great deal of problems. It has to come in on 30 June, and we won't have time to make the arrangements.' I question that, but I do believe that it is unfortunate that the opposition have caved in on this—I thought that they would not. They were going to support the reference, which is absolutely essential. I regret that these circumstances all combine to put pressure on the opposition to just let it through, irrespective of the damage that is done. I do not intend to make a deal of this, or oppose the measure if it is now agreed upon all round, but I do ask that consideration be given to the matter that I raise in respect of staff, particularly the staff of Independent senators. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-03-26,"—I think we should be sitting an extra week, but we are not. I have been speaking with the government and the opposition about the allocation—which the opposition very kindly gave to me—for private members' time tomorrow to discuss the very important Constitution amendment bill that I have before the Senate to allow for a referendum to change the Constitution so that the five million or so Australians who currently cannot stand for parliament without resigning their jobs would be able to do so. I think we have been able to come to a happy arrangement whereby the bill will not be debated tomorrow but in May—I will speak with Senator Faulkner about that when we next sit—with the intention that it be brought to a third reading vote so that there is a vote on the matter by the Senate. In turn, that makes me very content, and I hope it will expedite matters tomorrow so that the debate will not go quite as late as it otherwise would.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-03-26,"—I would like to briefly reiterate what has been said with regard to the available time and the pressures that are on people. I think that in terms of the Senate's operation it is not good that we have consistently reduced the number of sitting days each year. I am not speaking just from an Independent's point of view; it is not good from a government point of view of dealing with the legislation this place has to deal with. We have a very hefty amount of committee work and, in dealing with some of the issues that come before committees—whether in the form of legislation or a reference—it is very difficult to give justice to the concerns that the public have when we are running on such a tight time frame.
Then we get into a situation where we try and jam a significant number of bills into a very limited number of hours. I just do not think that does justice to the parliament. The people expect the parliament to do its work and do that work well. I suggest that the number of sitting days is something we have got to really look hard at for the future. Frankly, we ought to be sitting for longer periods of time. We have a significant break coming up, and there is no reason why we could not have included an additional period of sitting within that time. When we get to the end of each year we are adding on a day here or a day there, which seems ridiculous when there are significant periods of time throughout the year when we do not sit at all and do not deal with any legislation. The public have a right to expect that we use some of that time to give appropriate consideration and deliberation to the task we are expected to do.
Senator Harradine raised the issue about the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002. I have not had the opportunity to look at it in detail, but I am concerned about the fact that it was supposedly going to be referred to a committee. There is a significant impact in Tasmania—potentially a very significant impact—so it is something that ought to have been referred to a committee. There is a way in which it can be done that might take up considerable time of this Senate. I say to the government that maybe it is something that they might consider for the future if they do not want to see efforts being made to take up the time of this place to a greater extent in endeavouring to give proper consideration to these things from a public point of view.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-26,"—I want to make two points in response to some of the points that have been made. I firstly thank all honourable senators for agreeing to the motion and for the advice that I have been proffered as well on the management of the Senate. Firstly, the logjam that was referred to in Senator Ludwig's reference to the 1988 committee has become a feature of Senate deliberations. But in fact, if you look at the program we are debating right now, it is one of the more reasonable programs that we have ever seen. In terms of logjams, there are not many logs in it—it is quite reasonable. The medical indemnity bill was considered by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the committee unanimously decided not to refer it. 
—Selection of Bills Committee.
—Selection of Bills Committee—an excellent committee, with extraordinary members on it.
—Senator Chapman is keen to introduce a report and he is provoking me to give a full 10-minute reply to all of the wonderful points that were made. If you interject, I am just going to keep going.
—You're wasting your own time here.
—No. To finish on Senator Murphy's point, if the will of the chamber was to refer that bill, it would have been referred, but it was not—the will of the chamber was not to refer that bill. As Senator Bartlett and, I think, Senator Ludwig have said, 33 per cent of bills are being referred to committees. That is a very high percentage historically—significantly higher than under the previous governments. But I do agree with Senator Bartlett in many respects. Many committee references do allow the parliament to create better legislation, but even Senator Bartlett did admit that some references are motivated as a way of delaying the bill for political reasons. Certainly bills that have been to committees and through the parliament once already and then get referred back to committees to delay their consideration until the next period of sittings, I think, can be an abuse of the system. I think even Senator Bartlett has agreed that there are abuses. I am happy for there to be a debate about it. I am happy to provoke a debate about it, but I am a great supporter of the Senate having sound and adequate scrutiny of legislation. As a member of the opposition prior to the 1996 election, I did involve myself in references.
—Yes, you did, on many occasions.
—Yes. But history will show that generally, when this party was in opposition, most legislative references occurred through the Selection of Bills Committee process. The committee would sit on a Friday, take evidence on the bill, and report back on the following Monday or Tuesday. Practice has evolved—that is not the normal process now. The length of the references was a lot shorter and the number of bills referred was much lower.
In relation to comments about sitting days and sitting weeks, I am happy to incorporate the statistics—I think I have done that already. The parliamentary sitting pattern, going all the way back to 1977, shows again that this year is an entirely normal sitting year. Last year was an entirely abnormal year. We sat about a week later because of the election and we had the sittings truncated because Australia hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which is something we do once in probably every quarter of a century. It was decided—I think by all parties—that it would be inappropriate for the parliament to be sitting while that meeting was going on. It was an unusually short year and that did create a pressure on the program which is unusual. But this year, if you look at the statistics, in terms of the number of sitting weeks and the number of sitting days, you will see that it is an entirely normal schedule.
What creates the biggest pressure in terms of a legislative logjam at the end of a session is that at the beginning of a session the Senate—because it is the master of its own destiny in these things—tends to devote a lot of time to some bills. That is entirely its will. Last year or the year before—Senator Brown would remember—we had a very long debate about the RFA legislation. I suspect we spent two or three sitting weeks on one bill and then we had about 40 bills to consider. 
—I might be wrong. I am just giving that as a very broad example—I do not have the stats in front of me. But the Senate can decide to devote two or three weeks, as we did for the native title legislation—and Senator Minchin is here with me at the moment—which senators had a deep, passionate interest in for all sorts of reasons. I think we devoted something like 65 sitting hours, which is the equivalent of five sitting weeks, to one bill. The Senate can do that—it is within the gift of the Senate as to what speed it handles legislation— but, if you handle one bill over five or six sitting weeks, that will leave only a few sitting days to do all the rest. As a group of people, we basically have to decide how much time we give to each piece of legislation. My experience is that, if you provide extra sitting days, it does not—
—I am getting the wind-up from my friendly Opposition Whip, and it is quite an appropriate wind-up. But these points do need to be made because there are misconceptions about what creates legislative logjams. It really is in the hands of the Senate to reduce the logjam. I accept criticism that on occasions ministers and the bureaucrats, dare I say, and the House of Representatives tend to give us legislation towards the end of the program. But I do make the point, and I think it has been accepted, that the way that the Senate has performed in the last couple of years is a significant improvement on the years before that. There is much better coordination and there is much better—and I reiterate this—cooperation in terms of handling the program in the Senate. I repeat what I have said today and on previous occasions: the cooperation of the Australian Labor Party, the Greens, the Democrats and Independent senators in allowing this flexible approach at the end of sessions has created a considerable improvement which is appreciated by the government, although I reserve my right to retain my frustration at the number of bills that get negatived while respecting the democratic right of senators to vote against our bills.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,18,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-03-26,"—I present the third report of 2003 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 4 of 2003, dated 26 March 2003. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In the interests of accommodating the government's timing problems, I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard. I encourage senators—ministers in particular—to take the opportunity to have a look at that statement, especially the issues to do with the short title of bills that are canvassed in the report and in particular the use of numbers to identify bills. I think that issue has concerned our committee for some time and we would like some ministers, especially ministers to do with taxation matters, to have a look at that. I would also like to bring to the attention of the Senate that in the Alert Digest of this week the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No.2] is addressed. 
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The committee's Third Report of 2003 which I have just tabled advises that the committee will write to the Attorney-General and to the First Parliamentary Counsel about the short titles of bills, in relation to which the committee has noted some possible problems.
The committee is particularly concerned about bills with sequential numbers in their title whose passage overlaps two or more calendar years of a session. The committee has observed that the present arrangements for the re-titling of such bills might not be the optimum outcome, resulting in a lack of clarity and transparency which has at least the potential to confuse Senators and the public.
One instance of these difficulties is the eight taxation laws amendment bills introduced in 2002, each of which was differentiated only by a sequential number. The last three of these bills did not pass in that year, so the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2003, introduced early in 2003, suggests that it is the fourth bill for that purpose introduced this year and not the first. In addition, the bill refers to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 2003, although no bill for an act with that title is before the Parliament. The bill in question was in fact the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002. In these circumstances it is easy to see how the public might find it a problem to track the course of a bill.  
The committee initially wrote about these matters to the Treasurer, who asked the Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan, to respond. The Minister replied promptly, advising quite reasonably that everything was in accordance with normal practice. The committee, however, has decided that it may be possible to improve this practice.
The present arrangements are that government bills introduced into either House but not passed in the same year are amended by the Chairman's amendment procedures to replace references to the previous year with references to the present year. The amendments also include any consequential changes advised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and, importantly from the point of view of the present exercise, any necessary sequential re-numbering of bills.
These arrangements nevertheless result in a lack of certainty and transparency which may perplex both Senators and those people affected by the bills. One problem is that at present, unless there is an another print of the bill such as a third reading print, the new title of a bill including a sequential number might not be in the public domain until the bill receives Royal Assent. The situation is particularly unsatisfactory in relation to bills which might not be passed until months into the new year.
The committee has therefore written to the Attorney-General and to the First Parliamentary Counsel, suggesting that the problem might be alleviated by the greater use of descriptor or explanatory words in parentheses in the titles of bills. The committee asked whether it would be possible to include explanatory words in the titles of more bills whose passage may overlap more than one year and which have the same title numbered in sequence. The change of year and any consequential amendments could continue, as at present, to be the subject of Chairman's amendments.
The committee will report again after it has considered the replies to these letters.
The committee would also like to draw attention to one of the indicators of its effectiveness, which is the number of amendments made or other action taken in response to its comments. The can be illustrated best by several brief examples.
The committee's scrutiny of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] identified a number of provisions which may have breached its principles. These include absolute liability, strict liability and the creation of criminal liability by declaration. In this instance the committee decided that the issues were significant enough to justify a briefing by the Attorney-General's Department on this and related bills, which were a package intended to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities. Following the briefing, advice from the Attorney-General and a report by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the committee reported that it continued to draw Senator's attention to the provisions, which may breach personal liberties. Subsequently, the Senate amended the bill to remove the provisions which the committee had identified, illustrating the Chamber acting in relation to matters commented upon by the committee.
The committee has often reported on deficiencies in Explanatory Memoranda and has recently written to the Minister responsible for the Legislation Handbook, asking whether it would be possible to issue a special Legislation Circular setting out the requirements in this area. For instance, the Explanatory Memorandum for the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 2002 was so defective that the committee suggested it would be advantageous to table an additional Explanatory Memorandum including all necessary information. The Minister advised that he would be happy to do this, which is a welcome instance of a Minister acting to meet the concerns of the committee.
In total, during the last 12 months action has been taken in relation to 10 bills to improve aspects of personal liberties or parliamentary propriety identified by the committee. This is quite encouraging and the committee will continue to monitor and report on this important aspect of its activities.

I think that issue has concerned our committee for some time and we would like some ministers, especially ministers to do with taxation matters, to have a look at that. I would also like to bring to the attention of the Senate that in the Alert Digest of this week the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No.2] is addressed. 
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The committee's Third Report of 2003 which I have just tabled advises that the committee will write to the Attorney-General and to the First Parliamentary Counsel about the short titles of bills, in relation to which the committee has noted some possible problems.
The committee is particularly concerned about bills with sequential numbers in their title whose passage overlaps two or more calendar years of a session. The committee has observed that the present arrangements for the re-titling of such bills might not be the optimum outcome, resulting in a lack of clarity and transparency which has at least the potential to confuse Senators and the public.
One instance of these difficulties is the eight taxation laws amendment bills introduced in 2002, each of which was differentiated only by a sequential number. The last three of these bills did not pass in that year, so the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2003, introduced early in 2003, suggests that it is the fourth bill for that purpose introduced this year and not the first. In addition, the bill refers to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 2003, although no bill for an act with that title is before the Parliament. The bill in question was in fact the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002. In these circumstances it is easy to see how the public might find it a problem to track the course of a bill.  
The committee initially wrote about these matters to the Treasurer, who asked the Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan, to respond. The Minister replied promptly, advising quite reasonably that everything was in accordance with normal practice. The committee, however, has decided that it may be possible to improve this practice.
The present arrangements are that government bills introduced into either House but not passed in the same year are amended by the Chairman's amendment procedures to replace references to the previous year with references to the present year. The amendments also include any consequential changes advised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and, importantly from the point of view of the present exercise, any necessary sequential re-numbering of bills.
These arrangements nevertheless result in a lack of certainty and transparency which may perplex both Senators and those people affected by the bills. One problem is that at present, unless there is an another print of the bill such as a third reading print, the new title of a bill including a sequential number might not be in the public domain until the bill receives Royal Assent. The situation is particularly unsatisfactory in relation to bills which might not be passed until months into the new year.
The committee has therefore written to the Attorney-General and to the First Parliamentary Counsel, suggesting that the problem might be alleviated by the greater use of descriptor or explanatory words in parentheses in the titles of bills. The committee asked whether it would be possible to include explanatory words in the titles of more bills whose passage may overlap more than one year and which have the same title numbered in sequence. The change of year and any consequential amendments could continue, as at present, to be the subject of Chairman's amendments.
The committee will report again after it has considered the replies to these letters.
The committee would also like to draw attention to one of the indicators of its effectiveness, which is the number of amendments made or other action taken in response to its comments. The can be illustrated best by several brief examples.
The committee's scrutiny of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] identified a number of provisions which may have breached its principles. These include absolute liability, strict liability and the creation of criminal liability by declaration. In this instance the committee decided that the issues were significant enough to justify a briefing by the Attorney-General's Department on this and related bills, which were a package intended to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities. Following the briefing, advice from the Attorney-General and a report by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the committee reported that it continued to draw Senator's attention to the provisions, which may breach personal liberties. Subsequently, the Senate amended the bill to remove the provisions which the committee had identified, illustrating the Chamber acting in relation to matters commented upon by the committee.
The committee has often reported on deficiencies in Explanatory Memoranda and has recently written to the Minister responsible for the Legislation Handbook, asking whether it would be possible to issue a special Legislation Circular setting out the requirements in this area. For instance, the Explanatory Memorandum for the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 2002 was so defective that the committee suggested it would be advantageous to table an additional Explanatory Memorandum including all necessary information. The Minister advised that he would be happy to do this, which is a welcome instance of a Minister acting to meet the concerns of the committee.
In total, during the last 12 months action has been taken in relation to 10 bills to improve aspects of personal liberties or parliamentary propriety identified by the committee. This is quite encouraging and the committee will continue to monitor and report on this important aspect of its activities.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-03-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
I rise to make a few remarks about the tabling of the first report of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, and I understand another will be tabled tomorrow. Australians are people of commonsense. They know the building industry is tough and that it probably has more than its fair share of undesirable characters. It is commonly understood that cash payments and tax evasion are rife in the industry and that that presents many opportunities for money laundering. Anyone involved in supplying the industry with products or services knows how difficult it can be to get paid, whether you are a small business owner or an employee. Indeed, it is probably the industry that presents the most examples of so-called phoenix companies, where businesses are placed into insolvency to avoid obligations to workers—such as their pay and conditions and superannuation—and small business creditors, only to rise from the ashes in another guise shortly afterwards. Australians also know that in some areas there is a widespread use of illegal immigrant labour, with associated safety problems, and Australians are understandably deeply disturbed by horrific accidents that all too frequently still occur in this industry. On average, one worker is killed every week in the building industry in Australia.
For $60 million—that is the cost of this royal commission—Australians are entitled to expect that these issues would have been addressed in some detail in the report. From reading the first instalment today they would be very disappointed, if not astonished. This first instalment reveals a staggering statistic: almost nine out of 10 of the royal commission's specific findings of unlawful conduct are against workers and unionists. By contrast, approximately just one out of 10 concerns employers. It beggars belief that any fair and balanced inquiry into the building industry could decide that workers and unionists are responsible for approximately nine out of 10 findings of unlawful conduct in this industry. Yet, when you add up the specific findings, that is exactly what this inquiry suggests. 
As I mentioned, this is an industry in which a life is lost to workplace accidents almost every week. Yet this report makes only two specific findings of breaches of health and safety laws by employers. Incredibly, there is not a single specific finding of unlawful conduct relating to underpayment of workers' entitlements, debts to small business, avoidance of tax, sham subcontracting or phoenix company restructuring in the building industry. There was not a single specific finding on these areas of widespread abuse in this industry.
As I said earlier, Australians know the building industry is a tough industry, and they expect their government to be an appropriate regulator—not an agitator or provocateur. Fair-minded Australians would cringe at some of the behaviour that occurs on both sides of this industry, and I think they recognise that the industry would be far worse if there was no union presence at all. At the end of the day, Australians recognise an effective and decent union presence can be a civilising influence in respect of fairness, accountability and safety. Insofar as there are problems, Australians expect the government to be diligent and genuine, not partisan and political, when inquiring into unlawful conduct in the building industry or, indeed, in any industry.
Australians will be rightly outraged if they think the Liberal Howard government has spent $60 million just to bash building unions while ignoring corporate misbehaviour. The Labor opposition has always said anyone found to have committed illegal or criminal acts must face the law. We stand ready to consider any genuine proposal to address criminality or corruption in this or any industry. But we will not see this report used by the Howard Liberal government as a political tool to advance a divisive industrial relations agenda. Such an agenda is fundamentally shortsighted, and it will not achieve long-term productive outcomes.
Few objective commentators would agree with the minister's statement that this has been a `model royal commission—swift, thorough, efficient and fair'. It is well known that 90 per cent of public hearing time was dedicated to anti-union subjects; indeed, around 81 per cent of the time was spent attacking the CFMEU in particular. Only three per cent of hearing time was occupied with subjects that might have adversely reflected on employers. Just seven hours was spent with a worker in the witness box, while employers or their representatives were in the witness box for around 293 hours—and that was not because there was a shortage of complaints from employees. Counsel assisting took evidence from employers 663 times, but from workers only 34 times. As I emphasised earlier, it was not because there was a shortage of complaints from workers.
Is it any wonder that detailed findings on broader issues confronting the industry are lacking? I appreciate that we are involved in a political debate but I think any fair-minded observer would reach the same conclusion. Whilst on fair-minded observers, I do note comments by that well-known radio broadcaster, Mr Alan Jones, a couple of weeks ago in the Sydney Morning Herald. He said:
It's an enormous waste of public money ...
That is what he said about the $60 million royal commission which investigated corruption in the building industry. He described it as a `cynical political attack on the powerful Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union'. Of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, Mr Jones said he is a:
... good friend ... I've told him to his face 100 times, `Tony, you've simply got it wrong.'
He is not a renowned supporter of the Labor Party or the labour movement, yet here we have a well-known Australian, Mr Jones, accurately describing what has occurred in this case. I note the minister referred to commission evidence and said that some workers in the commercial construction industry can earn $100,000 per year with overtime and allowances. What the minister did not refer to was the fact that the great majority of workers in a dangerous occupation, often in extremely poor conditions, can earn considerably less than $20 per hour.
Talking about wage payments, this royal commission was a real racket. I am sure I can say with confidence that the average Australian would be quite astonished by the legal bill paid from this royal commission. Lawyers were paid $21 million—some of them at the rate of almost $20,000 per week. The minister has the hypocrisy to abuse workers in this dangerous industry who earn a reasonable wage for what is a hard day's work. As for the fairness of this commission, there has been widespread criticism of the procedures adopted by it. A number of potential witnesses who were prepared to give evidence about broader problems facing the industry were overlooked as counsel assisting the commission focused primarily on those who were prepared to attack the building unions. The commissioner himself admits in his report that: 
Some of the material that was led during hearings would not have been admissible in either a civil or a criminal trial. Despite this the opportunity to cross-examine commission witnesses was severely limited even where serious allegations had been made by these witnesses against certain individuals. Anyone wanting to cross-examine was first required to submit their own statement on which they were cross-examined by counsel assisting before a determination was made to allow them to cross-examine.
Quite an incredible process, and I doubt the star chamber even came up with such a procedure as this. The commission was conducted by way of careful selection and filtering of information and, regrettably, it is clear from the report that selection had a predetermined focus to attack building industry unions rather than address broader issues.
My colleague in the other place Mr McClelland gave some examples. At no stage have we excused, or will we excuse, any person that is engaged or has engaged in criminal activity. We should note, however, that it does not take a $60 million inquiry to refer individuals to prosecuting authorities. A 25c phone call would do the trick. As responsible legislators in the 21st century, it is incumbent on us to do something about the fact that there is still one death almost every week on work sites in the building industry, nor can we ignore the extent to which decent tax paying Australians are subsidising massive tax evasion in the building industry. All too little was said, referred to or concluded on in regard to these particular issues in this royal commission report.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Building and Construction Industry: Royal Commission</title>,Ministerial Statements,20,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-26,"—The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry was an expensive one. Today the Senate gets its first look at half, or perhaps a little less than half, of its reports and documents. Some 12 volumes landed on my table this morning. I will get the same number tomorrow, and I am expected to comment on 12 volumes which, added to those arriving tomorrow, will reach nearly a foot high. Frankly, I am not prepared to do so. The reason I am not prepared to do so, in any sense, is quite simply this: we know there will be a contest of wills between the coalition and the Labor Party on this issue. The Labor Party has a close relationship with the unions, as we know. We know that this issue will be quite fiery. We know the opinion of the hard Left will be to support the unions, right or wrong.
Our position is that we are neither beholden to business nor unions. We will evaluate the issue on its merits. We will end up perhaps being in the middle, when we look at the legislation that will result from this. We will need time to evaluate those reports fully and we will take weeks rather than days to do so. If there is anyone in the media who is going to try to push me into a position of commenting on this in any depth right now, they are going to get nowhere— and I hope they get that message.
The things I want to say, while I have the call, are those that are immediately apparent before us. The first is that one thing the Australian Democrats will not agree to is any attempt, hint or effort to deregister the unions concerned. We take the view that, if there is malfeasance in the industry, it will not be union wide or business wide. We further take the view that the role and participation of the unions and employer organisations in that industry are absolutely vital and essential to the health of that industry.
The second thing is that we thoroughly agree with Mr Beattie's remarks, as reported by AAP. My own remarks in my statement issued today were:
We are pleased that instances of criminal behaviour will be investigated for potential prosecution. It is important that these allegations be resolved in our justice system beyond reasonable doubt. 
Mr Beattie, Premier of Queensland, said the same thing. He is reported as saying:
But at the end of the day we don't support anyone breaking the law. If people break the law they should feel the full force of the law.
Mr Reynolds, the CFMEU Secretary in Western Australia, said, quite succinctly, in his usual style:
... let them get on and charge us. Put up or shut up.
That is as he was reported and that is how it should be. Frankly, if there are going to be allegations of criminality, let us get on with the prosecution and have it tested at law, beyond reasonable doubt, so that we can put aside allegations that such things are not dealt with, that they are widespread or that they pose great difficulties.
I want to move on to some of the criticisms enunciated by Labor. They are quite clear on the face of it: it has been a very expensive commission, it has focused most of its time and effort on the unions and it has been criticised for some of its processes. I am not in a position now where I can comment on that in any great depth, but I can say that in the end we will have to consider not what the royal commission has said but what the government's response will be—what the legislative response will be—and how we should react to that based on the evidence, the findings and the recommendations of the Cole royal commission. For us to take any position on those recommendations—and I do not even know what they are, frankly— right now would be very difficult.
The Cole royal commission has, according to the statement by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, found 392 separate instances of unlawful conduct: 230 of them in my state of Western Australia, 58 in Victoria, 55 in Queensland, 25 in New South Wales and 13 in Tasmania. So the figure is pretty low in New South Wales, relative to the size of the industry, and quite large in my own state, relative to the size of the industry. The Cole report is apparently likely to recommend a national authority to enforce the law, and that will be a key thing to look at. It will recommend a specialist tribunal, and we will have to have a look at that. It will recommend an industry restructure, and that, too, will require careful study. The Cole report is likely to recommend an increase in the powers of an interim building task force. That, too, will deserve analysis. In any situation of regulation, it is appropriate to target any industry or any circumstance where it is believed that there are problems which require constant oversight. My problem with it would be, automatically, if it were ever biased and not examining employers with the same vigour with which it examines employees' organisations. The inquiry has been categorised as a witch-hunt. It obviously has a particular motivation from the coalition's point of view, but the outcome will end up being determined by the Senate of Australia, which represents all the people of Australia and which will judge the matters on their merits at that time.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Building and Construction Industry: Royal Commission</title>,Ministerial Statements,20,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-03-26,"—We have known all along that this royal commission was set up by the government as an opportunity to have a go at trade unions in the lead-up to the last federal election, when this government was looking for a leg-up and was in a tight spot. Journalist Jim Marr commented:
It was set up not as an inquiry but as a prosecution of a single party within the industry.
Eighty-one per cent of public hearing time was devoted to attacking one particular trade union. Not one statement was obtained by investigators and presented to the commission that presented unions in a positive light. From the outset, Murdoch newspapers such as the Australian wrote:
Is the royal commission a political stunt? Yes.
Journalist Ashley Crossland said:
It's as if someone devised the perfect mechanism for destroying the public standing of building unions. Unfortunately, the Cole royal commission may also end up the perfect mechanism for destroying the already threadbare authority of royal commissions.
A US study found that productivity for unionised contractors compared with non-unionised contractors was 30 per cent higher for commercial buildings, which is what this royal commission focused on.
The greatest impediments to an increase in productivity growth in the Australian construction industry are a falling level of employer investment in training and the proliferation of small undercapitalised businesses. This proliferation results in companies going bust and being unable to pay workers' entitlements. They then often re-emerge as another company with the same work force. The Cole royal commission investigators failed to come up with one witness statement alleging these phoenix operations anywhere in New South Wales. The Australian Tax Office, however, identified it as a problem for the industry, and has 30 staff dedicated to a special phoenix project dealing with hundreds of cases. Yet somehow Minister Abbott manages to describe this as a model royal commission.  
In the year ended June 1999, the construction industry lost over 95,000 weeks due to workplace injury—five times the amount of time lost to industrial disputes. Yet the Cole commission investigators did not produce a statement from a single person in New South Wales alleging illegal or inappropriate practices with regard to workplace safety. And it has continued to be called a model royal commission. The treatment of unions and employers was vastly different. Employers were given weeks to prepare for allegations to be raised in the commission, whereas union officials were not given any advance notice of allegations. Does the minister truly believe that this is the sort of legal process we should be aspiring to in royal commissions in this country? The control of the media exercised by the royal commission was phenomenal and it was used to smear trade unionists. Throughout the royal commission there were constant examples of biased treatment and blatant lies against trade unions and trade unionists. There was nothing model about this royal commission unless, of course, the minister means a model for bashing unions.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Building and Construction Industry: Royal Commission</title>,Ministerial Statements,20,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-03-26,"—Volumes 2 and 12-22 of the report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry have today been tabled by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the other place, and in the Senate only a few minutes ago. These volumes relate to the royal commission's findings of fact in the states and territories. The report by Commissioner Cole shows a consistent pattern of illegality in the building industry across the nation. It needs to be very carefully noted from the outset, particularly in view of comments made by other speakers before me, that Commissioner Cole is an eminent jurist. He applied the highest judicial standards to his inquiries. On this side of the chamber, we will not hear any of the lame excuses that we have just heard from the Labor Party and the previous speaker, who like to trot them out to excuse the conduct of their union mates.
The report by Commissioner Cole is not union bashing; it is a forensic examination of widespread ills in the construction industry in this nation. That industry—as we have long suspected and now know—is a notoriously compromised industry in which illegality is endemic, malpractice is found widely and intimidation by unions is a fact of life that no one can escape or deny. From evidence gathered by the royal commission during public hearings conducted between October 2001 and October 2002, Commissioner Cole found and identified 392 separate instances of unlawful conduct committed by individuals, unions and employers; 25 different types of unlawful conduct; and 90 types of inappropriate conduct. And this is far from being the quantum of the illegality and inappropriate conduct. What has been revealed is only the tip of the iceberg.
Obviously there are many instances that have not been examined, because the evidence to force an examination was not discovered. There was, and still is, good reason why additional evidence has not been discovered. It is because of intimidation and threats that would be made and executed against people who would need to be more brave than those who did make presentations to the commission. On the evidence that Commissioner Cole has discovered through exhaustive inquiry, we now know that our understanding of what goes on in the building and construction industry is very far from being the full picture.
One volume of the report has not been tabled on the commissioner's recommendation. It deals with matters on which the Attorney-General will refer 31 individuals to the relevant authorities for possible criminal prosecution. The report finds that unlawful conduct in the building and construction industry is most prevalent in Western Australia and Victoria. In New South Wales it found that the rule of law and legal obligation have been replaced by commercial expediency. In Tasmania there is widespread inappropriate conduct. In my own state of Queensland the commission found a culture of disregard for the law. On a national scale what the commissioner has found is nothing short of a national scandal. 
When he tabled these documents in the House of Representatives this morning, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said:
...Commissioner Cole's report reveals an industry which all too often operates as a kind of conspiracy by big unions and big business against small business and consumers ... [and] on large building sites the CFMEU ... is a quasi-monopoly supplier of labour.
The big union rent seeking that we have seen revealed by Commissioner Cole, principally involving the CFMEU—the ubiquitous and apparently iniquitous CFMEU—comes at horrific cost. That cost is not just to Australia's reputation as a place in which to do business, unmolested by corrupt individuals and certain—not all, but certain—union organisations; the financial cost is very much part of the flow-on impact of the nationwide pattern of illegality exposed by Commissioner Cole.
This additional cost is easily illustrated by just one instance. In the late 1990s, Woolworths commissioned two almost identical buildings in Melbourne and Sydney. The Sydney warehouse was completed on time and—only—$5 million over budget. The Melbourne warehouse was seven months late and $15 million over budget because of industrial practices—if that is the term we can attribute to those practices. These industrial practices included routine breaches of certified agreements, chronic failure to observe safety dispute settlement procedures, the use of three different workers from three different unions to operate machinery usually operated by two workers, demands to employ union nominated activists and illegal picketing. I will repeat one of them: chronic failure to observe safety dispute settlement procedures.
I would just like to respond briefly to Senator Murray, Senator Nettle and Senator Sherry in relation to workplace health and safety. A senator stated that there were only 92 complaints in evidence on workplace health and safety. Honourable senators should be aware that there is abundant legislation in every state which every day successfully prosecutes irresponsible individuals, whether they be employees or employers, for breaches of workplace health and safety. A very strong body of law already exists and is very efficient—that is the reason workplace health and safety issues barely came up at the Cole commission hearings.
The head contractor in the case that I quoted obtained a Supreme Court injunction against a picket line, but still found it had to make a $50,000 payment to a Victorian Trades Hall trust account before the picket was withdrawn. That is a fact. Perhaps this is an opportune time to make the observation that it is almost understandable—though still not forgivable—that building companies do deals that are regarded as repugnant by most building industry managers but which are viewed as essential to the progress of their project. They would simply go broke if they did not settle. It is clear, too, that the CFMEU is a serial offender. As the minister said in his tabling speech today:
This near anarchy in the commercial construction industry ultimately impacts on everyone. An Econtech report, published last week, shows that commercial construction tasks typically cost 10 per cent more than comparable tasks in domestic construction.
Labor productivity in commercial construction is some 13 per cent lower than in home building, mainly because of overmanning, demarcations and frequent work stoppages.
That gives the lie to, or contradicts, the comments made by Senator Nettle when she quoted the US experience. The minister went on: 
Most importantly, this research showed that housing industry standard labour productivity in commercial construction would produce a 1 per cent boost in GDP, a 1 per cent cut in inflation, and $2.3 billion worth of benefits to consumers every year.
If we could achieve that it would well and truly justify the $60 million that the commission of inquiry cost. So there you have it, Mr Acting Deputy President: the cost to our country of paying off big-union muscle in the construction industry is $2.3 billion a year and a drought sized drag on GDP.
In terms of the findings of unlawful conduct made by Commissioner Cole, it should be noted that he interpreted the word `unlawful' to include all civil wrongs, including torts and breaches of contract, contraventions of statute and illegal acts contrary to the criminal law. A finding that an individual, company or organisation has engaged in unlawful conduct does not necessarily mean the individual, company or organisation has committed a crime. Some or all of any material placed before a royal commission— which is an administrative inquiry, not a judicial hearing—may not be admissible in a court of law. So it is no surprise that those statements were made in the commissioner's report and at the inquiry.
But, that caveat aside, Commissioner Cole's findings are stark. In Western Australia he made 230 findings of unlawful conduct against two unions, 28 representatives of three unions, three companies and one representative of a company. In Victoria he made 58 findings against one union, 18 officials and stewards representing three unions, six companies, two representatives and three employees of five companies, and one individual. In New South Wales he made 25 adverse findings; in Tasmania, 13; and in the ACT, one. In Queensland he made 55 findings of unlawful conduct against five unions and eight representatives of three unions. They are very specific findings.
I am encouraged by the comment made by the Premier of Queensland, as told to this place by Senator Murray, that he will treat the findings of illegality and unlawful conduct seriously and assist in referring them to the appropriate authorities. I also agree with the comment made by the CFMEU representative in WA to `put up or shut up'. You can rest assured that this government will be putting up rather than shutting up, because the findings by Justice Cole, an eminent jurist, are very clear and very transparent. They are findings that will be able to be understood by most Australians, who will absolutely reject the suggestions that have been made here that this was simply a political exercise. If members opposite do in fact have instances of employer corruption and malpractice within the building industry that for some reason were not able to be put before the commission, they have the privilege and protection of this place to be able to bring them up in here.
I did not realise I was meant to be summing up the debate and therefore commenting on some of the points that have been made by honourable members.
—You can sit down if you like!
—No. You will like this quote I want to read out because it indicates the mentality of the union movement in particular in response to this inquiry. This is what Mr Kevin Reynolds, the guy held up as a bit of a hero by people across the chamber, said this morning on Perth radio:
What people have got to understand is that it is capital versus labour—the bosses have got it and the workers want a bit of it and the only way the workers are ever going to achieve anything is to fight for it.
That is what it comes down to in the end as a result of the mentality of people opposite. It is a class struggle and they will do whatever they have to do to get a little bit, including committing all of the illegalities, all of the inappropriate actions, all of the adverse findings that Commissioner Cole found in his report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
About an hour ago in this place Senator Ludwig listed 21 returns to order that the government has failed to comply with in recent times. Even though he said that he had not had time to research to see whether that was a record, I can almost guarantee that it is—
—It might be a record number of returns to order, too.
—in part because there is a record number of returns to order happening. I agree with that statement of Senator Patterson. It is still a very large number and an indication of what is in effect a contempt of the Senate, in my view and in the Democrats' view. That is perhaps reflected by the words of the minister's statement, which were that the Senate resolution `requested' a copy of the document. It is not a request, it is an order; that is why it is called a return to order. It is a defiance of an order of the Senate to fail to do so. Once again, we have the totally undefinable and catch-all defence of `It is not in the public interest to say why this document can't be tabled.' 
The minister then said—no doubt words given to her by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs— that the matter contains sensitive immigration information and there was a guarantee given at the time it was negotiated that it would not be made public. The government should not give guarantees like that; they should not be negotiating with the intention of keeping documents secret and then relying on that intent to justify not releasing them. It is very much in the public interest for the public to know what sort of agreement the federal government have reached with the government of Iran—a government, let me remind the Senate, that is part of President Bush's axis of evil and that is frequently criticised for significant human rights breaches. 
We have had the government in this place today and in recent times making lots of statements about the terrible human rights abuses in Iraq and how concerned they are for the people in Iraq. Iran might not be up at that level but it is certainly pretty high up in terms of nations that have significant human rights breaches inflicted on its people across the board. Yet this government have negotiated an agreement with that nation to make it easier for them to return people to that very nation. The minister will say that they are people who have been proven not to be refugees and therefore have no legitimate fear of persecution. Two things need to be said in response to that. Firstly, the hurdle for being recognised as a legitimate refugee under Australian law is fairly high. There is a very tight definition. Secondly, the issue of persecution is much wider than that just under the refugee convention. There are plenty of other ways you can be persecuted than the ways outlined in the refugee convention. 
—That is absolutely untrue. More people get through. It would pay you to get your facts straight.
—The minister wants to interject about people not getting their facts straight, yet they hide behind secret documents that they will not let the public see. It is an absolute undeniable fact because it is clearly on the public record that there are many ways to be persecuted other than under the definitions in the refugee convention, which are very specific. You can be persecuted for a lot of reasons other than those outlined in the refugee convention. If Minister Patterson is not aware of that it is a great tragedy given her former role as parliamentary secretary.
—This is misrepresentation.
—I know you have been misrepresenting me but that does not mean I am not going to respond. The convention against torture, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on Civil and Political Rights require Australia to ensure that people's safety is protected. The convention against torture in particular requires us not to send people back to situations where they may face persecution for any reason, not just the narrow reasons contained in the refugee convention. Yet that is the situation faced by virtually all the Iranians who are in detention in Australia now, at whom this MOU is aimed. This MOU with Iran was adopted specifically with the aim of enabling the deportation of Iranian detainees. It will enable easier deportation of all people to Iran, of course, but that was the intent, that was the driving force behind the government's desire to adopt it.
 Once again we have it being used as a form of psychological pressure, adding to all the other psychological pressures used on detainees: `We'll give you a financial incentive to return home. That incentive is available for only a short period of time. If you do not take it then we now have this new secret MOU—nobody knows what is in it—that says we can send you back anyway.' That is an ongoing part of the psychological pressure that is being brought to bear repeatedly on detainees, not just from Iran but also from Afghanistan and Iraq. The effect of that psychological pressure is being seen every day in terms of the almost epidemic—literally— levels of serious depression and psychiatric disorders created directly as a result of the prolonged detention that this government inflicts on those people. There are ample testimonials from psychiatric experts, mental health workers, health workers who have worked in the camps and others that have quite directly drawn the link between the ill health, the mental illness, the psychiatric disorders and the depression generated by the detention regime and by the continual pressure because of the fear of being sent back to a place where people have a legitimate fear of persecution.
 Nobody is going to sit in a jail in the desert for years on end rather than go back to somewhere where they feel quite safe. People have a genuine fear of the sorts of things that this government has outlined in great detail about Iraq in recent times. After the sorts of things the government has been saying the entire Iraqi people are afflicted with, why would anybody in their right mind be thinking it is safe to go back there? Yet that is the sort of line that this government is trying to suggest to the Australian people— that it is safe for people to return. There is a big difference between not meeting the narrow definition of the refugee convention and absolute safety. There are some basic humanitarian issues involved there.
The government have made great play in recent times about their immense humanitarian concern for the civilians of Iraq. Well, here is a simple way for them to demonstrate that humanitarian concern: let them into the Australian community. It would not cost the government a dollar; in fact it would save them quite a lot of money because of the outrageous cost of detention, and it would cease the immense psychological trauma that is literally driving these people mad, driving them to despair and to suicide. That should not be tolerated in a humane society.
Because the government has refused to table the document, which contains so-called `sensitive immigration matters', this means that nobody knows the legality or the extent of the agreements that the government has reached with Iran. Once again, as in so many other areas in refugee and immigration law, this government is putting itself outside the law, outside the reach of scrutiny, above and beyond the rule of law. It is the latest in a long line of legislative amendments and actions by this government in the immigration area to totally remove itself from any public scrutiny.  
I imagine that most, if not all, of these people would have put in section 417 requests to the minister seeking his intervention. The rationale for his decisions and the nature of the consideration given to those requests are completely private. They are not made public in any way beyond whether the minister has made a decision to agree to intervene. The only thing that is made public is what the decision is. 
The degree of total secrecy and the total lack of transparency in life and death areas is simply shameful. Now we have a so-called `historic' memorandum of understanding with the Iranian government—widely acknowledged as a government involved in, or overseeing, a nation that has significant human rights abuses—aimed at enabling an easier return of people to that regime. The fact that, as we speak, Iranians in detention are being pressured even more by the department to accept so-called `voluntary' return makes it absolutely critical that this document be made public. Nobody can confidently rely on the process used to legitimise these deportations if that process relies on a secret agreement. It is a fundamental issue in terms of the accountability of government decision making in an area that is literally one of life and death. 
Anybody that has taken the trouble to meet the individual people or to read some of their testimonies or reports by health workers and others sees the massive human trauma and human cost that occurs as a direct result of this government's policy—a policy that, admittedly, builds on the policy of the previous Labor government in relation to mandatory detention. The psychological pressure that is put on all these people to sign a piece of paper saying they return voluntarily is enormous. That is why we are seeing so much trauma, so much disorder and so much depression in these centres. We are supposedly trying to say to these people, `This is all legitimate. It is fine. We have your best interests at heart,' yet the government will not even release the agreements it has made with Iran about this issue. When you have genuine and legitimate concerns about people being returned to a place where they have real fear for their safety, to say that that return is conducted on the basis of a secret document is a pretty bad principle. 
Let us leave aside for a moment the problem of the government showing contempt for the Senate by ignoring returns to order—serious though that is—we should not even need to do returns to order to get documents like this made public. It should be part of open government. The fact that the government from the outset has obviously had the intent to keep it secret because that was part of the negotiations, according to the minister's statement, highlights again the whole culture of secrecy and the lack of transparency and accountability to the law and to basic principles of governance and human rights that so pervades the area of immigration in particular. Once those basic principles are seen as able to be ignored in certain circumstances, then it is quite easy to say, `We have done it in this area, why can't we also do it here? Why can't we do it in another area?' The whole practice of secrecy and lack of concern for particular principles when they are not convenient can then permeate all other areas of government activity. I think we have seen evidence of that in recent times. That is why it is so important to make these points, to stand up on these matters and to try to hold the government accountable.
There are people today suffering enormously, literally on the edge of breakdown and in complete despair. They are being affected directly by this document. Their futures are fundamentally intertwined with this MOU. Their very survival may be intertwined with this MOU, and yet it will remain a secret document between this government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. I think that is a very worrying scenario. It is one that the Democrats deeply regret and strongly condemn. We will continue to advocate on behalf of those people in detention because they deserve to know that there are people in Australia who do have concern for their wellbeing, who do believe that basic humanity is something that needs to be acknowledged and stood up for. 
I send out the message to those people who are suffering as a direct consequence— indeed, as a deliberate consequence—of government policy that there are many people in the Australian community, the Democrats among them, who do support you and are doing everything they can to try to end your suffering. It is a deliberate intent on the part of the government to make these people suffer, because that is a key way, in its view, to make them return to other countries—that is, to break them down so that they have no hope, see no future and say, as many of them do, `I may as well die quickly back where I was born rather than die slowly in a jail in Australia.'
The fact that our nation has deliberately executed, and continues to deliberately execute, a public policy with that outcome is simply inexcusable. I think it is incumbent upon the Australian public and everyone in this place to do what we can to turn that policy around. There is no doubt that, for people who do not wish to return home voluntarily to countries like Iran and Iraq, the deliberate intent of the regime of detention and the other ways that people are treated is to destroy all of their hope until they feel that they have no future and no hope and that they may as well go home to face the very horrors and fears that they fled from. The fact that Australia is doing that is a tragedy. The refusal to make public the agreements that the government has reached with Iran compounds again the outrageous behaviour of the government in this whole area. This is an issue the Democrats certainly will not give up on, and I know many other Australians will not either.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-26,"—The purpose of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, is `to ensure that health care professionals have access to medical indemnity cover that is provided by properly regulated insurers'. The government's failure to deal with the medical indemnity insurance crisis must be viewed in the context of its failure in other areas of the health care system. This government has overseen a steady decrease in the rate of bulk-billing. Fewer than 70 per cent of visits to general practitioners now are bulk-billed, yet the Minister for Health and Ageing has hardly admitted that it is a problem. This same government has twice introduced legislation to increase the cost of essential medicines. This place has twice rejected those proposed increases. The bills before us represent a belated attempt to deal with a crisis that has been public knowledge for nearly a year. More than that, medical practitioners themselves have been concerned by the increased costs of medical indemnity insurance for well over two years.
The public first became aware of the medical indemnity insurance crisis in April 2002, when United Medical Protection sought provisional liquidation. Today, almost one year on, the government is still introducing legislation to attempt to resolve the issues surrounding the collapse of UMP and the resulting failure of insurers to protect doctors from financial ruin. But the writing was on the wall for a considerable time before that. In July 2000, which is now a year and a half ago, the President of the AMA, Dr Kerryn Phelps, highlighted the fact that medical indemnity insurance was blowing out as a concern for the health industry. In November 2000, United Medical Protection announced that in the 1999-2000 financial year over $95 million had been paid to 1,035 claimants. A day later, the AMA and individual doctors publicly voiced their concern that the expected, and later realised, `call' by UMP to increase fees would inhibit their ability to continue practising medicine. By mid-2001 Dr Phelps said that specialists were being driven out of practice by rising costs in medical indemnity insurance. 
The Australian Labor Party realised that something needed to be done. That is why the then opposition leader, Kim Beazley, and Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, held a press conference on 31 July 2001 to announce Labor's policy to address medical indemnity insurance. But it was not until 19 December 2001 that the Prime Minister called for a summit on the matter, which finally convened on 23 April 2002. Before the summit began, the minister for health said that the government's role was only to bring the relevant groups together. Perhaps it is that attitude that sees us debating policy which attempts to address a crisis that still has not been resolved. In fact, the government introduced medical indemnity insurance legislation into the Senate for the first time on 19 November last year—seven months after UMP went under. The government's handling of this matter has been at best sporadic and at worst disorganised. During 2002 it became clear that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and the minister for health did not agree on the manner in which the crisis could be averted, nor on who was to take the blame.
The most concerning element of the medical indemnity insurance crisis has been its particular effect on doctors in the bush. For a long time there has been concern surrounding the number of doctors in rural and regional areas, and the increase in medical indemnity insurance costs has only served to make the matter more pressing. There have been significant flow-on effects from the medical indemnity insurance crisis. We have seen bulk-billing rates in Australia drop through the floor. Anecdotal evidence would suggest that there is a link between increased insurance costs and the now snowballing decline in bulk-billing. Many GPs, particularly in regional and rural areas, do not make buckets of money and, as in any business, increased costs are inevitably passed on to the consumer. But health care and medical advice, unlike many other services, are essential services that all Australians should have equal access to.
The government's inability to deal with the medical indemnity insurance crisis has made health care less accessible, has placed an extra burden on the hospital system and has made doctors' professional futures uncertain. In Bathurst, a town of 32,000 people, there is only one doctor who offers full bulk-billing services. People who used to be able to visit their doctor and simply present their Medicare card now have to make a copayment, which is on average $12.78 per visit. It is no great stretch to see a link between increased insurance costs for doctors and the decline in bulk-billing services. A New South Wales health department survey found that only 28 per cent of GPs on the Central Coast of New South Wales intend to offer full bulk-billing services in less than six months time. The equitable provision of health care services should not be taken lightly. But that is precisely what the coalition government has done, firstly, by denying responsibility for the medical indemnity insurance crisis; secondly, by failing to introduce appropriate legislation in time to prevent the crisis from affecting Australian families; and, thirdly, by failing to consult the relevant stakeholders in time to ensure that any legislation does not cause the problems that may occur in places like Tasmania and Queensland.
This government has an unforgivable record on health care services. In addition to letting the medical indemnity insurance crisis get out of hand, it failed to control the rapid decrease in bulk-billing services and it has twice attempted to increase the cost of essential medicines by 30 per cent. Labor and the minor parties have ensured that the PBS remains accessible by making sure the government's legislation has been blocked. But governments are elected to govern, and it is wholly the responsibility of the government to fix the bulk-billing and medical indemnity insurance crises. The Australian Labor Party will not oppose these bills. We believe that medical defence organisations have justifiable concerns regarding these bills and that the most effective way of dealing with those concerns would be to refer the bills to the relevant Senate committee. However, due to the government's inactivity on the matter, there is quite simply not enough time to apply the rigorous analysis these bills require. 
The medical indemnity insurance crisis has been public knowledge for nearly a year now. Anyone who follows the medical indemnity insurance industry has known the potential for the system to break down for over eighteen months. But today, due to the government's ignorance of the issue, the Senate is compelled to pass legislation which may not address the issues effectively. At the eleventh hour, the government has listened to the concerns of doctors on the matter of run-off cover and has decided to provide them with at least an element of what they need to go about their business without worrying about claims in their retirement.
These bills are long overdue. They may not be ideal and they may not be the result of open and effective consultation with the relevant stakeholders, but we need legislation to ensure that we do not see a repeat of the United Medical Protection collapse. I support the bills but condemn the actions of the government in failing to appropriately deal with the crisis. Australians rely on this government to legislate for unexpected eventualities. In this case, they have failed to do so and the Australian health care system has suffered the consequences.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",IND,2003-03-26,"—I want to place on record my disappointment at the way the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 have been handled by government, and particularly my disappointment that they have not been able to be referred to a legislative committee for full examination. There are some very serious concerns held by doctors. They believed that the government was listening to those concerns, and it was not until late last week that it was finally obvious to them that the government was indeed not listening or that it had dismissed their concerns. Had we been aware of that earlier, I would certainly have pressed on to have a full committee hearing. Indeed, given the seriousness of some of these concerns I think we will have to do something at committee level on this entire issue at some stage down the track.
Part of the government's argument is that we have to separate the whole issue of costs from actually getting this done and getting the prudential supervision model in place. I would argue very strongly that we cannot separate out costs so neatly and so cleanly, because, if doctors find it unaffordable, they will simply not practice. We are already seeing that in my home state of South Australia. I was given examples earlier this week of a number of GPs, particularly those working part time, who have decided that it is all too hard and too difficult now and that they are moving on, in some cases to quite different professions and in other cases into either the bureaucracy or the health servicing area.
If we had been sitting a few more weeks—at least another week—in the first part of this year, I think a lot of the pressure that these bills are now under would have been off. I think the government has in fact created an unnecessary atmosphere of pressure. I do not believe that we need these bills to go through today, and I would like to quote from an email that I have from the President of the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, William Turner. He says:
Government speakers to the Bill that I have heard appear to place great emphasis on the urgency of passing this legislation. There is no imperative for it to be passed this session or even in the budget session. The facts are that medical indemnity coverage will remain available from the current providers under the present system whether or not they offer insurance contracts. It is far more important to satisfactorily resolve the outstanding issues such as run off cover and cover for claims in excess of the insurance cap. It is not good enough for the Government to offer to establish a task force to look at these problems subsequently. 
I say again to government that we really did not need to be rushing this through today. Obviously, the general aim of these bills is commendable. We have to make sure that medical defence organisations are prudentially regulated and comply with APRA's minimum standards. The doctors agree with that. The issue at stake is how we do it and whether or not there should be some choice for doctors as to how this is done and how they want to insure themselves.
I certainly want to thank those people who have contacted me to explain the reason that they do believe the bill needs to be passed. I thank the department for the briefings and I thank the minister's office, but I still remain unconvinced that there is this level of urgency. As I have said, I have also been contacted by many, many people, including individual doctors and doctor organisations— they include the AMA and the divisions of general practice—who do not see the need for the haste and indeed want to be able to put their case publicly to government.
According to the provisional liquidator of UMP Ltd, delay or deferment of the bill presently before parliament would have had disastrous consequences for UMP and the doctors it presently insures. This is the issue that I think has swung others in this chamber to letting this legislation go through today, but this is the very point that many doctors are arguing about. The AMA says its members are concerned about the impact of moving to a contractual form of insurance on the issues of retirement cover and what they call blue-sky provisions. These are the very rare but unfortunately very large claims made against doctors. I realise there are some provisions that the minister has outlined, but the AMA as at this morning would have very much liked to see this bill go to committee. I know these are not easy issues; hence, we have had a long period of time between when the original crisis happened and when we actually see legislation. But I reiterate my belief that it would be much better to allow doctors to bring these concerns to a Senate committee before we actually pass this bill.
I have been assured by some that changes made by this bill will not result in substantially higher insurance premiums, but I have also been told that many GPs are not in any way convinced of this. Indeed already, with premiums forecast to rise, some are leaving altogether. The last thing Australia needs right now is doctors, particularly GPs, leaving the system. The situation that we have with the number of GPs—and it is not just the distribution; it is the number of GPs in this country—is reaching crisis proportions.
The GPs are not a happy lot. They may be incredibly dedicated, but they are also extremely overworked. As we know, as has already been said as we debate this bill, and as has been said time and time again, bulk-billing is declining. This means the financial pressure on doctors is reaching the point where they simply cannot bulk-bill. Some doctors say they are bulk-billing to try to reduce the pressure in the waiting-room and to try to reduce the pressure on their secretaries. Some doctors' services now simply have an answering machine message that says: `If you are a regular in this practice, press 1. If you are trying to join us as a new patient, press 2.' Pressing 2 usually leads you to an incredibly long queue or, indeed, a refusal to see you, on the basis that the practice books are already full.
We need to look at some of the real statistics involving general practice. Eighty per cent of practices would like to put on another GP if they could find one. It is not good enough to look just at the hundreds and hundreds of advertisements we have for doctors across the country—and these are certainly not just for rural and remote areas. You need to look at all those practices who would like some more help but for whom there is no point in advertising; they know they are not going to get anybody.
More than 50 per cent of doctors now going into GP training are overseas trained. We cannot get enough Australians who even want to enter general practice. We are not training enough doctors in our universities. We need many more funded GP places in our medical schools. I have received an estimate this week that, in Queensland alone, 1,200 GP places are vacant that could have a doctor in them if one was available. If we look at some of the statistics—I recently got a very helpful paper from the library—as at the year 2000, 23 per cent of GPs were over the age of 55. Teaching is getting to this stage. In my home state of South Australia it is at about 48 per cent and the crisis button has been pushed. Nearly a quarter of doctors are over 55 years of age and AMWAC is still telling is, `Don't worry; everything is fine. We have got enough doctors.' In fact, one of the library papers tells me that AMWAC claims that we have something like 1,000 doctors too many. When is AMWAC going to take a look at how GPs are working, what the structure of their working week is, how many are working full time and how many working part time, and get some realistic figures so we can start looking at how many doctors we actually should have? 
If you look at TRDs plus OTDs plus the vacancies—all those practices wanting more help—I estimate we would need at least 300 extra funded places in our universities for doctors to be training year after year. Remember that it is six years before we see any results of extra training. If you look at some of the ways that GP shortages have been dealt with overseas, it is not just about finding more GPs; it is actually about supporting the ones that you have got. Putting this level of insurance costs on them is certainly not a way of supporting them. It is good to see the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, here and I hope that she will look at some of the solutions that she already has in place in rural Australia, which ensure that GPs have access to practice nurses. It is a very limited opportunity. You need about five doctors to get the wage of one practice nurse for a week—I think it is around $8,000 per doctor. We need to assist in getting some of the pressure off doctors, by practice nurses being available for all doctors, and also by more access to allied health professionals, whether they are dieticians, physiotherapists or diabetes educated professionals. In rural South Australia Aboriginal health workers are being supported under this program. There is a long list of other support people who should be supported by the Commonwealth to assist in taking some of the pressure off GPs.
To return to the legislation that is before us, the Australian Divisions of General Practice have raised quite a number of concerns about the impact of this bill and have been working very hard to have it looked at in committee. The government claims that the majority of MDOs in Australia are supportive of this bill. It would appear that a couple of the larger ones are, but the smaller ones are not. I will read through a list of concerns that they would have liked to have expanded on in committee. They argue firstly that the bill has been drafted with undue haste and fails to achieve the stated objectives. Secondly, it exposes patients of doctors to significant risk of going uncompensated in cases of medical negligence. Thirdly, it will have a significant adverse impact on bulk-billing and medical services generally. Fourthly, it will have a profound impact on medical manpower—particularly in general practice—as medical practitioners will refuse to continue to work under the proposed changes. Their fifth concern was that it would increase the cost of medical practice substantially. Lastly, they say it is anticompetitive.
As to the question of whether this legislation needs to be passed by 30 June, they argue it will not have the impact that the government has suggested, because the provision of medical indemnity cover is already sorted out for 2003-04. It strongly argues that the legislation be referred to a committee in order that appropriate measures can be introduced to safeguard doctors and their patients. In view of the time, I will not read through the executive summary of a report done by the Allen Consulting Group entitled Insuring medical defence: what will it cost? This was a report prepared for the Medical Indemnity Protection Society. I have circulated it to all whips and I seek leave for it to be incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The report read as follows—
INSURING MEDICAL DEFENCE: WHAT WILL IT COST?
Executive Summary
A sense of crisis in medical indemnity protection was crystallised with the provisional liquidation of United Medical Protection or UMP. This appeared to leave nearly 60 percent of Australia's doctors stranded without medical indemnity protection. This in turn appeared to place the health care system at risk and leave patients potentially without means to recover damages that resulted from medical negligence.
These dramatic events spurred rapid action by the Commonwealth Government. Government investigation into the industry seems to have involved a number of surprises including the realisation that:
·	Medical Defence Organisations (MDOs) have been struggling to deal with the escalation of claims and costs arising from increased litigation against doctors;
·	some MDOs have not made full provision for the liabilities arising from incidents that had incurred but not reported (IBNR);
·	MDOs were not subject to prudential supervision;
·	the indemnity cover provided by MDOs is discretionary and is not an insurance contract and so is not covered by the protections that legislation applies to insurance; and
·	commercial insurers have found it very difficult to compete in the medical defence industry and insurers are particularly worried about threats to viability including increased liabilities and uncertainty.
The Commonwealth Government has developed a broad package of measures in response. As the Prime Minister noted when he announced it, the measures are to `address rising medical indemnity insurance premiums and ensure a viable and ongoing medical indemnity insurance market.'
This study has conducted an independent review and evaluation of these measures. It has looked at their expected impact upon the medical defence industry, doctors and the community at large.
A key finding is that regulatory supervision of the medical defence industry is desirable. This activity, similar to other insurance activities, is subject to market failure which requires government intervention and prudential supervision. Of course, if theory is not sufficient, the failure of UMP should seal the argument about the implications of the current approach in practice. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) appears to be the appropriate entity to supervise the industry.
An important aspect of the approach proposed by APRA is to replace MDOs with insurance companies or to require MDOs to become insurance companies.
In APRA's words:
In future, all medical insurance in Australia will have to take the form of insurance contracts between individual doctors and APRA-regulated insurance companies. MDOs will have to cease writing insurance on their own account or convert to a licensed insurance company. Either way, the traditional and outmoded practice of discretionary insurance will cease.
APRA media release, 23 October 2002
Some MDOs are concerned that, at its core, forcing MDOs to become insurers is based on a false premise—that there is no alternative. This appears to have been accepted without question and without regard to the broader implications. With the benefit of some time to analyse the approach seven key issues now present themselves.
l.	Have the costs of the proposal been fully identified?
2.	What are the additional costs?
3.	Does the proposed approach deny choice and reduce competition?
4.	Does the approach `fix' or `break' the medical protection product?
5.	Is the approach really sustainable?
6.	Does the arrangement still leave doctors and ultimately patients uncovered?
7.	Will the proposed approach lead to a further wave of doctors exiting bulk billing?
Key findings from the investigation of these issues are summarised below.
The costs of the measures have not been fully identified by the Government. It is not clear that the Government has fully examined the impact of the measures upon the medical defence industry at large. In addition to identifying costs to the budget, the Government appears to have focused on raising the viability of UMP and giving it the opportunity to trade out of difficulties. It has not, however, analysed the impacts regarding the industry at large. There is no evidence of a thorough evaluation of the sort required by Government under the COAG Competition Principles Agreement examining whether the proposed regulation restricts competition, whether the restriction is the only way of achieving the objective and if so, whether the restriction is justified as being in the public interest. 
The results of the analysis conducted in this study suggests that the additional costs are significant. The reconfigured medical defence industry is estimated to face additional costs including:
·	establishment implementation costs—$7 million;
·	operating costs—$55 million per annum; and
·	capital costs—rising to $35 million per annum.
These costs are largely an attribute of APRA's choice of corporate structure to apply in the new regulated medical defence industry. Most would not be incurred under a framework that simply applied and raised capital requirements and other prudential controls. They are therefore avoidable.
The measures deny choice and reduce competition. The direct impact of the measures is to block the continued operation of MDOs unless they become insurers. MDOs have provided vigorous competition in the industry for decades. In essentially banning MDOs from `writing insurance' APRA's proposed approach imposes a fundamental restriction on competition. The case has not been made why this is the only or best option.
If the Government has the power to ban MDOs it also has the power to regulate them. It seems poor public policy to remove choice and competition just to make it easier to fit medical indemnity within the largely existing regulatory framework. It is not clear that changes cannot be made to the regulatory framework to accommodate MDOs. It is notable that regulators blocked entry of mutual funds from banking for some time reflecting similar arguments, and that removal of this prohibition and the accommodation of mutuals within the banking legislation enhanced competitive pressure in that industry to the benefit of consumers.
The measures `break' rather than `fix' the medical protection product. While it is not always popular, discretionary protection is an effective means of dealing with the moral hazard problem in insurance. MDOs use it to promote best practice and manage risks proactively rather than adopt the passive contractual approach involved in traditional insurance.
It is not clear that the measures will place the medical defence industry onto a sustainable footing. There is a profound weakness in implementing as a solution broadly the same model that failed. The absence of even a single insurer willing and able at this time to commit substantial capital reserves to the industry should raise alarm bells about the approach. Of course, one is not enough. Efficiency and lower premiums can only be assured if there is vigorous competition in the industry. Any less than seven insurance providers (the number of MDOs currently in the market) should be viewed as a failure to lock in sustainable competition.
The arrangements leave doctors and ultimately patients with less coverage. They will shrink the breadth of protection currently provided to doctors (while raising costs). If insurers come to dominate, as intended, the industry will shrink the service base to insurance of medical malpractice liabilities alone. This will leave doctors unprotected over most of the wide range of areas where doctors face threats. The expense of long tail insurance for the run-off as doctors exit the industry or retire poses additional problems. There is risk that doctors will `run bare' as they retire leaving injured patients without scope to recover damages for negligence.
The measures will lead to doctors exiting bulk billing arrangements. Increased costs for MDOs will have to be passed on in full to doctors if they are to be viable. These costs imply a significant burden upon doctors of about $1,800 per annum. This would be on top of other measures such as the IBNR levy and outstanding call payments owed by UMP and other MDO members. Unless Medicare arrangements are adjusted quickly to fully reflect this change in doctors costs, doctors will have a pressing incentive to exit bulk billing so that they can pass these costs on. This will compound the current trend decline in the proportion of doctors who bulk bill.
A further wave of doctors exiting bulk billing can be expected to have adverse consequences for the weakest and most vulnerable parts of the community. It is likely to impact most heavily upon medical practices that are already at the margin in economic terms, including those in rural and remote communities.
The study has also examined the economy wide implications of the avoidable aspects of the medical indemnity package, especially the change away from MDO structures towards insurance.
The economy wide picture differs from the partial view. Naturally, evaluation of a change in public policy should get to the issue of how it impacts upon welfare. It is insufficient to merely look at the cost to government, or to industry where these costs are passed on to households (through taxes or changes in prices). The economy wide perspective takes into account that one industry's costs are another's income, that changes in budget balances have to be financed with impacts upon taxpayers, and that there are sometimes complex connections that produce unexpected results. 
The MONASH model of the Australian economy has been used to evaluate the policy change.
The MONASH simulation indicates that while this is a small change in terms of the economy at large, there would still be significant macroeconomic implications once the additional costs imposed upon the medical defence industry have worked their way through the system. This includes:
·	a contraction in real GDP of around $30 million per annum;
·	a contraction in employment by some 400 jobs; and
·	an economy wide reduction in real consumption of $54 million per annum.
The reduction in consumption is equivalent to saying that there would be a contraction in economic wellbeing or welfare. Looking at the next decade the forecast implies a loss of around $400 million in net present value terms.
There are also some macroeconomic implications. These include:
·	an increase in activity and therefore employment in the insurance sector; and
·	a very small expansion in employment in export oriented industries and some job losses in industries that are consumption oriented.
Reflecting these impacts, it would seem appropriate to reconsider the approach. In particular, it would seem desirable to review the potential to bring the medical defence industry within a rigorous supervisory framework as intended by APRA, but without blocking continued involvement of MDOs structured as mutual funds and offering discretionary protection. This would preserve vigorous competition, enhance consumer choice and place the medical defence industry upon a genuinely sustainable position.
—I thank the Senate. In closing, the way this is seen by general practitioners is quite different from the way it is seen by some who work in specialty areas. I think the biggest issue facing us today, as we look at the overall health of Australians, is the issue of the medical work force. Whether the issue is a shortage of nurses, a shortage of doctors or a shortage of appropriate allied health professionals and the ability to pay for that, it all comes down to us waiting very anxiously to see the next Medicare agreement and hope that in the budget some of the outstanding issues for the support of doctors will be dealt with.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-03-26,"—This has been a rather hectic day. I understood that the Senator Lees may have been moving that the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 be referred to a committee. I understand what she has said on the matter. I wanted to formally move that the matter be referred to committee, and at present I am hurriedly getting a proposition drafted so that this can be done. It would be more appropriate, though, that it be done at the end of the second reading debate. I do not intend to repeat what I said in the debate on the Medical Indemnity (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002, Medical Indemnity (Enhanced UMP Indemnity) Contribution Bill 2002 or the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Bill 2002. I made an intervention on the matter on 10 December 2002; I am not going to repeat it in this second reading debate.
I want to speak to a proposed amendment that I will move, if nobody else does, at the end of this second reading debate. We have to be honest—we have to be honest with the patients and also with the medical profession and other health professionals. But we are not being honest if this has not been forwarded for proper consideration by the committee. I am absolutely astounded that the ALP should roll over on the completely baseless assumption that if this matter is referred to a committee then patients will be without relief. That is not the case at all.
To date, a case has not been made by the government to convince us that this is the most appropriate way forward. The Medical Protection Society of Tasmania has been advised that, should this legislation fail to pass by 30 June 2003, it will have no impact on the provision of medical indemnity cover for the profession in 2003-04. Did you hear that? I heard some members of the opposition saying that it would. Tell us how it would! It is a false assumption. Supporters of the government's model are already offering insurance products. Reinsurers have indicated that any delays will have no adverse effects upon premiums. Did you hear that, Madam Minister? Supporters of your government's model are already offering insurance products, and reinsurers have indicated that any delay will have no adverse effects upon the premiums. Therefore, why not allow referral of the legislation to a committee to fully and properly explore the most appropriate measures to safeguard both doctors and patients? That has been urged by a wide range of people, including the Australian Medical Association's federal council and, of course, the Tasmanian branch of the AMA. 
If we do not have the urgency of the 30 June deadline, it is incumbent upon the Senate to ensure that the legislation we pass is far-sighted enough and the least restrictive as possible. The legislation needs to be user-friendly in the interests of the health system. We cannot be seen as favouring one approach over another when the case for the former has not been made. What is the government frightened of if the matter goes to a committee? It is the normal course for measures such as this, which are contentious and which will have a dramatically adverse effect on patients and the medical profession in my state.
Let us not forget that within this debate are the long-term care costs for people who are disabled as a result of medical services. This issue itself has not had enough discussion in this place. Whose interests are we trying to advance here? Whose interests are we, as elected members of parliament, trying to advance? Is it in the patients' interests or is it in the interests of an organisation that has gone belly-up? At the end of the day we must put the interests of people who have been left disabled as a result of medical misadventure first and foremost in our minds as we look at any of these changes.
We also need to bear in mind that none of us want a situation where obstetric services begin to vanish in rural and regional areas. It is clear that there are at least two conflicting views on how to move forward. However, it is also clear that a broad coalition of medical protection interests contend that this legislation is not ready to be passed. As a legislator, this rings too many alarm bells for me to be prepared to say, `Yes, let's rush this through—get it through without exposure to a Senate committee and without examining the aspects that are being raised.'
As I said, many doctors have expressed the view that the legislation has been drafted with undue haste and fails to achieve the stated objectives: that it could expose patients to a risk of being uncompensated in ongoing cases of medical negligence; that it would have a negative impact on bulk-billing and medical services in general; that it would lead to a shortage of medical practitioners as many would refuse to continue to work under the proposed changes; that it would increase the cost of medical practice substantially; and that it would deny choice and reduces competition. These are the sorts of issues which should be explored by a Senate committee hearing.
The robust commercial nature of some of the MDOs has been questionable. At the same time, what is being put as a solution raises a number of questionable issues. Is there an alternative? Has the evaluation been done by the Commonwealth? Can the government put any evaluations on the public record? In my view, and this has been backed up by better informed views, we could still have an inquiry and a report delivered by 30 June, but even if we do not it is not going to endanger the situation of indemnity. So I am proposing to move an amendment and I will do so formally at the end of this debate—or can I do that now, Madam Acting Deputy President?
 (Senator McLucas)—You can foreshadow your amendment but you cannot move it at this point because we already have an amendment on the books.
—Yes, I understand, so I am foreshadowing an amendment—
—After the second reading debate.
—I will leave it until after the end of the second reading debate.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-03-26,"—In this debate on the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 and the associated bill, I wish to reiterate some of the points that Senator Harradine has made because, from a Tasmanian perspective, this issue is critically important. I am not going to claim to have a huge knowledge of this issue but I know it has raised concern amongst the people I have spoken to. It is interesting to look at some of the issues that have been raised by the report that was conducted by the Allen Consulting Group, which the government has used on a number of occasions. I will be listening with interest to see whether the government responds to these issues because I think they are of fundamental importance.  
Let us look at just some of the things that have been raised in the report about insurance matters. The report alleges there will be a reduction in competition and that there will be a denial of choice. It alleges that there has been no explanation from the government as to why the government's proposition is the best and/or only option and that the measures proposed by the government break rather than fix the medical protection product. The report says:
It is not clear that the measures will place the medical defence industry onto a sustainable footing. There is a profound weakness in implementing as a solution broadly the same model that failed.
It goes on to say:
The arrangements leave doctors and ultimately patients with less coverage. They will shrink the breadth of protection currently provided to doctors (while raising costs). If insurers come to dominate, as intended, the industry will shrink the service base to insurance of medical malpractice liabilities alone. This will leave doctors unprotected over most of the wide range of areas where doctors face threats.
It has been put to me that doctors, particularly part-time doctors, will leave and no longer provide services. How can that be a good solution not just from a Tasmanian perspective but from any perspective? I am not sure why the government is not prepared to have the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 referred to a committee for the purposes of having an inquiry and allowing senators to actually hear arguments as to why the government proposals in respect of this matter are unsatisfactory. I think it would have been a very useful exercise to allow that to happen. I understood that it was the opposition's view that this ought to be referred to a committee. Whilst I have not been made aware of why that view has changed, I would be interested to know why it changed.
I will support the amendment that is to be moved by Senator Harradine in respect of the referral of this matter to a committee. The bill can proceed to be dealt with, but that referral would allow people to put their case, particularly in respect of some of the MDOs, and ensure that we do have competition. By all accounts, some of them have operated very effectively and would continue to operate very effectively and provide an insurance product that would be superior to that which we are likely to end up with. At the moment, I do not see the logic in the government's approach but I will listen with interest to what the minister has to say to see whether there is a response to some of the allegations contained within this report which was prepared for the Medical Indemnity Protection Society. It seems to me that they are very serious allegations which should be responded to.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-03-26,"—The medical indemnity insurance issue that we are dealing with is a very major matter. It affects the lives and livelihoods of many medical practitioners and, therefore, untold thousands of their patients. I am indebted to the Australian Medical Association and their officer in Tasmania, the Hon. Doug Lowe, for much of the information I will give to the Senate today. I will also be supporting the amendment that Senator Harradine has flagged. 
The Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 that we are dealing with are not of themselves the whole answer to the question of medical insurance—they are a long way short of it. The medical indemnity crisis was sparked by the financial collapse of UMP in New South Wales, which was the largest medical defence organisation in the country. It had achieved that position by recklessly pursuing additional client base without corresponding prudential safeguards to meet increasing claims. 
In seeking a solution, the federal government has relied on Treasury to set a new policy for the medical defence organisation recovery strategy in consultation with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Health Insurance Commission, which supervises the structure under which the vast majority of medical services are obtained, was given no real opportunity to provide policy alternatives, nor was the federal health department—maybe the minister can either countermand that or give details. While UMP in New South Wales provides medical indemnity cover for the vast majority of medical practitioners, mutual discretionary medical indemnity organisations provide indemnity cover for the majority of medical practitioners across Australia generally. The vast majority of these mutual discretionary MDOs have provided reliable medical indemnity cover by following sound prudential practice and adhering to the strict accountability requirements and transparent reporting provisions of the respective state corporation codes, which are mutually consistent across the nation.
The Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, MPST—and this is the case in point for those of us from Tasmania, but it does apply to other organisations—provides medical indemnity cover for about 85 per cent of all medical practitioners. It has consistently provided reasonably priced medical indemnity cover but, of course, it is by no means the lowest, because it has been very prudential in its operations. The transfer to an insurance based product for Tasmanian doctors would mean an 85 per cent increase in medical indemnity costs. This legislation aims to give them no choice. It will take away what they have got, insist they go to insurance based cover and costs will increase by 85 per cent and those costs will inevitably be passed on to the patients of the doctors.
If the medical indemnity crisis is to be resolved satisfactorily for the community, our parliament needs to ensure the retention of a high level of competition in the provision of medical indemnity cover through the retention of not-for-profit mutual discretionary MDOs operating in competition with the profit based insurance companies, which include medical indemnity cover with their portfolios. Measures which have been put in place by the federal government to enable the medical profession to continue to function through 2003 are both short term and biased to UMP—the troubled organisation based in Sydney.
The current federal government strategies, which are embodied in these bills, do not provide a solution to the issue of blue skies or run-off cover upon retirement. Many people would not have thought that doctors retain liability or are exposed to liability long after they retire. They do and, therefore, they need cover. On that basis alone, this current legislation is fundamentally flawed. An examination of the legislation by the relevant Senate standing committee—which is what Senator Harradine is enabling us to opt for— will enable a review of the fundamentals of this legislation for the purpose of ensuring it meets its policy objectives in a cost-effective manner. That is pure commonsense. The mutual discretionary MDOs are not seeking to be excluded from APRA's prudential supervision. They are simply seeking to ensure that APRA is sufficiently authorised to establish alternative prudential requirements for the not-for-profit mutual discretionary MDOs as compared to the profit based, shareholder owned insurance companies, which is the stated objective of the federal government's current policy.
The stated urgency—Senator Harradine spoke about this as well—upon which it is claimed the ALP has been driven to make a decision to support this legislation does not exist. UMP is guaranteed by the government until 31 December and the status quo will continue to exist for all other providers up until 30 June next. It is anticipated any recommendations from a Senate standing committee could be dealt with by the parliament well before that deadline. Senator Harradine has proposed a reporting date of 12 May; he may care to look at whether that should be 13 May when we come back for the budget. I commend Senator Harradine on his amendment.  
I note that a month or two ago in this place I moved a similar amendment. On that occasion, I was supported by Senators Nettle, Lees, Harris and Harradine. We would have been there by now had that amendment been supported; we would have had this inquiry. I ask the Senate: how can we make a decision to support the profit based insurance companies, and effectively extinguish the mutual organisations which give indemnity to doctors without a profit, without hearing from the latter? Should we not be prudent ourselves? Should we not listen to what they have to offer? On the face of it, not only is it extremely good theoretically, but it has worked practically. These organisations have not got themselves into the trouble that UMP has got itself into. In fact, on the face of it, they offer a better option. Yet here we have legislation that says, `Let's opt for a profit based, insurance company based indemnity scheme and extinguish those schemes which have been sailing along through prudence, transparency and good management without that trouble.'
The Senate committee system exists to ensure that we do not make mistakes. I submit to the Senate, and not least to the Labor opposition, that we will be denying ourselves the opportunity to have the insurance that we do not make a mistake if we do not listen to these mutual organisations. The way to do that is to have a Senate committee which they can appear before. It could report back at the next day of sitting after tomorrow, which is 13 May. I say to both sides of the Senate—and the government must be included in this—that that is proper procedure. To deliberately say that as a Senate we will not listen to these organisations, that we will deny them access to the committee system, is very poor practice indeed. It frightens me. It is tantamount to studied ignorance. This is a very important matter. We should be as prudent as we would expect medical indemnity organisations to be. We must have a committee before which the mutual organisations and, indeed, all other interested parties can appear.
Everybody knows that medical insurance is a top problem in these days of rapidly escalating cost. It is a problem for doctors, for patients and for the insurance industry. The mutual organisations have been handling that well for many decades, but we are saying: `You're not the answer. We are going to remove you from the scene and bring in a single prescription—which are for-profit insurance organisations—to deal with this problem.' We must allow the mutual organisations the opportunity to put forward the alternative which they not only have as a theory but have practised, and have practised well.
Senator Harradine's amendment is absolutely critical. We should come back informed, on the next sitting day after tomorrow, with the committee able to report to us so that we can vote on this matter with that information at hand. At the moment we cannot do that. I appeal to the Labor Party and to the government to think very seriously about supporting Senator Harradine's amendment. It must be supported.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-03-26,"—I thank my colleagues for their contributions to this debate. The primary purpose of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 is to ensure that health care professionals have access to medical indemnity cover that is provided by properly regulated insurers. The issue is one of safety for doctors and consumers as well as a matter of stabilising an industry.
The bills are designed to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of medical indemnity providers. The bills give effect to the Prime Minister's announcements on 31 May and 21 October last year, which essentially aimed to bring all of the insurance business of MDOs into the prudential framework for general insurers. The bills also give effect to the Prime Minister's announcement on 19 March 2003. 
There are two main components to the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2003, which I will hereafter refer to as the bill. Firstly, it provides that medical indemnity cover is only to be provided by general insurers and only under contracts of insurance. Secondly, it provides for minimum product standards for medical indemnity insurance contracts. A minimum cover amount of $5 million, or such other amount as may be prescribed by regulation, will be required. There are also minimum product standards set down in the bill to offer doctors retroactive cover in certain circumstances.  
The bill also establishes a framework to specify minimum run-off cover via regulations. My press release of 24 March indicated that it is the government's intention to regulate, in advance of 1 July, to require that appropriate interim run-off cover is offered to medical practitioners, consistent with conditions in the reinsurance market and the type of cover that MDOs are able to offer. To help assist the medical indemnity industry adapt to the prudential reforms contained in the bill, the government has offered a generous transition period of five years, from 1 July 2003, from the minimum capital requirements for MDOs currently providing medical indemnity cover that wish to become authorised insurers and that do not already meet minimum capital requirements. 
The consequential bill is designed to support the measures contained in the primary bill. Importantly, it will ensure that data must be provided by the MDOs to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and will prohibit MDOs with discretionary liabilities from becoming authorised insurers. This prohibition is included so that legacy liabilities—the long-tail liabilities—of MDOs are quarantined from the new insurance business being issued from 1 July 2003.
The government sees the passage of these bills as an important element of a broad strategy that has several parts to stabilise the medical indemnity insurance market in Australia. In addition to the guarantee, to 31 December 2003, provided to United Medical Protection and its wholly owned subsidiary Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd—combined UMP-AMIL—that broad strategy has seen the government already implement a premium subsidy scheme to assist high-risk doctors with their premiums, a high-cost claims scheme to assist with reinsurance and a scheme to fund unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities of MDOs to be recouped by a levy on doctors of participating MDOs over time. These measures will address the safety of doctors and their patients as well as stabilise the industry.
This legislation that we are considering before the Senate will ensure that doctors and their patients can have greater certainty in their indemnity arrangements, better access to appropriate and adequate indemnity arrangements and better information about those arrangements. I urge all members of the Senate to support the passage of these bills in a timely fashion to ensure that doctors have the certainty they need in indemnity arrangements and in the entities that provide those arrangements, thereby ensuring that adequate medical services will continue to be available to all Australians.
I know that in the debate—not all of which I have been able to hear—there have been some concerns raised about a couple of issues: run-off cover and blue sky. I will just say a few words about them. I want to put on record that the government acknowledges the concerns of doctors about the availability and affordability of appropriate run-off cover for doctors on retirement. However, I should also put on the record that this is not a simple issue to resolve and it requires a response which will adequately take into account both the concerns of doctors and the ability of medical indemnity providers to offer this cover in a way that does not jeopardise MDOs' ongoing commercial viability.
It is the government's understanding that the provision of run-off cover by MDOs in the past—either through claims-incurred cover over the working lifetime of the doctor or through the provision of free run-off cover upon retirement for doctors with claims-made cover—may not have been supported by appropriate reinsurance arrangements. Quite frankly, if there are not reinsurance arrangements, there are unacceptable risks. The arrangement could place MDOs at considerable financial risk. 
In recognition of what I must say are the legitimate concerns of doctors about certainty in retirement and the commercial difficulties of ensuring safe, sustainable retirement cover for the providers of that cover, an amendment was made to the bill in the other place to remove the more prescriptive elements of the bill relating to run-off cover. The provisions have been replaced with an ability to prescribe run-off cover requirements by regulation. I am now putting on record that it is the government's intention to regulate, in advance of the 1 July 2003 commencement of the bill, to require that appropriate interim run-off cover is offered to medical practitioners consistent with the conditions in the reinsurance market and the type of cover that MDOs are able to offer, so that doctors will have greater flexibility in specifying the type of run-off cover that they can get.
The Prime Minister announced last week that the federal government will commission a study of options to examine the broader longer term retirement cover issues, particularly in relation to cover for medical practitioners who may not retire for many years, to supplement the minimum standards allowed for under the bill. The study will proceed, as a matter of urgency, in consultation with the MDOs and representatives of medical practitioners. The federal government is determined to ensure that workable arrangements are put in place to enable medical practitioners to access affordable and adequate run-off cover. It is committed to examining all options in this area as a high priority.
I now want to say a few words about blue sky claims. The bill requires that medical indemnity be offered by way of a contract. It is the government's view that contractual cover is entirely in the interests of doctors. In the past, doctors have obtained medical indemnity by way of a discretionary promise. These arrangements are certainly not suitable in going forward because they do not contain the certainty that doctors require. Contractual cover provides doctors and their patients with greater certainty as to what they are covered for and provides an avenue to enforce that contract through the courts. Contractual cover also provides more certainty to providers of medical indemnity as to the actual liabilities for which they should hold capital and reserves. Obviously, with discretionary cover you do not have that certainty. A consequence of contractual cover is that it clearly defines the limits of indemnity provided.
MDOs have, in the past, marketed their discretionary products as unlimited, which may be a concept that is not entirely true when you look at it. Of course, unlimited cover is naturally limited by the amount of capital and reserves that a company holds, so it is only as good as the reserves it has to meet any claims. MDOs do not have access to unlimited capital so there is a natural limit upon the amount of cover they can provide. The move to contractual cover makes this limit more transparent and more explicit. As senators will appreciate, in the context of limited cover, particularly in circumstances where doctors previously had the view that they had unlimited cover, doctors have a very real concern that claims may occur which are in access of the amount for which they are insured.
The potential for claims to be made against personal assets, where insurance is insufficient, is an issue that all other professional groups have long had to grapple with. The resolution of this issue is not simple—I am not suggesting it is—and it must take account of the rights of consumers and their ability to access appropriate compensation in circumstances where they have been injured or suffered loss through the negligence of another. It must also recognise the vulnerability of medical practitioners to long tail claims. However, in all of these things there is a balance, and the government recognises that consumers are not benefited if professionals are so fearful of the potential for their personal assets to be exposed to litigation that they are not willing to continue to provide essential services to the community.
The federal government cannot determine potential solutions to this issue; it will require state and territory government involvement. This is primarily because actions for medical malpractice would, in usual circumstances, be pursued in tort in various state and territory courts. It also involves cross-portfolio interests, including the portfolios of Treasury, Health and Attorney-General's, so it is my view that the most appropriate forum to continue the consideration of this very important issue is the Commonwealth-state ministerial meetings on liability insurance. The next ministerial meeting is scheduled for 4 April in Perth, and I have asked my state and territory colleagues that this item be included for discussion on the agenda for that meeting. I think it is appropriate that this matter be taken forward at a high level and given the priority it deserves. 
I thought it appropriate to just mention some of these concerns, without taking issue with every matter raised in debate, because there may well be doctors and others listening to this debate who would expect something to be said about these issues. Apart from that, it is a package designed, as I said, to provide greater safety to doctors and consumers and to stabilise an industry in much need of attention. For those reasons I urge that the bills be passed.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-03-26,"—The Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002 is a significant bill as it has been a lightning rod for community concern about corporate greed. The purpose of the bill is to permit liquidators to claw back unreasonable payments made to directors of insolvent companies. In spite of its original, limited purpose, the bill has taken on a much greater purpose on account of Labor's amendments. Labor's amendments crack down on the disclosure of executive remuneration and empower shareholders to take on the boards around the country. This bill highlights the difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. Labor backs the shareholders whereas the Howard government backs the board directors. You can always count on the Howard government to back the big end of town, and this bill is no exception. This evening I will discuss the loopholes that exist in the bill and Labor's amendments to close those loopholes, Labor's amendments to crack down on executive remuneration and enhance the disclosure regime, and Labor's proposals to empower superannuation funds. The loopholes in this legislation have already been documented in the House; however, I will briefly run through them.
This bill provides that a liquidator can reclaim an unreasonable director related transaction made within four years of a company appointing a liquidator. The definition of what constitutes an unreasonable director related transaction creates a loophole for certain benefits which escape this definition. The definition does not capture all transactions between directors and companies. In particular, the bill only refers to payments made by the company, and not to benefits received by the directors. The effect is that options issued to a director are captured by the definition, but any profit made on the exercise of these options is not captured. The legislation allows the company to claw back the original value of the options, which could be a small proportion of the ultimate value of these options. Given some of the excesses that we have seen, it is to be expected that that will be a small amount. This means that shareholders and creditors are ripped off. The company has gone belly up, the creditors are seeking payment for debts and the liquidator is unable to access the real benefit of the options payments received by the directors. Labor proposes to amend the definition of `unreasonable director-related transactions' to capture this benefit. We must capture all unreasonable payments made to unscrupulous executives like Brad Keeling, Jodee Rich and Mark Silbermann. Labor welcomes the recent settlement that ASIC reached with Mr Brad Keeling, whereby he is banned from being a director and being involved in the management of any corporation for 10 years. He is liable to pay compensation of $92 million to One.Tel, although he does not have to cop the whole $92 million—Rich and the others are also going to be liable—and he has agreed to pay ASIC's costs of $750,000.
The second loophole in the bill is that it is up to the courts to determine when a payment is considered unreasonable. To give this legislation some real teeth, Labor recommends that proposed section 588FDA be amended to set out the circumstances to which the court should have regard in determining whether a transaction is unreasonable. The third loophole in this bill relates to the timing of these new provisions. If Mr Howard is serious about protecting shareholders, investors and policyholders, the bill should apply from 4 June 2001, when the Prime Minister said he would legislate. The retrospectivity argument raised by the Howard government is a furphy. The fourth loophole in the bill was identified during the Senate economics committee hearing in relation to the bill. Professor Baxt from the Australian Institute of Company Directors said: 
The way this bill is drafted, I think that if a payment were made to a director of a partly owned subsidiary it might not be caught by this legislation. ... We see so many cases of people getting off because there is a technical flaw in the legislation and the court says, `Sorry, there is no case to answer.'
So Labor will move an amendment to capture such payments to subsidiaries. We will also move an amendment to ensure that section 300A of the Corporations Act applies to executives, regardless of which company in a corporate group they work for. This issue was also raised by Professor Baxt during the Senate hearing.
Whilst the claw-back of unreasonable payments is supported by Labor subject to the amendments outlined above, the bill fails to address the core of the problem. That problem is excessive executive remuneration. Boards in Australia have had it too good for too long. Boards in Australia have held their shareholders to ransom. They have acted in their own interests, not in the interests of their shareholders. That well-known American investor Warren Buffet recently described the actions of US executives paying themselves exorbitant salaries as `piracy' and said they treated the companies they worked for as their private banks.
Self-regulation is a green light for corporate greed. The average annual salary for the top 100 CEOs in Australia increased from $1.4 million to $2 million last financial year. That is a 38 per cent increase. This translates to a $10,000 increase per week, taking a CEO's weekly salary up to $38,000 a week. These are the same CEOs who have been opposing an extra $24.60 a week for 1.7 million workers, increasing a worker's weekly salary to the princely total of $456. That is right: CEOs have gone up $10,000 a week to $38,000 a week—that is not per year, but per week—and they have been opposing workers getting an extra $24.60 a week, taking them up to $456 a week.
—Perfectly reasonable!
—`Perfectly reasonable!' I am sure I should indicate for the record that that was sarcasm from Senator Murray. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has opposed any increase over $10 per week in each of the last seven years. That is right: in the last seven years, Mr Howard has said, `Workers can have no more than $10 a week,' while at the same time executives have got an increase of $10,000 a week. There is one rule for senior executives in this country and one rule for workers. It is time for the Howard government to face up to the fact that self-regulation has failed. 
Labor wants checks and balances on the setting of executive remuneration. Accordingly, Labor will today move amendments that require companies to disclose the policy behind the setting of executive remuneration. These are the same amendments which we moved in the House and which the government voted down. Labor's amendments mean that shareholders will get a breakdown of how the compensation package is composed and how compensation relates to the company's performance over a five-year period. We want shareholders to know whether options and equity are subject to performance hurdles. We also want shareholders to know what those performance hurdles are. This concept is not ground breaking. Already in the UK these requirements are part of the law. However, the Howard government voted down this amendment in parliament just a few weeks ago, saying that such amendments were `complex and overly prescriptive'.
Labor will also move today an amendment that forces companies to give shareholders a say on executive remuneration. That is right. It gives them a say—not a chance to find out what has happened after the horse has bolted and what the government has been dragged screaming and kicking to, but a real say. The amendment requires companies to put an annual non-binding resolution to shareholders on executive pay. This amendment would give shareholders a statutory right to voice their opinion on the policy upon which these big payouts are based. Again, this is not a radical idea. British shareholders will have the ability to vote on executive salary packages from April this year. In the UK, the TUC helped encourage a shareholder vote against the obscene salaries paid at Vodafone. One in 10 shareholders voted against the chief executive's package, and 15 per cent of shareholders refused to endorse it. With the statutory right to an annual vote starting in April this year, the TUC plans to target a series of companies where the remuneration policy is unacceptable. 
Why don't Australian shareholders have similar rights to their UK counterparts? It is simple: the Howard government voted these amendments down in the other place. But today there is a second chance. Today is a second chance for the Howard government to back the shareholder, not the board director. But we all know Mr Howard and Mr Costello do not want to empower Australian shareholders. They like the status quo. Under the Howard government, the board makes the decisions and the shareholders wear them.
Super funds in Australia have control of over $505 billion. That is almost three times what the federal government will spend running the country this year, and it is almost 39 times our annual defence budget. This is a monumental responsibility, but it is also a monumental opportunity. Labor believes that it is essential that superannuation trustees use this opportunity and vote their shares. Because of the matters on which shareholders vote—the election of directors, certain share capital transactions, certain related party transactions—voting has a direct impact on a company's management.
Super trustees bring pressure to bear on companies which far outweighs the pressure of individual shareholders. The old response of simply selling up is the easy way out. Trustees of super funds need to engage with the companies they invest in. To date, many trustees have ignored this responsibility. In fact, some trustees of super funds have a general rule not to vote at all. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, ACSI, believe that such a rule is contrary to trustees' common law obligations and believe that super funds have, at the very least, an obligation to consider whether to exercise their proxy vote. The IFSA blue book was a good start for many trustees and fund managers. However, circumstances have now changed.
Internationally, both the US and the UK have taken bold steps to increase shareholder participation. In the US, in addition to the ERISA legislation requiring private sector pension plans to vote, the SEC has adopted new rule amendments for mutual funds. In January this year, the SEC adopted amendments that require mutual funds and other registered management investment companies to disclose their proxy voting policies and procedures, and their actual proxy votes cast. In the UK, the Institutional Shareholders Committee released a statement of principles setting out best practices for institutional investors. More recently, the UK government has said that it will examine implementing the recommendations from Myner's review into institutional investors later this year. The Myner report proposed that there should be a legal duty on funds to intervene in companies where it would be in the best interest of pension scheme members. Myner made it clear that exercising a voice is better for the economy as a whole than the current strategy of doing what is called the `Wall Street walk'.
In Australia, only 14 per cent of investors voted against resolutions on executive pay in the 2002 annual general meetings season. Clearly, Australia is behind the game, and it is time we caught up. How do we catch up? There are three ways: firstly, by legislating— the amendments that Labor will move today will empower super trustees to stand up to corporate Australia; secondly, by encouraging super funds to become more active; and, thirdly, as a last resort, there is always litigation. To protect workers' entitlements, the labour movement has argued for changes to company law, better redundancy compensation and strong labour laws. These are essential restrictions on corporate behaviour. However, there is more that can be done.
It is worth remembering that the Hawke-Keating government's introduction of compulsory superannuation changed the financial landscape forever. It rejuvenated our capital markets and fundamentally altered our financial services sector. At that point, Australia led the world on retirement funding. It is now time for more structural changes to the industry, yet some industry participants would argue that voluntary codes of conduct are sufficient and that we should take a wait and see approach. In Labor's view, as I have said, self-regulation has been a green light to corporate greed. Self-regulation has failed to produce outcomes that benefit the investor or the employee. That is why a more robust approach is needed. 
In the UK, the Institutional Shareholders Committee's statement of principles has been criticised on the grounds that, as they are not part of the law, it is impossible to overcome the web of conflicts of interest in the industry. Similar considerations apply in Australia. Trustees must take responsibility for protecting the assets of their members. That is why Labor is proposing to legislate in relation to voting and disclosure. Our first amendment relates to trustees of super funds. This amendment makes it mandatory for trustees of super funds regulated under the SI(S) Act to exercise their votes, disclose their voting record and explain why it was in the best interests of their clients that they voted in this manner. These amendments would only apply to investments in listed companies in Australia. The amendments would not apply to small funds like self-managed funds and some of the smaller corporate funds. Provision is made for appropriate carve-outs to be prescribed. For example, a carve-out would apply for certain pooled investment vehicles where investors are required to abide by the rules of the investment and do not have the power to direct their votes.
Labor's second major amendment relates to fund managers. This amendment requires fund managers to disclose their voting record. Labor's amendments will make it mandatory for fund managers in Australia to disclose their proxy voting policy and procedures, the matter voted on, whether and how the fund manager cast their vote and whether the vote cast is for or against management. Certain carve-outs can be considered. If these changes fail to increase the activism of funds managers, Labor will revisit the issue and see if more stringent requirements are needed. These amendments are intended to increase shareholder activism in Australia. They are also intended to increase transparency and disclosure in relation to proxy voting. Labor wants to ensure that boards act in the best interests of the owners of the companies—the shareholders. We believe that one of the most effective ways to do that is to empower shareholders to take an active role in company affairs.
The second way for Australian super funds to catch up with international best practice is to become more active. It is not good enough for trustees to watch passively from the sidelines. This is not a spectator sport. To see results, actions need to be taken. Trustees of super funds in Australia have got to be in the game. Very few super funds have even been fielding a team. Cbus, to mention just one, is a notable exception. Their decision in October last year to write to the chairmen of Australia's largest 200 companies and say that they would vote against all executive option package proposals was a major break with past practice for the industry. As Cbus invests about $1.5 billion of funds in public companies, Australian boards were forced to sit up and take notice. The CSS/PSS is another example. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investments has also taken the fight up to the boardroom. Their decision to advise their members to vote against Chris Corrigan's options package in February this year sent a shiver down the spine of directors across the country. Super trustees should be following the Cbus lead. The ACSI guidelines provide a good basis for trustees to identify the issues on which they need to focus. Also, Corporate Governance International's guidelines on executive remuneration provide a step by step guide for investment managers and superannuation trustees—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-26,"—My compliments to Senator Conroy. That was one of the best corporate accountability speeches I have heard from Labor in my time here, and I think it advances the cause very considerably. The Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002 was prompted by the collapse of One.Tel when the directors, Keeling and Rich, had paid themselves $7½ million in bonuses in a year when the company lost—note `lost'—$291 million. The bill has a relatively narrow aim: to permit liquidators to reclaim unreasonable payments made to the directors of insolvent companies. The Democrats support the intention behind the bill, but it needs to be considered in a wider perspective. We have sought to include amendments to improve its significant shortcomings.  
This legislation has to be seen in context, and it is the same context that Senator Conroy outlined. Executive and director remuneration is a matter of great public and private interest. It lies at the heart of investor confidence and faith in the credibility of corporations and the share market. It is a matter of great public interest because the extravagant greed of many directors and executives has not only caused a justifiable public outcry but has also contributed to major company failures and market shocks. It is a matter of great private interest because shareholders have been robbed—and I use the word `robbed' advisedly—by the syphoning off of their funds through board approved salary package rackets.
I note that the Business Council of Australia discussion paper of March 2003 on executive salaries states:
There are strong lessons for corporate Australia from the current debate about executive pay: they are that companies—and in particular their Boards—must respond more effectively to heightened shareholder and community concerns on this issue, and where there is poor performance, payout must be minimised.
The Australian Democrats agree but with the force of law. Market confidence has been badly affected in the long term. The new and very large cohort of `mum and dad' investors have been taught that they cannot trust auditors and accounting standards and that they cannot trust directors to do their job and to do the right thing. In the eighties and early nineties the corporate opprobrium landed on entrepreneurs who were, by definition, few in number. Now it is the corporate bureaucrats, the professionals—a whole class of business people and their advisers—who have lost public trust.
At the heart of the matter is a series of connected failures. Neither board practice nor the law prohibit arrangements where there is a conflict of interest. Those who benefit from devising clever, concealed and costly salary, bonus or option packages— which benefit the executive and director mates on the board—are the same people who approve those packages, often ticked off at the shareholder level by the chairman holding proxies. Full disclosure of executive and director packages to shareholders and the market has been poor and the bare minimum, despite Democrat and Labor legislation which explicitly forced its disclosure. Boards do not have independent directors. Directors are invariably subject to the patronage of dominant executives or dominant owners. Good democratic processes for director election are rare, and far too often it is still a mates arrangement. Accounting and auditing standards and practices have been deficient. The regulators on this particular front—ASIC, the ASX and the Accounting Standards Board—have been weak in their efforts.
The debates of 1997 and 1998, which led to the greater disclosure of pay packages, was a result of the Democrats and Labor recognising that managements and boards were conspiring to enrich themselves at shareholder expense. In the wake of what has happened since, you would not be stretching it too far to call it a criminal conspiracy, given the loss of shareholder funds by some of those people. The Democrats and Labor rightly saw that the danger of creating acceleration in remuneration from disclosure was outweighed by the right of shareholders to judge pay and performance and to have a say in determining pay for performance. Disclosure is an essential part of governance and is an essential market mechanism. Disclosure is not a privilege or some kind of motherhood statement; it is an essential market mechanism. Unfortunately, neither the law nor the regulators were up to the task of defeating the greedy. Hence, the need for more changes to the law.
In commenting on new draft ASX guidelines for disclosure of executive pay packages, an Australian Financial Review editorial on 13 March 2003 said: 
... [the previous guidelines have been] notoriously porous and have allowed companies to hide details of incentive and retirement benefits until the lucky executives and directors have banked their cheques.
The problem with the ASX approach, of course, is that it is voluntary. Pathetically, the ASX says those who do not volunteer to disclose would also have to explain why in due course. We are going to introduce amendments to add some force behind such provisions which, being voluntary, are extremely weak.
Many company directors and executives have proven they are not to be trusted. Greed and self-interest govern their actions. The only antidote is black-letter law to ensure transparency. Shareholders deserve full information on which to judge pay versus performance. We welcome the fact that the government, after five years, is finally accepting the need to enforce these remuneration provisions. They have also come a long way from their earlier positions, five years ago, with CLERP 9. Hopefully it will herald a new era. The Democrats will try and ensure it is as tough as it needs to be.
Further, the penalties for nondisclosure need to be high and the regulators need to be put on notice to take an active interest. Companies have not had the morality that should motivate disclosure, the regulator was asleep, the accounting standard setter was snail-like, and the determination of boards to keep their greedy secrets meant they disregarded the present law's penalties and, anyway, found ways around it. Alan Kohler from the Australian Financial Review on 15 March 2003 had this to say:
Companies have been blatantly breaking the law by signing or maintaining contracts that include large termination benefits and performance incentives that are not disclosed each year.
He went on to say:
Admittedly ASIC's PN98 was also deficient in not specifically requiring accrued termination benefits and long-term incentives to be disclosed each year, and the Accounting Standards Board took years to issue an exposure draft ...
Note that he used the phrase `blatantly breaking the law'. These are our top companies and they are so-called `leaders' in the corporate world in our society.
In the Democrats' view, any substantial salary or performance package should be disclosed at the time it is negotiated. This should also apply to any potential redundancy payout and should include the value of shares and options. We look forward to the CLERP 9 amendments. With the benefit of hindsight, we have seen boards cleverly avoid our remuneration amendments through retirement benefits that were not fully disclosed. We intend to try to ensure that these provisions are strong and enforceable, and that the clear legislative intent cannot be circumvented by clever remuneration arrangements. The Democrats will seek to toughen disclosure requirements and to financially punish any public company that does not appropriately and promptly inform ASIC and the ASX of the employment terms of its highly paid executives. 
The revelation of the Commonwealth Bank's $32.7 million payout to Mr Cuffe once again highlighted the urgent need to improve corporate disclosure rules. When they eventually released this information to their shareholders, the company stood behind the fact that the payment was required under an existing contractual obligation arising from the Colonial takeover. That amount of money should have been in their balance sheet as a liability and should have been shown as an accruing liability. Our amendment will seek to include such commitments within the existing disclosure requirement. It will expand the disclosure of `emoluments' to include accruing and unvested benefits. It will also achieve the aim of forcing companies to disclose such obligations to their auditors. In this way companies may also reveal such contingent liabilities in their financial statements. Concealing payments of that size is just totally immoral and wrong. Timely disclosure may, in some small way, have mitigated shareholder outrage, the damage to the Commonwealth Bank's, Mr Cuffe's and Mr Murray's reputations, and any negative impact on the share price. 
The revelation of AMP's multimillion dollar payouts to executives and directors also highlighted the urgent need to give shareholders the right to veto massive payments. The announcement of the extravagant bonus payments was another example of shareholders being treated with contempt by executives and company directors. We need tougher rules to empower shareholders with the right to decide whether exorbitant payments are appropriate. Due to their self-interest and greed, many directors have shown themselves incapable of showing adequate discretion. For years now, weak company directors have allowed themselves to be victims of executives' greed. Section 200B of the Corporations Act outlines that a company must not give a person a retirement benefit without shareholder approval, as outlined in section 200E. However, it seems that major corporations—the AMP and the Commonwealth Bank being the most recent examples—are circumventing the spirit of these amendments. We are seeking to amend section 200F of the Corporations Act to stop companies from hiding behind existing contractual arrangements and thereby avoiding shareholder approval of such payments. 
Our amendments will give shareholders a greater opportunity to veto payouts, particularly where there has been a significant reduction in the company value; where performance criteria have not been met in a material sense; and/or the company has made a loss or there has been a significant profit reduction. I note the amendments of Senator Conroy that attempt to ensure that super funds and other fund managers vote on their shareholding or, at the very least, outline their voting policy. I believe that is a good start but I hold firmly to the view that all institutions above a certain size and capability should be exercising their voting shares. It is a really simple argument: they hold those shares in trust, they have those powers almost of escrow over other people's money and shareholding and they should be exercising their vote as a duty of care. Since they are not doing it, we should make them do it. I want the government and its advisers to understand that if you reject these amendments this time, when you come back with CLERP 9 they will be in front of you again and we will keep hammering you until they are law.
In respect of related companies, corporate restructuring is used by unscrupulous companies to deprive creditors, including employees, of access to assets when a subsidiary collapses. There have been examples in the recent past where employees, and creditors generally, have lost out where the company responsible for the failure has been a holding company that has washed its hands of the debts of the subsidiary company. When companies were originally conceived, it was intended that they would provide a benefit of limited liability to their owners— the shareholders. It was not intended that they would be manipulated to allow the separation of assets in one company and liabilities in another, resulting in those to whom money is owed having access to no significant assets to satisfy their entitlements. 
We have again and again brought this amendment to the Senate—and we tell you again that we will keep doing this because the recommendations of the Harmer Law Reform Commission report in 1988 proposed making related companies liable for the debts of insolvent companies in limited circumstances. With those limited circumstances, it would be up to a court to consider matters like the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the insolvent company, the conduct of the related company to the creditors of the insolvent company and the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up are attributable to the actions of the related company. Labor has supported these Democrat initiatives a number of times in the Senate but for the same number of times the coalition have refused this obvious reform. Their refusal continues to benefit the dishonest and the immoral. We again seek to include in this bill those amendments dealing with related companies.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit Report No. 391 was a milestone for that committee. It was a milestone because it was the first time the committee had stepped outside the public sector, government business enterprises included, and looked at aspects of the private sector. I thought its report was a very good contribution to the debate. In that report, the committee refers to independence. From paragraphs 1.23 to 1.30 in the report there is a succinct summary of independence. Briefly, independence is determined by the method of appointment and termination, the security of tenure and remuneration. It is enhanced by the best features of democracy, which are the separation of powers, full access to relevant information, high standards of process and performance, transparency, disclosure and accountability, and the full involvement of stakeholders, particularly through democratic elections. As report No. 391 says: 
Independence is important to ensure that a person or group of persons undertake their work professionally, with integrity and objectivity and free of bias and undue influence.
It is notable, and a tribute to the past influence of board insiders or political insiders, I suspect, that the Corporations Law still lacks definitions or criteria for independence, yet these are fundamental statements that are continually referred to in matters of corporate law. I find it astonishing that there is this continued lack, and it is that continued lack which is at the heart of many of our major problems. So, hopefully, public outrage is now creating the right climate for more reform in this area.
The second issue I want to refer to relates to the separation of powers. The issue of corporate governance is at the heart of managerial and board accountability. Existing company law is inadequate in terms of corporate governance. Directors' duties are very wide in respect of operational and management matters and can create situations where major conflicts of interest, mismanagement and even corruption can go unchecked. As some of the recent corporate collapses show, directors and senior management can evade their full responsibilities to the company's shareholders, at great cost not just to the company but also to the country. As a means of improving this situation, the Australian Democrats have for the last five or six years—under my portfolio management—proposed a separation of powers so that the law gives shareholders of public companies the option of requiring a separation of the normal business and internal management functions of the board from the governance functions of ensuring openness, accountability and good process. The main board would continue to be oligarchic. It is oligarchic because it represents the oligarchy of financially dominant bodies. A main board would continue to be elected by a shareholding which represents financial power and would continue to concentrate on strategic, business and operational issues.
We propose a corporate governance board separately elected directly by shareholders and not by shareholding—that is, numerical or democratic power in contrast to oligarchic power—that would comprise not more than three non-executive directors. It should call and chair shareholders' meetings, propose changes to the company constitution, manage the process of electing directors, resolve conflicts of interest, determine the remuneration and packages for directors and executive management and ensure independent advisers by taking the appointment of auditors and other advisers such as valuers away from the main board. That is a very practical recommendation, but I am afraid the forces of conservatism that we are up against cannot grasp the essential concept of separation of powers and of democratising companies in order to ensure the proper exercise of their responsibilities.
There is currently a great disparity between the principles of corporate democracy and the rules set out in the Corporations Act governing the internal operations of companies. For example, the existing method of electing company directors on a limited re-election basis allows dominance by control groups and inhibits the likelihood of support being expressed for particular directors or independent directors. The law does not enable minority interests to be heard through more accessible internal procedures, forcing them to rely on expensive and time-consuming formal procedures like the legal system and ASIC. Unacceptable discriminatory practices still apply, and women are still in a small minority as directors. The Democrats believe that if the ASX and ASIC do not insist on best practice election processes, in due course the Senate would have to consider legislating for the election procedures for companies. 
In closing, we have to ask why we need these amendments attached to this particular bill. The Senate is faced with the second-lowest sitting week year in a non-election year since 1988—that is, in15 years. We have bills stacked up against us. We have no idea when and if CLERP 9 will reach the Senate; we have no idea of its final content. So when you have a national crisis, as we do in this area of governance, we should take the opportunity when it arises to make the amendments to ensure that this area of law is far clearer and far more effective.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-03-26,"—In rising to contribute to this debate tonight, I would like to echo the sentiments of some of the speakers in the other place on this bill—the sentiment being that this bill is long overdue. The Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002 is yet another example of the government shutting the gate long after the proverbial horse has well and truly bolted. Every time this issue has been raised in this place during question time, the minister's response has been to sneer at the Labor senators and accuse us of envy. That is their approach—yet another wedge, it would seem. The bottom line in all of this is that the Australian taxpayers and shareholders are well and truly fed up with the extraordinary behaviour of corporate directors and senior executives. This behaviour and their extraordinary rush to get their snouts in the trough sickens our fellow Australians, especially when they stick their snouts in a trough that is nearly empty. I have quoted Abraham Lincoln before, and it is appropriate to do so once again: `Too many piglets, not enough teats.'
I am sure that I will be accused of envy again, but I am talking about applying the rule of law to what has been unregulated greed. This bill is about accountability. If these people in corporate Australia want to pay themselves high salaries and bonuses and, at the same time, allow the company to be run into the ground, there must be redress for the shareholders and creditors, including employees. No longer should they be able to pay themselves big dollars and then run away to do it all over again somewhere else. The government's response is belated. No matter how often we raised the issue, the government dismissed it, and at the death knell they have brought in this legislation. 
Let us be clear about one thing: this bill does not address all the deficiencies that exist in the area of corporate governance. For example, it does not extend to senior executives. Our fellow Australians, like ourselves, struggle to understand how someone can be paid a huge salary, get a bonus and leave when the company does not perform. Senator Murray referred earlier to the example of the Commonwealth Bank. It has been only weeks since we saw the unedifying procession of AMP directors from their particular boardroom. They had just seen a massive loss—they had seen the share price slump— and they all got a nice little payment to ease their pain on the way out. 
But what has been done to ease the pain of the mum and dad shareholders who have seen their portfolios collapse as a result of their corporate governance? In one word: nothing. They say, `Don't worry; you'll get a new board.' No doubt they too can get a nice little earner whether the company performs or not. This is an absolute farce—high farce, in fact, in the world of high finance. You can perform badly, you can stuff the company up and you can still keep going and get paid. Does that rule apply to ordinary, everyday Australians? Not on your life. Too many mistakes or poor performance and out you go. As a director or senior executive, you get paid for bad or good performance. What a fraud. I have noticed from recent news reports that the former CEO of AMP has accepted his severance pay and has banked it, but he has reserved the right to seek redress in the courts. He takes over $3 million and has the hide to reserve the right to take legal action. No doubt AMP will settle to save costs so, yet again, the shareholder is going to get it in the neck.
During the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation, a number of submissions were received. The Australian Institute of Company Directors raised a number of concerns about the legislation. Of gravest concern was the failure of the government to consult with concerned parties. Their submission states: 
AICD has unsuccessfully endeavoured to have our views heard on this subject for over twelve months. Indeed, it has been disappointing that our more recent requests to the Government for a copy of the Bill were rebuffed.
This raises some serious issues about the genuineness of the government's approach. The AICD believe that the government, by taking this approach, has failed to use the provisions of existing laws to take action against directors. The AICD argue that ASIC should be provided with sufficient resources to take appropriate action. They also make the point that the focus of this legislation is only on directors and that it fails to address the problems of senior executives.
Another submission came from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. ASFA stated that they thought that the four-year time limit leading up to a company's liquidation was inappropriate, given that the law regarding corporate record retention requirement was for a longer period. If you do not like those two organisations, CPA Australia believe that the scope of this bill does not go far enough. They said in their submission that the bill: 
... should address the granting of benefits (including bonuses) to directors (and others such as chief executives); the recovery of unreasonable payments; and protect the interests of shareholders as well as creditors.
Any reasonable person would agree that, when the CPA are highlighting these concerns, there is a problem. Yet again, this government does as little as possible, just to make the issue go away. The CPA make a number of suggestions to improve the legislation, but we are unsurprised that the government does not take up any of these suggestions.
The Australian Stock Exchange made a number of points in relation to the legislation as well. One of their suggestions is that payments made while the company is solvent should not be covered under the provisions of the act. The other striking suggestion is that the four-year period of time to review transactions is excessive. The ASX seem to have adopted the view that what went on in the past is not relevant to the present. They seem to suggest that a transaction made four years ago that benefits a director or an associate should not be included. To my mind, this flies in the face of the available evidence that shows that companies do not collapse overnight. Of course actions taken in the lead-up to a collapse are as relevant as those taken immediately prior to the company folding.
The ACTU submission covers the issue of executive remuneration and makes the point that, in 2002, average annual remuneration for the top 100 CEOs increased by a massive 38 per cent to $2 million. This now represents 44 times average weekly earnings, an increase from 34 times average weekly earnings in the previous year. That staggering amount is over $10,000 per week. This ridiculous and obscene amount of money is at a time when the government can only support an increase of less than $20 a week for average Australians. Let me see whether I have this right: a $20 a week increase for the majority, but a $10,000 a week increase for the minority—the top 100. The government can sit over there and support a system that allows increases of over $10,000 per week for the CEOs and about $20 a week for everybody else. 
This is a government that cannot even come up with a reasonable increase for the staff working directly for them—and for all the rest of us, I might add. I understand that the current offer to MOPS is a whopping great four per cent increase. But in return for that, they have to work longer hours. Contrast that four per cent for the people who work directly for the government with the 38 per cent that the government lets senior executives get. The ACTU believe, like most other submissions, that this bill should extend to senior executives as well as directors. They believe that it creates uncertainty by not defining an unreasonable transaction. Finally, they also believe that it does not go to excessive remuneration when the company is solvent.
The IPAA, the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia—the people who are charged with winding up the companies that these well-paid directors and executives allow to go to hell in a handbasket, so to speak—also suggest a number of improvements. These include the insertion of a new section which they state in their submission: 
... will give a clear and unambiguous message to officers and management of companies and provide liquidators with the necessary legal framework within which to pursue unreasonable direct or related transactions.
The IPAA also raise the concern that one of the problems with this is the extensive litigation required to recover the payments. They say this is of particular concern, especially regarding companies known as phoenix companies. It is interesting to note, on the day that a report on a $60 million attack on the construction unions has been tabled, that the report remains largely silent on this sleazy method of asset stripping, going into liquidation and reappearing under yet another name. The IPAA points are well made in this regard.
This legislation does not go far enough, it is not clear enough and it fails the test of reasonable law. It is designed so that the government can pretend to the Australian people, and especially to the Australian shareholders, that they are taking steps to protect their money. But this legislation just tinkers with the edges and does not go far enough. Based on the submissions that were received by the Economics Legislation Committee, one would have thought it reasonable to make some changes to this legislation. Nothing that this government have done is about a total solution to the problem. Like so many other pieces of legislation we are faced with, like so much else where this government are concerned, they are doing all they can to get the issue off the front pages of the newspapers so that they can slip back into their lethargic, arrogant, hands-off style of government.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-03-26,"—I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002. This is fundamentally an issue of corporate accountability. Many Australians, in fact most Australians, are rightly concerned about the issue of corporate accountability and corporate governance, particularly as many Australians find it hard to make ends meet. They are still confronted with the spectre of unreasonable executive remuneration, particularly in the context of companies whose share values are falling or, even worse, where they are insolvent. HIH and One.Tel are amongst many other examples of where our corporate sector has unfortunately not behaved or performed as well as we consider it ought to.
There are some obvious prudential issues associated with some of these corporate collapses, but there is the broader issue beyond corporate insolvency that deals with accountability in relation to remuneration and with how directors' remuneration and bonuses ought to be treated. I think most Australians would agree that if a company goes into liquidation it is not fair, in that context, for directors to walk away with significant payouts whilst employees of the companies await their longstanding entitlements, often endlessly, and end up either not being paid at all or being paid a very small proportion of the amounts they are owed. It really does offend basic principles of fairness to see that occur in the context of corporate collapse, where you see the top end of the company sailing along just fine and employees who have devoted themselves to the company not being paid out basic entitlements.
It is appropriate that this legislation is introduced; it is unfortunate, however, that it is introduced in this form. There are a number of key issues that the Labor Party has voiced in relation to this legislation. To put those in a nutshell, it simply does not go far enough. It does not go far enough on the issue of executive remuneration and it does not go far enough in relation to transparency, disclosure and ensuring that shareholders are actually getting value for money when their companies enter into contracts with executive directors or when directors take inappropriate bonuses.
It seems strange in this policy context that we have a continued opposition by the Howard government to properly dealing with the issue of executive remuneration and corporate governance. Yet we also have the same Howard government, as other senators before me have identified, opposing what one would consider to be reasonably minimal wage increases for working Australians. As Senator Conroy pointed out, the Prime Minister, through the government, has opposed any wage increase above $10 a week for ordinary working Australians for the past seven years. However, he is not prepared in the legislation his minister has introduced into this parliament to deal properly with the issue of executive remuneration and to put in place legislation that can effectively allow administrators to recoup moneys that should not have been paid to directors when a company becomes insolvent. 
Let us remember that, in the context of corporate insolvency, what we are talking about is a limited pool of money and people making claims on it. I think many Australians are tired of seeing their life savings—in the sense of entitlements they have built up over the years—not paid out because the company is insolvent, but then see the directors and executives of those companies walking away with unreasonably high packages. We can go through many examples of that. One I had particular involvement was with the Ansett workers, many of whom are still waiting for what are basic entitlements but who have seen unreasonable redundancy packages paid to those who hired and fired them.
I am very pleased to be able to speak on this legislation tonight. I am disappointed that the government is refusing to really deal with the issues of transparency and accountability in the area of corporate governance. They are key measures towards better democratising companies. It seems to me that democratisation of companies is a primary way in which you can ensure proper corporate accountability and, to that end, ensure better shareholder value for the investment the shareholders make in these listed companies. 
The first issue I want to address is that of executive remuneration. It is a pity that this bill is limited to circumstances of corporate insolvency. That is an important measure to ensure that you increase the source of funds that can be properly applied to appropriate purposes, and it is appropriate that bonuses paid to directors are in the pool of funds that can be turned to in the context of insolvency. However, we say that there is a loophole in the legislation, that it does not go far enough. It limits the things that a liquidator can reclaim from an unreasonable director related transaction made within four years of a company appointing a liquidator.
We are concerned that the definition of what in fact constitutes an unreasonable director related transaction could create a loophole, and appears to create a loophole in respect of certain benefits. It does not appear to capture all transactions between directors and companies, and a very good example of that is share options, whereby the options issued to a director would be clearly captured by the definition but any profit made on the exercise of those options would not be captured. So one could foresee a scenario where a company which goes into liquidation could claw back the original value of the options but, if those options had been exercised at a time when the share value was significantly higher, that additional profit would not be something that the liquidator could turn to. For this reason it is appropriate that Labor's amendments to the definition of unreasonable director related transactions be supported. That would capture this particular benefit and would give more certainty to the definition.
The second area I want to speak about is the importance of ensuring transparency of the links between boardroom pay and company performance. We have had quite a few examples in Australia where you would have to say that that link has not been properly established. An example that was referred to in the other place was that of AMP. Whilst I do not like to name any particular persons, the former CEO of AMP took over $3.3 million in the same year as the AMP share price was slashed by more than a quarter. I am sure the mums and dads and other Australians who were investing in AMP at the time would have questioned whether that was appropriate, given that their investment had quartered.
Australia really is lagging behind many other countries in relation to this area. The United Kingdom has regulations which are designed specifically to improve the transparency of links between boardroom pay and company performance. One would not have thought that that was a particularly revolutionary concept. To try to ensure that what companies pay their executives is reasonably related to the performance of the companies is surely exactly what people are being paid for. Whilst Labor are not saying we are going to be overly prescriptive and regulate everything, we are saying there should be appropriate measures in place to improve transparency so that shareholders actually understand what their company is paying their executives for. 
I understand that the Labor Party is also moving amendments to include executives in this bill, not simply directors. That is highly appropriate. We have had numerous examples of excessive executive remuneration, and those executives may not be directors. It would be inappropriate for them to be excluded from the ambit of this legislation. It would be totally ridiculous to have a situation where you had directors' bonuses in an insolvent company being able to be retrieved by the liquidator for the purposes of meeting other debts but you could not retrieve non-director executives' bonuses in the same context.
On the issue of transparency, I note Senator Conroy has already indicated that Labor propose an amendment to the Corporations Act that would require listed companies to put to their shareholders an annual, non-binding resolution on the remuneration report. This is an example of trying to establish policy settings to ensure transparency within, and disclosure of, remuneration. We are not saying we will cap it. We are not saying we will be overly prescriptive in our regulation, as is often the cry from the other side. What we are saying to companies is this: if you are going to pay these people these salaries or these packages you should be required to disclose that. You should be required to tell your shareholders that you are doing it and why you are doing it and, as appropriate, justify the contracts that you have entered into. We are not suggesting that there is no freedom of contract; there obviously is. What we are suggesting with regard to publicly listed companies is that there is obviously a significant public interest associated with the management of those companies. There are many Australian families who invest in shares and they are entitled to have companies actually turn their minds to the issue of whether or not the remuneration that is being sought by executives is commensurate with the value that those persons are putting into the companies. It is really not a particularly radical proposition.
Again on the issue of transparency, I note that Labor is proposing an amendment to the act which would require the publication of a report not only on directors but also on the five highest paid executives. The amendment would also require the disclosure of the board's policy in relation to executive remuneration. We are seeking that the report should include performance conditions to which any entitlement is subject, certain performance graphs showing historical information on the company's performance against relevant criteria and the equity value protection schemes entered into in relation to remuneration. These are amendments designed to increase the transparency of company policy on executive remuneration. This is simply saying to corporate Australia: if you wish to enter into arrangements with people it is appropriate that you disclose those arrangements, and the policy behind them, to your shareholders. Most workers, most employees in Australia are subject to various duties in terms of their work performance and they are subject to performance criteria. Should it not be the same for executives? What is wrong with shareholders actually being entitled to understand that basis on which these decisions are made?
I want to talk briefly about the issue of superannuation funds. I have heard quite often over the last few years the statements by the Prime Minister and other ministers in the government about Australia being the world's greatest shareholding democracy. The reality is that a significant number of shares in this shareholding democracy are held by superannuation funds. It would therefore seem that the government does not have a lot of basis on which to oppose amendments which seek to improve democracy for shareholders and seek to ensure that superannuation funds participate in what is an onerous responsibility, and that is their investment in very many Australian companies which are publicly listed. 
Seventy per cent of managed funds in Australia are invested through superannuation products, and hundreds of billions of dollars are invested by those funds. We say that it is appropriate to require trustees to do certain basic things in relation to the massive investment for which they are responsible: to exercise their votes, to disclose their voting record and to explain why it was in the best interests of their clients to have voted this way. One would think that those are precisely the sorts of things that trustees should be doing, particularly given that they are entrusted with such a significant amount of the money of Australians.
Labor's amendments and its whole approach to this area have focused on transparency and disclosure as being the best methods of ensuring that executive remuneration and directors' remuneration is appropriate. It is an issue of accountability. What can possibly be wrong with increased accountability? I await the government's response to these amendments. I understand that they are not supported, but one would have thought that accountability was a pretty reasonable concept. We say self-regulation has not yielded the outcomes that benefit either the investor or the employee and that it is important that the law sets out certain policy settings and prescriptions which seek to facilitate increased disclosure, transparency and accountability. Shareholders are entitled to this and we, as a parliament, ought to ensure that shareholders do indeed get appropriate value for their investments.
Senator CROSSIN (Northern Territory) (9.01 p.m.)—I seek leave to have incorporated in the Hansard some speaking notes from Senator Sherry on the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002. I understand these have already been approved.
Leave granted.
The notes read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002, and in particular, on the amendments which will moved by Senator Conroy as they relate to super funds.
Senator Conroy will move an amendment, that makes it mandatory for trustees of superannuation funds regulated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to:
·	exercise their votes;
·	disclose their voting record; and
·	explain why it was in the best interests of their clients that they voted in this manner.
The amendments would not apply to small funds like self-managed funds and some of the smaller corporate funds.
Appropriate carve outs will also be made where these changes would be inappropriate, for example, where another type of small super fund may not have the resources to comply without a significant increase in fees and charges they would have to impose on their members. Regulations will provide these exceptions.
The goal is not to compromise the fact super funds exist to provide a savings vehicle for their members to maximise retirement income. The Labor Party will consult with industry representatives to ensure this goal is not compromised.
It is important to note that these amendments increase the level of activism required of super funds trustees and I regard that as being a good thing when it comes to protecting and growing the investments of their members.
Many super funds are already engaged in this level of activism, but sadly many simply allow such decisions to go through to the keeper. That must change and Labor's amendments will ensure such changes are guaranteed.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-26,"—At the outset I would like to say something that is often said but often not said earnestly, and that is thank you to the honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002. About the only contributors to debates on Corporations Law issues over recent years—going back about six, nearly seven years—have been Senator Murray, Senator Conroy and me, with the odd angry shot fired by some senators from time to time. I do welcome Senator Wong and Senator Webber to the debate on this important area of law and, as the government describes it, the economy. In my time in the Senate—and I have been involved in most of the debates on the Corporations Law since 1990—the interest in this area of the law has been contained to a very small number of senators, so I do earnestly welcome senators to the debate. There may come a time when the baton has to be handed over to a new generation of people who focus on the Corporations Law. It is a bit of an exclusive club, unfortunately. 
The building of this great shareholder democracy has been caused by a number of factors. It is fair to give credit to this government for its economic reforms and it is also fair to give credit to the Hawke and Keating governments for a number of their reforms. The superannuation guarantee legislation was certainly a part of that. By ensuring significant funds go into, effectively, mutual funds, or superannuation funds as the majority of them are called here in Australia, it has ensured that we have developed a strong managed fund sector which in turn has ensured the growth of the financial sector overall. So I give credit to the Hawke and Keating governments for some of their reforms, and I give credit to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for their dogged determination to continue the reforms that have built the sector.
I thought Senator Webber was slightly unfair. It may be because she is new here—and I do not say that in any paternalistic or patronising sense—that she may not be aware of the strong reform agenda this government has pursued since 1996 in the Corporations Law area. No-one in this place—not Senator Conroy, Senator Sherry or Senator Murray— would do other than say that this government's commitment to a focus on Corporations Law reform has been anything other than thorough, dedicated, diligent and ongoing. Most people in industry acknowledge this when I talk about the potential for CLERP 10, 11 and 12, which I say without announcing what those policies may or may not be, because they do not exist.
No-one who has been through the process of the consultation on and implementation of CLERP 1; CLERP 2; CLERP 3; CLERP 4; CLERP 5; CLERP 6, which became the Financial Services Reform Act; CLERP 7, which is before the parliament tomorrow in relation to the reform of ASIC's interactions with the business community; CLERP 8, which has been announced and is out for public consultation now in relation to cross-border insolvency reform; and CLERP 9, which is before the government at the moment and is the most significant legislative reform in upgrading corporate disclosure in Australian history, could say other than that there has not been a massive focus and a massive delivery of substantial and, in many respects, world leading and, in some respects, revolutionary reform of the Corporations Law to develop a pro-business environment based on the premise that shareholders need to be well informed and to be empowered. Anyone who comes to the debate and says that this government has some sort of lazy approach to it either is trying to score a cheap and uninformed shot or is simply naive.
One of the lessons that I have learned, and that I think we should all learn about reform in this area, is that you are doomed to failure if you accept a proposition, grab it, put it into a law, bring it into this place, pass it out and cross your fingers and hope it is effective— and I will come to why that approach has failed in relation to section 300A of the Corporations Act, which was inserted by the parliament in 1999. The approach that has been developed through the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program has, not just in the law reform that it has delivered but also in the process that it has developed, stood Australia in very good stead. This has been at a time when world capital markets and world securities, the financial markets and the financial systems, have been under the greatest threats to their stability and to the faith in the markets and the citizens that they serve across the globe arguably since 1929-1930. That is how much stress the system has been under with the Asian financial meltdown and a range of other collapses and, of course more recently, the corporate collapses of the late nineties and the last couple of years.
The corporate remuneration disgraces that have occurred have added to that potential instability and the reduction in faith of many shareholders in the market and in the efficacy and trustworthiness of many of the captains of industry and people who run Australia's corporations and other investment companies. It is not of course restricted to Australia. I think we have had examples in many other jurisdictions. 
The approach that the government has put in place in terms of the process that surrounds CLERP, as the acronym has come to be known—the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program—with the support in most instances of the opposition, the Australian Democrats and other interested parties has developed for Australia a sound mechanism for creating good policy, and it will be a legacy which will continue, I hope, for the benefit of future governments of either political persuasion. Over the past seven years that mechanism has involved the government issuing a broad policy platform suggesting the area where reform will focus, developing then a detailed policy proposal paper—and we have now issued nine of those over the past six years—allowing broad community consultation conducted by me and by Treasury officers, and involving the regulator very closely, and taking that consultation document through cabinet processes and turning it into legislation. We then allowed that legislation to have further consultation so that the practitioners, the people who use the law, the people who are subject to the law and, most importantly, the people who tend to prosecute breaches of the law and take cases in relation to that law can, using their experience, look closely at, firstly, how those laws can be applied and, most importantly from the government's perspective, how compliance can be achieved by the regulator and how surveillance can take place. So we have developed that process.
I also created the Business Regulation Advisory Group chaired by Catherine Walter, which provides yet another process of consultation by experts who can also go out to their constituencies and seek broader comment in terms of an expert group. That group now has in it people of the calibre— and I do not want pick out individuals but I will pick out well-known ones—of as John McFarlane from the ANZ Bank and a range of other eminently qualified people including representatives of small and medium enterprise, and I pick out Mike Potter from the Small Business Coalition for his contribution on that board. 
So it is a thorough process. It has ensured that Australia has not reacted in a populist, knee-jerk way to the challenges of collapses particularly in the United States, but certainly here as well. It has allowed Australia to address these issues in two ways. Firstly, it has allowed us to address them from a position of strength. No-one in this place, unless they were wanting to score cheap political points, would say that the Australian financial system and corporate regulatory system is anything other than robust. It is internationally regarded, and that does owe some considerable thanks to the reforms that took place from 1996 onwards under our government. It is also a credit to people like Mr Ray Schoer at the Stock Exchange, back in the late eighties, who invented continuous disclosure. He invented the concept of disclosing material facts that shareholders know to the market in real time. No other jurisdiction has yet to catch up on that. The Americans are still asking us how we do it and trying to copy it. In America disclosures take place often three months after the event. Australia is in good condition but it can be improved. CLERP 9 is the most substantial reform of corporate disclosure, and improvements to corporate disclosure in the history of this nation and, I think it is fair to say, internationally. In relation to this bill, it also builds on a history of reform under this government to insolvency measures over the life of the government. We do not come to this as a Johnny-come-lately. We have a consistent history of reform in this area. This adds to those reforms.
I will deal with the specific details of the amendments to the core measures in the bill in the committee stage. But, just briefly, Senator Conroy has mentioned that he will be moving amendments, for example, to ensure that directors who reap benefits from the sale of their options will be captured. The bill provides for that already. It ensures that the court may make a range of orders in relation to the property that a person must repay to a company. These would include an order to pay to the company an amount that represents the benefits that the person received as a result of the transaction. 
In seeking to define uncommercial transactions, for example, the opposition amendments introduce some new elements which will add uncertainty to the bill's operation or simply limit its operation. In fact, they will constrain what this bill seeks to do. They are counterproductive. They will achieve a lower outcome than that which we are trying to achieve. They will constrict the reach of the bill because, under the opposition's amendments, a court would need to consider how close to the winding-up the payment was made, thereby shortening the four years proposed by the government.
In relation to making the legislation retrospective to the date of the Prime Minister's announcement, our advice is that it would be in contradiction of the constitutional requirement on the Commonwealth to acquire property on just terms and, because of the retrospective application, would risk its entire validity. That is not a risk we would be prepared to take. We want it to act prospectively, to have the full force of the law and to be valid. We do not want to be challenged when we first use this law sometime down the track and have it fail on constitutionality. Senator Conroy's other amendments are in relation to subsidiaries and I will deal with them in some detail.
I turn to two other issues which I call `tacked' amendments—amendments that have been tacked on to the bill. They relate specifically to, in the first instance, a gathering of proposals to deal with an upgrading of section 300A of the Corporations Law. Section 300A was inserted into the law by the Senate on a motion moved in similar terms by both parties; I think in the end it was a Labor amendment supported by the Democrats and not opposed by the government. This evening I have re-read the Hansard transcript of that debate, and in it I warned the Senate of the danger of legislating in the way we did then—of not testing it and not getting the definitions right. I think we would all agree now that that provision has not worked. The government recognised that when last year we put out proposals to reform it. They are still out for public comment under the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. We sent them out to Labor attorneys-general. The only response I have had has been from my ministerial council colleague Jim McGinty, the Attorney-General of Western Australia, who has made some constructive comments about them.
The government has been committed, as I have said, to a process of improving corporate disclosure through CLERP 9. I have developed a series of proposals which we are consulting on and which will go to cabinet in the very near future. They will be the subject of an announcement, obviously after the cabinet meeting, and will be the subject of CLERP 9 legislation which will be tabled in the parliament or given public exposure very shortly after it is drafted. Of course, that will be after the cabinet decision. If you read my speech in Hansard of Thursday, 25 June 1998, you will see that this is an issue that the government have not shied away from. It is an issue that should be dealt with thoroughly. Most jurisdictions in the world have grappled with it.
The Labor amendment has been drafted without any consultation with the users of the law or shareholders in Australia. In fact, consultation on the ALP amendment on remuneration took place in a major capital of the world. It was not the city of Brisbane, it was not the city of Sydney and it was not the cities of Adelaide or Perth. Consultation on the Labor provisions took place in the city of London, because the provisions they seek to put into the law tonight are, in Senator Conroy's style, a direct copy of the UK regulations. They are not even subtly disguised; they are almost word for word. I would be happy to table the UK regulations which have been—dare I say it—copied. I would not say plagiarised, because that is a bit harsh. That mirrors the policy development approach that Senator Conroy took in relation to the ALP's banking policy before the last election, when their policy was basically taken from the Australian Bankers Association. That is not a diligent way to legislate and it is not a diligent way to make policy. I will ask for leave to table that document later. I will table it. 
Senator Conroy's amendments would require disclosure up to 12 months after the event and would allow shareholders to look at it but to have no real power over it. The government's commitment, made publicly already, is for real-time, up-front disclosure when the contracts are entered into. That will give shareholders power. That will be relevant disclosure which will put market pressure on companies to ensure their remuneration policies and corporate disclosures are up to modern standards.
Senator Wong said that she had heard the coalition were going to oppose Senator Conroy's amendments in relation to superannuation trusts. We have had no position on those amendments because, although we had been trying on an hourly basis to see them since they were announced in Hobart yesterday, we received them at 8.40 p.m. So for us the amendments are not even an hour old. The concept of getting managed funds to vote their shares is a very good one. The performance in Australia has not been good, but it is improving. The Labor Party has little credibility in this area when it wants to force super funds to vote their shares. If a super fund votes its shares and a member of that fund does not like the way it has voted, what does the member do about it? Most super funds do not allow members to vote for the trustees, so they cannot vote them out. Because of Labor's intransigence on super choice, if they do not like the way the trustees are behaving, they cannot even leave the fund. So when you talk about the democratisation of superannuation, you talk with a forked tongue. (Time expired)
—Is there something to be tabled?
—It has been tabled, Senator Crossin.
—We have not seen whatever it was.
—Ministers and parliamentary secretaries have rights to table, I am advised, in the performance of their government duty.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-03-26,"—Today Mr Tony Abbott, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, tabled the final report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. This report is most welcomed by the small contractors and individual workers who were the victims of the unlawful activity undertaken by big unions and big business. The small contractor sector in our home state of Tasmania made numerous representations to me seeking this royal commission. In July 2001 I publicly called for such a royal commission and wrote to all my cabinet colleagues urging such a course. I am delighted that a royal commission was appointed and the story of union abuse has now been able to be told.
In particular, the royal commission devoted a section of its report to Tasmania—45 pages in all. Those 45 pages detailed chapter and verse the unlawful and inappropriate actions in the construction industry. There is an African proverb which says, `When elephants mate, the grass gets trampled.' And this royal commission has highlighted that when big unions and big business get together the rights of workers and small contractors are trampled. At this point I pay tribute to the Master Plumbers Association, represented by Adrian Cowie, the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation, represented by Michael Shepperd, and the Housing Industry Association, which at the time was represented by Peter Geeves, for their valiant pursuit of truth and justice in the building industry in Tasmania. Their representations were first rate, credible and persuasive.
Within a short seven days the royal commissioner heard about and found 13 separate incidents of unlawful conduct in Tasmania. On top of that, there were 15 types of inappropriate conduct identified, some of which the royal commissioner believes ought to be outlawed. I agree. But the conduct largely has at its foundations union threats, union intimidation and, at best, weak big business leaders or willing participants. The royal commission quite rightly calls for a change in this culture. It also makes the interesting finding that the state of workplace relations in Tasmania relates mainly to decisions made by union officials outside Tasmania. At page 421 the commissioner points out that the circumstances occurred not because of any pressure from or unrest or discontent of employees but in consequence of union officials in Victoria demanding the Tasmanian workers be forced into union based and approved enterprise bargaining agreements. The Master Builders Association brokered these negotiations between the unions and the four major builders. Why the MBA would do such a foolish thing is unclear, even to the royal commissioner. He found no apparent benefit to the Master Builders Association or its membership. Nevertheless, this treachery had a profound effect. As the royal commissioner found: 
The pattern EBAs in the industry in Tasmania are not in truth:
(a) relevant to the enterprise in question;
(b) a bargain freely struck between employer and employee; or
(c) the result of unpressured agreement on the part of many employers and employees.
That is a quote from page 422 of the report. As a result of this practice, we have witnessed the destruction of freedom of association and freedom of bargaining in the Tasmanian construction industry.
I draw particular attention to pages 436 and paragraphs 118 through to 122, which detail the strong and courageous stand taken by Mr Rudie Sypkes of Chickenfeed Bargain Stores against the conspiracy of the CEPU and Hansen Yuncken against a quality small contractor Parmic Pty Ltd. The thuggery and intimidation was thwarted on that occasion because of the moral courage and strength of Mr Sypkes. What a pity the builders did not show similar integrity and fortitude.
Another example of the unions' thuggery is highlighted at page 437. There the case of Mr Childs, a sole trader, is described in relation to the Woolstore Apartments project. He signed the EBA because of the builders' and unions' threats. As a result, he had to increase his charge out rate by $10 per hour to $55 per hour. Remember, he was a sole trader. The report on page 438, paragraph 125, states:
The experience of Childs in relation to the Woolstore Apartments project illustrates the extent to which unthinkingly Vos—
the builder—
and the union enforced the requirement of a union-endorsed EBA on the Woolstore Apartments project. In essence it required Childs to make an agreement between himself as an employee and himself as an employer.
How ridiculous. How shameful. It would be funny if it were not so very serious.
Another important finding of the royal commission is to be found on page 447. The report states:
By a letter dated 21 February 2002 addressed to this Commission, the Tasmanian Government contended that unlawful or otherwise inappropriate industrial or workplace practises or conduct `are not features of the building and construction industry in this State'.
The commissioner's finding in the next paragraph was:
That contention is unsustainable.
He goes on to say:
This Commission heard evidence of widespread unlawful or otherwise inappropriate conduct in the Tasmanian building and construction industry. The evidence suggested that the situation in the State is worsening. The Commission has found widespread unlawful and inappropriate conduct in Tasmania concerning freedom of association, freedom of bargaining, OH&S, and right of entry upon premises.
One may wonder how a premier could be so out of touch with the realities in his state. Mr President, you and I know, coming from Tasmania, that the Labor Premier of Tasmania is a former secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation, the notorious BLF. With that background, to seek to assert that he was not aware of those activities in the building industry simply defies belief. That he had the audacity to say to a royal commission, through his department, that these types of practices are not features of the building and construction industry in this state really shatters his credibility.
The royal commissioner was very polite when he said that assertion or contention was unsustainable. He went on to refer to `the evidence of widespread unlawful or otherwise inappropriate conduct in the Tasmanian building and construction industry' and suggested that the situation in Tasmania is worsening. I cannot believe that the Premier was not aware of that. I believe that the Premier, the former secretary of the BLF, was seeking to deliberately mislead the royal commission and to send the royal commission off the scent in relation to these matters.
I commend the royal commissioner on his hard work and on his findings, and I suggest that the Premier of Tasmania needs to recognise his responsibilities as premier. He needs to remember that being candid with a royal commission is a lot more important than being a sycophantic apologist for the building unions that have wrought so much disruption to the building industry in our home state of Tasmania.
