Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:32):  I indicate to the chamber that there will be some amendments that I will not be proceeding with. I am reading the sense of the chamber that I am going to go down in a screaming heap on a number of my amendments. However, there are a number of broader issues that I still want to canvass and ask the government some questions on and to get certain things on the record for implementation of the bill and also for interpretation of the bill. So I indicate that I will be withdrawing some of our amendments, because I have canvassed the broader issues that some of them relate to and some of them are dependent on other amendments that have already gone down.



The CHAIRMAN:  It may be easiest if we continue through the running sheet and, as we approach those particular amendments, you indicate them then.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I provided the information to the chamber so that people know where I am going with this debate.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move Greens amendment (16) on sheet 7676:

Chapter


1A—Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan





33A


Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan



(1) The Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure an Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan is developed, and prepared in written form, as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act.


(2) The Plan must include:


   (a) how Australia will meet obligations relating to biosecurity risk under the Biodiversity Convention; and


   (b) how Australia will meet obligations relating to biosecurity risk under Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy, as in force from time to time; and


   (c) how Australia will meet any other obligations relating to biosecurity risk that the Agriculture Minister, or the Environment Minister, considers relevant.


(3) The Agriculture Minister or the Environment Minister must consult the following when developing and preparing the Plan:


   (a) Indigenous groups;


   (b) industry groups;


   (c) State and Territory governments;


   (d) local governments;


   (e) public sector entities;


   (f) conservation organisations;


   (g) any other interested groups;


   (h) the general community.




33B


Variation of Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan



(1) The Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister may vary an Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan.


(2) However, the Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must not vary an Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan unless the persons and groups mentioned in subsection 33A(3) have been consulted.




33C


Environment Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan must be published



      The Environment Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan must be published on:


   (a) the Agriculture Department's website; or


   (b) the Environment Department's website.




33D


Review of Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan



      The Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must cause a review of the Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action plan to take place:


   (a) within 5 years after the Plan is first developed; and


   (b) once every subsequent 5‑year period.




33E


Reporting requirements



(1) As soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, the Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must prepare a joint report on the implementation and operation of the Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan during the previous 12 months.


(2) The report must be included in the annual report of:


   (a) the Agriculture Department; and


   (b) the Environment Department.


This amendment relates to an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan, specifically to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for the Environment taking all reasonable steps to ensure that an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan is developed and prepared in written form as soon as practicable after the commencement of this act. This is important because it is an essential component and complement to biosecurity laws.


We believe that biosecurity strategy and action plans that identify the priorities, targets and actions necessary to achieve national environmental goals are absolutely essential and must complement this process. The guiding principles for the implementation of article 8(h) of the Convention on Biological Diversity emphasise their importance and identify important elements. The proposed biosecurity strategy would encompass and build on existing strategies and address other invasive species categories, such as invertebrates, fungi and pathogens, and prioritise gaps. It is important to note that invertebrates, fungi and pathogens are often left off people's thinking, and we know how important they are. The development and implementation of these plans should manifest a partnership approach and meaningfully involve the community and the environmental sectors. The community has been arguing very strongly to have in place this strategy and an action plan, which is basically an implementation plan. We think these are important amendments, and those have been our reasons for wanting these amendments. I suspect that the government does not support this amendment, but I would like to hear from the government what it intends to do about putting in place a strategy and action plan/implementation plan.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:35):  I am advised by my ministerial colleague that the government will not be supporting your proposed amendment to develop and publish an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan. It is difficult to isolate environmental biosecurity risks within the overall system because the system operates to manage all biosecurity risks. Dealing with environmental biosecurity as a separate issue or function may actually act to the detriment of the system as a whole.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:38):  I indicate that I will move Australian Greens amendments (40) and (41) on sheet 7676 together. Obviously, I am seeking leave to do so. These amendments relate to injunctions by interested persons.



The CHAIRMAN:  Can I take it that you will not be proceeding with all the amendments prior to that on the running sheet?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Most of those relate to matters that we have traversed and on which I have gone down in a screaming heap. I am prioritising the issues for debate in the chamber.



The CHAIRMAN:  Leave to move the amendments together is granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move Australian Greens amendments (40), and (41) on sheet 7676 together:


(40) Clause 528, page 519 (after line 14), at the end of subsection (2), add:


   ; (c) an interested person (other than an unincorporated organisation); or


(d) a person acting on behalf of an unincorporated organisation that is an interested person.


(41) Clause 528, page 519 (after line 22), at the end of the clause, add:




Meaning of interested person—individuals



(5) For the purposes of an application for an injunction relating to conduct or proposed conduct, an individual is an interested person if the individual is an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia, and:


   (a) the individual's interests have been, are, or would be affected by the conduct or proposed conduct; or


   (b) the individual engaged in a series of activities for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity, at any time in the 2 years immediately before:


      (i) the conduct; or


      (ii) in the case of proposed conduct—making the application for the injunction.




Meaning of interested person—organisations



(6) For the purposes of an application for an injunction relating to conduct or proposed conduct, an organisation (whether incorporated or not) is an interested person if it was incorporated, or otherwise established, in Australia, and one or more of the following conditions are met:


   (a) the organisation's interests have been, are, or would be affected by the conduct or proposed conduct;


   (b) if the application relates to conduct—at any time during the 2 years immediately before the conduct:


      (i) the organisation's objects or purposes included the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity; and


      (ii) the organisation engaged in a series of activities related to the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity;


   (c) if the application relates to proposed conduct—at any time during the 2 years immediately before the making of the application:


      (i) the organisation's objects or purposes included the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity; and


      (ii) the organisation engaged in a series of activities related to the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity.


These amendments are about injunctions by interested persons and relate to issues around third-party review and injunction rights. They provide third-party rights for review of decisions to seek injunctions to restrain unlawful activity equivalent to those available under the EPBC Act for decisions and activities relating to imports of live specimens. Appeal rights under the Biosecurity Bill are lopsided and provide only for import applicants. Providing appeal rights to people acting in the public interest equivalent to the existing rights under the EPBC Act should improve the quality of decision making and increase accountability. We think it is particularly important that others are able to seek these injunctions and take these actions. As I articulated, we are looking for the equivalent activity that is available under the EPBC Act. Unfortunately, this bill does not provide for that. As I said, the appeal rights are lopsided. We think these are important amendments that deal with very significant issues.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if providing the information would contravene another law of the Commonwealth.


This amendment relates to the biosecurity advisory council. It is an issue that both industry and environment groups are particularly interested in. We believe that there is a need for greater ability for the government to seek advice from a process that is outside government and that the government should be putting in place a process that enables them to seek advice from those that are outside the system, from people with a range of expertise in biosecurity issues, from an industry perspective, an expert perspective and an environmental perspective. If the government are not prepared to support this amendment, what are they prepared to do? 


The functions of the biosecurity advisory council would include: to promote a coordinated strategic response to biosecurity issues; to promote the shared responsibility in minimising all levels of biosecurity risk; to provide a forum for discussing significant biosecurity issues in relation to meeting Australia's ALOP; to provide policy advice on biosecurity issues to the minister for agriculture and the states and territories; to liaise with the Inspector-General of Biosecurity, which the government has now very significantly put in place; if requested to do so, to provide advice on matters of biosecurity to the minister for agriculture; to engage in public consultation; and any other functions conferred on the council by this act and another law of the Commonwealth. 


We think this is a particularly important function. As I said, if the government are not prepared to support this amendment, I would ask them what arrangements they are prepared to put in place that extend the ability for input from such a body of experts in industry, environmental protection or academia and other areas of expertise needed to address biosecurity issues.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:43):  The government does not support Greens amendment (45), which, as Senator Siewert has outlined, seeks to establish a biosecurity advisory council. The proposed council does not need legislative powers to support its role. It could be established administratively. The department regularly utilises the expertise of consultative committees and groups to provide advice and coordinated approaches to management of biosecurity, including with state and territory governments, scientists, primary producers, farming associations and environmental NGOs, and does not require legislative power to engage or establish these groups.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:44):  I note the government said that it could be put in place administratively. I make two points there. We want this in the legislation so that it is permanently there, because the current government may be committed to doing something—and I will seek that commitment in a moment—but it does not bind future governments, and that is our concern. I know there is a bit of difference of opinion between the way we see legislation and the way the government sees legislation; we actually believe there are certain things that need to be embedded in legislation and not left to administration—whether it be purely by a process that is set up, or by a regulation or a delegated instrument; those things actually need to be the legislation. That is why we think this should be in legislation—because it is such an important issue. So I will get that on the table: we think this has to be there in legislation and not left just to administration.


I ask the government: are they intending to set up such an advisory committee? And what is their time frame for setting up such an advisory committee? Is it going to be done by regulation? And if so, when do we expect to see those regulations?

(3) In performing its functions, the Eminent Scientists Group must comply with any directions given to the Group by the Director of Biosecurity.




566R


Appointment of Eminent Scientists Group members



(1) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group is to be appointed by the Director of Biosecurity by written instrument.


Note: For reappointment, see section 33AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.


(2) The Director of Biosecurity must, in appointing members to the Eminent Scientists Group, ensure that the composition of the Eminent Scientists Group reflects the diversity of the interests in the matter or matters that the Group will be dealing with.


(3) The Director of Biosecurity may designate a member of the Eminent Scientists Group as the Chair of the Group.




566S


Terms and conditions of Eminent Scientists Group members



(1) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group holds office for the period determined by the Director of Biosecurity.


(2) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group holds office on the terms and conditions (if any) in relation to matters not otherwise covered by this Act that are determined by the Minister.


(3) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group may resign his or her appointment by giving the Director of Biosecurity a written resignation.


(4) The Director of Biosecurity may at any time terminate the appointment of a member of the Eminent Scientists Group.


As we know, the Eminent Scientists Group is a body for which there is a lot of strong support. We believe that this is an essential component of how we deliver biosecurity, and that the Eminent Scientists Group is a key part of delivering for biosecurity.


The functions of such a group would be to review and report on biosecurity—draft BRIA reports prepared by the department; submissions received on any draft BRIA reports; whether all relevant matters relating to the likely economic, social and environmental consequences of a disease or pest emerging, entering, establishing itself or spreading in an Australian territory or a part of the Australian territory have been considered in such reports; and whether the conclusions of a provisional BRIA are scientifically reasonable based on material presented.


We have articulated in our amendments that the Eminent Scientists Group must give the report on a review under section 1 within 60 days of receiving the draft BRIA report; that the group be appointed; that a member of such a group holds office for a period determined by the department; that a member of the group holds office on terms and conditions—in relation to matters not otherwise covered by this act—that are determined by the minister; that a member of the group must resign his or her appointment by giving a written resignation; and that—obviously—we believe that we need a group of eminent scientists who are able to conduct independent review of the BIRA reports. As I said, we believe this is an essential component of biosecurity risk analysis, and it is concerning to us that this has not been better considered in this legislation. We know that there is a lot of a strong support both in the industry and particularly in environment groups for such a group. Such a group has existed in the past and has provided excellent support, so we ask the government to reconsider this amendment to establish such a group.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:51):  I understand the government would not be supporting this amendment. I am deeply concerned. Again, it is the same argument as for the advisory group: we do not think it is appropriate to include this in delegated legislation and regulation. It is a key part of the approach that we take to biosecurity risk assessment and, therefore, it should be part of the legislation. The same argument stands: if it is in regulation, it is much easier to get rid of that regulation under a new government. This is long-term legislation. The Quarantine Act was in place for a very long time, and it has taken a long time to amend. You could not get rid of such a scientific group if it was actually in the legislation as easily as you could if it was in regulation. It takes a lot more thought to get that process changed. So our argument stands that the establishment of this particular group, because of its essential role in biosecurity risk assessment, should actually be part of the legislation. 


I ask the government: when is the regulatory process going to be undertaken to put this body in place? What is the time frame for that and how soon can we expect to see it?

I am double-checking that I have discussed all the broader issues that I sought to discuss, that I have sought from the government the assurances that I wanted to seek about how we are going to implement this legislation and about getting it as rigorous as possible. The one area that we have not traversed is the general biosecurity obligation, which is Australian Greens amendment (38)—I beg your pardon, I am going backwards. I move Australian Greens amendment (38) on sheet 7676:


(38) Page 412 (after line 21), after clause 427, insert:




427A


Biosecurity industry participant must mitigate risk when carrying out biosecurity activities



(1) A biosecurity industry participant contravenes this subsection if:


   (a) the biosecurity industry participant is authorised to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with an approved arrangement covering the biosecurity industry participant; and


   (b) the biosecurity industry participant knows, or ought reasonably know, that carrying out the activity is likely to pose a biosecurity risk; and


   (c) the biosecurity industry participant fails to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent or minimise the risk.


Note 1: See section 427 in relation to when a biosecurity industry participant is authorised to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with an approved arrangement covering the biosecurity industry participant.


Note 2: The physical elements of an offence against subsection (2) are set out in this subsection.




Fault
‑based offence



(2) A person commits an offence if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Penalty:   Imprisonment for 5 years or 300 penalty units, or both.




Civil penalty provision



(3) A person is liable to a civil penalty if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Civil penalty:   120 penalty units.




427B


Requirement to mitigate risk when carrying out biosecurity activities



(1) A person contravenes this subsection if:


   (a) the person:


      (i) handles or deals with goods that are subject to biosecurity control; or


      (ii) is an operator, person in charge of, or otherwise associated with, a conveyance that is subject to biosecurity control; or


      (iii) is in a biosecurity response zone; or


      (iv) is subject to a determination under subsection 445(1); or


      (v) has been given a direction under paragraph 446(1)(a); or


      (vi) has a human biosecurity control order in force in relation to them; or


      (vii) is subject to a requirement determined under subsection 477(1); or


      (viii) is subject to a direction given under subsection 478(1); or


      (ix) is subject to any other obligation under this Act; and


   (b) the person engages in conduct; and


   (c) the person knows, or ought reasonably know, that the conduct is likely to pose a biosecurity risk; and


   (d) the person fails to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent or minimise the risk.


Note: The physical elements of an offence against subsection (2) are set out in this subsection.




Fault
‑based offence



(2) A person commits an offence if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Penalty:   Imprisonment for 5 years or 300 penalty units, or both.




Civil penalty provision



(3) A person is liable to a civil penalty if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Civil penalty:   50 penalty units.


This amendment relates to the general biosecurity obligation that requires all biosecurity participants to exercise a general biosecurity obligation to take all reasonable and practicable measures to prevent and minimise biosecurity risks with provisions similar to those in Queensland's Biosecurity Act 2014, which is one of the most modern of the acts around Australia.


The amendment will create an offence of accepting goods knowing, suspecting or in wilful disregard of whether the goods are illegally imported or derived from illegally imported goods. We think this is important because, no matter how comprehensive biosecurity laws are, there will inevitably be myriad actions and omissions contributing to biosecurity risks that are not addressed.


The bill review expressed and emphasised the importance of biosecurity as a shared responsibility which requires that biosecurity participants not only obey the law but generally take care to observe, report and minimise biosecurity risks, requiring all biosecurity participants to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent and minimise biosecurity risk. This will help achieve shared responsibility. This type of obligation was included in Queensland's Biosecurity Act 2014 and was proposed by the New South Wales government in its Biosecurity Bill 2014.


We believe that it is important that this general obligation is in place, to ensure that we require all participants in the process to a favourable and to make sure that they do take particular care. This whole bill is about our recognition that biosecurity is so important to our environment and to industry. This amendment will enforce that process. I ask the government why it will not support this amendment, particularly as the subject matter has already been included in the modernising of state and territory biosecurity legislation.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:57):  The government, as Senator Siewert knows, does not support this proposed amendment. A broad, general obligation on the community with potentially higher penalty levels is problematic to administer. In relation to an additional provision on biosecurity industry participants, an offence on biosecurity industry participants—clause 428 of the bill—makes it an offence for a biosecurity industry participant to fail to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with their approved arrangement. The primary outcome of these agreements is to manage biosecurity risk, so the government believes that the amendment is not necessary. The bill, through division 8 of part 1 of chapter 3 and clause 431, also imposes obligations on persons in charge of goods and biosecurity industry participants to report biosecurity incidents, with penalties for non-compliance.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:59):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (36) and (37) on sheet 7676:


(36) Page 395 (after line 24), at the end of Part 2, add:




411A


Publication of approved arrangement



(1) The relevant Director must publish, on the relevant Department's website, a proposed arrangement that is approved under this Part as soon as practicable.


(2) An approval that is published under subsection (1) must include:


   (a) any conditions to which the approved arrangement is subject; and


   (b) the period for which the approved arrangement is to be in force.


(3) The published approval must not include any protected information.


(37) Page 398 (after line 25), at the end of Part 3, add:




416A


Publication of variation to approved arrangement



(1) The relevant Director must publish, on the relevant Department's website, the following as soon as practicable:


   (a) any variations to the conditions of an approved arrangement under this Division;


   (b) any variations to approved arrangements.


(2) The published variations must not include any protected information.


I indicate that these will be the last amendments that I will be moving. These amendments relate to the public release of approved arrangements to be published on the departmental website. The problem that a lot of community members are having—and there has been a long history of this—is that biosecurity is in fact characterised by a lack of transparency. We believe that publishing of approved arrangements would allow greater oversight. These amendments have the support of a wide variety of stakeholders. We believe it is important that these arrangements are released. I understand that some arrangements may be commercial-in-confidence. I understand that process, but we think that this should not stop some form of the release of these approved arrangements. 


I understand that the government are going to say no to these amendments—they have telegraphed that fairly clearly—but I ask the government what they are prepared to do to increase transparency on this issue. I think it would help a lot in terms of people understanding how they come to decisions and the broader community's understanding of biosecurity.

As approved arrangements are voluntary agreements between private entities and the government, the information is protected information and may represent confidential, commercial or sensitive information which is not appropriate to publish. Having said that, over the implementation period the government is happy to examine ways of progressing further transparency, but being ever mindful of the importance of commercial confidentiality.

Chapter


1A—Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan





33A


Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan



(1) The Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure an Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan is developed, and prepared in written form, as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act.


(2) The Plan must include:


   (a) how Australia will meet obligations relating to biosecurity risk under the Biodiversity Convention; and


   (b) how Australia will meet obligations relating to biosecurity risk under Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy, as in force from time to time; and


   (c) how Australia will meet any other obligations relating to biosecurity risk that the Agriculture Minister, or the Environment Minister, considers relevant.


(3) The Agriculture Minister or the Environment Minister must consult the following when developing and preparing the Plan:


   (a) Indigenous groups;


   (b) industry groups;


   (c) State and Territory governments;


   (d) local governments;


   (e) public sector entities;


   (f) conservation organisations;


   (g) any other interested groups;


   (h) the general community.




33B


Variation of Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan



(1) The Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister may vary an Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan.


(2) However, the Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must not vary an Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan unless the persons and groups mentioned in subsection 33A(3) have been consulted.




33C


Environment Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan must be published



      The Environment Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan must be published on:


   (a) the Agriculture Department's website; or


   (b) the Environment Department's website.




33D


Review of Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan



      The Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must cause a review of the Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action plan to take place:


   (a) within 5 years after the Plan is first developed; and


   (b) once every subsequent 5‑year period.




33E


Reporting requirements



(1) As soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, the Agriculture Minister and the Environment Minister must prepare a joint report on the implementation and operation of the Environmental Biosecurity Strategy and Action Plan during the previous 12 months.


(2) The report must be included in the annual report of:


   (a) the Agriculture Department; and


   (b) the Environment Department.


This amendment relates to an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan, specifically to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for the Environment taking all reasonable steps to ensure that an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan is developed and prepared in written form as soon as practicable after the commencement of this act. This is important because it is an essential component and complement to biosecurity laws.


We believe that biosecurity strategy and action plans that identify the priorities, targets and actions necessary to achieve national environmental goals are absolutely essential and must complement this process. The guiding principles for the implementation of article 8(h) of the Convention on Biological Diversity emphasise their importance and identify important elements. The proposed biosecurity strategy would encompass and build on existing strategies and address other invasive species categories, such as invertebrates, fungi and pathogens, and prioritise gaps. It is important to note that invertebrates, fungi and pathogens are often left off people's thinking, and we know how important they are. The development and implementation of these plans should manifest a partnership approach and meaningfully involve the community and the environmental sectors. The community has been arguing very strongly to have in place this strategy and an action plan, which is basically an implementation plan. We think these are important amendments, and those have been our reasons for wanting these amendments. I suspect that the government does not support this amendment, but I would like to hear from the government what it intends to do about putting in place a strategy and action plan/implementation plan.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:35):  I am advised by my ministerial colleague that the government will not be supporting your proposed amendment to develop and publish an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan. It is difficult to isolate environmental biosecurity risks within the overall system because the system operates to manage all biosecurity risks. Dealing with environmental biosecurity as a separate issue or function may actually act to the detriment of the system as a whole.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:38):  I indicate that I will move Australian Greens amendments (40) and (41) on sheet 7676 together. Obviously, I am seeking leave to do so. These amendments relate to injunctions by interested persons.



The CHAIRMAN:  Can I take it that you will not be proceeding with all the amendments prior to that on the running sheet?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Most of those relate to matters that we have traversed and on which I have gone down in a screaming heap. I am prioritising the issues for debate in the chamber.



The CHAIRMAN:  Leave to move the amendments together is granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move Australian Greens amendments (40), and (41) on sheet 7676 together:


(40) Clause 528, page 519 (after line 14), at the end of subsection (2), add:


   ; (c) an interested person (other than an unincorporated organisation); or


(d) a person acting on behalf of an unincorporated organisation that is an interested person.


(41) Clause 528, page 519 (after line 22), at the end of the clause, add:




Meaning of interested person—individuals



(5) For the purposes of an application for an injunction relating to conduct or proposed conduct, an individual is an interested person if the individual is an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia, and:


   (a) the individual's interests have been, are, or would be affected by the conduct or proposed conduct; or


   (b) the individual engaged in a series of activities for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity, at any time in the 2 years immediately before:


      (i) the conduct; or


      (ii) in the case of proposed conduct—making the application for the injunction.




Meaning of interested person—organisations



(6) For the purposes of an application for an injunction relating to conduct or proposed conduct, an organisation (whether incorporated or not) is an interested person if it was incorporated, or otherwise established, in Australia, and one or more of the following conditions are met:


   (a) the organisation's interests have been, are, or would be affected by the conduct or proposed conduct;


   (b) if the application relates to conduct—at any time during the 2 years immediately before the conduct:


      (i) the organisation's objects or purposes included the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity; and


      (ii) the organisation engaged in a series of activities related to the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity;


   (c) if the application relates to proposed conduct—at any time during the 2 years immediately before the making of the application:


      (i) the organisation's objects or purposes included the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity; and


      (ii) the organisation engaged in a series of activities related to the protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or research into biosecurity.


These amendments are about injunctions by interested persons and relate to issues around third-party review and injunction rights. They provide third-party rights for review of decisions to seek injunctions to restrain unlawful activity equivalent to those available under the EPBC Act for decisions and activities relating to imports of live specimens. Appeal rights under the Biosecurity Bill are lopsided and provide only for import applicants. Providing appeal rights to people acting in the public interest equivalent to the existing rights under the EPBC Act should improve the quality of decision making and increase accountability. We think it is particularly important that others are able to seek these injunctions and take these actions. As I articulated, we are looking for the equivalent activity that is available under the EPBC Act. Unfortunately, this bill does not provide for that. As I said, the appeal rights are lopsided. We think these are important amendments that deal with very significant issues.


Question negatived.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if providing the information would contravene another law of the Commonwealth.


This amendment relates to the biosecurity advisory council. It is an issue that both industry and environment groups are particularly interested in. We believe that there is a need for greater ability for the government to seek advice from a process that is outside government and that the government should be putting in place a process that enables them to seek advice from those that are outside the system, from people with a range of expertise in biosecurity issues, from an industry perspective, an expert perspective and an environmental perspective. If the government are not prepared to support this amendment, what are they prepared to do? 


The functions of the biosecurity advisory council would include: to promote a coordinated strategic response to biosecurity issues; to promote the shared responsibility in minimising all levels of biosecurity risk; to provide a forum for discussing significant biosecurity issues in relation to meeting Australia's ALOP; to provide policy advice on biosecurity issues to the minister for agriculture and the states and territories; to liaise with the Inspector-General of Biosecurity, which the government has now very significantly put in place; if requested to do so, to provide advice on matters of biosecurity to the minister for agriculture; to engage in public consultation; and any other functions conferred on the council by this act and another law of the Commonwealth. 


We think this is a particularly important function. As I said, if the government are not prepared to support this amendment, I would ask them what arrangements they are prepared to put in place that extend the ability for input from such a body of experts in industry, environmental protection or academia and other areas of expertise needed to address biosecurity issues.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:43):  The government does not support Greens amendment (45), which, as Senator Siewert has outlined, seeks to establish a biosecurity advisory council. The proposed council does not need legislative powers to support its role. It could be established administratively. The department regularly utilises the expertise of consultative committees and groups to provide advice and coordinated approaches to management of biosecurity, including with state and territory governments, scientists, primary producers, farming associations and environmental NGOs, and does not require legislative power to engage or establish these groups.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-05-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:44):  I note the government said that it could be put in place administratively. I make two points there. We want this in the legislation so that it is permanently there, because the current government may be committed to doing something—and I will seek that commitment in a moment—but it does not bind future governments, and that is our concern. I know there is a bit of difference of opinion between the way we see legislation and the way the government sees legislation; we actually believe there are certain things that need to be embedded in legislation and not left to administration—whether it be purely by a process that is set up, or by a regulation or a delegated instrument; those things actually need to be the legislation. That is why we think this should be in legislation—because it is such an important issue. So I will get that on the table: we think this has to be there in legislation and not left just to administration.


I ask the government: are they intending to set up such an advisory committee? And what is their time frame for setting up such an advisory committee? Is it going to be done by regulation? And if so, when do we expect to see those regulations?

Senator FIFIELD

Is the government intending to set something up specifically on the basis that you have proposed—not at the moment. But the government is very happy to have discussions with you, Senator.

We are very keen to progress those discussions, at least—given that you are not going to support this amendment—to get a firmer process, such as one using a delegated instrument or a regulation, by which to put in place an advisory committee.


I accept that invitation to hold further discussions about how we can progress that advisory committee and about how we can put such a committee in place in a way that is not just administrative; in terms of not having any form of protection for its existence. I thank the minister for that commitment.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:47):  I move Greens amendment (46) on sheet 7676, which relates to the Eminent Scientists Group:


(46) Page 556, at the end of Chapter 10 (after proposed Part 6), add:



Part


7—Eminent Scientists Group





566P


Establishment of Eminent Scientists Group



      The Eminent Scientists Group is established by this section.




566Q


Functions of Eminent Scientists Group



(1) The Eminent Scientists Group has the function of reviewing and reporting to the Director of Biosecurity on the following:


   (a) draft BIRA reports prepared by the Director of Biosecurity;


   (b) submissions (if any) received in response to draft BIRA reports;


   (c) whether all relevant matters relating to the likely economic, social and environmental consequences of a disease or pest entering, emerging, establishing itself or spreading in Australian territory or a part of Australian territory have been considered in the draft BIRA reports;


   (d) whether the conclusions of a provisional BIRA report are scientifically reasonable, based on the material presented.




Timing of the report



(2) The Eminent Scientists Group must give the Director of Biosecurity the report on a review under subsection (1) within 60 days of receiving the draft BIRA report.




Directions from Director of Biosecurity



(3) In performing its functions, the Eminent Scientists Group must comply with any directions given to the Group by the Director of Biosecurity.




566R


Appointment of Eminent Scientists Group members



(1) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group is to be appointed by the Director of Biosecurity by written instrument.


Note: For reappointment, see section 33AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.


(2) The Director of Biosecurity must, in appointing members to the Eminent Scientists Group, ensure that the composition of the Eminent Scientists Group reflects the diversity of the interests in the matter or matters that the Group will be dealing with.


(3) The Director of Biosecurity may designate a member of the Eminent Scientists Group as the Chair of the Group.




566S


Terms and conditions of Eminent Scientists Group members



(1) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group holds office for the period determined by the Director of Biosecurity.


(2) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group holds office on the terms and conditions (if any) in relation to matters not otherwise covered by this Act that are determined by the Minister.


(3) A member of the Eminent Scientists Group may resign his or her appointment by giving the Director of Biosecurity a written resignation.


(4) The Director of Biosecurity may at any time terminate the appointment of a member of the Eminent Scientists Group.


As we know, the Eminent Scientists Group is a body for which there is a lot of strong support. We believe that this is an essential component of how we deliver biosecurity, and that the Eminent Scientists Group is a key part of delivering for biosecurity.


The functions of such a group would be to review and report on biosecurity—draft BRIA reports prepared by the department; submissions received on any draft BRIA reports; whether all relevant matters relating to the likely economic, social and environmental consequences of a disease or pest emerging, entering, establishing itself or spreading in an Australian territory or a part of the Australian territory have been considered in such reports; and whether the conclusions of a provisional BRIA are scientifically reasonable based on material presented.


We have articulated in our amendments that the Eminent Scientists Group must give the report on a review under section 1 within 60 days of receiving the draft BRIA report; that the group be appointed; that a member of such a group holds office for a period determined by the department; that a member of the group holds office on terms and conditions—in relation to matters not otherwise covered by this act—that are determined by the minister; that a member of the group must resign his or her appointment by giving a written resignation; and that—obviously—we believe that we need a group of eminent scientists who are able to conduct independent review of the BIRA reports. As I said, we believe this is an essential component of biosecurity risk analysis, and it is concerning to us that this has not been better considered in this legislation. We know that there is a lot of a strong support both in the industry and particularly in environment groups for such a group. Such a group has existed in the past and has provided excellent support, so we ask the government to reconsider this amendment to establish such a group.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:50):  The government does not support the proposed amendment. The government has outlined its intention to provide for external scientific input into the biosecurity import risk analysis process within supporting regulations and administrative guidance.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-05-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:51):  I understand the government would not be supporting this amendment. I am deeply concerned. Again, it is the same argument as for the advisory group: we do not think it is appropriate to include this in delegated legislation and regulation. It is a key part of the approach that we take to biosecurity risk assessment and, therefore, it should be part of the legislation. The same argument stands: if it is in regulation, it is much easier to get rid of that regulation under a new government. This is long-term legislation. The Quarantine Act was in place for a very long time, and it has taken a long time to amend. You could not get rid of such a scientific group if it was actually in the legislation as easily as you could if it was in regulation. It takes a lot more thought to get that process changed. So our argument stands that the establishment of this particular group, because of its essential role in biosecurity risk assessment, should actually be part of the legislation. 


I ask the government: when is the regulatory process going to be undertaken to put this body in place? What is the time frame for that and how soon can we expect to see it?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:54):  We traversed quite a lot of the issues in the debate, yesterday. I am double-checking that I have discussed all the broader issues that I sought to discuss, that I have sought from the government the assurances that I wanted to seek about how we are going to implement this legislation and about getting it as rigorous as possible. The one area that we have not traversed is the general biosecurity obligation, which is Australian Greens amendment (38)—I beg your pardon, I am going backwards. I move Australian Greens amendment (38) on sheet 7676:


(38) Page 412 (after line 21), after clause 427, insert:




427A


Biosecurity industry participant must mitigate risk when carrying out biosecurity activities



(1) A biosecurity industry participant contravenes this subsection if:


   (a) the biosecurity industry participant is authorised to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with an approved arrangement covering the biosecurity industry participant; and


   (b) the biosecurity industry participant knows, or ought reasonably know, that carrying out the activity is likely to pose a biosecurity risk; and


   (c) the biosecurity industry participant fails to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent or minimise the risk.


Note 1: See section 427 in relation to when a biosecurity industry participant is authorised to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with an approved arrangement covering the biosecurity industry participant.


Note 2: The physical elements of an offence against subsection (2) are set out in this subsection.




Fault
‑based offence



(2) A person commits an offence if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Penalty:   Imprisonment for 5 years or 300 penalty units, or both.




Civil penalty provision



(3) A person is liable to a civil penalty if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Civil penalty:   120 penalty units.




427B


Requirement to mitigate risk when carrying out biosecurity activities



(1) A person contravenes this subsection if:


   (a) the person:


      (i) handles or deals with goods that are subject to biosecurity control; or


      (ii) is an operator, person in charge of, or otherwise associated with, a conveyance that is subject to biosecurity control; or


      (iii) is in a biosecurity response zone; or


      (iv) is subject to a determination under subsection 445(1); or


      (v) has been given a direction under paragraph 446(1)(a); or


      (vi) has a human biosecurity control order in force in relation to them; or


      (vii) is subject to a requirement determined under subsection 477(1); or


      (viii) is subject to a direction given under subsection 478(1); or


      (ix) is subject to any other obligation under this Act; and


   (b) the person engages in conduct; and


   (c) the person knows, or ought reasonably know, that the conduct is likely to pose a biosecurity risk; and


   (d) the person fails to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent or minimise the risk.


Note: The physical elements of an offence against subsection (2) are set out in this subsection.




Fault
‑based offence



(2) A person commits an offence if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Penalty:   Imprisonment for 5 years or 300 penalty units, or both.




Civil penalty provision



(3) A person is liable to a civil penalty if the person contravenes subsection (1).


Civil penalty:   50 penalty units.


This amendment relates to the general biosecurity obligation that requires all biosecurity participants to exercise a general biosecurity obligation to take all reasonable and practicable measures to prevent and minimise biosecurity risks with provisions similar to those in Queensland's Biosecurity Act 2014, which is one of the most modern of the acts around Australia.


The amendment will create an offence of accepting goods knowing, suspecting or in wilful disregard of whether the goods are illegally imported or derived from illegally imported goods. We think this is important because, no matter how comprehensive biosecurity laws are, there will inevitably be myriad actions and omissions contributing to biosecurity risks that are not addressed.


The bill review expressed and emphasised the importance of biosecurity as a shared responsibility which requires that biosecurity participants not only obey the law but generally take care to observe, report and minimise biosecurity risks, requiring all biosecurity participants to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent and minimise biosecurity risk. This will help achieve shared responsibility. This type of obligation was included in Queensland's Biosecurity Act 2014 and was proposed by the New South Wales government in its Biosecurity Bill 2014.


We believe that it is important that this general obligation is in place, to ensure that we require all participants in the process to a favourable and to make sure that they do take particular care. This whole bill is about our recognition that biosecurity is so important to our environment and to industry. This amendment will enforce that process. I ask the government why it will not support this amendment, particularly as the subject matter has already been included in the modernising of state and territory biosecurity legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:57):  The government, as Senator Siewert knows, does not support this proposed amendment. A broad, general obligation on the community with potentially higher penalty levels is problematic to administer. In relation to an additional provision on biosecurity industry participants, an offence on biosecurity industry participants—clause 428 of the bill—makes it an offence for a biosecurity industry participant to fail to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with their approved arrangement. The primary outcome of these agreements is to manage biosecurity risk, so the government believes that the amendment is not necessary. The bill, through division 8 of part 1 of chapter 3 and clause 431, also imposes obligations on persons in charge of goods and biosecurity industry participants to report biosecurity incidents, with penalties for non-compliance.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:59):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (36) and (37) on sheet 7676:


(36) Page 395 (after line 24), at the end of Part 2, add:




411A


Publication of approved arrangement



(1) The relevant Director must publish, on the relevant Department's website, a proposed arrangement that is approved under this Part as soon as practicable.


(2) An approval that is published under subsection (1) must include:


   (a) any conditions to which the approved arrangement is subject; and


   (b) the period for which the approved arrangement is to be in force.


(3) The published approval must not include any protected information.


(37) Page 398 (after line 25), at the end of Part 3, add:




416A


Publication of variation to approved arrangement



(1) The relevant Director must publish, on the relevant Department's website, the following as soon as practicable:


   (a) any variations to the conditions of an approved arrangement under this Division;


   (b) any variations to approved arrangements.


(2) The published variations must not include any protected information.


I indicate that these will be the last amendments that I will be moving. These amendments relate to the public release of approved arrangements to be published on the departmental website. The problem that a lot of community members are having—and there has been a long history of this—is that biosecurity is in fact characterised by a lack of transparency. We believe that publishing of approved arrangements would allow greater oversight. These amendments have the support of a wide variety of stakeholders. We believe it is important that these arrangements are released. I understand that some arrangements may be commercial-in-confidence. I understand that process, but we think that this should not stop some form of the release of these approved arrangements. 


I understand that the government are going to say no to these amendments—they have telegraphed that fairly clearly—but I ask the government what they are prepared to do to increase transparency on this issue. I think it would help a lot in terms of people understanding how they come to decisions and the broader community's understanding of biosecurity.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (10:01):  On this matter at this time, we will need to agree to disagree. The government does not support proposed amendments (36) and (37). As approved arrangements are voluntary agreements between private entities and the government, the information is protected information and may represent confidential, commercial or sensitive information which is not appropriate to publish. Having said that, over the implementation period the government is happy to examine ways of progressing further transparency, but being ever mindful of the importance of commercial confidentiality.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise to draw the chamber's attention to a recent decision of the Federal Court, sitting in Western Australia, wherein the Maritime Union of Australia and the labour hire firm Offshore Marine Services were successfully prosecuted by the Fair Work Ombudsman for breaches of the Workplace Relations Act and the Fair Work Act. Each of these respondents was fined and ordered to pay compensation to a married couple, Bruce and Lynne Love, whom the court assessed as a 'salt of the earth' couple, who were in 2009 seeking employment in the maritime domain of the Western Australian oil and gas industry as ship stewards. The union and the hire firm were ordered to pay some $800,000, inclusive of some $80,000 in penalties, with the balance being compensation paid directly to the Loves. The fines and compensation were imposed by the court for the breaches of the Workplace Relations Act and the Fair Work Act as a result of the union imposed 'closed shop' in employment within the maritime domain in the oil and gas industry in Western Australia—in other words, a 'no ticket, no start' as well as a 'closed shop, jobs for the boys' regime run by the MUA in Western Australia.


This case underlines and reaffirms the importance of a strong legislative framework giving clear powers to those agencies charged with the duty of protecting against, prosecuting and preventing such illegal industrial practices. Indeed, that is precisely the sort of legislation this Senate passed on Monday of this week to protect our building and construction industry from such union thuggery. The union was fined $79,200, with the labour hire firm given a much lesser penalty of only $7,500.


The facts of the case were that the Loves had applied for work as ship stewards through Offshore Marine, the hire company, which was keen to hire them but told them they would first have to join the MUA. Accordingly, they applied to the union for membership and were refused. His Honour, Mr Justice Gilmour, found that the couple would have been 'above average employees' and free of an 'entitlement mindset'. The Loves had travelled to Perth from Melbourne and had specifically undertaken several courses to obtain the necessary qualifications to secure their jobs, all at their own expense.


The Loves were the victims of an illegal closed shop orchestrated by the Maritime Union of Australia. This unlawful practice was accommodated by Offshore Marine, which did not contest the prosecution and to some extent was also a victim of the bullying and illegitimate standover tactics of the MUA. Having been told by an employee of Offshore Marine that they would need to join the MUA, the Loves attended the union offices on several occasions, only to be refused membership. They had completed an elementary first aid certificate course, a fire prevention and firefighting course and a personal safety course, and received training in social responsibility and personal survival techniques. They had also obtained maritime passports, all at their own expense, all whilst they themselves were under considerable financial pressure.


Their experience with the union, as set out in His Honour's reasons, indicates very clearly that there was no employment in the maritime domain in Western Australia unless such employment was accompanied by union membership. Membership of the MUA is at the whim of its officials and is not a qualification or membership freely available or obtained. His Honour's reasons set out a pattern of abusive and coercive conduct on the part of the state secretary and other union officials. The judge took into account abusive phone calls to the hire firm by such union officials, clearly indicating that, if you do not employ unionists, you will have industrial strife. His Honour found that a series of memos between the hire firm and the union in the context of the abusive phone calls recorded a 'closed shop arrangement', patently in breach of both the aforementioned pieces of legislation. It is important to note in reviewing what has happened in the court that the union called no witnesses and adduced no evidence in its own defence, and the time for the lodgement of an appeal has now passed.


The MUA and its bullying and standover type tactics have been a significant blot on the industrial landscape in Western Australia for many years. This situation has rendered WA ports as amongst the most inefficient in Australia, and in cost terms they compare very unfavourably to similar port operations around the world. This is completely unacceptable for an export oriented state like Western Australia. David Byers, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, has said:


… the MUA controls access to the supply chain in every facet of offshore oil and gas—exploration, feasibility, construction, operations and maintenance.


Companies like Woodside, Chevron and Shell have their schedules and overall productivity completely at the mercy of the MUA. Unionised construction site costs are clearly among the highest in the world, well above comparable project costs in the North Sea and in Houston in the United States. The result is that Shell are now building an offshore floating LNG facility, not in Australia. Woodside are going the same way and have shelved James Price Point, at a cost of some 8,000 Australian jobs. James Price Point was in fact a $40 billion development. Following the shelving of this project, Woodside immediately looked to acquire an interest in a Canadian LNG project. The blow-out in Chevron's costs at its Gorgon development has caused a reassessment of the go-ahead for the $10 billion fourth gas train on Barrow Island.


In WA, we have potential for almost $200 billion of oil and gas projects, with billions of dollars of future exports and royalties at stake. There is a further $100 billion worth of projects currently under consideration and evaluation. All of this would be under direct threat if there were a continuation of conduct as seen in this case by the MUA. The Business Council of Australia has maintained that Australian oil and gas projects require 30 to 35 per cent more labour than comparable projects off Houston in the US, because Australian productivity is dramatically lower. 


The bullying and intimidatory coercive conduct of unions, particularly in the offshore and construction industries in Western Australia, discloses the entrenchment of union thuggery in my home state of WA. Deliberate intimidation and the enforcement of a closed shop by the MUA is an example of what is at the heart of this nationally damaging blight. His Honour, in imposing some of the highest monetary penalties yet seen in the workplace-relations arena, explained that one of the contributing factors for this was the unions' 'significant number of prior contraventions of similar legislation'. This case sends a strong message that the imposition and enforcement of a closed shop will not be tolerated in today's—and future—workplace environments.


I wish to record, here in the Senate of the Australian parliament, my appreciation to His Honour for the very thorough way he has adjudicated this case over more than four years and I congratulate Fair Work Australia on this very successful prosecution.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.


Before I start, I want to touch on one part of today's question time, when Minister Scullion was asked questions by Senator Canavan about the beef industry. I think it should be noted that, I think, about $100 million or $120 million is going into beef roads for upgrades. That is very, very important—I admit that—but I find it the height of hypocrisy for it to be coming from the government, because not long ago the hardworking Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee ably supported me as the chair and my good mate Senator Bullock as an ongoing—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, the motion before—




Senator STERLE:
  I am going to get there, Mr Deputy President, but I have to clarify some misleading information from the government.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not actually the question before the chair, so, as cooperative as I am, please come back to the question before us.




Senator STERLE:
  Okay, let's talk about some of the measures in the budget—and I did refer to $100 million in the budget to beef roads. If you listened to that mob over there, you would think that they gave a damn about the beef industry. With the greatest of respect, the red meat industry would love to have some answers from the minister. Minister Joyce has gone missing in action, through you, Mr Deputy President. If he did give a fat rat's backside about the industry, he would at least have the decency to come back and address their concerns. They have asked for a lousy $4 million of assistance to keep this great industry afloat and they want to talk about best returns to the farm gate. Senator Canavan knows where I am coming from. Senator Canavan has absolutely no doubt where I am coming from. If they did care about the beef industry, which is worth $8.6 billion, they would talk about the real issues of how the industry have put forward a proposal to save themselves, with not a mention of it in the budget.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, I do need to bring you back to the motion before the chair.




Senator STERLE:
  There is not a mention in the budget about that.


Mr Deputy President, regarding the budget, what a calamitous issue we have here. It was only 18 months ago when we had Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey, ably backed up by all the now government senators and members, telling us about some fiscal crisis we had and how they were the only ones who could fix it. They said they would fix this budget emergency not only by toughening up on, in their terms, too much spending or wastage but by making absolutely no cuts anywhere. We even had Minister Cormann, when asked a question by Senator Wong today about how many new taxes there would be, blatantly sit there and say, 'Absolutely none.' I cannot believe that the Australian people think that that mob over there can be believed. How do they think that they can fool the Australian public for another year?


With their big, tough talk and all the action and what they were going to do, we do not have a fiscal crisis; we have a spending crisis. We have a crisis from that mob over there, who have absolutely no idea. They went to the election and the now Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, clearly stated there would be no cuts to certain areas. He clearly stated on more than one occasion—through every media outlet he could get his face on—that there would be no cuts to spending, no cuts to education, no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to pensions. What a disaster. We are at budget No. 2 for Mr Hockey. 


The commentators are clearly saying this is not a budget about what is in the best interests of the nation, this is not a budget about what is in the best interests of the Australian people or the future for Australia's kids, this is about two people. I will quote from some media sources who I would not call raving-mad lefties. One is none other than Mr van Onselen. I do respect and enjoy listening to Mr van Onselen, but he is not one of my mob. He is not a leftie, I can tell you. When I say 'leftie' I mean left of centre. In today's The Australian, on page 13—and this is friendly fire—he said: 'Hockey is delusional that reform is underway; however, I saw him utter the following words last night ….' He quotes Mr Hockey:


… the economic plan laid down by this government more than a year ago, is in place and it is helping us to deal with these challenges. 


Mr Van Onselen goes on to say: 'How? By osmosis? That plan included the shelved Medicare co-payment, dumped changes to pension indexation, a higher-education package twice blocked by the Senate and family tax benefit cutbacks yet to be passed.' He went on to say: 'An economic plan already in place? He must be joking.'


This is not Labor people saying this, these are right-wing media people. He goes on to say—and I agree with every single word—'No wonder Costello thinks they have become a morbid joke.' He is talking about the opposition. The sad part is that there are two jobs on the line: Mr Abbott's, the Prime Minister, and Mr Hockey's, the Treasurer. How long will they last? God help us, but hopefully we will find out sooner rather than later.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-05-13,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (15:09):  I am a bit confused, because I do not think the opposition know where they are heading with this budget. They do not particularly want to talk about last night's budget; they want to talk about last year's budget. That is fine if they want to do that, because we absolutely recognise and stand behind the fact that we did need to make tough decisions last year. We did need to make some difficult and necessary choices for the Australian people because the path we were on was completely unsustainable. Those decisions were made.


The opposition want to talk about last year's budget because that is in their political interest. There were very few questions today in question time about last night's budget, because last night's budget builds on those tough decisions we made last year and allows the Australian people to start reaping the dividends of those tough choices. You are never able to deliver success in life before you do hard work. The only place in the world where success comes before work is in the dictionary. We had to do the hard work last year before we delivered success to the Australian people.


I am confident that last night's budget will build confidence in our economy, particularly among small businesses and farmers. They will then have the confidence to invest and create the jobs and opportunity that only they can create. We cannot do that here, unfortunately. As much power as we think we have, we cannot wave a magic wand and make people have a job and opportunity. We must rely on the individual enterprise of all Australians to bring that about. Last night's budget will help achieve that.


Last night's budget enshrines the fact that taxes will be lower under a coalition government, and that will create more opportunity and confidence in our business sector. Under the previous government, revenue as a percentage of GDP was escalating, going through the roof. You will not hear the opposition talk about it. What you need to look at is not the Labor Party's last budget but the pre-election forecasts done by Treasury and Finance. When you look at the independent numbers that were done before the election, our revenue to GDP was going through the roof, because they came to government when our taxes or revenue to GDP were just 23.3 per cent of GDP. By the election, it had escalated or had gone down and then back up. Under the pre-election forecasts, our taxes to GDP were going to rise to 23.9 per cent of GDP, then to 24.6 per cent of GDP and then finally, in the last year of those forward estimates, 2015-16, to 24.8 per cent of GDP.


Every one of those numbers is now lower. In that final year, the revenue to GDP was 24.2 per cent of GDP, then 24 the previous year and then 23.5.




Senator O'Neill:
  You've killed off confidence; it's gone through the floor. You're going to 25.8!




Senator CANAVAN:
  What they do not quite understand on the other side is that when your economy grows you get higher taxes to GDP. We had a weak economy under the former government, and that is why taxes to GDP fell precipitously in their first years of government. They had plans, in similar years to us, to increase taxes to GDP. If you compare year to year, and that is the appropriate comparison, taxes are now lower under a coalition government than they would have been under a Labor government. They wanted to hit our wealth-producing industries with a carbon tax and a mining tax and put jobs at risk across the whole economy. We are serious in this government. 


I want to take up some of the points that Senator Sterle raised. It is about last year's budget—which they continue to want to talk about. We are serious about achieving serious reform of our spending system. So much of our spending goes towards health and education, but we are on an unsustainable path in growth of those particular spending initiatives. I do not know if the Labor Party reads the budget papers, but on page five of 23 the budget paper states that we spend around $18 billion a year on public hospitals. It is growing at somewhere between six and seven per cent a year at the moment. If that rate of growth continues for 40 years, hospital spending alone will take a third to 50 per cent, depending on how you measure it, of our Commonwealth budget. We cannot do that; it would be absurd. 


Somebody has to be serious here. Some serious people have to sit down and work out how we can deliver the great hospital services we have in this nation affordably. We are the party that is about serious discussions in our nation, about how we can grow jobs and opportunity and a sustainable Public Service. The other side simply wants to oppose. We cannot return to that path.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:14):  I am pleased to speak on this day after the disastrous budget this government has brought down. What a budget of deception, continuing the terrible form that we saw from them last year. While promising less tax and fewer taxes they have delivered 17 new taxes. Minister Cormann had the gall to stand up in this place today and bald-facedly say zero. I will mention just two, because I do not want to spend too much time on it 


There is a new import tax—cost-recovery for licensing import processing. There is a new citizenship tax—cost-recovery for citizenship and increased visa application charges. Those are just two of the 17 that it seems the Minister for Finance has forgotten he okayed in the new budget. They promised less debt and what they delivered in this budget is $12.5 billion of new debt. They have done so much damage to economic and business confidence since they got into government. They have driven confidence through the floor, they have driven unemployment through the roof and they have managed in one year to double the deficit, from $17 billion to $35 billion, yet they continue to stand there and pretend they are great economic managers.


Senator Canavan says we want to talk about last year's budget. We do, because they want everybody to forget that they have still got those savings that they wanted to bank from last year. One-hundred-thousand-dollar degrees remain in their budget calculations; $57 billion in cuts from last year remain in their budget; $30 billion in cuts to education remain. The budget this year retains the very same stench of unfairness that every Australian detected when the government put their budget out last year as well. It is clear that Mr Abbott has simply not learnt from last year's budget. This is the same style. It oozes unfairness. It operates like this government: on a platform of unfairness and misrepresentation.


With regard to health and the appalling attempt at not answering the question that we saw from the minister today, we are seeing a government that simply does not understand the investment in health that is the right of Australians. Last night, in addition to the $57 billion that they cut out last year, they added another $2 billion. Just last weekend, the health minister was promising Australia that the Abbott government would sink its teeth into dental reform, promising $200 million in spending, but the only thing that we can see in this budget that the minister has sunk her teeth into is Australian kids—stealing $125.6 million out of the next four years from Labor's scheme that provided millions of children with dental care through Medicare. That is what is wrong with this government. Look at the policy that they choose to inflict on the nation. They take to children's dental health and they take $125 million out of it. It is a budget that is short-sighted in so many ways. It threatens the future of Australia's health system and it entrenches the fundamental unfairness of this government's very first disastrous budget.


Close to $1 billion is going to be cut from programs that fund preventative health care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and mental health and other crucial health programs. Literally thousands of organisations around the country that do vital work, caring for Australia's most at risk and vulnerable people, will be left reeling from this further assault on their core funding. What have they cut overnight that they want to run away from and hide from? I mentioned the $125 million from the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. There is $144.6 million from the MBS. There is the appalling response we had from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He did not even seem to know that he had cut $70 million from the Department of Veterans' Affairs dental and allied health payments. There is $214 million from e-health and not a single dollar is allocated beyond 2018. There is a bit of a pattern. This government seems to have funded a few things for two years. The science that underpins the policymaking that leads to preventative health does not end in two years. Programs that deserve funding should be funded into the long term. They have cut $252 million from PBS listed drugs. They have cut $72.5 million from health workforce scholarships, wrecking the very fabric of prevention and good health. This Abbott government has gutted Medicare since coming to office. The budget that we saw last night inflicts further damage. The GP tax, no matter what they say, remains. It is just thinly veiled in a freeze on indexation. As every day passes, the people of Australia are seeing more and more. This government cannot be trusted and they have slashed the opportunities for Australia with this budget. (Time expired)

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (15:19):  I probably should remind the Labor Party that we inherited a deficit of $48 billion and the deficit for this budget year is going to be $35 billion, and it is forecast to reduce each year to below $7 billion over the next four years. This is because the coalition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—are careful economic managers. But on the other side we have the Labor Party, led by Bill Shorten. We are almost halfway through Bill Shorten's year of big ideas. So far his only big ideas have been taxes. Bill Shorten should be careful about Tanya Plibersek's big idea, and that is that she is going to become the leader. So I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party response to this budget has been all about saving Bill Shorten's job, because Bill Shorten is on thin ice because the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party is circling. She is circling. She is like one of those—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGrath, I generally do let a few instances of referring to people by their incorrect titles go if it is in the run, but—




Senator McGRATH:
  Okay. The Leader of the Opposition is being circled by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I do apologise, Mr Deputy President. If I were the Leader of the Opposition, I would be certainly locking the Leader of the Opposition's office because the deputy leader is certainly on the war path. This is a great budget for Australia and it is particularly a great budget for small business. I should remind the Labor Party about small businesses, because they do not know what a BAS is. They think BAS is something on the radio dial in their cars. This is a budget for small businesses across Australia, because small businesses are the engine of the Australian economy, and this budget has done fantastic things to grow the small business economy. We should support that.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator McGRATH:
  I am being shouted down by the deputy leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, who has no experience with small businesses. He is probably very good at turning large businesses into small businesses, in terms of when Labor are in power. Through you, Mr Deputy President: that is his experience of small businesses.




Senator Conroy:
  Why did you leave the UK? Why did Boris sack you?




Senator McGRATH:
  I would love to talk about the UK. Let's talk about the UK. Let's look at what happened to Labour in the UK. Let's talk about a Conservative party that had a strong deputy leader and a strong leader. I am happy to talk about the UK until the cows come home and they are milked by the dairy farmers of the Sunshine Coast. I am more than happy to do that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator McGrath, just resume your seat for a moment. I think there has been enough interjection, and I will ask for that to cease. Senator McGrath, please come back to the question before the chair.




Senator McGRATH:
  I will certainly come back to talking about the budget and talking about some of the wonderful measures that will help small businesses in Australia recover from six years of Labor government. In particular, I want to talk about the tax cut that small businesses are going to receive—a 1½ percent tax cut. I think that is fantastic for small businesses. I hope that those opposite in the Labor Party do not oppose this wonderful tax cut. The Liberal Party and the National Party are the parties of lower taxes, and we should be proud of that. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I would love the Labor Party senators to come across and support the lowering of taxes for small businesses.


Also, I want to talk about the ability to deduct assets up to $20,000 from 7.30pm last night. I have a lot of friends in small business and I know that already, last night and today, they have been out looking at what they are going to buy. I think that is a wonderful boost for the economy—in terms of what small businesses can buy, products up to $20,000, to push and grow the economy. I hope that those opposite will also support that. It is a wonderful measure for small businesses in terms of what small businesses can do to grow Australia.


The other thing the budget will do is help everyday Australians to access jobs. Sadly, in some parts of Queensland youth unemployment is still too high. I think we should all come together to work out what we can do to grow the job market in Australia. There is going to be a $1.2 billion national wage subsidy pool to target long-term unemployment. I think that is fantastic. Employers will receive the subsidy from the time they are starting a job, when hiring—when training costs are greatest—rather than waiting six months or more. This will ensure wage subsidies are more effective. This includes reforms to Restart. It will make it easier for small businesses to receive government support sooner when they employ older workers.

Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (15:24):  I have not had the opportunity to come fully to terms with all of the details contained in last night's budget, but at first glance it seems that Treasurer Hockey's second budget is on the up and up—spending up, deficit up, debt up. The government has given up. And, for them, the game is up. The bad news is that the budgetary position which Labor will inherit after the next election will be far worse than that bequeathed to the Liberals. While the deficit which this government confronted upon attaining office was the legacy of the heroic efforts of Wayne Swan in saving this country from the ravages of the global financial crisis, the deficit which we will inherit will simply be a tribute to this government's ineptitude and its lack of vision for Australia's future.


The most telling commentary on this budget is the cartoon in today's Australian of the artist Joe Hockey standing in front of a blank canvas entitled 'Reform'. In this budget, reform is missing. Policy is missing. But, remarkably, also missing is the debt and deficit disaster about which those opposite have been moaning non-stop since I arrived here. Magically, as the spending debt and deficit of this government rises and rises under its watch, talk of a deficit problem has disappeared. It would be no surprise if the next thing to disappear was our AAA credit rating—another gift of Labor to this government.


Today, all the talk is about trajectory. All I can see is a trajectory under this government leading straight downhill. This is a budget that is devoid of a vision and will take Australia nowhere. John Daley of the Grattan Institute is quoted as saying that 'This is a budget that relies on a drift back to surplus', relying on the economy growing as rosily as it predicts. The only credible path charted by this budget is a credible path for higher taxes, with the income tax bill on working people set to rise by 33 per cent between now and 2018-19. Income tax receipts will rise by seven per cent per annum over a period during which wages are forecast to rise by 2½ to three per cent per annum. This burden of higher taxes will particularly be felt by the 1.3 million workers earning between $30,000 and $37,000 a year, who will see their marginal tax rate jump by 14 per cent. These are my people: young full-time job assistants and senior part-timers; people with little money to spare who will be forced by bracket creep to do more than their fair share of heavy lifting to rescue the government from deficit. Once again, this government is placing the burden of budget repair on those who can least afford it. While their fundamental unfair bias remains unaltered, instead of a full frontal attack this year's budget mounts a more insidious attack by stealth, creeping deeper into the pockets of working people.


If the government has bet its future on an income tax led recovery, it needs to factor in more income earners. Predictably, the budget conjures up increased employment. Unemployment is forecast to fall from 6½ to 5¾ per cent. Frankly, I think this number was inserted simply to make the tax receipt numbers stack up rather than being based on any realistic assessment of the economy's capacity to grow employment. Significant employment growth from a government with no plan for jobs is baseless optimism. This is a government which destroyed our motor vehicle industry, a government with no plan for manufacturing, a government which cheers on attempts to reduce penalty rates and working conditions, a government in which the electorate can have no confidence when it comes to job creation. Their plan, such as it is, is to implement a small tax cut for small business, stand back, cross their fingers and hope. This may be a plan but it is only a plan to win the votes of small business people in what will prove to be a vain attempt to hold onto government.


Mr Deputy President, time is against me. I wanted to speak about the counterproductive disincentives to employers contributing to paid parental leave built into the government's long awaited but poorly executed paid parental leave plan. Instead, I will finish by referring to the fine assessment by my friend Senator Canavan of the government's linking of childcare funding to cuts to the family tax benefit. Senator Canavan said:


The system we are proposing massively penalises families where a parent stays home to look after children and we think it does not properly value the benefits of unpaid work.


I could not have said it better myself. A government that values people only in terms of their capacity to contribute through paid employment and cannot appreciate the value of the family— (Time expired)

That this bill be now read a second time.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I would like to thank the Senate for its consideration of my Private Senator's Bill.


In 2007 when the previous Labor Government was elected, we promised to put freedom of information at the core of our agenda to drive a shift to a pro-disclosure mode of governance. Labor went about changing the way in which freedom of information legislation was to be used in order to restore trust and integrity within government and enhance the public's right to know. Changes in the way that government and the public service operate can only be driven directly from the top. This creates a culture where we can advance governance in line with these goals. In government, I attempted to balance the Westminster convention, that governance requires some degree of confidentiality, and the very principles that underpin freedom of information. These two goals are not mutually exclusive; a strong FOI Act must seek to limit the release of certain information, to be balanced against a public interest threshold that favours disclosure. We did this when we were in Government and we will seek to further strengthen these principles in Opposition.


The Freedom of Information Amendment (Requests and Reasons) Bill 2015 seeks to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act) to require government agencies and Ministers to publish the exact wording of freedom of information requests. It will also require government agencies and Ministers to publish a statement of reasons concerning their decision to allow, refuse or edit the release of requested documents.


A key objective of the FOI Act is to ensure that information about the ""operations of departments and public authorities and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices"" is made available to the public.1


The amendments contained in this Bill seek to solidify and advance these core principles which are enshrined within the Act. It facilitates more practical use of freedom of information requests and enhances the principles of accountability and efficiency.


The Bill will achieve the purposes of:



ensuring transparency and accountability are included within the framework of government decisions concerning freedom of information requests;




allowing the public to view requests that have been made and the reasons why documents were or were not released;




allowing applicants seeking similar documents to build upon previous requests; and




reducing the duplication of requests.





These purposes will be achieved in the following ways:





1.


By inserting a new definition of 
""
working day
""
 in the Act to eliminate confusion concerning time frames for publishing information where they include weekends and location-specific public holidays.





2.


Where access to a document has been granted, by removing the option that an agency or Minister may publish on a website mere details of how the information may be obtained. The Bill ensures that 
information is available directly from an agency
'
s or Minister
'
s website, or a link on the website to another website where the information can be downloaded. This measure is designed to provide the public with easy access to documents released under the FOI Act.





3.


Where an application is successful, by requiring an agency or Minister to publish the request and reasons for the decision before the end of 10 working days after the day the person is given access.





4.


Where an application is successful, but documents are edited, by requiring an agency or Minister to publish the request and the notice under subsection 22(3) 
within 10 working days after the day the decision is made
. Subsection 22(3) requires the agency or Minister to give the applicant notice in writing that an edited copy of the document has been prepared, the grounds for the deletions, and whether any matter has been deleted because it would cause the document to be exempt under the Act. If an applicant requests that a notice be given under section 22(4), the agency or Minister must publish the notice given in accordance with section 26 within 10 working days after the notice is given.





5.


Where an application is unsuccessful, by requiring an agency or Minister to publish the request within 10 working days after the day the decision is made and the notice given in accordance with section 26 within 10 working days after the notice is given. A notice given in accordance with section 26 must, among other things, state findings on material questions of fact and the reasons for the decision, state the name and designation of the person giving the decision, and inform the applicant of their rights to review and complaint.





6.


The Bill also requires the agency or Minister to publish the requests, reasons or notice on a website, without charge, by making them available for download, or publishing a on the website a link to another website where the information is available.



The Bill also seeks to protect the privacy of individuals by requiring that certain information be removed. Examples of information that may be removed include personal information, information about the business, commercial, financial or professional affairs of a person, or information that would be unreasonable to publish. Further, the Bill requires information to be removed if the Information Commissioner determines that it would be unreasonable to publish that information.


This Bill seeks to promote the core tenets of transparency and accountability within government decisions.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

What we do object to, and why the Greens will not be supporting this motion, is that asserting that the constraints on land supply are the principal cause of worsening housing affordability dramatically oversimplifies an incredibly complex problem. The report the Senator McLucas just referred you to is a 496-page report with 40 recommendations.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:57):  I want to focus on one of the government's packages that it has been very proud of—that is, the childcare package. I want to try to unpack what is in that package and look at some of the aspects that the government has either ignored or it thinks are too hard to solve.


It seems clear to me that Prime Minister Abbott has learnt nothing from last year's budget. This government has unfairness at its core. No matter how many times it tries to say that it is a fair budget or it is a fair government, fairness is something you believe in, not something you can just make up one day because it sounds like it is a good idea. Certainly, Labor stand for fairness, and we have a strong record of standing for fairness. But the Abbott government has no record on fairness. This budget certainly does not deliver the fairness that you will hear them talk about. Before this budget Mr Abbott promised that this budget would not be at the expense of the family budget. He has once again broken that promise. Mr Abbott's legacy will be as the Prime Minister of broken promises.


Let us pause for a moment and think about child care and what commitments were made during the election campaign and indeed over the last period of the Abbott government. They have promised that fees will be lower in the childcare space. They have promised that there will be better access. But what has the government developed? Labor is concerned about where additional childcare places will come from for these women who supposedly will be lured back to work by the family package. Where will those places come from? It does not look to me that there is a plan in the budget to find additional childcare places. In fact, it is quite the reverse. That is an area that Labor will continue to focus on and look at closely. 


We the Labor Party are concerned about reports and concerns from the childcare sector itself that many, many families will be locked out of child care because of the work activity test. These are areas that we will look at closely. Last week, in Western Australia, a young woman who does not have family close by told me that she does not know how she will manage if she loses the two days a week that she currently has in child care and absolutely relies on. Labor knows that families are under significant financial pressures, especially with the cost of child care. One of the disappointments for families is that these changes to child care do not start until 2017—which means another whole year of high childcare fees. The cost of child care, by the government's own admission, is expected to go up by 20 per cent between now and 2017. That must be the biggest recorded increase in the history of subsidised child care in this country, and that is according to the budget papers—but, of course, you will not hear the Abbott government talk about that.


This means a huge increase in the out-of-pocket costs for families, and yet the government will provide no help to families with the costs of child care in the intervening period and, in fact, it wants to cut the family tax benefit in the meantime. The government has not tackled the increasing costs of child care. Giving more to some families completely ignores the market—and make no mistake, child care operates in a market. It is not a benevolent service; it operates in a market. Private operators comprise 70 per cent of the sector, and some within that market will take advantage of the extra subsidy by increasing their costs. Parents will be hit with the additional costs into the future and their out-of-pocket expenses will continue to rise, because the Abbott government has done nothing to look at how to curtail fee increases. And between now and 1 July 2017, when the new package takes effect, prices will rise. 


Mr Morrison has told us that about 20 per cent of services are around and above the new benchmark price—20 per cent! How many services, or what percentage of services, are below the benchmark cost? We do not know that, and I am not sure that the government does, but it is something we will be pursuing in Senate estimates. The budget papers predict a 20 per cent rise in childcare fees. A 20 per cent rise is bigger than any other rise we have seen in the subsidised childcare area—and this from a government who promises high quality and low cost! Of course, it is another broken promise. If, by Mr Morrison's own admission and as the budget papers demonstrate, 20 per cent of childcare services are above the benchmark rate, where are the 80 per cent? Are they at or below the benchmark rate? It is a critical question that needs to be answered. When we look at the budget papers we see that the Abbott government does expect a significant rise in fees. What does that tell us? It will be a fee rise such as we have never seen before in this market as operators who sit below the benchmark—maybe 80 per cent, maybe not—lift their fees to the benchmark level before it comes into operation so that they maximise the government subsidy, because this is a market and fees do not go down.


This is surely an inflationary measure completely missed by the government. And of course there is nothing on the table about making extra places available for families, so even where families may want to take up the package, they will not be able to. The Abbott government has done nothing to reduce waiting lists. There are waiting lists of up to two years and more in our major cities. Family day care—a flexible option—was gutted in the last budget, forcing services to close. I have met with services in Western Australia, and last week a service provider told me they had lost seven educators and had closed up their business solely because of what the Abbott government had done. They had shut their doors, making fewer services available in the suburbs of Western Australia. 


Family day care has been gutted again. The CEO of the Family Day Care Association states that, in the whole time that Mr Morrison has been the minister, he has not once visited their service—not once. Yet here we have family day care providers who are in our suburbs, who provide a home care environment, who provide early morning care, who provide late evening care, who provide weekend care—services that we know some families in our community need. These services have been gutted. And what has been put in their place? A trial for nannies. Family day care providers are regulated. They have to be trained. They are managed. They come within the licensing of the states. They are part of the National Quality Framework. They know what their role is and provide an exceptional service, yet these educators are being sacrificed so that we can have this trial of unregulated nannies who will not sit within the National Quality Framework.


What are we creating in this country? Will this be another area that labour hire companies get into to exploit 417 visa holders? Will this be another unregulated area where we see 417 visa holders being exploited, being underpaid, being treated appallingly, such as we saw on the Four Corners program a week or so ago? Because 417 visas are no longer holiday working visas; they are another form of exploitation of labour. They are completely unregulated, and the best the Abbott government can do is to pursue underpayment of wages.


It would be appalling if the area of childcare, where Labor has worked so hard to lift standards, was ripped apart because of this cheap, unregulated nanny scheme. And what of the low-paid educators who care for and educate the nation's children? There was nothing for them, so we will continue to see massive turnover of educators in this sector. The Abbott government has not done nearly enough in the area of early childhood.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (16:07):  I am very happy to rise to speak on this and explain why the budget this year is such a fair budget. I do not accept the premise that last year's budget was unfair. This is a very good budget for Australia. It is a very good budget for those who want to have a go. I think that that is to be applauded. 


The Treasurer, the finance minister and all those who worked on this budget need to be congratulated. This budget is the next step in the coalition's responsible, long-term economic plan to build a strong, safe and prosperous future for all Australians. We all know there are economic challenges. China's economy has slowed, and the iron ore price has almost halved since the last budget, but it is important to stabilise the nation's finances and reduce debt.


This is key to building a stronger economy and a better future for all Australians. Our country has seen real progress. Our economic plan is working. Growth is up and jobs are up. Labor's projected debt and deficit have already been cut in half, and this year's budget delivers a credible path back to surplus. This government, the coalition government, remains committed to returning the budget to surplus as soon as possible, and this budget shows that our plan is working. The budget will deliver jobs, growth and opportunity in a way that is responsible, measured and fair. 


We want to help Australians get ahead and we want to provide them with greater capacity to make their own decisions about their future. That is why this year's budget is good for families and good, especially, for small business. There is a jobs and small business package which I will talk about shortly. It includes a small-business tax cut, which will boost investment and create jobs. And the budget delivers a better childcare system that is simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible. This will provide parents with greater choice when it comes to balancing work and family.


Addressing Labor's debt and deficit will make Australia stronger and allow the government to invest more in the services that Australians need. So we are taking the responsible decisions in the long-term interests of our country. There will always be economic challenges but our plan is realistic, achievable and capable of adapting to changing circumstances. 


We should remind those who are listening to this, or reading it, that we inherited a deficit of $48 billion. The deficit for the budget year is now estimated to be $35 billion, and it is forecast to reduce each and every year to below $7 billion over the next four years. That means that, over four years, we will have reduced the $123 billion worth of deficits inherited from Labor by over $40 billion. And we have a credible path—with a credible plan—back to get us surplus.


Because of our efforts, the deficit reduces each and every year on average by around half a percentage point of GDP. This is despite a reduction of over $90 billion in tax receipts having been written off since we came into government. Iron ore prices have halved since the last budget, from US$90 a tonne to US$48 a tonne in this budget. This has contributed to the largest fall in the terms of trade in over 50 years. 


As we have promised, the size of government will reduce over the next four years. As someone who passionately believes in a smaller government—it means greater power for individual families—I think that is a good thing. We have kept real payments growth in check at 1.5 per cent average over the five years to 2018-19. While Labor promised real spending growth of two per cent per annum they delivered a 3.6 per cent per annum increase. Gross debt in a decade will be more than $110 billion lower than we inherited from Labor, which was a forecast of $667 billion. Net debt is projected to peak at 18 per cent of GDP in 2016-17, before falling considerably to 7.1 per cent of GDP in 2025-26.


Our action on the budget has allowed us, each year, to lower taxes. In 2014, we removed the carbon and mining taxes, a key election promise. In 2015, we are reducing taxes for 96 per cent of all Australian businesses. I will repeat that: we are reducing taxes for 96 per cent of all Australian businesses. Taken together, all of our decisions since government have reduced the overall burden of tax by $5.4 billion.


This government's economic stewardship, under the leadership of Tony Abbott, has seen nearly a quarter of a million new jobs created since we came to office. In the lead-up to the budget, Labor was standing in the way of fixing the budget by blocking $30 billion in savings, including $5 billion of savings that they had promised. There is more to do—we know that—but we have made considerable progress and laid a strong foundation for the future. 


I want to focus, with your permission, on small businesses. Like many on this side of the chamber, I come from a small business background. My parents were farmers, and I was a sole trader for a period of time. I was always quite frustrated when filling out the BAS forms that a small business has to fill out. It shows that on our side of politics we understand the stresses and tribulations that small businesses go through. They are often just mum-and-dad operations.


Small businesses form the engine room of our economy, and as the economy changes, the role of our small businesses will be even more important. With the economy in transition we are freeing up small businesses to create new jobs for Australians and for their children. That is why the $5.5 billion Growing Jobs and Small Business package will deliver a major incentive for businesses to invest, hire and grow. In addition, the package includes $375 million aimed particularly at improving opportunities for Australians to get a job and reach out to disengaged youth.


From 1 July 2015—a mere few weeks away—all small businesses, whether they are incorporated or not, will receive a tax cut. From 1 July 2015, the government will cut the company tax rate for incorporated businesses with annual turnovers of up to $2 million by 1½ percentage points to 28½ per cent. 


From 1 July 2015 the government will also provide a five per cent tax discount to unincorporated businesses with an annual turnover of up to $2 million. It was great news for small businesses when, at 7:30 pm last night, the Treasurer said the words, 'Up until 30 June 2017 small businesses will also be able to immediately deduct every asset they acquire, which is valued up to $20,000, for tax purposes'. Currently the threshold sits at $1,000. This is fantastic news for businesses in terms of how they deal with their tax liabilities, but it is more fantastic for those small businesses that are going to purchase goods. So, there is going to be a little miniboom over the coming weeks and months up until, certainly, the end of this tax year as people take advantage of this fantastic deduction.


This budget will also help everyday Australians access new jobs, particularly young job seekers and the long-term unemployed. New measures will focus on making job seekers more employable, on reducing the costs of taking on new staff and on bringing job seekers and job providers together. These initiatives include a $1.2 billion national wage subsidy pool to target long-term unemployment. Employers will receive this subsidy from the time an employee starts in a job, when hiring and training costs are greatest, rather than waiting six months or more. This will ensure wage subsidies are more effective. This initiative also includes reforms to restart or to make it easier for small businesses to receive government support sooner when they employ older workers. A private sector work-for-the-dole program of $18 million over four years, for around 6,000 job seekers annually, to undertake valuable work experience is another program that was announced in the budget. This will allow, particularly, young job seekers the chance to develop practical skills, gain workplace experience and better connect with real jobs.


It is not just small businesses. There is a strong package on families. The $4.4 billion jobs for families package will deliver a childcare system that is simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible. Our objective is to help parents who want to work and parents who want to work more. This package will provide parents with greater choice when it comes to balancing work and family. Families with incomes of between $65,000 and $170,000, who use child care from 2017, will be around $30 a week better off. Those on higher incomes will, on average, continue to receive the same level of support when faced with costs when wanting to return to the workforce. Having two parents in paid employment has become a necessity for most families because of the changes taking place in society and in the economy over many years. All mothers work hard, and many are also in paid employment.


This budget is not a budget that is unfair. This budget is a budget that is very fair for all Australians.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:17):  I agree that the 2015 budget is unfair. It is unfair to future Australians and it is unfair to current taxpayers. It is unfair to future Australians because it buries them further in debt. Next financial year the Commonwealth government's liabilities will exceed its assets by $261 billion. That is $11,000 of net liabilities for every Australian—man, woman and child. Net debt to GDP will be 17.3 per cent of GDP. Since 1970 it has only been higher than that once—in 1995-96. That was Keating's last year as Prime Minister, and it brought on Howard's era where debt and deficit were eliminated. Unfortunately we see no sign of a concerted deficit reduction strategy from the Abbott government.


The projected surpluses in 2019-20 and beyond are too late and too small. Too late because we have four more years of getting deeper into debt. Too small because these surpluses will only whittle away at what will be a significant pile of debt. What is more, these paper-thin surpluses are not worth the paper they are written on. These distant and small surpluses would only be achieved if the Senate passed all of the government's policy-specific legislation, like the increase in the eligibility age for the age pension and the cuts to family tax benefits and higher education subsidies. The government has rejected my call for a surplus to be achieved immediately by putting spending cuts in the annual appropriation bills. These are bills that Labor will never block. These distant and small surpluses would only be achieved if Australia achieved the longest period of continuous economic growth in history. In fact, Australia would need to achieve growth rates of 3½ per cent over a number of years—a feat that is far from assured given our current antigrowth policies in areas like industrial relations. These distant and small surpluses would only be achieved if Commonwealth taxes rise to 23.9 per cent of GDP through unabated bracket creep.


The Australian public will not stand for this, and nor should they. Our top marginal personal income tax rates are already among the world's highest, and bracket creep will put more and more of the middle class into these brackets. The 23.9 per cent of GDP represents an extraordinarily high Commonwealth tax burden. In only four years, since 1970, have we endured a higher Commonwealth tax burden, and that was during the commodity price boom of the early 2000s when company tax collections were pouring in. Running deficits now means we are living the high life at the expense of current taxpayers and future generations. It is unfair in the extreme.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:21):  I rise today to talk about this government's second budget and how it has, once again, failed my home state of Queensland. Last year we learned that this was a government of broken promises and twisted priorities. Last year we also found out how unfair a coalition government could be if it really put its mind to it. The fact is that the Abbott government's 2015 budget locks in the unfairness of last year's budget. It is not only an unfair budget; it is a weak budget when it comes to the critical points and the tests of job creation and increasing economic opportunities. Under this budget unemployment remains stuck, with the government forecasting it at over six per cent until 2018-19, which means that they have essentially given up on creating more jobs and doing the hard work to bring unemployment down faster. 


As I say, this budget retains much of the unfairness of last year's budget. The Abbott government has not reversed its massive cuts to our hospitals. They have not reversed the cuts to education. The government's higher education proposals are still very much on the table—$80 billion of cuts to schools and hospitals are still on the table and the same $100,000 degrees are still there. We are still left with big cuts to family payments. This second budget is no better than the first. The Abbott government's second budget does not address the cuts to health and education from the first budget. This budget is all about saving the Prime Minister's job. It is about the Prime Minister's and the Treasurer's political survival. There is no long-term vision for Australia in this budget. It is not about the future of Australia; it is short-sighted and this government seems to make things up as it goes along. 


It is hard to keep track of the government's litany of broken promises, and they are all to the detriment of my home state of Queensland. On examination of the budget we see that Queensland is facing an $18 billion funding shortfall in health and education over the next 10 years. It is obvious that this government's shocking and clumsy approach to Commonwealth-state relations remains intact. The Commonwealth budget papers reveal that Queensland will be $924 million worse off in hospitals funding over the next three years compared to the specific purpose payments in last year's federal budget. We will also be $466 million worse off in schools funding over the next three years compared with the specific purpose payments of last year's budget. 


It is refreshing to point out that the long-held hysteria about debt has suddenly and miraculously disappeared, with debt now suddenly not an issue. Last year the red lights were flashing and we had a budget emergency; this year the glass is half full. It is a miraculous turnaround. Our nation's budget deficit has doubled on Mr Hockey's watch and Mr Hockey says that is okay now. The government has doubled the deficit since last year and we are now under this government seeing the highest tax and spending levels.


I return to a point I made earlier about financial assistance grants to local authorities, which is an important issue in Queensland. This funding arrangement is vital to ensure that local government is supported by the Commonwealth so it can carry out important work for communities. I have already mentioned today that in the electorate of Kennedy the total figure for cuts to local authorities under the financial assistance grants is estimated at $27,698,012 million to the 2017-18 financial year. Longreach Regional Council alone loses $3.3 million. Every single local government will be worse off as a result of the Abbott government's indexation freeze. The government admitted during Senate estimates that they had not done an analysis of the impact of the cuts to local governments and what effect they will have on communities or service provision. They have also admitted to having undertaken no consultation with local councils or communities before making this decision. The flow-on from this decision will hamper the ability of these councils to provide good local roads, decent libraries, well-maintained parks, regular garbage pickups and high quality essential services including child care. Labor has always been a strong supporter of local government and its role in the community and only Labor understands the critical role that local governments play in the economic growth of local communities. 


To reiterate, spending is up, unemployment is high, debt and taxes are up and yet the Abbott government's second budget does not redress the cuts to health and education from the government's first budget. This is the same Prime Minister that said that under a coalition government debt would be down, taxes would be down and spending would be down. This government claims that the budget is about fairness and encouraging people to have a go. This government is cutting $80 billion worth of funding to schools and hospitals, and I do not categorise that as a fair budget.


I want to turn to the issue of the Paid Parental Leave scheme and make the observation that the cuts announced in last night's budget will hurt new families in my area. The Treasurer has changed the terms of paid parental leave benefits meaning that mothers can no longer claim paid parental leave from the state if their employer also provides a benefit. Labor will oppose this measure. The Paid Parental Leave scheme that is now in place was designed by Labor to support working fathers and mothers. The scheme was designed to make sure that the basic scheme is built on with top ups from employers. Mr Abbott said years ago that paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body. At the time, Mr Abbott wanted to introduce his gold-plated paid parental leave scheme that would have seen mothers get $75,000 to have a baby. Now Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey want to cut paid parental leave to around 80,000 mothers. How can the Australian people believe anything that Tony Abbott ever says again when it comes to family policy? Whilst I am talking about paid parental leave, one must also express great concern at the demonisation in this debate of mothers who access both the government scheme and their employer's scheme. It is suggested that they are somehow rorting the system, but nothing could be further from the truth and I think it is reprehensible that the government has portrayed Australian mothers in that light.


On the issue of health, the GP tax remains in the background of this unfair budget. Millions of patients are set to be hit with a GP tax even bigger than the original proposal, with the 2015 budget confirming that the Abbott government is committed to a four-year freeze on Medicare rebates. The fundamental unfairness of last year's budget disaster continues. The rebate freeze is just the latest version of the unfair GP tax, which has seen the government attempt to slug patients with a $7 fee, a $5 fee, a $20 fee and now an $8.43 fee through the back door.


On the issue of multinational tax avoidance, the Prime Minister has spent months promising to reap billions from tax integrity measures. Joe Hockey's own budget papers reveal this to be a fraud. Mr Hockey's best effort at tackling multinational tax avoidance is worth a total of $30 million over four years, less than one-sixtieth of Labor's multinationals package. I think everybody can agree that all companies should pay their fair share of tax. Labor has announced a fully costed, carefully calibrated package of measures that would keep $7.2 billion worth of tax in Australia over the next decade. Those changes relate to arrangements as to how multinational companies claim tax deductions, greater compliance work by the ATO, cracking down on multinational companies using hybrid structures to reduce tax, and improved transparency and data matching. Only Labor has a plan to tackle multinational tax avoidance and ensure big multinationals pay their fair share.


This Abbott government budget does lock in the unfairness of last year's budget.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:31):  It never ceases to amaze me, I have to say, that the Labor Party never seem to have the answers in government. They create the problems in government, but, in the wisdom of opposition, apparently they always have a plan that they are going to bring forward. Their plan over the last 18 months has been to stop budget repair. They have stood in the way of tens of billions of dollars worth of savings that would have offset some of the spendthrift and wasteful nature that characterised their government. But the job, as always in repaying Labor's debt and deficit, falls to the prudent policies of the coalition.


I will not gild the lily; not every decision in last year's budget met with my approval. I did not want to see tax rates go up, but that is okay—Labor supported that. I do not want to see Australian consumers hurt; I want to see small business flourish, and the government has undertaken a package in this budget to do exactly that. It has undertaken not to lift taxes. It has undertaken to give a tax break to Australia's small businesses whether they are incorporated, by lowering the tax rate to 28½ per cent, or unincorporated, by allowing them to have a $1,000 tax rebate. That is a magnificent start to spurring the engine room of the Australian economy. If nothing else, the Labor Party's maladministration over the six or so years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments demonstrated that the government does not drive the economy. The government creates problems for those who do undertake productive and effective work.


In the budget handed down by Mr Hockey last night, the centrepiece—the flag-bearer for it, from my point of view—is the way it treats small business. I was brought up in small business; my father was involved in it; I was involved with it before I came into this place. I understand how tough it can be for small business people, whose only motivation, might I add, is to provide for their families, to try and make a dollar, hopefully to grow, and to employ other Australians so that they can lead productive lives and look after their families as well. That is the motivation for bosses, and yet the circumstances we had under Labor were barrier after barrier, red tape after red tape, and green tape after green tape put up in front of small businesses so that not only was it tough for them to get started but it was very tough for them to get any bigger. This government went a long way last night to redressing that, not only by lowering the tax rate but by this magnificent and, I have to say, unbelievably generous measure for immediate depreciation of assets purchased for the business up to the value of $20,000. That is, I think, one of the best policy decisions I have heard. It will stimulate the economy and encourage businesspeople to go out, invest in the assets, the infrastructure and what is necessary for them to function in their business, and employ people going forward. It is a very generous measure, and I think it is fantastic, so I support that.


Also, the government has focused on the ability for businesses to transform out of perhaps an unwieldy structure into a more modern structure. A lot of businesses, when they are incorporated or created, are not set up in the most effective manner for them, which is proved subsequently with their growth and various other changes. The government has implemented some procedures and some regulations that will allow for the minimisation of taxation and costs in respect of the transition to a more flexible or perhaps a more relevant structure for businesses.


The government has also touched on employee share schemes, to make it worthwhile and less onerous for the start-up companies—the ones that are going to drive our economy going forward—to include employees in the benefits of any success that business may have. If you want to look around the world, you will see that some of the great success stories, whether it be Google or Apple or any of these other start-ups that have emerged—Uber and PayPal are other examples—have all had employee share schemes that have enabled those people to go into work and receive a salary perhaps under what they might otherwise command in the private sector but with the upside of business ownership and entrepreneurship. That is the culture we should be encouraging in this country. It is a culture that I absolutely support, because it is what is going to drive innovation—and innovation is what we need to be encouraging.


It is often said at my children's school that information is available, to every child, wherever they go. They can go to Google or anywhere else and get all the information they need, but it is how they analyse and look at that information that is important. That is what they are teaching children in schools today—I hope they are—how to learn, how to digest and how to dissect information.


We have to start to think that our economy cannot be prescriptive. It is not just about manufacturing or mining or anything else. They are very important, but probably the most successful company in this country has not even been started yet. Maybe it started in the last year. We are yet to see it grow, and we cannot even envisage the success of the future that so many people will undertake. That is why innovation, particularly innovation and investment in small business by government, is so welcome.


None of this comes without expense, but it is far better to give a tax break to business that will result in more jobs, overall, than to send cheques for $900 to people who live overseas or who are deceased. One senator said you should be able to put it into the poker machines. A government investing in small business is much better than giving someone money to put into a poker machine. That is just a personal view. I know some on the other side have different views, because they have said them before in this place.


Last night's budget was an excellent budget for the country at the time we find ourselves in. Let us not fool ourselves. We have a massive process ahead of paying back the debt to reclaim the deficits that have been characterised by modern budgets, but we have made some giant inroads along the way. We have cut the deficit that was projected. We have cut the overwhelming national debt that was projected under the previous governments. We are on the right path. 


If we can stimulate our economy, if we can continue to grow it—the best way to grow an economy is to get government out-of-the-way of it; it is to cut taxes, allow more freedom and allow more innovation—then we have a real chance of addressing the economic and fiscal problems that our country faces as a result of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. We cannot afford to continue down the path they set us on, and last night's budget goes a long way to addressing that damage.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-05-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:39):  I rise to make a contribution to this matter of public importance that discusses whether the budget locks in unfairness. Yes, it definitely does. We have the cuts the previous budget made that are continued, here with this budget, and those that have already started. 


You have the cuts that were made to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, which took $534 million out of spending in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That is already being felt on the ground in those communities and is extremely unfair. You have the cuts to the Department of Social Services, which are $270 million taken out of supports and services for the most vulnerable in our community—and those are hitting the ground. The cuts to emergency relief are hitting the ground not only across metropolitan areas throughout this country but also in rural and regional areas. You have cuts to health that are already hitting the ground. There is the loss of youthconnect. The list goes on. 


Those were the cuts from last year, which have been entrenched in this budget and the measures that have not been passed and those that are still on the books. There are the cuts to family tax benefits and, in particular, those that would hit very hard on single parents. And there is the government's total refusal to look at key revenue measures, including looking at super to the big end of town. They will not look at it. They have made no commitments at all.


They are shying away from and refusing to address issues around retirement income—in the broader context—and looking at a review. Seniors groups are calling for this and have been repeating their calls for that broader review of retirement incomes, to make sure that retirement income is fair and equitable and that the government is not just looking after the wealthy through the very generous tax concessions, for super, for the wealthy. Those are grossly unfair. The government knows about it. They are shutting their eyes and do not want to deal with it—because it might affect their mates.


The Treasurer, Mr Hockey, said the budget enables every Australian to 'have a go'. I have news for him: no, it does not. The cuts they are locking in through this budget, that they brought through the last budget, undermine the ability of vulnerable Australians to have a go. What do you think happens to a young person when they are on no income, whatsoever? The government said it has heard the message. They said: 'Do you think it unfair that young people are dumped off income support, of any form of income, for six months?' 'Oh, we have heard that. We'll just make it seem a bit fairer by reducing it to one month.' No. It is not fairer. It is cruel. It is harsh. How do you expect young people under the age of 25 to eat, have accommodation and gain employment when they are living in poverty—on nothing for a month? 


They are also extending the age for Youth Allowance to 25. They are on even lower money, living below the poverty line. Did they address the gross unfairness of Newstart and its payments? They have not been rising to meet the cost of living. People are living below the poverty line and will drop further below the poverty line because the indexation of Newstart does not keep up with the true cost of living. They are not increasing Newstart and people are still existing on $260 a week below the poverty line. If the government were really about addressing fairness and a good quality of life for people and helping people gain employment, they would be investing in helping people much more than they are. They would not be locking in unfairness by not committing to increased payments, like Newstart and Youth Allowance, so people can live above the poverty line. We know that poverty makes it even harder for people to gain employment.


Another unfair component of this budget is the fact that we knew we had to upgrade the IT system for Human Services—but what did they do? They said this is all about collecting revenue from those people who are not compliant and are fraudulently claiming benefits. That is not the approach we should be taking. The IT system should be helping people gain employment. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:44):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance on the Abbott government's 2015 budget, which locks in the unfairness of last year's budget. We know that last year's budget was one of the worst and most unfair in history. It hit pensioners, it hit students, it hit families and it made savage cuts to health and education. The budget handed down last night is simply more of the same. It is unfair. The unfair measures in last year's budget live on in this budget. The $80 billion of cuts to health and education live on. The cuts to the family tax benefits are still there. The $100,000 university degrees are still there. Unfairness remains at the core of this latest budget. The language may have changed, but the cuts remain.


In the last budget we were told that the family tax benefits had to be cut because we had to repair the budget and get the budget back to surplus. Now we are told by the government that the cuts to family tax benefits are needed to fund the childcare package. As the shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, said this morning:


The alibi has changed but the cuts have remained.


The Abbott government's second budget simply locks in the unfair cuts to family payments that were made the first time around. We know that this government cannot be trusted. It said that the family budget would not be hit in this year's budget, but that is not true. The Abbott government still wants to cut families off Family Tax Benefit B when their youngest child turns six. Kids do not get cheaper when they turn six. Mr Abbott still wants to freeze family tax benefit rates, which will erode the value of these payments. For example, a single-income family on $65,000 a year with two children at school will be $6,000 a year worse off. The Large Family Supplement will be abolished and the Low Income Supplement will also be abolished. These cuts are still in the budget, and these cuts will have a huge impact on the lives of low- and middle-income Australian families. They will hurt millions of families across the country and I can assure you that Labor will continue to oppose these cuts.


To add insult to injury, Mr Abbott wants to rip a further $967 million from paid parental leave in a new cut that will push around 80,000 mothers off PPL, leaving them up to $11,500 worse off. This will also leave them with less time with their babies in the early years of their child's life. One of the most unfair and cruellest cuts in the Abbott government's first budget was the move to force jobseekers to live on nothing for six months. His second budget will leave jobseekers under the age of 25 with nothing to live on for one month. This is unfair and will continue to hurt young Australians who are struggling to make ends meet. The government has learnt nothing from the cuts that they sought to make in their last budget. They moved from six months because they knew that it was deeply unpopular within the Australian community and now they are trying to trick the community into accepting that maybe one month is okay. Well, it is not. It is unfair and it is not okay.


We need to support and encourage our young people, not treat them unfairly and leave them out in the cold. We need to make it easier for them to find a job, not harder. There is no justification for this measure, as the Australian Council of Social Service chief, Cassandra Goldie, said after the budget was handed down. No amount of sugar-coating, spin or glossy brochures will change the fact that this budget fails the fairness test. It certainly will not help one Australian family. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:49):  I regret feeling the need to stand here and maybe give those opposite a lesson in economics 101. The fundamental basis of it is that you cannot just keep spending money and constantly putting more and more programs into your public budget if you cannot actually afford to pay for them. Senator Brown made the comment that we need to support and encourage our young people. The best way that we can support and encourage our young people is to allow them to be able to get a job. The best way for them to be able to get a job is if we put confidence back into our economy so that our businesses start employing people, and, if they employ people, there will be more jobs for our young people. By spending more and more money in the public sector and constantly putting more and more pressure on the public purse to pay back the interest that is on the money that we owe is no way to run our economy.


As someone more famous than me said: 'You can't tax your way out of a recession.' And the public sector cannot spend its way out of a recession. We need to give business the confidence, the incentive and the tools so that they can make our country more prosperous. Instead of standing opposite and talking about all the things that may not have been in the budget that you would have liked to have given people so that you could buy their vote at the next election, maybe a more responsible approach would be to come up with suggestions about how you are going to deal with the debt and deficit problems this government has inherited from you.


I think that the budget that was brought down last night was eminently sensible, balanced and reasonable. I do not believe that in any way it was unfair. I am a small-business person. I come from a community that is run on small business. Many people in this chamber, if they actually bothered to have a look, would realise that small business is the engine room of this country. By putting in some programs and some initiatives and allowing them a 1.5 per cent tax cut, maybe small businesses—remember that every big business was a small business once—will have the confidence and the incentive to employ more people. Employing more people, Senator Brown, will mean that young people will have greater opportunity and access to a greater job market.


It is not just tax relief of 1.5 per cent that is being given to small business—it is a whole package of $5.5 billion. With accelerated depreciation, those of you who have been involved in small business, as I have, will know that one of the greatest things to give you the encouragement to make that decision to purchase a new piece of equipment is knowing that you are able to depreciate it over a much shorter period of time. If I had to go and buy myself a lawnmower and I knew I could depreciate it over the first 12 months of owning it, I would be much more likely to buy it. But that does not just benefit me because I am able to get that depreciation benefit immediately; it also benefits the local dealer who sells me the lawnmower. Of course, this continues to have a flow-on effect in our economy. This is what you call stimulating growth. You are not putting a blanket on growth by just trying to use the public sector to spend your way out of the situation, you are using business and using your economy to drive the growth of the Australian economy. Certainly, the small business package is something that has been welcomed in the electorate and in South Australia, because it is seen as a stimulus to our economy.


The other area that was particularly welcomed was the $4.4 billion families package. Certainly, in the discussion after the last budget in relation to the Paid Parental Leave scheme it appeared that the women of our country were keen for childcare support and believed that it was an important way of assisting them to get back into the workforce. We need to look at this as a productivity measure and encourage the 50 per cent of our population, or thereabouts, that take some time off to have children to get back into the workforce. Up until now, they have found it particularly restrictive because they have not been able to access child care at affordable levels. For those opposite to come in here and say that this is an unfair budget, when they were advocating that child care be included in the budget, seems rather ignorant. It is contradictory for them to come in here and say that the childcare and $4.4 billion families package is unfair.


I want to touch quickly on my home state of South Australia. I would like to put on the record that annual Commonwealth funding to South Australia will increase by $2.4 billion over the next four years. That is an increase in hospital funding; it is an increase in school funding. I would like to put that on the record. It does not matter how many advertising campaigns Premier Weatherill in South Australia decides that he is going to run to try and bluff the South Australian public into believing that the federal government is somehow cutting funding to South Australia, he cannot cover up the fact that he has been a totally incompetent fiscal manager in our state. The budget measures and the fiscal inadequacies of his government are the reasons he has had to cut programs in South Australia. The federal government has not taken money out of the South Australian bucket. As I said, it has increased overall funding. It has increased school funding and increased hospital funding. For Premier Weatherill to spend millions of dollars of South Australian taxpayers' money running what would have to be described as misleading at best and dishonest at worst advertising campaigns, and to suggest that the federal government is in any way to blame for the fact that he is no longer able to fund some of the initiatives that are the purview and responsibility of the South Australian government, I think is reprehensible and entirely recklessly irresponsible on his part. To add insult to injury, we had a question today criticising this government about hospital funding. It is the South Australian government who intends to shut down the repat hospital for our veterans in South Australia. This is a fair budget, and it is ridiculous to say otherwise.

At the last election, the Government promised to take a hands-on approach to the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac. We said:




The Centenary of Anzac will be a period of national reflection, remembrance and commemoration for the service and sacrifice of so many Australians in defence of our way of life, our values and our freedoms. 





The Coalition will ensure that communities right across Australia have every opportunity to commemorate the deeds of local people in the service of their nation. 



We have delivered this commitment.


Since coming to office, this Government has delivered the nation's most significant national commemorative event in history. The 100th anniversary of the landing of Australian and New Zealand forces at Gallipoli was commemorated on 25 April 2015 in Australia and New Zealand, as well as locations around the world, including the place of the landing at Gallipoli in Turkey.


Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Australians actively participated in the commemoration of this watershed moment in our nation's history. In the biggest cities and the smallest towns and farming communities, Australians gathered in extraordinary numbers to pay their respects to all those men and women who have served our nation in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations over more than a century of service.




Why commemorate a Centenary of Anzac and a century of service



Commemoration is a vitally important component of the support we provide returned men and women. 


Providing financial and health care assistance through our world-leading repatriation system is a fundamental way of acknowledging service and sacrifice. Similarly, commemorating veterans' service is a nation's obligation to those who have served.. As a society we owe it to veterans, and their families, to recognise their service and to provide validation and acknowledgment that their service and sacrifice was worthwhile and is respected.


The Centenary of Anzac is not just about commemorating those who fought in the First World War. The Anzac Centenary program is about a century of service: it commemorates and recognises the service of all those who have served in the Australian Defence Force over the last one hundred years.


It is a mistake to think that commemoration is somehow not important in validating the service of veterans. It is a mistake to think that the Anzac Centenary program is not recognising the service of contemporary veterans either. As I have said previously, it is most important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as the appalling way our Vietnam veterans were treated. The Centenary of Anzac is about commemorating service in all theatres in which Australians have served in war, conflict or peacekeeping operations. 


The taxpayer support for the Centenary of Anzac, spread over more than 10 years, is consistent with the community's desire to honour those who have served our nation. Spending is measured – it is not excessive. Annually, government spending on commemoration represents less than 1 per cent of the entire $12 billion Department of Veterans' Affairs' budget for pensions, compensation and health care treatment for veterans and their families.


Within Australia, funding for the Centenary of Anzac has included up to $125,000 per Federal electorate for community-based commemoration through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. It funded the curtain raiser for the Anzac Centenary - the Albany Convoy Commemorative Event and included funding three quarters of the National Anzac Centre in Albany.


Domestically, other funded initiatives include:


the program to Honour Australia's War Dead;


the refurbishment of the Australian War Memorial's First World War galleries;;


the 'Anzac Portal', an Online Educational and Community Portal;


the Arts and Culture Fund;


television programs on the ABC, such as Anzac Girls and The War that Changed Us;


the digitisation of selected First World War repatriation records; and


the development of the short films and audio excerpts from the digitised Australians at War Film Archive.


Internationally, the Commonwealth has recently supported:


commemorative events in Gallipoli and France;


the protection and preservation of HMAS AE2;


the dedication of the new Australian War Memorial in New Zealand's Pukeahu War Memorial Park in Wellington;


the development of the Australian Remembrance Trail, a tri-partite investment between the Australian Government and French and Belgian regional and local authorities.


The Commonwealth has announced funding to support major commemorative events at Fromelles, Pozieres, Polygon Wood, Be'er Sheva and Le Hamel to mark the centenary of battles fought in these locations. Funding will also support a series of domestic commemorative events to mark these events, as well as other significant military anniversaries such as Victory in the Pacific, the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore and service on the Thai-Burma railway, and the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan and the Vietnam War.


Further, the Prime Minister has announced that the Australian Government will establish the Sir John Monash Centre at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, France, to tell the story of Australia's contribution to victory on the Western Front during the First World War. I acknowledge the bipartisan support all of these initiatives have received.


Our support for the Centenary of Anzac is in not at the expense of our ongoing support for veterans and their families. For example, DVA's annual Budget of around $12 billion includes more than $6 billion in financial assistance to veterans, and more than $5 billion in health treatment costs. Further, every year we spend at least $179 million on dedicated mental health treatment and support for veterans and their families. This funding is demand driven and is not capped.


Since the last election, the Government has issued two Ministerial Statements about the Centenary of Anzac. This statement, the third, looks back at events of Anzac Day 2015, but also forward to the remainder of the commemorative programme until the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day on 11 November 2018.




Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program



The Centenary of Anzac captured the interest and imagination of communities right across Australia. Consistent with the Government's pre-election commitment, community-based commemoration was at the heart of the Centenary of Anzac commemorations.


The Government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program provided up to $125,000 per Federal electorate to support community-based commemoration. Across 150 electorates almost 1,800 individual projects sought funding. Applications from local groups have shown a high level of community engagement, innovation and educative value.


Examples of projects supported under the program include:


an exhibition entitled, 'In Memory', honouring Aboriginal servicemen and women of the South Coast of New South Wales, which will be partially funded through a $10,000 grant provided to Shoalhaven City Council;


in Melbourne's northern suburb of Meadow Heights, the Northern Turkish Family Association will conduct an Anzac Day commemoration, with $3,000 from the Australian Government;


at Deception Bay in Queensland we have provided more than $30,000 for a new war memorial commemorating the Centenary of Anzac;


in South Australia, a grant of almost $35,000 assisted in the re-enactment of the initial troop marches associated with the enlistment of troops in 1914;


the placement of photos of First World War soldiers in prominent places around Bunbury and nearby towns in Western Australia, through a $3,173 grant to the Bunbury RSL Sub-branch;


a grant worth $1,000 assisted the Liffey Old School Hall group to restore the Avenue of Honour which passes by the Hall in rural Tasmania;


the St Paul's Primary School in Darwin has installed a flagpole and plaque to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac, courtesy of a grant of $2,333;


the Woden Valley RSL sub-branch received a grant worth $6,000 to publish a book titled 'We Will Remember Them – Canberra's War Memorials'; and


the 'Centenary of ANZAC Jewish' program at the Sydney Jewish Museum, which will be partially funded through four grants worth $47,760 awarded to the Museum.


I want to take this opportunity to thank those members of the community who joined local electorate committees, hosted by Members of the House of Representatives, to assist in the assessment of projects at a local level. Your enthusiasm ensured the success of this program. I also wish to pay tribute to all colleagues in the other place for their work in making this program the success it has been.




Travelling Exhibition



On 25 March this year, the Prime Minister, together with the CEOs of Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, launched the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience, or SACE.


The SACE will be a national, travelling exhibition bringing the story of Australia and the First World War to 23 communities across Australia. Beginning in Albury-Wodonga in September this year, the SACE will give communities the chance to gain a deeper understanding of what Australia, and Australians, did during the First World War. This free exhibition will visit all states and the Northern Territory, concluding in Sydney in April 2017.


The partnership between the Australian Government, Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank, who are jointly funding this project, is greatly valued. I want to thank the two organisations for their shared passion for this project. I also want to welcome Brigadier Alison Creagh CSC (Ret'd) as the Executive Director of the project. Brigadier Creagh brings a lifetime of experience in the Australian Army to assist in the management of this considerable project.


I also welcome the Hon Tim Fischer AC as Envoy. Tim Fischer, a veteran of the Vietnam War, is a former deputy prime minister and ambassador. Tim has enormous energy and interest in the First World War which will serve him well in this role.


The Australian War Memorial is responsible for the content of the exhibition. The Memorial's team supporting the SACE is led by Major-General Brian Dawson AO (Ret'd) and the Memorial's team of curators have searched through their extensive collection to find a number of items which will tour, giving those Australians who cannot visit the Memorial in Canberra the chance to see part of our national collection.


The Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force have been passionate supporters of the SACE. I welcome their agreement to provide financial support for the SACE, ensuring the project can reach as many locations around Australia as possible.


The SACE will be the biggest undertaking of its type since the Bicentenary travelling exhibition more than 25 years ago. It will be a once in a lifetime experience and I encourage all Australians to make a special effort to attend the SACE when it visits a town or city close to them.




Australian War Memorial New Zealand



One hundred years on from the landing at Gallipoli, and 14 years after the dedication of New Zealand's memorials on Anzac Parade in Canberra, the Prime Minister officially dedicated the Australian War Memorial in New Zealand's new Pukeahu War Memorial Park in Wellington.


The Australian Memorial is the first international memorial to open in the new park in Wellington, and sits directly opposite New Zealand's National Carillon and the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. Linked by 'Anzac Square', this special memorial underlines the deep and abiding connection between our two nations.


The new Memorial features 15 red stone columns, inset with black granite. Seven of the columns contain the names of 21 theatres and operations where Australians and New Zealanders have served alongside each other. Others feature Indigenous and Maori artwork.


The fifteenth, and central, pillar is emblazoned 'Anzac'. As the Prime Minister noted in his speech at the dedication: 


On the central pillar of this memorial is inscribed one word: 'Anzac'.


Charles Bean, Australia's first and finest war correspondent, once wrote: ""Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never own defeat"".


This Memorial, funded by the Howard government in the 2006-07 Budget, will stand for ever more as a testament to the shared bond between our two nations, a timeless reminder of our two nations' shared values, service and sacrifice.




Anzac Day 2015



The commemoration of Anzac Day 2015 involved many hundreds of communities right across Australia. Australians young and old actively participated in their own way to mark this defining moment in our nation's history.



Australia



Crowds at Dawn Services in Australia continued to increase. The Australian War Memorial reported the largest crowd, at over 100,000. Major regional dawn services, such as at Torquay in Victoria, Albany in Western Australia and Elephant Rock in Queensland, continued to see large crowds. Marches in many cities saw their largest attendance in many years. Community enthusiasm for Anzac Day is arguably at its highest level in a generation.




Gallipoli



A crowd of 10,043 attended the Dawn Service at the Anzac Commemorative Site in Turkey on Anzac Day and participated in a solemn and dignified commemorative ceremony at the place where, 100 years earlier, ANZAC forces had landed.


A total of 7,766 Australians attended the Dawn Service and the Australian service at Lone Pine and 1,935 New Zealanders attended the Dawn Service and the New Zealand service at Chunuk Bair. All three services were attended by 342 official guests representing Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and twelve other nations directly involved in the Gallipoli campaign in 1915.


On behalf of the Australian Government, I would like to again place on the record our grateful thanks to the Government and people of Turkey, our most generous hosts. It is a rare thing indeed for two nations, once enemies, to be such firm friends. It is even rarer for the nation who was once our foe to welcome us so warmly to the place where the landing took place in 1915. We indeed have a special relationship, one which the Australian Government hopes will continue long into the future.


I am pleased to report that all 8,120 Australian attendance passes for the dawn service were allocated. The waitlist which had been established following the draw of the ballot in March 2014 operated as it was intended. 7,320 Australians were offered, through the ballot and the waitlist, a double attendance pass to attend the services. 3,755 people accepted a double pass and 214 accepted a single pass. There were also 396 single passes allocated to students and their chaperones across all states and territories. 


The Government, with the grateful assistance of Qantas, invited the widows of 10 Australian First World War veterans to attend the commemorations. These remarkable ladies, each accompanied by a carer, were active participants in the day's commemorative activities. At the Dawn Service, Mrs Niki Alldritt, whose husband Private Robert (Bob) Gregory Alldritt had served at Gallipoli, laid a wreath on behalf of all war widows. At the Australian ceremony at Lone Pine, Mrs Ann Beasley, whose husband Lieutenant Frank Beasley also served at Gallipoli, laid a wreath on behalf of all war widows. It was a moving moment.


I would like to place on the record my personal thanks to the dedicated staff in my Department, and across government, who have worked for many years to make this event possible. They are to be commended for their personal dedication, and the professionalism of their team, in making this event a solemn, dignified and safe commemoration.




Villers-Bretonneux



On the Western Front, a crowd of 6,100 attended the Anzac Day dawn service at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux. This ceremony honours the 290,000 Australians who fought on the Western Front during the First World War; the Memorial records the names of more than 10,700 Australians who died in France and have no known grave.


The ceremony at Villers-Bretonneux, managed by the Australian Government with the grateful assistance of local French authorities, is becoming a major commemorative event for Australians visiting or living in Europe. I expect that, as the focus of the Centenary commemorations shifts to the Western Front, that more and more Australians will wish to attend this ceremony.




Other international services



Her Majesty the Queen led Anzac Day commemorations in London. The Australian Government acknowledges the decision of the Government of the United Kingdom to manage Anzac Day in London this year. A crowd of more than 5,000 gathered for the Dawn Service at the Australian War Memorial in Hyde Park Corner, which was followed by a wreath laying ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall and a thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey.


In Belgium, the Minister for Foreign Affairs led Anzac Day, the first Ministerial visit to Belgium for Anzac Day in many years. Thousands of Australians are buried in Belgium; the cemetery at Toronto Avenue, the only all-Australian cemetery in Belgium, hosted a large crowd for the morning's commemorative service.


Australians also gathered in large numbers at Hellfire Pass in Thailand; Isurava and Bomana in Papua New Guinea; Sandakan in Malaysia; in Vietnam and throughout New Zealand. Many Australian missions across the world also marked Anzac Day.




Sir John Monash Centre



On 26 April the Prime Minister announced the winning design for the Sir John Monash Centre which is to be constructed at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux in France.


The Centre will tell the story of the extraordinary efforts of the 290,000 Australians who served with such distinction on the Western Front during the First World War. More Australians died on the Western Front than on Gallipoli or in the Sinai combined. It is appropriate that we tell our nation's story of service and sacrifice not only to Australians who visit the former battlefields of northern France and Belgium, but to Europeans who are eager to better understand our engagement during the First World War.


The Centre will educate a new audience about Australia's significant role on the Western Front and provide a lasting international legacy from the Centenary of Anzac. To achieve this, it will offer an evocative and educational experience for visitors of all nationalities.


Sir John Monash was the engineering genius and citizen soldier whose leadership broke the stalemate on the Western Front in 1918. The Battle of Villers-Bretonneux was fought on ground around the Australian National Memorial and, from the Memorial, the site of Monash's famous victory at Le Hamel can be seen. It is right that our nation's greatest leader from the First World War is honoured at this Centre.


The winning architects, Cox, have developed a concept which will see the Memorial's original plan finally completed. The design in no way detracts from the stately grandeur of the Memorial. Further, as a technology-based museum, the Centre will complement the Franco-Australian Museum at the Victoria School in Villers-Bretonneux, as well as acting as a starting or finishing point for the Australian Remembrance Trail. It will be completed by Anzac Day 2018, the 100th anniversary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux which was won by Australian forces on 24/5 April 1918.




Western Front



More than 90 per cent of the Australian Imperial Force served on the Western Front during the First World War. More than 75 per cent of the Australians who died in the First World War died on the Western Front. It is critical that the service and sacrifice of the men who fought on the Western Front are as well understood as are the stories of Gallipoli.


Immediately following the Gallipoli commemorations I travelled to France to see first-hand early preparations for centenary commemorations there in 2016. I also met with Belgian authorities to discuss their plans for commemoration in 2017, and particularly to discuss plans to commemorate the Battle of Passchendaele which, in October 1917, resulted in almost 7,000 Australians killed in action.


The Government has announced funding to support international commemorative events at Fromelles (19 July 2016), Pozieres (23 July 2016), Polygon Wood (26 September 2017), Le Hamel (4 July 2018) and the Australian National Memorial (Armistice Day, 11 November 2018). This funding is over and above funding for annual Anzac Day services at the Australian National Memorial in France, and events in Belgium.


The funding will provide additional security, seating and logistical support to these events. In some cases, such as Fromelles, commemorative services may be conducted across two or three locations, such is the small size of the cemeteries where events could take place. These plans will continue to be worked on and announced in due course. 


There will be no ballot for Australians to attend commemorative events run by the Australian Government on the Western Front.




Be-er Sheva



The exploits of the Australian Light Horse in the deserts of Palestine and the Sinai from 1916 to 1918 deserve to be better known. The Light Horse victory at Be'er Sheva, one of the best known cavalry charges in history, was a highlight of the epic campaign led by Australian and New Zealand mounted horsemen that advanced from the Suez Canal to Jerusalem and onto Damascus and which broke the Turkish Ottoman army. Too few Australians know about these stories.


It is right that Australia commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Be'er Sheva. The Government has provided funding to enable a commemorative ceremony to take place in Israel on 31 October 2017 to mark this event.


I want to acknowledge the significant interest amongst the Australian Jewish community to see this event appropriately acknowledged and commemorated. Australia's role in the liberation of the Sinai region from Ottoman rule ultimately led the creation of the state of Israel. The Government will work with the Jewish community in Australia to ensure that events in both Israel and Australia appropriately commemorate the importance of this event.




Budget 2015-16



Funding in this year's Budget will deliver the Government's commitment to honour not just events on the Western Front and Be'er Sheva, but key anniversaries throughout the century of service.




Lone Pine



The Government will provide additional financial support for a commemorative event at Gallipoli on 6 August 2015 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Lone Pine and the August Offensive.


The Lone Pine ceremony will take place at 5pm on 6 August 2015 at the Lone Pine Cemetery. The attack at Lone Pine began in the early evening of 6 August 1915 and it is appropriate that, 100 years on, we mark this event at this time.


The August Offensive, which this ceremony will commemorate, was the last great push by the Allies against Turkish forces. Four days of intense fighting cost more than 2,000 Australians killed or wounded This ceremony will particularly honour them. The service also provides those Australians who were unable to attend Gallipoli on Anzac Day with the chance to visit and participate in a commemorative event.


This ceremony will not be balloted. In coming weeks, my Department will provide advice via its website about arrangements for the ceremony. Consistent with arrangements for Anzac Day, however, those wishing to attend are encouraged to book with a tour group. Further, infrastructure at the site is limited – there is no running water, permanent toilet facilities or electricity. It can also be extremely hot in Turkey in August. Those wishing to attend are encouraged to consider these points in their preparation.




Century of service



The exploits of the original Anzacs were a major focus of Anzac Day 2015. However, as we move through the remainder of the Centenary of Anzac, our focus broadens not just to the remainder of the First World War campaigns involving Australians, but also to significant events in subsequent conflicts involving Australians.


Last week, I accompanied seven veterans of the Second World War to Paris and London to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe commemorations. The veterans of the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force were warmly welcomed by their hosts, the French President and Her Majesty the Queen, and warmly acknowledged for their role in the liberation of Europe from the forces of Nazism.


Next month a mission of eight Australian Second World War veterans will travel to Borneo to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Operation OBOE. And in September a mission to Papua New Guinea will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the unconditional surrender of the Japanese.


In August this year, the Australian Government will mark the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific with a series of commemorative events across the nation. I am pleased to announce that, in cooperation with the Returned and Services League of Australia, commemorative events will take place across the country to honour the men and women who defended Australia during the Second World War. Sadly, age is wearying our surviving Second World War veterans and this anniversary may provide the last significant opportunity for Australians to honour their service. Further details about the commemorative programme will be released shortly.


I can also announce that funding has been allocated to support a series of domestic commemorative events to mark the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore and the completion of the Thai-Burma Railway. These two events will be conducted at the Australian ex-Prisoner of War Memorial in Ballarat, and will be funded by the Australian Government.


Significant 65th anniversaries associated with the Korean War will be marked at the Australian War Memorial. A veteran commemorative mission will return to the Republic of Korea in October 2016 to commemorate on United Nations Day the significant battles of the Korean War in which Australians were involved.




Vietnam



In 1962 Australian Army members as part of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) arrived in South Vietnam as part of Australia's initial deployment to the ongoing conflict in Vietnam. On 25 May 1965 Australian troops from 1RAR commenced their deployment to South Vietnam, marking the beginning of the employment of Australian combat unitsin the Vietnam War.


Coming years mark significant 50th anniversaries for events which took place in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In 2016 we will mark the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, the anniversary of which has come to be the day when this nation honours all those who served in the Vietnam War. Other anniversaries for the Battle of Fire Support Base Coral and Fire Support Base Balmoral, and the Battle of Binh Bah, will also occur in 2018 and 2019 respectively. These are significant anniversaries which deserve to be marked by a nation grateful for the service of those who fought in them.


Later this month I will announce the details of the Government's plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, marking 50 years since Australian forces fought in the Vietnam War. I view these commemorations as being as important as the commemoration of events during the First and Second World Wars.




Boer War and Peacekeeping Memorials



Consistent with the Government's pre-election commitment, the Budget also extends Deductible Gift Recipient status to the Boer War Memorial Project and the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project until 31 December 2017. I encourage both of these organisations to use this extension to actively seek financial support for the establishment of their memorials. This extension comes at a cost of $1.4 million to the Commonwealth, and is on top of $200,000 in seed funding provided to each organisation.




Official Histories



Official histories provide a comprehensive account of Australia's involvement in conflict, peacekeeping and overseas humanitarian missions from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present.


Starting with the First World War, the Australian War Memorial has been responsible for the compiling of official and authoritative histories of Australia's involvement in wars and conflicts. The first, authored by Charles Bean, tells the story of Australia's involvement in the First World War. Subsequent histories include the Second World War, Korean War and south-east Asian conflicts, including the Vietnam War.


The Howard government commissioned the authoring of an Official History of Peacekeeping Operations between 1946 and 2006. After some delays, this work has been fast-tracked and will be completed by mid-2016. This fifth series tells the story of more than 60 years of peacekeeping service by Australians throughout the world.


The sixth series in our national collection of Official Histories will focus on Australia's involvement in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. To be completed by mid-2022, the histories will give an authoritative account of Australia's involvement in these conflicts.


Australian involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has been complex and long-running, and is of sufficient magnitude and complexity to warrant an official history. As many as 40,000 Australian Defence Force personnel may have served in or supported these conflicts over 13 years of operations; 43 Australians were killed in action in these conflicts and many hundreds wounded.


In the case of East Timor, Australia's involvement from 1999 to 2012 was instrumental in the country gaining independence and moving forwarded in stability and prosperity. The International Force East Timor deployed from 1999 to 2000 was Australia's largest peacekeeping mission to date, as well as the largest overseas military deployment since the Vietnam War.


The service of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have served in these operations deserves to the told.


The Australian community has been seized by the opportunity of the Centenary of Anzac to look back upon our nation's history. It has given people the opportunity to discover the service of a relative who did not return from the battle, or to speak to those who did about their own experiences.


In my first statement on the Centenary of Anzac, I said:




The Centenary of Anzac will be this nation
'
s most defining period of national commemoration.


Through this period, when we commemorate a Century of Service, Australians will be asked to consider three things:





Where we fought;





When we fought; and perhaps most importantly





Why we fought and the values we fought for.





The Centenary of Anzac is a period for all of us to reflect on past sacrifice, to understand that the nation we have today is the result of the sacrifice of 102,785 Australians killed in action, the hundreds of thousands wounded in action and the more than one million Australians who have worn the uniform of the Australian Defence Force.





The Coalition Government is absolutely committed to the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac, from events in Rabaul and Gallipoli to the Western Front and the Middle East.



We are well on track to deliver this, as well as leaving a lifelong understanding amongst younger Australian, in particular, that Anzac means service and sacrifice. It is future generations of Australians who will carry the torch of remembrance.


The Centenary of Anzac is far from over. As the Prime Minister has said: ""Gallipoli was a splendid failure; the Western Front was a terrible success and we should recall our victories as much as our defeats."" Our focus will soon shift to the commemoration of these events.


We have a duty to honour the memory of the men and women who served our nation with such distinction and whose names are listed in the cloisters at the Australian War Memorial. 


A nation that fails to remember is a nation that fails itself.




Senator PAYNE:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Centenary of Anzac</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,15,1
"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (17:24):  I rise to take note of the ministerial statement on the Centenary of Anzac and the Anzac celebrations at Anzac Cove this year. Last night I was very fortunate to be able to share with this place my story and my family's story of our pilgrimage to Gallipoli as four of the very lucky ballot holders to go and join in the ceremonies there. I shared a little bit about my own family journey and the family story of our experience in learning more about my grandfather, who never talked about war and never valued any of his mementos or anything that reminded him of his four years in war.


One of the most wonderful things that I think has happened very organically now is that, through the Centenary of Anzac activities, we are capturing more and more of the individual stories of the men and women who served in World War I. While the stories of many of these servicemen in particular are now lost to time, save a family's note to them on their gravestone or their service records, wonderfully, what I have experienced myself now is that, through historians and the increasing work of families, people are going back and trying to recover and preserve as much of the family history of their World War I veteran relatives as they possibly can. How that is now evolving is truly a wonderful thing.


For example, before I went to Gallipoli, I attended several RSL Anzac Day ceremonies. One of the things that were very clear was that, even at the local community level, not just through RSLs but through schools and other community groups, people are now looking very carefully and closely at who served in their local community. They are capturing the stories of very ordinary Australians who did extraordinary things in the service of their country in World War I.


For example, in the RSL in my local area of Kalamunda in Perth I found the story of Sister Agnes Tait, who was from Carmel in the hills. She was the only woman on the Kalamunda and districts RSL honour roll. Sister Tait, against her parents' wishes, trained as a nurse at the Perth public hospital and joined the Australian Army Nursing Service on 23 August 1915. Sister Tait served in Egypt, at a casualty clearing station in France and at base hospitals across Europe and England. She spent years tending to the dead, dying and critically injured. She spent the last two years of the war on a Red Cross hospital ship, comforting those who were finally returning home. Like everybody else, she eventually returned home—in this case, to Kalamunda—where she remained for the rest of her life, serving the community as a nurse. Sister Tait is just one of the thousands of examples of local community members who are being remembered.


I was also very fortunate to launch in Fremantle, on behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, a wonderful book called Fremantle Voices of the Great War. This was an astonishing achievement by Mr Pittaway and the Army historical society. They discovered that over 3,000 young men left the Fremantle community for the Great War and nearly a third of them never returned home. It is a wonderful book that captures what it was like at the time in Fremantle. The historians spent many years working with families, going through their records and pulling out family oral histories. It is a most remarkable record of the Fremantle community.


Melissa Parke, the member for Fremantle, was also at the launch. Interestingly, by sharing my story of my grandfather and her sharing her story of her great-uncle, we realised that the two of them served together at Gallipoli. In fact, they were both in the 3rd Field Ambulance, my grandfather leaving from Albany and her great-uncle leaving from Fremantle. They must have known each other and served together, tending the wounded and the dying at Gallipoli. You just never know quite where these linkages are going to come from.


My story that I shared last night and the thousands of other stories that are now coming to light not only help families preserve the memory of their family members, sometimes three generations ago now, but also make sure that these men and women are remembered. When we come together as a nation to commemorate all those who have served—not just those in World War I but in World War II, all the other conflicts we have been involved in and those we are involved in today—it gives families the understanding and ability to make sure that they capture the stories when they can. That is one of the many wonderful things that the Centenary of Anzac program is delivering to this nation. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:30):  I rise to speak on the ministerial statement on the Centenary of Anzac and to reiterate the sentiments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and, hopefully, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, when he is able to get back from the War Memorial.


The Centenary of the Anzac landings on Gallipoli have given all Australians the opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices that our service men and women have made for our country. While the centenary recognises time passed since that conflict, the commemoration of Anzac has a much broader meaning. It is important that we as Australians remember that Anzac Day is a commemoration and a time of reflection. It is a time not only to reflect on the actions of the Anzacs 100 years ago but also to recognise the sacrifices and commitment of our men and women who are currently serving overseas far from home and their families. While the Anzac legend is firmly rooted in the shores of Gallipoli, the values that the Anzacs represent have been practised by Australian service men and women ever since.


Anzac Day is our opportunity to recognise and thank all of those who have given themselves to protect our country. Many of my colleagues have spoken about the Anzac Centenary in past weeks. I share their admiration for those who have served, but I take this opportunity to make particular mention of the men and women who are currently serving overseas and the families who support them. There are approximately 2,750 Australians serving in 14 different operations globally. They are working in places like Iraq, Sudan and across the Middle East as well as closer to home. These people exemplify the best qualities of our military and community. They operate under challenging circumstances with dignity, compassion and professionalism. As they uphold the honourable values that we associate with the Anzac spirit, their families at home bear the heavy burden of an absent loved one. Service to our country puts immense distance between parents and children, husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. We as a community have an obligation to those service families. While our loved ones are representing our country far from home, we must ensure that these families are appropriately supported. Provision of housing, health care, education and other essential services helps ease the burden of having a loved one away while on service related duties. Furthermore, this support must extend to our veterans once their service is complete. The spirit of Anzac demands that we stand by our people. Their service has earned are respect and our gratitude.


On behalf of this side of the chamber I sincerely thank all of the courageous people who have served our country throughout its history. The Anzac commemoration has been an opportunity for all Australians to thank you for your service. I congratulate the minister for overseeing an excellent program and an excellent centenary. It is a credit to him.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Special Minister of State) (17:33):  I thank Senator Conroy for his very generous comments. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Australians actively participated in the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on Anzac Day this year. In the biggest cities and the smallest towns and farming communities, Australians gathered in extraordinary numbers to pay their respects to all those men and women who have served our nation in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations over more than a century of service.


Since the last election, the government has issued two ministerial statements about the Centenary of Anzac. This statement, the third, looks back at the events of Anzac Day 2015 but also forward to the remainder of the commemorative program until the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day on 11 November 2018.


Community enthusiasm for Anzac Day is arguably at its highest level in a generation. Crowds at dawn services in Australia continued to increase. There were huge crowds in capital cities, including here in Canberra. Major regional dawn services, such as at Torquay in Victoria, Albany in Western Australia and Elephant Rock in Queensland, continued to see large crowds. Marches in many cities saw their largest attendance in many years. I would like to place on the public record my thanks to those responsible for coordinating the Anzac Day activities across the country. I particularly acknowledge the Returned and Services League of Australia, the RSL, for their work. I know that many RSL subbranches were responsible for working with local government, police and other services to coordinate community commemorative events involving large numbers of Australians. To the RSL, in particular, and other ex-service and service organisations who took on this responsibility I say a most sincere thankyou on behalf of the Australian government.


I also wish to place on the record how proud I am of the staff from my department and across the government who worked tirelessly to bring events in Gallipoli together. The people responsible are part of a small, dedicated and highly professional team of staff who bring together these services on Anzac Day. I echo the words of the Prime Minister when he said their planning was 'meticulous'. I add to this by saying, 'Thank you—you have done your nation proud.'


The Gallipoli dawn service was attended by 10,043 people at the Anzac Commemorative Site in Turkey on Anzac Day. On the Western Front, a crowd of 6,100 attended the Anzac Day dawn service at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux. Australians also gathered in large numbers in Belgium and in London, as well as at Hellfire Pass in Thailand, Isurava and Bomana in Papua New Guinea, Sandakan in Malaysia, in Vietnam and throughout New Zealand. 


I turn to the budget. Funding in this year's budget will deliver the government's commitment to honour not just events on the Western Front and Be'er Sheva but key anniversaries throughout the century of service. The government will provide additional financial support for a commemorative event at Gallipoli on 6 August 2015 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Lone Pine and the August Offensive. The Lone Pine ceremony will take place at 5pm on 6 August 2015 at the Lone Pine Cemetery. Attendance at this ceremony will not be balloted. The attack at Lone Pine began in the early evening of 6 August 1915 and it is appropriate that, 100 years on, we mark this event at this time.


The August offensive, which this ceremony will commemorate, was the last great push by the Allies against Turkish forces. Four days of intense fighting led to more than 2,000 Australians being killed or wounded. This ceremony will particularly honour them. The service also provides those Australians who were unable to attend Gallipoli on Anzac Day with the chance to visit and participate in a commemorative event.


We have also allocated funding to mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War. Later this month I will announce the details of the government's plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, marking 50 years since Australian forces fought in the Vietnam War. 


I view these commemorations as being as important as the commemoration of events during the First and Second World Wars. The Centenary of Anzac is far from over. We have a duty to honour the memory of the men and women who served our nation with such distinction and whose names are listed in the cloisters at the Australian War Memorial. A nation that fails to remember is a nation that fails itself.


I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

NORFOLK ISLAND LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2015


Almost a year ago today, I provided a statement in this House on the critical issues facing Norfolk Island.


Today, I introduce a Bill that seeks to resolve these issues through a range of significant changes.


Norfolk Island is a small and remote community with a population of around 1,800 people.


Like any remote community, Norfolk Island has challenges in terms of service delivery, infrastructure maintenance and economic growth.


However, on Norfolk Island these challenges have only been magnified by a unique set of governance arrangements.


Under arrangements established in 1979, the Norfolk Island government is required to deliver all local, state and many federal services—more than any other government in Australia.


It is not reasonable to expect such a small and remote community to deliver these responsibilities effectively.


It is no surprise that services on Norfolk Island are well below the standard Australians typically expect.


In fact, there is almost a complete absence of the health and social services most Australians take for granted.


For instance, Norfolk Island is the only place in Australia where Australian citizens do not receive social security benefits and do not fully participate in the Australian taxation system.


Norfolk Island's problems are not new, but they are now critical.


There has been no significant infrastructure investment since the 1970s, and the Norfolk Island government has not had the capacity to maintain what was built then, or earlier.


The Island's Hospital is outdated.


The roads are deteriorating.


And the Island's electricity network is at risk of collapse.


The financial position of the Norfolk Island government is also dire.


The Australian government has provided in excess of $40 million in assistance since 2010 to keep essential services going.


But this assistance has not dealt with the underlying problems.


The Bills introduced today provide the structural reform needed to strengthen Norfolk Island and ensure its sustainability.


From 1 July 2016, the Norfolk Island community will have access to social security payments.


Older Australians will be able to access the age pension.


Families will be able to access a range of support payments such as family tax benefits.


The community will also have access to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and will no longer pay a separate Norfolk Island healthcare levy, which unfairly targets low income earners.


In line with our election commitment, these benefits will be introduced with the taxation system.


From 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island residents will pay income tax and other direct federal taxes on all of their income, not just their income sourced from the mainland.


Federal taxes will replace a range of inefficient taxes and charges currently levied by the Norfolk Island government.


This includes a local goods and services tax and punitive customs charges. Both of these will be removed.


The Australian government will also extend the superannuation guarantee to Norfolk Island, to allow future generations to save for their retirement.


To minimise the impact on business, the guarantee will be phased in over the next twelve years.


Economic modelling has shown that the long term impact of these changes will be overwhelmingly positive.


According to the Centre of International Economics, Gross Territory Product is projected to increase by around 25 per cent, and household consumption will go up by 52 per cent.


However, the full application of Australia's social security and taxation system alone does not address the long-standing need for governance reform.


The need for governance reform is well recognised and has been the subject of numerous reports, inquiries and submissions over the last four decades.


Most recently, the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories concluded that governance and economic reform must occur together to give the community the greatest chance of recovery.


The Committee's strong and bipartisan recommendation was that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly be transitioned to a Regional Council.


The Bill I am introducing today will achieve this.


Following the Bill's commencement, the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and Executive Council will be dissolved, and a Local Advisory Council appointed to represent community views.


From 1 July 2016, a Norfolk Island Regional Council will be established to deliver an extended range of local services.


This Council will be elected by Islanders to represent Islanders.


Under this model local issues will be driven at the local level wherever possible, without placing unreasonable expectations on this small and remote community.


From 1 July 2016, New South Wales laws will gradually be applied on Norfolk Island to provide a modern body of state law.


The Australian government will also negotiate with the New South Wales government to expand the range of services it currently provides.


Other federal services will also be extended.


From 1 July 2016, the Australian migration system will replace the immigration arrangements currently maintained by the Norfolk Island government.


This will remove a key barrier to tourism and trade, and simplify travel arrangements significantly.


Customs and biosecurity services will also be provided by Australian government agencies.


These changes will bring Norfolk Island in line with other Australian communities and ensure services are delivered to a modern standard by the appropriate level of government.


Although common-sense, these reforms represent significant change for the local community.


Ultimately, our goal is to put Norfolk Island on a more sustainable footing.


It is about delivering growth and prosperity and protecting Norfolk Island's cultural identity and rich heritage for generations to come.


I would like to thank the community for its active engagement to date and for showing such strong support for the reforms being implemented today.


The Australian government will continue to engage closely with the community during this process and into the future.


We are committed to doing what is needed to deliver a better future for all Australians, regardless of where they live.


 


TAX AND SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (NORFOLK ISLAND REFORMS) BILL 2015


The Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Norfolk Island Reforms) Bill 2015 amends taxation and superannuation legislation to fully apply Australia's income tax, Medicare Levy and superannuation guarantee system to Norfolk Island.


The Bill will see the taxation system apply to Norfolk Island in the same way it currently applies to mainland Australia, with the exception of indirect taxes including the GST, customs duty and excise duties.


This Bill will establish transitional arrangements which phase in the superannuation guarantee over the next twelve years.


This Bill also establishes transitional arrangements in respect of capital gains tax.  This will ensure that Norfolk Islanders are only taxed on capital gains that accrue from 1 July 2016.


 


A NEW TAX SYSTEM (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE—FRINGE BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 2015


The A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Amendment Bill 2015 makes consequential amendments to A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999.


These amendments support the repeal of the Medicare Levy exemptions provided for by the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Norfolk Island Reforms) Bill 2015.


 


HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES (COMPENSATION) CARE CHARGES AMENDMENT (NORFOLK ISLAND) BILL 2015


The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Amendment (Norfolk Island) Bill 2015 supports the extension of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 to Norfolk Island.


The Bill ensures that Medicare benefits, nursing home benefits or residential care subsidies are recoverable from persons on Norfolk Island who receive compensation or damages through a judgement or settlement.


 


HEALTH INSURANCE (APPROVED PATHOLOGY SPECIMEN COLLECTION CENTRES) TAX AMENDMENT (NORFOLK ISLAND) BILL 2015


The Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment (Norfolk Island) Bill 2015 will ensure that the tax on the grant of an approval for a specimen collection centre under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and, for related purposes, also applies to persons who reside on Norfolk Island.


 


HEALTH INSURANCE (PATHOLOGY) (FEES) AMENDMENT (NORFOLK ISLAND) BILL 2015


The Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Amendment (Norfolk Island) Bill 2015 works with the Health Insurance Act 1973, which is being amended in the Norfolk Island Legislation Reform Bill 2015.


This Bill relates to the fees payable for certain purposes of the Health Insurance Act 1973, such as the acceptance of an approved pathology authority undertaking and the approval of premises as an accredited pathology laboratory.


 


AGED CARE (ACCOMMODATION PAYMENT SECURITY) LEVY AMENDMENT (NORFOLK ISLAND) BILL 2015


The Aged Care (Accommodation Payment Security) Levy Amendment (Norfolk Island) Bill 2015 relates to the imposition of levies in respect of certain obligations to refund accommodation payment balances, and for related purposes.


This Bill is part of the broader Norfolk Island reform package, which implements the government's election commitment to fully apply mainland taxation and social security to Norfolk Island.


 


PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE (RISK EQUALISATION LEVY) AMENDMENT (NORFOLK ISLAND) BILL 2015


The Private Health Insurance (Risk Equalisation Levy) Amendment (Norfolk Island) Bill 2015 relates to the broader Norfolk Island reform legislative package which is being implemented through the Norfolk Island Legislation Reform Bill 2015.


The Private Health Insurance (Risk Equalisation Levy) Act imposes a risk equalisation levy on private health insurers, and for related purposes.


The Act is part of the Private Health Insurance arrangements which exist on mainland Australia which are to be extended to Norfolk Island through the Norfolk Island Legislation Reform Bill 2015.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:44):  I am very pleased to continue my remarks on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. I remind those who are present and those listening that this bill proposes to amend the act to provide for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority which might care to exit the Comcare scheme. This has been prompted by the fact that the ACT government indicated in February that it might so move. It consulted and it has concluded its consultations. Therefore, why is it necessary that we do it and why now? I would like to reflect on that for a few moments if I can.


Firstly, the framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect exit contributions from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. What does this ensure? That the employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount of money to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. I go back to the comments made by senators Rice and Cameron, in which they were expressing, quite rightly, concern for the interests of employees. That brings me to the point that the framework will ensure that employees injured before an employer leaves the scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority. That is the primary objective. It goes on to enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or the bodies that succeed them. These are entirely appropriate and reasonable factors. Why do we need to be dealing with it now? Because, indeed, the ACT government has flagged the likelihood that it may want to exit the scheme. What we will then do through this legislative amendment is to clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities, such as a government department, should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as is available under section 90C of the act. That is what the wider community and particularly those likely to be affected would be expecting us to do. 


The framework will allow Comcare to agree to instalments of an exit contribution being paid over a period up to seven years from the day on which the determination is made to allow for run-off liability estimates. Furthermore, in terms of fairness, the framework will provide for Comcare to refund all or part of an exit contribution if the assessment reveals that the amount of the available scheme funds attributed to the exited employer exceed Comcare's liabilities. If indeed there has been an over-estimate, they get the money back. Determinations of a refund will only be made within that seven-year period after the employer exits the scheme. It also, on the other side, provides for Comcare to remit the whole or part of an unpaid instalment of an exit contribution if a later assessment reveals that the amount of the available scheme funds that is attributable to the exited employer exceeds what Comcare's liabilities are.


Why are these amendments so important now? Because we have the ACT government contemplating the likelihood of exiting. Indeed, we are fortunate to have the recent Chief Minister of the ACT now in the chamber, and I am sure she could further advise colleagues as to what the thinking of the ACT government was, certainly up until the time she ceased being Chief Minister. The amendments are important for two major  reasons: firstly, to protect injured employees who remain in the Comcare scheme and, secondly, to make sure the future viability of the Comcare scheme is protected. 


Since 2013-14, Comcare has been progressively restoring the funding position of the scheme. I know people would be very pleased to learn that. This bill will support existing measures now put into place by Comcare to restore funds to adequate levels to meet estimated liabilities. Surely there can be nobody in this chamber and nobody listening to this discussion who would have any argument with that sound philosophy. The bill will also ensure that Commonwealth authorities do not exit the Comcare scheme without paying an appropriate amount to cover any unfunded liabilities arising from claims that will continue to be managed by Comcare into the future. This protects premium payers who remain in the scheme, and this is what we want to see happen.


If I can recap, this bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to provide for financial and other arrangements when a Commonwealth authority exits the Comcare scheme. The frameworks established by these amendments I have outlined. It is important to have such arrangements in place in the context of the ACT, because the ACT Labor government has indicated that it is looking at a potential departure from the Comcare scheme, citing it as being 'quite burdensome, not only for claimants but for their employers as well'. It is essential that this amendment is passed so that any liabilities the ACT government may have in consideration of existing or prospective employees will indeed be adequately funded so that those people are protected. Employees injured before a Commonwealth authority leaves the Comcare scheme will continue—I repeat, will continue—to receive compensation and rehabilitation under the SRC Act. The bill will ensure stability for workers, employers and the Comcare scheme when a Commonwealth authority exits the scheme. I cannot be more clear than that. The bill goes on to amend the act to clarify that premiums for current premium payers should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and future liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as would be available under the relevant section of the act, section 90C. So I come back to that commentary again about protecting injured employees who remain in the scheme, as well as ensuring the future viability of the scheme itself.


Let me make the point strongly that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015, the one we are debating at the moment, is not in any way related to other reforms that passed the House of Representatives on 26 November last year and are currently before the Senate. Let me make it clear, again, that the matter we are considering at this moment is not in any way related to these reforms. I am not going to go back and rehash the commentary of Senator Cameron in this particular space, except to emphasise again: they are unrelated. But it is unfortunate that the opposition, in opposing any meaningful reform in this space, is not encouraging, allowing or agreeing to reasonable dialogue and discussion in this area.


The Comcare scheme generally operates effectively. There are four areas that I want to focus on. Firstly, achieving high safety—and surely, that would be commendable. Secondly, return-to-work outcomes—and all of us, whether we are on the employer side or the employee side, know very well that speed of return to work is surely the highest priority, when it is safe to do so. The third area is the provision of income replacement through to retirement age, and the statement is made, 'it is almost the only scheme left in Australia which actually provides income replacement right through to retirement age'. The fourth area—and equally importantly for all people who are covered under these protections—is medical support for life.


It falls to people like ourselves, law-makers in this place, to make sure that each of those four high ideals remains permanent, remains current, and remains affordable. But there are signs that the scheme is coming under pressure. For example, while Comcare's return-to-work rates are better than average, they are falling. They are not where we want them to be. If this is to be the benchmark, we want the benchmark to be set higher. And the current experience is that return-to-work rates are falling; they are still better than average, but they are falling. Secondly, some medical treatments are not making people better in the long term. And thirdly, employers are facing rising premiums and other costs. So what do we need to do about this? The amendments that are proposed and are sitting here in the Senate are aimed, in fact, to address those issues. They are aimed to improve the return-to-work outcomes for injured employees and injured workers. They are aimed to put focus on early intervention and health outcomes for injured workers. And they are, thirdly, aimed at improving the operation of the system by excluding injuries sustained in non-work activities outside the workplace; excluding, of course, secondary psychological injuries, and removing payment for non-traditional treatments.


Let me make the point very strongly: reference has been made of course to the fact that if somebody is outside their workplace, during their lunch hour or whatever, they cease to have any coverage; if they go across the road, or if they go into a cafe or whatever—but such of course is not the case. We in Australia know very well the circumstance in which, if somebody is injured, for example in a road-related accident, they are adequately insured under third-party provisions. Indeed, if somebody was in an eating establishment and injured themselves, we know the law requires that the operator of that facility must have adequate insurance to protect customers. So there is a circumstance in which there is still adequate cover under the provisions for which we seek.


The package of reforms which will be considered here in the Senate in due course is important in providing a strong and sustainable scheme into the future to ensure that Australia's only remaining long-tail workers compensation scheme exists, is adequately funded, and ensures that the employees of any organisation who leave Comcare in fact have still got adequate financial funding. I want to stress if I may the fact that this package of reforms has been supported by departmental secretaries and heads of agencies. It has been supported by licensees and has broad support in the community.


Concerns have been expressed in this place and elsewhere—and I am sure they will be raised again—about the question of the viability of state and territory work, health and safety workers compensation schemes in relation to the potential exodus of employers, particularly large employers, from the schemes. The information that is available suggests that this is, at most, a minor issue, if indeed it is an issue at all. The 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry suggested that the volatility in premium rates that might occur in the event of such exits are not supported by evidence. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission and a 2008 review of self-insurance arrangements under Comcare both indicated that the impact of exits of corporations from state-based schemes on those schemes or on remaining employers would be minimal; and Taylor Fry, in their actuarial report to inform the 2008 Comcare review, concluded that the financial impacts of the exits to the Comcare scheme from other Australian jurisdictions had been insignificant.


To conclude: will the bill adversely affect any employee entitlements to compensation? The answer is no. An employee who is injured before an employer exits the scheme will continue to be compensated under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The bill will ensure that employees injured before an employer's exit continue to be supported by appropriate rehabilitation authority, protecting the rehabilitation rights of employees. Let me finish, if I may, with these two brief observations. The bill will ensure that Commonwealth authorities exiting the Comcare scheme cover the costs of their liabilities. This will protect premium payers remaining in the scheme and ensure that injured workers continue to be supported. And I make this final observation. Anybody in this place voting against this bill is, indeed, voting against ensuring that injured workers have a safety net should their employer leave the scheme.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (18:00):  I rise to oppose the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015 that is before us, and I can assure Senator Back that I absolutely, 100 per cent support workers getting their full entitlement to a workers compensation scheme. To suggest that if you vote against the bill somehow you are voting against the safety and the wellbeing of workers if they are injured is absolute rubbish.


This is one of three bills around workers compensation which will disadvantage workers. This is bill No. 2, and the Abbott government really does need to lay out its plan. There is bill No. 1, although it has not come into the Senate, there is bill No. 2, which is before us today, and, of course, there is a third bill, and to suggest that somehow these bills are unrelated is not true. There are relationships between all of them, and it is clearly about disadvantaging workers. If they are not related then why have they been brought in together and why are they all about Comcare? Of course they are related, and this bill is being put before the Senate because the government thinks that perhaps it will get support for this bill and it will start the softening up process to get the other two bills in place.


Indeed, we were able to have an inquiry for the first bill, and what stakeholders told us in that process was that, yes, they had had meetings with the department, but they were bound by rules of confidentiality. So they were not allowed to speak outside of the meetings about the content of those meetings and when they sought additional information about bills coming forward they were not told anything either. What sort of consultation process is it when we bind people and when we make them sign documents so that they will not utter a word about what happened in the meeting and when they sought information about future bills they were told that was not part of the discussion? That is not an open and transparent process, and of course those stakeholders had every right to be suspicious and to be very concerned about what was going to come next because of these confidentiality provisions. In the inquiry we had on that first bill we asked the department if we could have further information, but we were told, no, we could not either. I think we ended up getting the list of who attended those secret meetings, but we were not able to get much further than that.


Labor opposes this bill. Fundamentally, this bill will allow employers and insurers to scheme swap at will between state and national schemes. The arrangement laid out in this bill may potentially lead to the economic collapse of state schemes, and Labor believes it is likely to drive up premiums for small- to medium-sized employers. Again, with this bill, the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee was denied a public hearing by a majority of government senators on the committee, and it is absolutely shameful that this open and transparent process was denied to us. It is the second time that I have reported in this place that, on government controlled inquiries, senators have been denied an open and public transparent process. It is one thing to have submissions in front of you; it is quite another to have witnesses in front of you where they make particular statements that are worth exploring or they give you further information than was in their written submission.


But, no, the Abbott government and its senators in this place absolutely denied an open, public, transparent hearing into this bill. So it is left to Labor to defend and raise our concerns in this place about the bill because we were denied that opportunity through the Senate processes. More and more we are seeing that, when the government do not want to be held accountable, when they do not want to listen to independent evidence and experts, they simply use their numbers and deny the Labor senators that opportunity for an open and public hearing. It does lead me to say: what are they hiding? What is it about this bill, in particular, that they do not want transparency to be on the record?


Despite what we heard from government senators, there is no need to rush this bill. There is simply no need to rush this bill, because, despite the Australian Capital Territory signalling it wishes to exit the bill, it is a long way from doing that. The Australian Capital Territory government is in the process of consulting about the makeup of any new scheme. It does not yet have a designated scheme and it will not for some time. So why the rush? As we know, there is a bill that has not been voted on in this place that looks to cut workers' entitlements, and what I think the government are trying to do is to soften up the crossbench senators and get this bill through and then say to them: 'It's all a part of a tranche. There are three bills here. You voted for the first bill. The sky hasn't fallen down. Let's bring the other bills in.' I am sure that is their plan.


It is time that the Abbott government laid out their plan and stopped trying to pretend there is no link between any of these bills, because there is a link. The Australian Capital Territory government is out there running an open and transparent process—unlike the opportunities to have an open and transparent public hearing in this place, which we were denied by government senators. So why the rush? Rather than try and push a bill through the Senate, why aren't the Abbott government talking to the Australian Capital Territory government? Why aren't they talking to them? Maybe they are. But, again, we do not know, because we did not have that public hearing. But what we do know from the Abbott government's track record is that they do not like to consult. They do not like open consultations. They do not like independent advice. They do not really like anything contrary to their own positions. So the Abbott government thinks the only way forward is to rush this bill through.


Labor wants to be absolutely certain that no worker will be worse off as a result of this bill. I speak from experience. I worked for quite some time as the workers compensation officer at the WA branch of United Voice. In that role, one of the hardest roles I have ever done in my career, I met workers with debilitating injuries—low-paid workers, cleaners, orderlies, nurses, early childhood educators, and manufacturing workers, many with debilitating injuries. I met workers who desperately wanted to get back to work. They wanted to look after their families and do all the things they did before they suffered a workplace injury. I worked with good employers who respected workers and did everything in their power to get workers back to work and to start the rehabilitation process. Unfortunately, and in the majority of cases, I also met employers and insurers whose agenda was to reduce their costs and to take no responsibility for injured workers. Sadly, I saw too many workers caught up in a situation not of their making and completely outside of their control. I saw deliberate actions taken by insurers and employers to drag out claims, to deny benefits, to put workers in a situation where they had no money coming in, to blame workers for their workplace injury and to suggest it was because a worker smoked or was not fit enough or was old. They would use any excuse rather than take responsibility for the fact that their workplace had injured that worker.


I saw workers treated disgracefully at the hands of employers and insurers: workers who throughout their working life had given extra and who did not knock off right at the end of the shift; workers who always were willing to take on additional roles, who gave loyal service and who expected in their time of need their employer to act in the same way when they needed support. I have seen workers totally broken who started out with a physical injury and ended up with mental disabilities, not because of their injuries but because of the way they were treated once they entered the workers compensation scheme. There were far too many who were broken individuals as a result of a workplace injury not of their own making. As a Labor senator in this place I stand for fairness and justice for these workers.


I want to touch on an other point raised by Senator Back that came out at the hearing we had on the first bill, and I must say that I could not believe what I was hearing. I did not want to believe the words on the page, where the first bill sought to take away the right to workers compensation during an unpaid work break, such as a lunch break. Let us just imagine the early childhood educator who started her shift at seven o'clock and works in the city and maybe travels an hour to get to work. She would have left home at six o'clock, so maybe she got up at five o'clock to start her day. At lunch time she will want to have a break. I do not know whether you have been into a child care centre but, unlike perhaps in a big manufacturing workplace, or in a hospital or in an aged care facility, the staff rooms are very small. They often serve as meeting rooms for other workers or as places where workers do programming. So they are not always a place to relax, to get away from the children and to have a desperately needed break. Working with children is rewarding work, but it is also hard work. From my experience as an organiser in the early childhood sector, I can tell you that many workers like to get out and have a break—they like to leave the centre at lunch time. If that worker leaves the centre and walks over to the shopping centre and then trips and hurts herself, under the bill before the Senate she will be out on her own.


I can also tell you that many of those workers work a day shift. As you would know, getting to the bank or the post office is often something workers do in their unpaid break, because it is the only time they can do those things. I heard Senator Back say, 'Oh, well they will be covered by public liability or they will be covered by motor vehicle insurance.' Can you imagine the scenario? There I am leaving the child care centre and I walk down the pavement and I trip. As a low-paid educator earning about $21 or $22 an hour, am I going to engage a lawyer to sue the council? How likely is that? It is incredibly unlikely, and it is impossible. I would not know where an early childhood educator would get the funds to stump up money for a lawyer to sue the council, and to win. We know those claims are arduous and are hard to prove. What if I am injured walking across the road. Do I then make a claim on motor vehicles? Or if I finally get into the shopping centre and I trip over will I then go after the shopping centre's public liability? What a ridiculous statement to make that somehow someone else is responsible for that worker.


The other thing I can inform the Senate is that the break in child care centres is an hour long, not because the worker needs it, but because the employers like to stretch the day out so that they do not have to bring additional staff in. They have that worker there from seven until four o'clock and they give them an hour off because they want to lengthen the shift to reduce their rosters so that they do not have to bring other workers in. Here we are saying that that worker who leaves the childcare service at lunchtime to have a break or to pay a bill or to get to the post office is somehow on her own. What a ridiculous statement to make! It shows how absolutely out-of-touch this Abbott government is that they do not know what workers do during their lunch hour.


During the Senate inquiry we heard—Senator Abetz and the Abbott government are very good at making things up—about the worker who goes surfing and incurs an injury. I do not know how many workers Senator Abetz has met, but over my lifetime as a union official I have met thousands, and I have never yet met one who went surfing during their lunch break. I have met plenty who went shopping, who bought the dinner, who went to the post office, who paid the bills, who rang their kids to check on how they were doing and did all the things that all of us do as part of our daily life. But that is what you will hear from those opposite: 'What about the person who goes surfing?' What about the early childhood educator who simply goes to pay a bill and then gets denied workers compensation because she has had an accident outside of the workplace? That is ridiculous, and it is not something that Labor senators will support in this place.


I want to be absolutely sure—whether it is this bill, bill No. 1; or whether it is this bill before us, No. 2; or whether it is the incorrectly-titled bill No. 3, 'Improving the Comcare scheme'—that no worker will be worse off. But those assurances are not there—they are clearly not there with these bills. And nothing I have read and nothing I have heard and nothing in my own experience as a workers compensation officer and as an organiser gives me confidence that the bills deliver confidence and real surety and protection for workers. What I see in this bill continues the Abbott government's anti-worker and anti-union agenda. I counted the bills the other day because I got invited to speak at the national day of mourning for workers killed on the job in Perth, and the Abbott government has brought something like 15 anti-worker or anti-union bills before this place. Remember when we heard that Work Choices was dead, buried and cremated? Well, it is not. The Abbott government is trying to attack workers and their unions by stealth through 15 bills—most of them rejected in this place. That is Work Choices—when you start to take away workers rights and when you start to reduce their access to unions. I have spoken before about the appalling death rate in the construction industry which goes completely unnoticed by the Abbott government.


We should have a bill to immediately look at and stop workplace deaths, not these sorts of bills which rip entitlements away from workers. It is a disgrace that we do not respect those who toil, that we do not respect lives, that we think it is somehow okay for someone to lose their life when earning their livelihood. Labor senators do not stand for that, and that is why we oppose these bills. The Abbott government has not undertaken proper consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders about this. No doubt they will tell us: 'We had secret confidential meetings that no-one is allowed to tell you about.' But they denied us a proper hearing where we could get evidence out in the open on this particular bill.


It is really important that there is a thorough investigation of the legislation, because the Abbott government has already sought to make adverse changes to the Comcare scheme. These proposed changes will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. What we heard in the first hearing—and that is the only hearing I can refer to, because we have not had a hearing on this bill—was that somehow we needed to make these changes to the Comcare scheme because of red tape. I tell you what: if the choice for me and other Labor senators is between red tape and workers' lives, or between red tape and workers remaining fit and well in the workplace, then I will pick red tape any day. I know there is not a Labor senator here who would say: 'Let's reduce red tape and create a risk that injures or, in extreme examples, where a worker dies.' No. There is a view from the Abbott government that all red tape is somehow bad; but it is not, because workers in this country need red tape to protect them. They absolutely need that. We will not be supporting words that say 'improving' and 'simplifying', because we know that that reduces workers entitlements and puts them at risk. We will not be supporting this bill.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (18:20):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. By way of background for those listening and for those reading this later, Commonwealth authorities—for example, the ACT government—and entities including an agency or a parliamentary department are premium payers under the Comcare scheme. Licensees and some Commonwealth authorities who hold a licence self-insure and, accordingly, do not pay premiums to Comcare. Comcare is responsible for paying liabilities associated with injuries sustained by employees of premium payers from Comcare-retained funds under section 90C of the act. Comcare-retained funds should be adequate to meet current and prospective liabilities from year to year. The amendments made by the bill will clarify this intention as well as ensure mechanisms are in place to support Comcare to manage its liabilities in Comcare-retained funds. 


On 26 February 2015 the ACT government announced that it is consulting its workforce on plans to leave the Comcare scheme. Consultations were completed on 8 May 2015, only a week ago. If a premium payer as large as the ACT exits the scheme without paying an amount to cover unfunded liabilities, this would further diminish the capacity of Comcare-retained funds to be sufficient to meet liabilities. The associated risk of underfunding would be borne by remaining premium payers or the Commonwealth. This bill proposes to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act of 1988 to provide for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority to exit the Comcare scheme.


Firstly, the framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect exit contributions from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. This will ensure that an employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. 


Secondly, the framework will ensure that employees injured before an employer leaves the scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority. 


Thirdly, the framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or successor bodies. 


Fourthly, the framework will clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities such as government departments should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the consolidated revenue fund as is available under section 90C of the act.


Fifthly, the framework will allow Comcare to agree to instalments of an exit contribution being paid over a period of up to seven years after the day on which the determination is made, to allow for run-off of liability estimates. 


Sixthly, the framework will provide for Comcare to refund all or part of an exit contribution if an assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds attributable to an exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities. Determinations of a refund may only be made within the seven-year period immediately after an employer exits the scheme.


Finally, the framework will provide for Comcare to remit the whole or part of an unpaid instalment of an exit contribution if a later assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds that is attributable to the exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities. The amendments will also make minor contingent amendments related to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014—part 2 of schedule 1. Schedule 2 of the bill amends provisions in the act related to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to streamline appointment processes and ensure appropriate membership of the commission.


That was a little bit of background. This is a straightforward and logical bill that simply takes account of what can and should happen should any premium payer or licensee decide to leave the Comcare scheme. It is important to have such arrangements in place, especially given that the ACT Labor government have indicated that they are looking at a potential departure from the scheme, citing it is as burdensome for claimants and for their employers. They have said: 


The Comcare system is quite burdensome, not only for claimants but for their employers ….


Employees injured before a Commonwealth authority leaves the Comcare scheme will continue to receive compensation and rehabilitation under the act. The bill will ensure stability for workers, employers and the Comcare scheme when a Commonwealth authority exits the scheme. The bill also amends the act to clarify that premiums for current premium payers should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and future liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare-retained funds and so much of the consolidated revenue as would be available under the act.


The question is: why are these amendments important? The act is being amended to protect injured employees who remain in the Comcare scheme as well as to ensure the future financial viability of the Comcare scheme. Since 2013-14, Comcare has been progressively restoring the funding position of the scheme. The bill will support existing measures put in place by Comcare to restore funds to adequate levels to meet estimated liabilities. The bill will also ensure that Commonwealth authorities do not exit the Comcare scheme without paying an appropriate amount to cover any unfunded liabilities arising from claims that will continue to be managed by Comcare into the future. This will protect premium payers who remain in the scheme. 


We should be aware—this has been touched upon by a couple of senators who have spoken prior to me—that there are two bills here at the moment. The Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 passed the House of Representatives on 26 November 2014, and is currently before the Senate. That bill is focused on expanding the coverage of the Comcare scheme for national employers as self-insurers. The bill excludes coverage for recess breaks where a person is injured during an ordinary recess break away from their employer's premises, unless the injury arises from employment. The bill also excludes an injury arising from serious and wilful misconduct, where it results in death or serious and permanent impairment.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015 is not, in any way, related to these reforms.    That said, given the opposition's obsession with opposing any meaningful reform in this space I do want to briefly touch on the other bill that is currently being considered.


The Comcare scheme generally operates effectively. It achieves relatively high safety and return-to-work outcomes, and it is almost the only scheme in Australia to provide income replacement to retirement age and medical support for life. The legislation underpinning the scheme has not changed much since it was introduced 27 years ago. Workplaces and working conditions, health care and rehabilitation practices, technology, social behaviour and expectations have all changed in that time. Various court decisions have also affected the way the act is applied in practice. To keep pace with the modernisation of work and health practices the scheme needs to be updated. There are also signs that the scheme is coming under pressure. For example, while Comcare's return-to-work rates are better than average, they are actually falling. Some medical treatments are failing to make people better in the long term and    employers face rising premiums and other costs.


The proposed amendments aim to do the following:    improve return to work outcomes for injured workers; put the focus on early intervention and health outcomes of injured workers; and improve the operation of the system by excluding injuries sustained in non-work activities outside work, excluding secondary psychological injuries, and removing payment for non-traditional treatments. That package of reforms, which will be considered by this place in due course, is important in providing a strong and sustainable scheme into the future to ensure the continuation of Australia's only remaining long-tail workers compensation scheme. Further—and I want to stress this because it is important—in an unprecedented submission to the Senate committee, that package of reforms has been supported by departmental secretaries and agency heads. It has been supported by licensees, and it has broad support in the community.


Submissions from stakeholders, which were picked up by the opposition in its additional comments, related to a different bill. These are falsities, which have been repeated by the opposition, that this bill will impact on state and territory workers compensation schemes. This bill has no impact on states and territories as it only applies to Commonwealth authorities if they exit the Comcare scheme, and it has no impact on premium payers under the state schemes. Concerns have been raised, however, about the impact of another bill currently before the parliament—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014—on the viability of state and territory work, health and safety and workers compensation schemes due to the potential exodus of employers, particularly large employers, from those schemes. The concern is that, if large employers with better safety records move to the Comcare scheme, premiums will increase for employers remaining in the state and territory schemes.


The 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks specifically noted that concern about exiting premium payers from state schemes would lead to volatility in premium rates was not supported by the evidence. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry, and for the 2008 review of self-insurance arrangements under the Comcare scheme, indicated that the impact on those schemes or on remaining employers of the exit of corporations from state based schemes would be minimal. Taylor Fry, in their actuarial report to inform the 2008 Comcare review, concluded that the financial impact of exits to the Comcare scheme from the other Australian jurisdictions had been insignificant.


Assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission concluded that: the larger the employer, the closer the premium is to the 'true' cost of claims and expenses, such that the exit of large employers would be relatively neutral to the state and territory schemes; and the percentage of exiting employers from state schemes would represent less than 10 per cent to scheme revenues and probably less than five per cent of scheme revenues. In the government's assessment the circumstances have not changed since 2004 and the impact will remain minimal. But, again, I say to the opposition: stop the dishonesty and focus, please, your attention on the bill before the Senate as we speak and not on the other bill.


In conclusion, the bill will ensure that Commonwealth authorities exiting the Comcare scheme cover the costs of their liabilities. This will protect premium payers remaining in the scheme and ensure that injured workers are supported. Any senator voting against this bill is voting against ensuring that injured workers have a safety net should their employer leave their scheme.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:35):  In rising to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill, I reiterate Labor's concern that the government seems to be rushing this legislation unnecessarily. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act established the Comcare scheme in 1988 to provide compensation and rehabilitation to Australian government and Australian Capital Territory government employees, as well as to employees of private corporations that hold a licence under the act.


The ACT government has indicated that it wishes to leave the scheme, citing cost concerns. This bill creates a framework for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority to exit the Comcare scheme. The framework established by these amendments will enable Comcare to determine and collect 'exit contributions' from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. This will ensure that an exiting employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. It will ensure that employees injured before the employer's exit continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority, and it will enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or successor bodies. The bill also amends the act to clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities should be calculated to ensure that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare-retained funds.


I mentioned at the outset that this bill is unnecessarily rushed, and I say so for two key reasons. Firstly, the government has introduced other legislation which may affect how this bill impacts on injured workers and, secondly, we have yet to see the design of the ACT government's replacement scheme. The ACT government scheduled a six-week consultation to listen to the views of stakeholders before designing a new rehabilitation and compensation scheme. That consultation period only ended last Friday, 8 May. The design of the new scheme is going to take a significant period of time, and the ACT government has made a commitment to work with stakeholders. 


Labor's first priority is to ensure that no worker will be worse off under this bill. We must also be certain that this bill will not provide an incentive for others to leave workers worse off. This is why Labor took the responsible course of action to refer the bill to the Senate Employment and Education Committee for a thorough investigation. However, since the bill was referred to an inquiry the government introduced another bill relating to the Comcare scheme. This bill—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Improving the Comcare Scheme) Bill—is the third substantive bill relating to the Comcare scheme currently before the parliament. Although the committee has concluded its inquiry into the exit arrangements bill, the introduction of the other bill, the third bill, means the committee has not had a proper opportunity to investigate the relationship of this bill with other bills concerning the Comcare scheme. 


I mentioned there were three substantive bills relating to the Comcare scheme. In March this year the government also introduced the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill. Labor strongly opposes this bill. The proposed changes in this bill will directly and indirectly risk the health and safety of Australian workers and will remove their rights to fair and reasonable cover when they suffer the misfortune of a work-related illness or injury.


The most recent bill—the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Improving the Comcare Scheme) Bill 2015—is over 200 pages long. It is also highly disadvantageous to workers. This bill makes cuts to the lump sum compensation payable for permanent impairment for the vast majority of injured workers and removes the already modest pain and suffering payment. I have concerns that this bill will leave workers worse off, particularly in relation to how the bill widens the way in which claims can be disqualified from compensation. Changes to eligibility requirements will mean injured workers are locked out of the scheme altogether. I have some examples of how this new scheme will impact workers.


Firstly, compensation entitlements would be suspended where an injured worker is absent from Australia for more than six weeks, for example even if they had a dying relative they needed to care for overseas. Under the current scheme, while a worker needs to seek approval prior to departure, there are no cuts to entitlements if a worker travels overseas. In circumstances where a worker is totally unfit for work as a result of a compensable work-related injury, it does not matter whether the worker lives in Australia or elsewhere.


Secondly, the current exclusionary provision for injuries caused by 'reasonable administrative action' will be broadened by the term 'reasonable management action'. This will exclude any physical or psychiatric injury or illness resulting from a directive of management unless an injured worker can prove unreasonableness. How would this affect an Australian Federal Police officer who is injured in the undertaking of his or her duties? For example, if an AFP officer is instructed by his supervising officer to investigate a suspected drug lab and is stabbed during that investigation, would the injured officer be excluded under the new law on the grounds that the injury was partially caused by the reasonable direction given by the superior officer to investigate?


Thirdly, there are new tests for vulnerability to injury which would require consideration of whether the worker would have hypothetically suffered a similar 'designated injury' at the 'same time in the worker's life' or at the 'same stage'. It has been a long-standing principle of injury and compensation law that the injured victim is taken as found, including their age, vulnerabilities and susceptibilities. Since any musculoskeletal condition may be regarded as an ailment or any spinal condition as a 'designated injury', the effect of such a provision has the potential to strike out any such musculoskeletal injury. In a society where the working age now extends beyond 65 years and the Abbott government has declared it expects workers to work longer, our workforce is ageing and therefore becoming more susceptible to workplace injury. This provision effectively serves to discriminate against workers on the basis of their age. 


These are just a few examples of how workers will not receive any compensation for work-related injuries under the so-called improving the Comcare scheme bill because of the related unfair and draconian eligibility rules. This bill also reduces incapacity payments and expands sanctions against workers including removal of medical support if a worker fails to attend a medical appointment. All of this is totally opposed by Labor. It is typical of this government when they are under pressure to attack the workplace conditions of working Australians. I know there are issues with the resourcing of the Comcare scheme and the workloads of workplace inspectors and Comcare staff, but undermining the rights of workers to fair compensation is not the answer. With these bills currently before the Senate and with the ACT government still designing their new scheme, it is unclear whether ACT employees would be better off under the Comcare scheme or its replacement scheme. This point was made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions in its submission to the inquiry. The ACTU also noted in its submission that it is unclear how the government proposes to manage the rehabilitation and compensation claims of those workers who are currently covered by the Comcare scheme or whose claims are still being processed. 


Another concern raised through the inquiry by both the Victorian government and the Electrical Trades Union was that the bill may result in a reduced premium pool in state workers compensation schemes. Labor senators noted in their additional comments in the inquiry report that they were unconvinced by the Department of Employment's submission that the reduction in the premium pool would not result from the passage of the bill.


The principle of giving workers fair compensation and the best opportunity for rehabilitation is of particular importance to me. I have spoken before in this place about the difficulties experienced by workers under the current scheme. For more than five years I have been working hard to represent a constituent who has been fighting to get decent rehabilitation services and fair compensation from an injury suffered as a Commonwealth employee 27 years ago. I know from an independent report given to Comcare that there are another 13 injured workers who have experienced expressed longstanding problems with aspects of their claims and Comcare's services.


While it is vital that we do everything we can to avoid injuries at work, we know that unfortunately injuries will inevitably occur. When they do occur, workers need to have the assurance that they will receive not only fair compensation but the best rehabilitation support they can to restore them to their fullest possible health, both physically and psychologically. Given the difficulties that workers are experiencing with the Comcare scheme as it currently operates, it is absolutely vital that any changes to the scheme do not disadvantage workers and are carefully and thoroughly considered as a whole.


The most unfortunate thing about the government's hasty and piecemeal approach to these legislative changes is that Labor may be able to support the exit arrangements bill—the bill we are currently debating—but we cannot under the current circumstances. There is no need to try and rush this bill through with such haste when the ACT government does not even yet have a scheme designed to replace the Comcare scheme and will not have one for some time. There is no need to rush this bill through when we have a number of other substantial changes to the Comcare scheme also before the parliament. The opposition has not received any information from the ACT government about the consequences for workers of their exit from the Comcare scheme. Labor needs to have assurances that ACT workers will not be left worse off under this bill. We need to be sure there is nothing questionable about this bill before parliament today, and the only way to do this is to take the necessary time for further consultation with all stakeholders.


It is not all right for workers to be not properly compensated if injured while working, and it is not all right to cut standards that protect workers. Labor strongly believe no worker should be worse off under this bill, and that is what we will continue to push for. Workers must be afforded fair and reasonable compensation should they suffer the misfortune of a work related injury or illness—because that is only fair.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:46):  I am pleased to speak to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. This bill is a technical one dealing with how Comcare is funded when premium payers under the scheme exit. The ACT government announced in February this year that it is consulting its workforce on plans to leave the Comcare scheme. The ACT government has been a premium payer and the exit of a body of this size would have a detrimental impact on Comcare's capacity to continue providing cover for workers under the scheme. It is vital we continue to ensure Comcare has the resources to deal with the claims of employees under the scheme and is not held hostage by the whims of various premium-paying bodies.


The bill proposes to make amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to provide for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority to exit the Comcare scheme. The framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect 'exit contributions' from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. This will ensure that an employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. It will also ensure that employees injured before an employer leaves the scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority, which is very important. It will enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or successor bodies. It will clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities, such as a government department, should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as is available under section 90C of the act. It will allow Comcare to agree to instalments of an exit contribution being paid over a period of up to seven years after the day on which the determination is made to allow for run-off liability estimates. It will provide for Comcare to refund all or part of an exit contribution if an assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds attributable to an exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities; determinations of a refund may only be made within the seven-year period immediately after an employer exits the scheme. It will provide for Comcare to remit the whole or part of an unpaid instalment of an exit contribution if a later assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds that is attributable to the exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities.


This is a very straightforward bill that simply ensures the ongoing viability of Comcare whenever any large premium payer or licensee decides to leave the Comcare scheme. It is important to have such arrangements in place, especially given that the ACT Labor government have indicated that they are looking at a potential departure from the scheme, claiming it is burdensome for claimants and for their employers. Employees injured before a Commonwealth authority leaves the Comcare scheme will continue to receive compensation and rehabilitation under the SRC Act. The bill will ensure stability for workers, employers and the Comcare scheme when a Commonwealth authority exits the scheme.


The bill also amends the act to clarify that premiums for current premium payers should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and future liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as would be available under section 90C of the act. These amendments protect injured employees who remain in the Comcare scheme and ensure the future financial viability of Comcare.


Since 2013-14, Comcare has been progressively restoring the funding position of the scheme. The bill will support existing measures put in place by Comcare to restore funds to adequate levels to meet estimated liabilities. The bill will also ensure that Commonwealth authorities do not exit the Comcare scheme without paying an appropriate amount to cover any unfunded liabilities arising from claims that will continue to be managed by Comcare into the future. This will protect premium payers who remain in the scheme from having to cover these liabilities with larger premiums.


The Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 passed the House of Representative on 26 November 2014 and is currently before the Senate. That bill is focused on expanding the coverage of the Comcare scheme for national employers as self-insurers. The bill excludes coverage for recess breaks where a person is injured during an ordinary recess break away from their employer's premises unless the injury arises from employment. The bill also excludes an injury arising from serious and wilful misconduct where it results in death or serious and permanent impairment.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015 is not in any way related to these reforms. That said, given Labor's inability to do any of the hard work of meaningful reform in this space, I do want to briefly touch on the other bills that are currently being considered. The Comcare scheme generally operates effectively. It achieves relatively high safety and return-to-work outcomes, and it is almost the only scheme in Australia to provide income replacement to retirement age and medical support for life. The legislation underpinning the scheme has not changed much since it was introduced 27 years ago. 


Workplaces and working conditions, healthcare and rehabilitation practices, technology and social behaviour and expectations have all changed in that time. Various court decisions have also affected the way the act is applied in practice. To keep pace with the modernisation of work and health practices, the scheme needs to be updated. There are also signs that the scheme is coming under pressure. For example, whilst Comcare's return-to-work rates are better than average, they are falling; some medical treatments are failing to make people better, in the long term; and employers face rising premiums and other costs. 


The proposed amendments aim to do the following things: improve return-to-work outcomes for injured workers; put the focus on early intervention and health outcomes of injured workers and improve the operation of the system by excluding injuries sustained in non-work activities outside work; exclude secondary psychological injuries; and remove payment for non-traditional treatments. That package of reform, which will be considered by this place in due course, is important in providing a strong and sustainable scheme into the future to ensure that Australia's only remaining long-tail workers' compensation scheme is able to continue. Further, in an unprecedented submission to the Senate committee, that package of reform has been supported by departmental secretaries and agency heads, it has been supported by licensees and it has broad support in the community.


The Education and Employment Legislation Committee examined this and the associated Comcare legislation in the first months of 2015. Submissions from stakeholders, which were picked up by the opposition in its additional comments, also related to a different bill—falsities that have been repeated by the opposition that this bill will impact on state and territory workers' compensation schemes. This bill has no impact on states and territories as it only applies to Commonwealth authorities if they exit the Comcare scheme, and it has no impact on premium payers under the state schemes.


Concerns have been raised, however, about the impact of another bill currently before the parliament—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014—on the viability of state and territory work health and safety and workers' compensation schemes due to the potential exodus of employers, particularly large employers, from those schemes. The concern is that if large employers with better safety records move to the Comcare scheme, premium rates will increase for employers remaining in the state and territory schemes.


The 2004 Productivity Commission Inquiry into National Workers' Compensation and Occupational Health and Safety Frameworks specifically noted that the concern that exiting premium payers from state schemes would lead to volatility in premium rates was not supported by the evidence. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry and for the 2008 review of self-insurance arrangements under the Comcare scheme—the Comcare review—indicated that the impact of the exit of corporations from state based schemes on those schemes or remaining employers would be minimal.


Taylor Fry—in their actuarial report to inform the 2008 Comcare review—concluded that the financial impacts of exits to the Comcare scheme from the other Australian jurisdictions had been insignificant. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission concluded: 'The larger the employer, the closer the premium is to the true cost of claims and expenses, such that the exit of such large employers would be relatively neutral to the state and territory schemes.' The percentage of exiting employers from state schemes would represent less than 10 per cent of scheme revenues and probably less than five per cent of scheme revenues.


In the government's assessment, the circumstances have not changed since 2004 and the impact will remain minimal. I call on those opposite to focus on the bill at hand and do the right thing and provide certainty for workers under the Comcare scheme. The bill will ensure that Commonwealth authorities exiting the Comcare scheme cover the costs of their liabilities. This will protect premium payers remaining in the scheme and ensure that injured workers are supported.


Any senator voting against this bill is voting against ensuring that injured workers have a safety net should their employer leave the scheme. I therefore commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:57):  I rise to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. At this time of the day—after the big, long night of the budget—I suppose people are starting to feel a little weary, and it is hard to keep your attention on these things. It is really important to pay attention, because something really important could happen if this legislation were allowed to go through in the way this government is proposing.


The purpose of this bill has been discussed in very different ways in the contributions from both sides of the chamber this evening. The explanatory memorandum of this bill states: 


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the Act) establishes a scheme (the Comcare scheme) to provide compensation and rehabilitation support to injured Australian Government and Australian Capital Territory employees, as well as employees of private corporations that hold a licence under the Act.


It sounds like a mouthful, and by the time you get to the end of a few sentences like that it is very easy to have your eyes start to glaze over. But we have to remember that at the heart of this piece of legislation is either a positive or a negative outcome for people who find themselves injured while at work. That could be any one of us or any of the people we love or care for or any of the people we work with. This is not an abstract concept, this is not an abstract set of words and it is not a meaningless set of words, even though it does sound like that in the way that it is written for the purposes of legislation. This is about people and real outcomes for people.


In fact, this piece of legislation is more complicated in the way that it has come before this parliament than many others, because this is part of a suite of three bills that are dealing with Comcare. That is why we need to be really careful about what we are doing with it. Senator Lines, Senator Cameron and Senator Bilyk have made very strong claims, articulating our concerns about the haste with which this is being attempted to be pushed through the parliament by the government, and I think with good cause. One of the things that my kids say these days, using a very descriptive word, is that things may be 'dodgy'. I have every feeling that there is something dodgy going on here—the sense of speeding to get this piece of legislation through.


The fact is that, only as recently as 25 February this year, the ACT government announced that it was going to leave Comcare. When that announcement happened, pretty much at the same time the Territory government also announced that it was going to conduct a six-week consultation period before deciding on the design of the new scheme—whatever it might look like. That consultation period has been open to some discussion. There are concerns about how private those conversations have been and there are concerns about why such an important discussion about a scheme that could affect so many people here in the ACT has not been held in a much more public way. Given that the consultation period ended on 8 May, just last Friday, it is really quite remarkable that we are in the week of the budget and this piece of legislation has been rushed into this place.


Pardon me: I do not usually like cynics or cynicism, but I have to say that the alarm bells are ringing at this point in time. What on earth is going on here? A secret, quiet process over six weeks, an attempt to push this through and no chance for us to have the great scrutiny of this bill that the Senate committees can undertake. Labor's first priority with regard to this bill is to ensure that we get the bill right. To do that we need to make sure that any design of any new scheme is going to provide at least the same protection. In my view, if you have an opportunity to review, you should look to ways that would enhance the protection. We can enhance the financial outcome too—they are not necessarily mutually exclusive goals—but we should be determining that this scheme will advance the cause of the people who are going to be sadly caught up in it.


The ACT government, from what I can gather, have made a commitment to work with the stakeholders. There should be sufficient time allowed to unearth any outstanding matters and have public scrutiny of the process, public consideration of what is proposed, and certainly those who have been affected may have some particularly valuable insights that they could bring to the process. In a way, one of the reasons why I am so concerned about this process is that I watched the failure of the government to consult in a public way prior to the last budget—the very first budget that they delivered—particularly with regard to the area of health. Compensation for injured workers is not exactly a health matter, but it is certainly intimately connected with the health sector. We had a government that decided it was a good idea, without consultation, without talking to the RACGP, without talking to the AMA and without talking to any of the state departments of health—they just arbitrarily decided, this week last year—that they were going to bring in a $7 GP co-payment, a GP tax.


Failure of consultation leads to really stupid policies like that, and the government have had to remove themselves from that position to a point. They still have lots and lots of issues with their health policy. They have had to change their minister and they have got to a point now where the minister says she is consulting, but all that is happening in private and it has taken a committee of the Senate to watch what is going on in the health sector publicly and put it on the record. Acting Deputy President Peris, you are well aware of the work of the committee that is doing that and why it is important to have public scrutiny and use the resources of this parliament to put on the record the evidence that experts have to offer, not just people who can get inside a little private room and make some decisions that ultimately might advantage them over others who have less power and less opportunity to have their voice heard.


It is in that context that I really want to emphasise that Labor's first priority is to ensure, with this bill in particular, that there will be no worker worse off. We also want to make sure that there is no structuring of this to provide an incentive to make workers worse off. We wanted it to go to a Senate committee for thorough investigation, but with unseemly haste the government has rushed it here into the chamber. There is something wrong with that attitude. Our story is the Australian Labor story. It is about protecting and promoting the interests of working men and women. The future of Australia, from the values that we hold, is about getting a great job—giving people the opportunity and the support they need to get a job that they can be fulfilled in, where they can go to work each day and come home safely and well. We know that it does not always turn out that way and that people will need, from time to time, assistance if they find themselves injured or so unwell that they require rehabilitation.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill is one of the suite of bills that I referred to in my opening remarks. It is another reason that explains why I am concerned about what is happening here tonight. That bill was introduced into the parliament in March last year. What we saw in that bill was absolutely outrageous—directly and indirectly risking the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. One of the things that was threatened in that was the right of Australian workers to have reasonable cover when they suffered the misfortune of a work related illness or injury. Labor completely opposed that bill. We continue to oppose that bill. There is great concern on this side of the chamber that, in that bill, the government has included provisions to hollow out state workers compensation schemes. Part of the process that the community should be aware of is that one of the plans, revealed in the process of looking at that legislation, intended to open up the Comcare scheme to private sector companies.


I am trying, with this abstract piece of legislation, to continue to remember, and to speak about, the people who will be affected if this legislation is wrong and if this legislation is hastily pushed through. We need to keep remembering that people are at the heart of what we do here in this place, and that the impact of this legislation on people is real. I am trying to use language that reminds us of that because we have heard from the other side technical language distancing people from the conversations of this place. Legislation has to be rich and in a particular form of words. But when those on the other side stand up and their language choices do not mention people, do not mention health consequences and do not mention safety in the workplace, and when they do not look like they are there to protect workers but to exploit them, and when their language choices are filled with words like contributions, funds, instalments, liabilities, assessments and remittances, when they are punctuated and littered with those sorts of words and there is no consideration of what those words might collectively mean in terms of impacting somebody's life, then there are more alarm bells ringing in my head. We are concerned that there are going to be large companies that will flee state schemes and that would compromise the capacity of those schemes to properly look after workers. We do not believe it would be in the interests of workers to have that happen. We do not think this legislation should proceed with such haste.


In addition to the bill that is before the house tonight, and the one that I have just mentioned, there is yet another Comcare bill—the third one in the sequence—that has just recently been introduced by the government. This is also one that should have us raising our concern and casting a close eye over what is being proposed by the government. That third bill makes cuts to lump sum compensation payable for permanent impairment for the vast majority of injured workers. Let me just say that again: it cuts lump sum compensation payments to permanently impaired people. It also attempts to remove the already modest pain and suffering payment that people so far can access. In her commentary in this place this evening, Senator Lines spoke eloquently about the reality of a period of work in which she was interacting with people who had found themselves on the wrong side of a workplace incident. These people suffered in the first instance a physical impairment that disconnected them from the experience of work, marginalised them from their community of work and impacted their health and wellbeing and family lives, and then the stress of dealing with the system that was so discriminatory towards them and so aggressive towards them meant that there was an amplification of their injury from a physical one into a mental health injury. We need to be careful about not allowing the construction of a system that will create that reality for people.


This third piece of Comcare legislation that the government is advancing does other things. It changes the eligibility requirements. That means that injured workers are locked out of the scheme altogether. It also attempts to reduce incapacity payments. It expands sanctions against workers, including the removal of medical support if a worker fails to attend a medical appointment. Where have I heard that before? These are some of the most excessive and punitive measures that we have seen this government try to implement since they came into the parliament with regard to people who find themselves unemployed.


We have seen this government almost selectively targeting those who are the most vulnerable, seeking them out, almost, when they are at their lowest point and then really kicking them while they are down. That is why this legislation is so important and deserves the proper scrutiny of a committee. There should be time given to this second part in the bill under the chamber's consideration this evening. We oppose all of the elements of that Comcare bill. We are very concerned about this Comcare bill. We oppose the elements of the first Comcare bill. There is a theme here. These guys are up to something no good. We are onto it. As the Labor Party, we will stand here and make sure that the proper scrutiny is applied, no matter how uncomfortable it is for those opposite.


What we have here is the Abbott government asking the parliament to make a determination on a matter which it has very recently introduced. It is a very substantial bill. It does, potentially, contain crucial information about future changes. Given the introduction of a third substantive Comcare bill, Labor really cannot believe that there was proper opportunity to fully investigate the current bill. These bills do not sit as separate entities. Once one gets through, there will be interactions with the other. Those interactions, those sophisticated and complex interactions, need to be given consideration as well.


I said earlier that the ACT government has not made a determination on the make-up of any new scheme. They only announced it in February. They have only just finished their consultation process. So, supporting the legislation that is before us is a foolish thing to do. It is foolish and it is dangerous, because the whole detailed process that should be part of any change is simply being overlooked. Obviously it is not reasonable or fair to suggest that people exit a particular type of arrangement that covers workers if they are injured at work and without being able with any certainty to outline what entitlements they may have in any subsequent scheme. It is simply not reasonable to ask us to support such a proposition. So inevitably we have considerable reservations about this bill.


That is not to say that we seek to usurp the rights of the ACT to make determinations about this. The ACT clearly should be making decisions for its own workforce in relation to workers compensation, including rehabilitation. But it is only reasonable that they make clear their intentions, in a detailed way, before this bill passes. And certainly a Senate inquiry would provide a space in which such reportage could happen and due consideration could be given.


I am advised that there has been considerable conversation with the ACT government. I am led to believe that the concerns that I am raising here in the chamber and that have been raised by my other colleagues who have participated in this debate have been raised with the ACT. We need them to outline their intentions. We need to explain any material changes that might be made to entitlements of those workers if they are injured. We need, in fact, a simple degree of fair scrutiny to be provided. I do not believe we have had sufficient time for that to happen at this stage, and it is certainly unduly hasty to be pushing for a resolution of this matter so promptly. The ACT government really does need to provide that information to this government and to the opposition as well so that we can ensure that there actually are no adverse consequences of this bill before the government exits the scheme.


One of the things I thought it would be worth putting on the record for people who may be listening and are interested in the process of scrutiny of these bills is that one of the very impressive things I found when I was a new senator was the introduction of a consideration of the human rights implications. Each bill has to be considered in terms of that human rights lens. Articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and articles 26 and 27 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. It reminds us, as I said at the beginning of my remarks this evening, that this is a complex piece of legislation. At its heart are outcomes for real people, and I urge a due degree— (Time expired)

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (19:17):  It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. Unfortunately, I do not think I will get to complete my contribution, but I am really looking forward to the full 20—full bottle—on this particular piece of legislation when we next have it before us. I am chair of the committee that Senator Lines is deputy chair of. I sat  in my office and listened to the tirade from Senator Lines, and I am looking forward to correcting so many of the false assumptions that she put on the Hansard, as if they were somehow fact—as if somehow because she says them they must be true. She complains that the committee did not undergo a full and transparent assessment of the submissions. The inquiry was conducted under the usual practice of the Senate. Public submissions were sought, and we got not hundreds, not thousands but four submissions—from, as we like to say in the game, 'usual suspects'. We had the ACTU, the ETU, my own state government of Victoria, and the Department of Education—so, four submissions. With the workload that the current Senate committee is under—and it is not just my own committee; this is the case right across the Senate at the moment, thanks to the Greens' inquiries and thanks to the numerous reference committee inquiries from those opposite and indeed from the scrutiny of bills process, which is referring so much of the government's legislative agenda, which it has a mandate to deliver, off to committee in a tactic to delay us delivering on election promise after election promise for the Australian people—in that deliberate tactic by those opposite to use those Senate committees, there is an enormous burden. If those opposite want to consider the workers of Australia, then they need to actually consider the committee secretariats and the workload that they are currently under. So, when we get four submissions saying what we all knew they would say—

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:44):  I am very pleased to continue my remarks on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. I remind those who are present and those listening that this bill proposes to amend the act to provide for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority which might care to exit the Comcare scheme. This has been prompted by the fact that the ACT government indicated in February that it might so move. It consulted and it has concluded its consultations. Therefore, why is it necessary that we do it and why now? I would like to reflect on that for a few moments if I can.


Firstly, the framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect exit contributions from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. What does this ensure? That the employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount of money to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. I go back to the comments made by senators Rice and Cameron, in which they were expressing, quite rightly, concern for the interests of employees. That brings me to the point that the framework will ensure that employees injured before an employer leaves the scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority. That is the primary objective. It goes on to enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or the bodies that succeed them. These are entirely appropriate and reasonable factors. Why do we need to be dealing with it now? Because, indeed, the ACT government has flagged the likelihood that it may want to exit the scheme. What we will then do through this legislative amendment is to clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities, such as a government department, should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as is available under section 90C of the act. That is what the wider community and particularly those likely to be affected would be expecting us to do. 


The framework will allow Comcare to agree to instalments of an exit contribution being paid over a period up to seven years from the day on which the determination is made to allow for run-off liability estimates. Furthermore, in terms of fairness, the framework will provide for Comcare to refund all or part of an exit contribution if the assessment reveals that the amount of the available scheme funds attributed to the exited employer exceed Comcare's liabilities. If indeed there has been an over-estimate, they get the money back. Determinations of a refund will only be made within that seven-year period after the employer exits the scheme. It also, on the other side, provides for Comcare to remit the whole or part of an unpaid instalment of an exit contribution if a later assessment reveals that the amount of the available scheme funds that is attributable to the exited employer exceeds what Comcare's liabilities are.


Why are these amendments so important now? Because we have the ACT government contemplating the likelihood of exiting. Indeed, we are fortunate to have the recent Chief Minister of the ACT now in the chamber, and I am sure she could further advise colleagues as to what the thinking of the ACT government was, certainly up until the time she ceased being Chief Minister. The amendments are important for two major  reasons: firstly, to protect injured employees who remain in the Comcare scheme and, secondly, to make sure the future viability of the Comcare scheme is protected. 


Since 2013-14, Comcare has been progressively restoring the funding position of the scheme. I know people would be very pleased to learn that. This bill will support existing measures now put into place by Comcare to restore funds to adequate levels to meet estimated liabilities. Surely there can be nobody in this chamber and nobody listening to this discussion who would have any argument with that sound philosophy. The bill will also ensure that Commonwealth authorities do not exit the Comcare scheme without paying an appropriate amount to cover any unfunded liabilities arising from claims that will continue to be managed by Comcare into the future. This protects premium payers who remain in the scheme, and this is what we want to see happen.


If I can recap, this bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to provide for financial and other arrangements when a Commonwealth authority exits the Comcare scheme. The frameworks established by these amendments I have outlined. It is important to have such arrangements in place in the context of the ACT, because the ACT Labor government has indicated that it is looking at a potential departure from the Comcare scheme, citing it as being 'quite burdensome, not only for claimants but for their employers as well'. It is essential that this amendment is passed so that any liabilities the ACT government may have in consideration of existing or prospective employees will indeed be adequately funded so that those people are protected. Employees injured before a Commonwealth authority leaves the Comcare scheme will continue—I repeat, will continue—to receive compensation and rehabilitation under the SRC Act. The bill will ensure stability for workers, employers and the Comcare scheme when a Commonwealth authority exits the scheme. I cannot be more clear than that. The bill goes on to amend the act to clarify that premiums for current premium payers should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and future liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as would be available under the relevant section of the act, section 90C. So I come back to that commentary again about protecting injured employees who remain in the scheme, as well as ensuring the future viability of the scheme itself.


Let me make the point strongly that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015, the one we are debating at the moment, is not in any way related to other reforms that passed the House of Representatives on 26 November last year and are currently before the Senate. Let me make it clear, again, that the matter we are considering at this moment is not in any way related to these reforms. I am not going to go back and rehash the commentary of Senator Cameron in this particular space, except to emphasise again: they are unrelated. But it is unfortunate that the opposition, in opposing any meaningful reform in this space, is not encouraging, allowing or agreeing to reasonable dialogue and discussion in this area.


The Comcare scheme generally operates effectively. There are four areas that I want to focus on. Firstly, achieving high safety—and surely, that would be commendable. Secondly, return-to-work outcomes—and all of us, whether we are on the employer side or the employee side, know very well that speed of return to work is surely the highest priority, when it is safe to do so. The third area is the provision of income replacement through to retirement age, and the statement is made, 'it is almost the only scheme left in Australia which actually provides income replacement right through to retirement age'. The fourth area—and equally importantly for all people who are covered under these protections—is medical support for life.


It falls to people like ourselves, law-makers in this place, to make sure that each of those four high ideals remains permanent, remains current, and remains affordable. But there are signs that the scheme is coming under pressure. For example, while Comcare's return-to-work rates are better than average, they are falling. They are not where we want them to be. If this is to be the benchmark, we want the benchmark to be set higher. And the current experience is that return-to-work rates are falling; they are still better than average, but they are falling. Secondly, some medical treatments are not making people better in the long term. And thirdly, employers are facing rising premiums and other costs. So what do we need to do about this? The amendments that are proposed and are sitting here in the Senate are aimed, in fact, to address those issues. They are aimed to improve the return-to-work outcomes for injured employees and injured workers. They are aimed to put focus on early intervention and health outcomes for injured workers. And they are, thirdly, aimed at improving the operation of the system by excluding injuries sustained in non-work activities outside the workplace; excluding, of course, secondary psychological injuries, and removing payment for non-traditional treatments.


Let me make the point very strongly: reference has been made of course to the fact that if somebody is outside their workplace, during their lunch hour or whatever, they cease to have any coverage; if they go across the road, or if they go into a cafe or whatever—but such of course is not the case. We in Australia know very well the circumstance in which, if somebody is injured, for example in a road-related accident, they are adequately insured under third-party provisions. Indeed, if somebody was in an eating establishment and injured themselves, we know the law requires that the operator of that facility must have adequate insurance to protect customers. So there is a circumstance in which there is still adequate cover under the provisions for which we seek.


The package of reforms which will be considered here in the Senate in due course is important in providing a strong and sustainable scheme into the future to ensure that Australia's only remaining long-tail workers compensation scheme exists, is adequately funded, and ensures that the employees of any organisation who leave Comcare in fact have still got adequate financial funding. I want to stress if I may the fact that this package of reforms has been supported by departmental secretaries and heads of agencies. It has been supported by licensees and has broad support in the community.


Concerns have been expressed in this place and elsewhere—and I am sure they will be raised again—about the question of the viability of state and territory work, health and safety workers compensation schemes in relation to the potential exodus of employers, particularly large employers, from the schemes. The information that is available suggests that this is, at most, a minor issue, if indeed it is an issue at all. The 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry suggested that the volatility in premium rates that might occur in the event of such exits are not supported by evidence. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission and a 2008 review of self-insurance arrangements under Comcare both indicated that the impact of exits of corporations from state-based schemes on those schemes or on remaining employers would be minimal; and Taylor Fry, in their actuarial report to inform the 2008 Comcare review, concluded that the financial impacts of the exits to the Comcare scheme from other Australian jurisdictions had been insignificant.


To conclude: will the bill adversely affect any employee entitlements to compensation? The answer is no. An employee who is injured before an employer exits the scheme will continue to be compensated under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The bill will ensure that employees injured before an employer's exit continue to be supported by appropriate rehabilitation authority, protecting the rehabilitation rights of employees. Let me finish, if I may, with these two brief observations. The bill will ensure that Commonwealth authorities exiting the Comcare scheme cover the costs of their liabilities. This will protect premium payers remaining in the scheme and ensure that injured workers continue to be supported. And I make this final observation. Anybody in this place voting against this bill is, indeed, voting against ensuring that injured workers have a safety net should their employer leave the scheme.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (18:00):  I rise to oppose the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015 that is before us, and I can assure Senator Back that I absolutely, 100 per cent support workers getting their full entitlement to a workers compensation scheme. To suggest that if you vote against the bill somehow you are voting against the safety and the wellbeing of workers if they are injured is absolute rubbish.


This is one of three bills around workers compensation which will disadvantage workers. This is bill No. 2, and the Abbott government really does need to lay out its plan. There is bill No. 1, although it has not come into the Senate, there is bill No. 2, which is before us today, and, of course, there is a third bill, and to suggest that somehow these bills are unrelated is not true. There are relationships between all of them, and it is clearly about disadvantaging workers. If they are not related then why have they been brought in together and why are they all about Comcare? Of course they are related, and this bill is being put before the Senate because the government thinks that perhaps it will get support for this bill and it will start the softening up process to get the other two bills in place.


Indeed, we were able to have an inquiry for the first bill, and what stakeholders told us in that process was that, yes, they had had meetings with the department, but they were bound by rules of confidentiality. So they were not allowed to speak outside of the meetings about the content of those meetings and when they sought additional information about bills coming forward they were not told anything either. What sort of consultation process is it when we bind people and when we make them sign documents so that they will not utter a word about what happened in the meeting and when they sought information about future bills they were told that was not part of the discussion? That is not an open and transparent process, and of course those stakeholders had every right to be suspicious and to be very concerned about what was going to come next because of these confidentiality provisions. In the inquiry we had on that first bill we asked the department if we could have further information, but we were told, no, we could not either. I think we ended up getting the list of who attended those secret meetings, but we were not able to get much further than that.


Labor opposes this bill. Fundamentally, this bill will allow employers and insurers to scheme swap at will between state and national schemes. The arrangement laid out in this bill may potentially lead to the economic collapse of state schemes, and Labor believes it is likely to drive up premiums for small- to medium-sized employers. Again, with this bill, the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee was denied a public hearing by a majority of government senators on the committee, and it is absolutely shameful that this open and transparent process was denied to us. It is the second time that I have reported in this place that, on government controlled inquiries, senators have been denied an open and public transparent process. It is one thing to have submissions in front of you; it is quite another to have witnesses in front of you where they make particular statements that are worth exploring or they give you further information than was in their written submission.


But, no, the Abbott government and its senators in this place absolutely denied an open, public, transparent hearing into this bill. So it is left to Labor to defend and raise our concerns in this place about the bill because we were denied that opportunity through the Senate processes. More and more we are seeing that, when the government do not want to be held accountable, when they do not want to listen to independent evidence and experts, they simply use their numbers and deny the Labor senators that opportunity for an open and public hearing. It does lead me to say: what are they hiding? What is it about this bill, in particular, that they do not want transparency to be on the record?


Despite what we heard from government senators, there is no need to rush this bill. There is simply no need to rush this bill, because, despite the Australian Capital Territory signalling it wishes to exit the bill, it is a long way from doing that. The Australian Capital Territory government is in the process of consulting about the makeup of any new scheme. It does not yet have a designated scheme and it will not for some time. So why the rush? As we know, there is a bill that has not been voted on in this place that looks to cut workers' entitlements, and what I think the government are trying to do is to soften up the crossbench senators and get this bill through and then say to them: 'It's all a part of a tranche. There are three bills here. You voted for the first bill. The sky hasn't fallen down. Let's bring the other bills in.' I am sure that is their plan.


It is time that the Abbott government laid out their plan and stopped trying to pretend there is no link between any of these bills, because there is a link. The Australian Capital Territory government is out there running an open and transparent process—unlike the opportunities to have an open and transparent public hearing in this place, which we were denied by government senators. So why the rush? Rather than try and push a bill through the Senate, why aren't the Abbott government talking to the Australian Capital Territory government? Why aren't they talking to them? Maybe they are. But, again, we do not know, because we did not have that public hearing. But what we do know from the Abbott government's track record is that they do not like to consult. They do not like open consultations. They do not like independent advice. They do not really like anything contrary to their own positions. So the Abbott government thinks the only way forward is to rush this bill through.


Labor wants to be absolutely certain that no worker will be worse off as a result of this bill. I speak from experience. I worked for quite some time as the workers compensation officer at the WA branch of United Voice. In that role, one of the hardest roles I have ever done in my career, I met workers with debilitating injuries—low-paid workers, cleaners, orderlies, nurses, early childhood educators, and manufacturing workers, many with debilitating injuries. I met workers who desperately wanted to get back to work. They wanted to look after their families and do all the things they did before they suffered a workplace injury. I worked with good employers who respected workers and did everything in their power to get workers back to work and to start the rehabilitation process. Unfortunately, and in the majority of cases, I also met employers and insurers whose agenda was to reduce their costs and to take no responsibility for injured workers. Sadly, I saw too many workers caught up in a situation not of their making and completely outside of their control. I saw deliberate actions taken by insurers and employers to drag out claims, to deny benefits, to put workers in a situation where they had no money coming in, to blame workers for their workplace injury and to suggest it was because a worker smoked or was not fit enough or was old. They would use any excuse rather than take responsibility for the fact that their workplace had injured that worker.


I saw workers treated disgracefully at the hands of employers and insurers: workers who throughout their working life had given extra and who did not knock off right at the end of the shift; workers who always were willing to take on additional roles, who gave loyal service and who expected in their time of need their employer to act in the same way when they needed support. I have seen workers totally broken who started out with a physical injury and ended up with mental disabilities, not because of their injuries but because of the way they were treated once they entered the workers compensation scheme. There were far too many who were broken individuals as a result of a workplace injury not of their own making. As a Labor senator in this place I stand for fairness and justice for these workers.


I want to touch on an other point raised by Senator Back that came out at the hearing we had on the first bill, and I must say that I could not believe what I was hearing. I did not want to believe the words on the page, where the first bill sought to take away the right to workers compensation during an unpaid work break, such as a lunch break. Let us just imagine the early childhood educator who started her shift at seven o'clock and works in the city and maybe travels an hour to get to work. She would have left home at six o'clock, so maybe she got up at five o'clock to start her day. At lunch time she will want to have a break. I do not know whether you have been into a child care centre but, unlike perhaps in a big manufacturing workplace, or in a hospital or in an aged care facility, the staff rooms are very small. They often serve as meeting rooms for other workers or as places where workers do programming. So they are not always a place to relax, to get away from the children and to have a desperately needed break. Working with children is rewarding work, but it is also hard work. From my experience as an organiser in the early childhood sector, I can tell you that many workers like to get out and have a break—they like to leave the centre at lunch time. If that worker leaves the centre and walks over to the shopping centre and then trips and hurts herself, under the bill before the Senate she will be out on her own.


I can also tell you that many of those workers work a day shift. As you would know, getting to the bank or the post office is often something workers do in their unpaid break, because it is the only time they can do those things. I heard Senator Back say, 'Oh, well they will be covered by public liability or they will be covered by motor vehicle insurance.' Can you imagine the scenario? There I am leaving the child care centre and I walk down the pavement and I trip. As a low-paid educator earning about $21 or $22 an hour, am I going to engage a lawyer to sue the council? How likely is that? It is incredibly unlikely, and it is impossible. I would not know where an early childhood educator would get the funds to stump up money for a lawyer to sue the council, and to win. We know those claims are arduous and are hard to prove. What if I am injured walking across the road. Do I then make a claim on motor vehicles? Or if I finally get into the shopping centre and I trip over will I then go after the shopping centre's public liability? What a ridiculous statement to make that somehow someone else is responsible for that worker.


The other thing I can inform the Senate is that the break in child care centres is an hour long, not because the worker needs it, but because the employers like to stretch the day out so that they do not have to bring additional staff in. They have that worker there from seven until four o'clock and they give them an hour off because they want to lengthen the shift to reduce their rosters so that they do not have to bring other workers in. Here we are saying that that worker who leaves the childcare service at lunchtime to have a break or to pay a bill or to get to the post office is somehow on her own. What a ridiculous statement to make! It shows how absolutely out-of-touch this Abbott government is that they do not know what workers do during their lunch hour.


During the Senate inquiry we heard—Senator Abetz and the Abbott government are very good at making things up—about the worker who goes surfing and incurs an injury. I do not know how many workers Senator Abetz has met, but over my lifetime as a union official I have met thousands, and I have never yet met one who went surfing during their lunch break. I have met plenty who went shopping, who bought the dinner, who went to the post office, who paid the bills, who rang their kids to check on how they were doing and did all the things that all of us do as part of our daily life. But that is what you will hear from those opposite: 'What about the person who goes surfing?' What about the early childhood educator who simply goes to pay a bill and then gets denied workers compensation because she has had an accident outside of the workplace? That is ridiculous, and it is not something that Labor senators will support in this place.


I want to be absolutely sure—whether it is this bill, bill No. 1; or whether it is this bill before us, No. 2; or whether it is the incorrectly-titled bill No. 3, 'Improving the Comcare scheme'—that no worker will be worse off. But those assurances are not there—they are clearly not there with these bills. And nothing I have read and nothing I have heard and nothing in my own experience as a workers compensation officer and as an organiser gives me confidence that the bills deliver confidence and real surety and protection for workers. What I see in this bill continues the Abbott government's anti-worker and anti-union agenda. I counted the bills the other day because I got invited to speak at the national day of mourning for workers killed on the job in Perth, and the Abbott government has brought something like 15 anti-worker or anti-union bills before this place. Remember when we heard that Work Choices was dead, buried and cremated? Well, it is not. The Abbott government is trying to attack workers and their unions by stealth through 15 bills—most of them rejected in this place. That is Work Choices—when you start to take away workers rights and when you start to reduce their access to unions. I have spoken before about the appalling death rate in the construction industry which goes completely unnoticed by the Abbott government.


We should have a bill to immediately look at and stop workplace deaths, not these sorts of bills which rip entitlements away from workers. It is a disgrace that we do not respect those who toil, that we do not respect lives, that we think it is somehow okay for someone to lose their life when earning their livelihood. Labor senators do not stand for that, and that is why we oppose these bills. The Abbott government has not undertaken proper consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders about this. No doubt they will tell us: 'We had secret confidential meetings that no-one is allowed to tell you about.' But they denied us a proper hearing where we could get evidence out in the open on this particular bill.


It is really important that there is a thorough investigation of the legislation, because the Abbott government has already sought to make adverse changes to the Comcare scheme. These proposed changes will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. What we heard in the first hearing—and that is the only hearing I can refer to, because we have not had a hearing on this bill—was that somehow we needed to make these changes to the Comcare scheme because of red tape. I tell you what: if the choice for me and other Labor senators is between red tape and workers' lives, or between red tape and workers remaining fit and well in the workplace, then I will pick red tape any day. I know there is not a Labor senator here who would say: 'Let's reduce red tape and create a risk that injures or, in extreme examples, where a worker dies.' No. There is a view from the Abbott government that all red tape is somehow bad; but it is not, because workers in this country need red tape to protect them. They absolutely need that. We will not be supporting words that say 'improving' and 'simplifying', because we know that that reduces workers entitlements and puts them at risk. We will not be supporting this bill.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (18:20):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. By way of background for those listening and for those reading this later, Commonwealth authorities—for example, the ACT government—and entities including an agency or a parliamentary department are premium payers under the Comcare scheme. Licensees and some Commonwealth authorities who hold a licence self-insure and, accordingly, do not pay premiums to Comcare. Comcare is responsible for paying liabilities associated with injuries sustained by employees of premium payers from Comcare-retained funds under section 90C of the act. Comcare-retained funds should be adequate to meet current and prospective liabilities from year to year. The amendments made by the bill will clarify this intention as well as ensure mechanisms are in place to support Comcare to manage its liabilities in Comcare-retained funds. 


On 26 February 2015 the ACT government announced that it is consulting its workforce on plans to leave the Comcare scheme. Consultations were completed on 8 May 2015, only a week ago. If a premium payer as large as the ACT exits the scheme without paying an amount to cover unfunded liabilities, this would further diminish the capacity of Comcare-retained funds to be sufficient to meet liabilities. The associated risk of underfunding would be borne by remaining premium payers or the Commonwealth. This bill proposes to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act of 1988 to provide for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority to exit the Comcare scheme.


Firstly, the framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect exit contributions from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. This will ensure that an employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. 


Secondly, the framework will ensure that employees injured before an employer leaves the scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority. 


Thirdly, the framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or successor bodies. 


Fourthly, the framework will clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities such as government departments should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the consolidated revenue fund as is available under section 90C of the act.


Fifthly, the framework will allow Comcare to agree to instalments of an exit contribution being paid over a period of up to seven years after the day on which the determination is made, to allow for run-off of liability estimates. 


Sixthly, the framework will provide for Comcare to refund all or part of an exit contribution if an assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds attributable to an exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities. Determinations of a refund may only be made within the seven-year period immediately after an employer exits the scheme.


Finally, the framework will provide for Comcare to remit the whole or part of an unpaid instalment of an exit contribution if a later assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds that is attributable to the exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities. The amendments will also make minor contingent amendments related to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014—part 2 of schedule 1. Schedule 2 of the bill amends provisions in the act related to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to streamline appointment processes and ensure appropriate membership of the commission.


That was a little bit of background. This is a straightforward and logical bill that simply takes account of what can and should happen should any premium payer or licensee decide to leave the Comcare scheme. It is important to have such arrangements in place, especially given that the ACT Labor government have indicated that they are looking at a potential departure from the scheme, citing it is as burdensome for claimants and for their employers. They have said: 


The Comcare system is quite burdensome, not only for claimants but for their employers ….


Employees injured before a Commonwealth authority leaves the Comcare scheme will continue to receive compensation and rehabilitation under the act. The bill will ensure stability for workers, employers and the Comcare scheme when a Commonwealth authority exits the scheme. The bill also amends the act to clarify that premiums for current premium payers should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and future liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare-retained funds and so much of the consolidated revenue as would be available under the act.


The question is: why are these amendments important? The act is being amended to protect injured employees who remain in the Comcare scheme as well as to ensure the future financial viability of the Comcare scheme. Since 2013-14, Comcare has been progressively restoring the funding position of the scheme. The bill will support existing measures put in place by Comcare to restore funds to adequate levels to meet estimated liabilities. The bill will also ensure that Commonwealth authorities do not exit the Comcare scheme without paying an appropriate amount to cover any unfunded liabilities arising from claims that will continue to be managed by Comcare into the future. This will protect premium payers who remain in the scheme. 


We should be aware—this has been touched upon by a couple of senators who have spoken prior to me—that there are two bills here at the moment. The Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 passed the House of Representatives on 26 November 2014, and is currently before the Senate. That bill is focused on expanding the coverage of the Comcare scheme for national employers as self-insurers. The bill excludes coverage for recess breaks where a person is injured during an ordinary recess break away from their employer's premises, unless the injury arises from employment. The bill also excludes an injury arising from serious and wilful misconduct, where it results in death or serious and permanent impairment.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015 is not, in any way, related to these reforms.    That said, given the opposition's obsession with opposing any meaningful reform in this space I do want to briefly touch on the other bill that is currently being considered.


The Comcare scheme generally operates effectively. It achieves relatively high safety and return-to-work outcomes, and it is almost the only scheme in Australia to provide income replacement to retirement age and medical support for life. The legislation underpinning the scheme has not changed much since it was introduced 27 years ago. Workplaces and working conditions, health care and rehabilitation practices, technology, social behaviour and expectations have all changed in that time. Various court decisions have also affected the way the act is applied in practice. To keep pace with the modernisation of work and health practices the scheme needs to be updated. There are also signs that the scheme is coming under pressure. For example, while Comcare's return-to-work rates are better than average, they are actually falling. Some medical treatments are failing to make people better in the long term and    employers face rising premiums and other costs.


The proposed amendments aim to do the following:    improve return to work outcomes for injured workers; put the focus on early intervention and health outcomes of injured workers; and improve the operation of the system by excluding injuries sustained in non-work activities outside work, excluding secondary psychological injuries, and removing payment for non-traditional treatments. That package of reforms, which will be considered by this place in due course, is important in providing a strong and sustainable scheme into the future to ensure the continuation of Australia's only remaining long-tail workers compensation scheme. Further—and I want to stress this because it is important—in an unprecedented submission to the Senate committee, that package of reforms has been supported by departmental secretaries and agency heads. It has been supported by licensees, and it has broad support in the community.


Submissions from stakeholders, which were picked up by the opposition in its additional comments, related to a different bill. These are falsities, which have been repeated by the opposition, that this bill will impact on state and territory workers compensation schemes. This bill has no impact on states and territories as it only applies to Commonwealth authorities if they exit the Comcare scheme, and it has no impact on premium payers under the state schemes. Concerns have been raised, however, about the impact of another bill currently before the parliament—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014—on the viability of state and territory work, health and safety and workers compensation schemes due to the potential exodus of employers, particularly large employers, from those schemes. The concern is that, if large employers with better safety records move to the Comcare scheme, premiums will increase for employers remaining in the state and territory schemes.


The 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks specifically noted that concern about exiting premium payers from state schemes would lead to volatility in premium rates was not supported by the evidence. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry, and for the 2008 review of self-insurance arrangements under the Comcare scheme, indicated that the impact on those schemes or on remaining employers of the exit of corporations from state based schemes would be minimal. Taylor Fry, in their actuarial report to inform the 2008 Comcare review, concluded that the financial impact of exits to the Comcare scheme from the other Australian jurisdictions had been insignificant.


Assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission concluded that: the larger the employer, the closer the premium is to the 'true' cost of claims and expenses, such that the exit of large employers would be relatively neutral to the state and territory schemes; and the percentage of exiting employers from state schemes would represent less than 10 per cent to scheme revenues and probably less than five per cent of scheme revenues. In the government's assessment the circumstances have not changed since 2004 and the impact will remain minimal. But, again, I say to the opposition: stop the dishonesty and focus, please, your attention on the bill before the Senate as we speak and not on the other bill.


In conclusion, the bill will ensure that Commonwealth authorities exiting the Comcare scheme cover the costs of their liabilities. This will protect premium payers remaining in the scheme and ensure that injured workers are supported. Any senator voting against this bill is voting against ensuring that injured workers have a safety net should their employer leave their scheme.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:35):  In rising to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill, I reiterate Labor's concern that the government seems to be rushing this legislation unnecessarily. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act established the Comcare scheme in 1988 to provide compensation and rehabilitation to Australian government and Australian Capital Territory government employees, as well as to employees of private corporations that hold a licence under the act.


The ACT government has indicated that it wishes to leave the scheme, citing cost concerns. This bill creates a framework for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority to exit the Comcare scheme. The framework established by these amendments will enable Comcare to determine and collect 'exit contributions' from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. This will ensure that an exiting employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. It will ensure that employees injured before the employer's exit continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority, and it will enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or successor bodies. The bill also amends the act to clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities should be calculated to ensure that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare-retained funds.


I mentioned at the outset that this bill is unnecessarily rushed, and I say so for two key reasons. Firstly, the government has introduced other legislation which may affect how this bill impacts on injured workers and, secondly, we have yet to see the design of the ACT government's replacement scheme. The ACT government scheduled a six-week consultation to listen to the views of stakeholders before designing a new rehabilitation and compensation scheme. That consultation period only ended last Friday, 8 May. The design of the new scheme is going to take a significant period of time, and the ACT government has made a commitment to work with stakeholders. 


Labor's first priority is to ensure that no worker will be worse off under this bill. We must also be certain that this bill will not provide an incentive for others to leave workers worse off. This is why Labor took the responsible course of action to refer the bill to the Senate Employment and Education Committee for a thorough investigation. However, since the bill was referred to an inquiry the government introduced another bill relating to the Comcare scheme. This bill—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Improving the Comcare Scheme) Bill—is the third substantive bill relating to the Comcare scheme currently before the parliament. Although the committee has concluded its inquiry into the exit arrangements bill, the introduction of the other bill, the third bill, means the committee has not had a proper opportunity to investigate the relationship of this bill with other bills concerning the Comcare scheme. 


I mentioned there were three substantive bills relating to the Comcare scheme. In March this year the government also introduced the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill. Labor strongly opposes this bill. The proposed changes in this bill will directly and indirectly risk the health and safety of Australian workers and will remove their rights to fair and reasonable cover when they suffer the misfortune of a work-related illness or injury.


The most recent bill—the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Improving the Comcare Scheme) Bill 2015—is over 200 pages long. It is also highly disadvantageous to workers. This bill makes cuts to the lump sum compensation payable for permanent impairment for the vast majority of injured workers and removes the already modest pain and suffering payment. I have concerns that this bill will leave workers worse off, particularly in relation to how the bill widens the way in which claims can be disqualified from compensation. Changes to eligibility requirements will mean injured workers are locked out of the scheme altogether. I have some examples of how this new scheme will impact workers.


Firstly, compensation entitlements would be suspended where an injured worker is absent from Australia for more than six weeks, for example even if they had a dying relative they needed to care for overseas. Under the current scheme, while a worker needs to seek approval prior to departure, there are no cuts to entitlements if a worker travels overseas. In circumstances where a worker is totally unfit for work as a result of a compensable work-related injury, it does not matter whether the worker lives in Australia or elsewhere.


Secondly, the current exclusionary provision for injuries caused by 'reasonable administrative action' will be broadened by the term 'reasonable management action'. This will exclude any physical or psychiatric injury or illness resulting from a directive of management unless an injured worker can prove unreasonableness. How would this affect an Australian Federal Police officer who is injured in the undertaking of his or her duties? For example, if an AFP officer is instructed by his supervising officer to investigate a suspected drug lab and is stabbed during that investigation, would the injured officer be excluded under the new law on the grounds that the injury was partially caused by the reasonable direction given by the superior officer to investigate?


Thirdly, there are new tests for vulnerability to injury which would require consideration of whether the worker would have hypothetically suffered a similar 'designated injury' at the 'same time in the worker's life' or at the 'same stage'. It has been a long-standing principle of injury and compensation law that the injured victim is taken as found, including their age, vulnerabilities and susceptibilities. Since any musculoskeletal condition may be regarded as an ailment or any spinal condition as a 'designated injury', the effect of such a provision has the potential to strike out any such musculoskeletal injury. In a society where the working age now extends beyond 65 years and the Abbott government has declared it expects workers to work longer, our workforce is ageing and therefore becoming more susceptible to workplace injury. This provision effectively serves to discriminate against workers on the basis of their age. 


These are just a few examples of how workers will not receive any compensation for work-related injuries under the so-called improving the Comcare scheme bill because of the related unfair and draconian eligibility rules. This bill also reduces incapacity payments and expands sanctions against workers including removal of medical support if a worker fails to attend a medical appointment. All of this is totally opposed by Labor. It is typical of this government when they are under pressure to attack the workplace conditions of working Australians. I know there are issues with the resourcing of the Comcare scheme and the workloads of workplace inspectors and Comcare staff, but undermining the rights of workers to fair compensation is not the answer. With these bills currently before the Senate and with the ACT government still designing their new scheme, it is unclear whether ACT employees would be better off under the Comcare scheme or its replacement scheme. This point was made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions in its submission to the inquiry. The ACTU also noted in its submission that it is unclear how the government proposes to manage the rehabilitation and compensation claims of those workers who are currently covered by the Comcare scheme or whose claims are still being processed. 


Another concern raised through the inquiry by both the Victorian government and the Electrical Trades Union was that the bill may result in a reduced premium pool in state workers compensation schemes. Labor senators noted in their additional comments in the inquiry report that they were unconvinced by the Department of Employment's submission that the reduction in the premium pool would not result from the passage of the bill.


The principle of giving workers fair compensation and the best opportunity for rehabilitation is of particular importance to me. I have spoken before in this place about the difficulties experienced by workers under the current scheme. For more than five years I have been working hard to represent a constituent who has been fighting to get decent rehabilitation services and fair compensation from an injury suffered as a Commonwealth employee 27 years ago. I know from an independent report given to Comcare that there are another 13 injured workers who have experienced expressed longstanding problems with aspects of their claims and Comcare's services.


While it is vital that we do everything we can to avoid injuries at work, we know that unfortunately injuries will inevitably occur. When they do occur, workers need to have the assurance that they will receive not only fair compensation but the best rehabilitation support they can to restore them to their fullest possible health, both physically and psychologically. Given the difficulties that workers are experiencing with the Comcare scheme as it currently operates, it is absolutely vital that any changes to the scheme do not disadvantage workers and are carefully and thoroughly considered as a whole.


The most unfortunate thing about the government's hasty and piecemeal approach to these legislative changes is that Labor may be able to support the exit arrangements bill—the bill we are currently debating—but we cannot under the current circumstances. There is no need to try and rush this bill through with such haste when the ACT government does not even yet have a scheme designed to replace the Comcare scheme and will not have one for some time. There is no need to rush this bill through when we have a number of other substantial changes to the Comcare scheme also before the parliament. The opposition has not received any information from the ACT government about the consequences for workers of their exit from the Comcare scheme. Labor needs to have assurances that ACT workers will not be left worse off under this bill. We need to be sure there is nothing questionable about this bill before parliament today, and the only way to do this is to take the necessary time for further consultation with all stakeholders.


It is not all right for workers to be not properly compensated if injured while working, and it is not all right to cut standards that protect workers. Labor strongly believe no worker should be worse off under this bill, and that is what we will continue to push for. Workers must be afforded fair and reasonable compensation should they suffer the misfortune of a work related injury or illness—because that is only fair.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-05-13,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:46):  I am pleased to speak to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. This bill is a technical one dealing with how Comcare is funded when premium payers under the scheme exit. The ACT government announced in February this year that it is consulting its workforce on plans to leave the Comcare scheme. The ACT government has been a premium payer and the exit of a body of this size would have a detrimental impact on Comcare's capacity to continue providing cover for workers under the scheme. It is vital we continue to ensure Comcare has the resources to deal with the claims of employees under the scheme and is not held hostage by the whims of various premium-paying bodies.


The bill proposes to make amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to provide for financial and other arrangements for a Commonwealth authority to exit the Comcare scheme. The framework will enable Comcare to determine and collect 'exit contributions' from former Commonwealth authorities and successors of former Commonwealth authorities. This will ensure that an employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit. It will also ensure that employees injured before an employer leaves the scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority, which is very important. It will enable Comcare to determine and collect ongoing regulatory contributions from exited employers or successor bodies. It will clarify that premiums for current Commonwealth authorities and entities, such as a government department, should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and prospective liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as is available under section 90C of the act. It will allow Comcare to agree to instalments of an exit contribution being paid over a period of up to seven years after the day on which the determination is made to allow for run-off liability estimates. It will provide for Comcare to refund all or part of an exit contribution if an assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds attributable to an exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities; determinations of a refund may only be made within the seven-year period immediately after an employer exits the scheme. It will provide for Comcare to remit the whole or part of an unpaid instalment of an exit contribution if a later assessment reveals that the amount of available scheme funds that is attributable to the exited employer exceeds Comcare's liabilities.


This is a very straightforward bill that simply ensures the ongoing viability of Comcare whenever any large premium payer or licensee decides to leave the Comcare scheme. It is important to have such arrangements in place, especially given that the ACT Labor government have indicated that they are looking at a potential departure from the scheme, claiming it is burdensome for claimants and for their employers. Employees injured before a Commonwealth authority leaves the Comcare scheme will continue to receive compensation and rehabilitation under the SRC Act. The bill will ensure stability for workers, employers and the Comcare scheme when a Commonwealth authority exits the scheme.


The bill also amends the act to clarify that premiums for current premium payers should be calculated having regard to the principle that current and future liabilities should be fully funded by Comcare retained funds and so much of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as would be available under section 90C of the act. These amendments protect injured employees who remain in the Comcare scheme and ensure the future financial viability of Comcare.


Since 2013-14, Comcare has been progressively restoring the funding position of the scheme. The bill will support existing measures put in place by Comcare to restore funds to adequate levels to meet estimated liabilities. The bill will also ensure that Commonwealth authorities do not exit the Comcare scheme without paying an appropriate amount to cover any unfunded liabilities arising from claims that will continue to be managed by Comcare into the future. This will protect premium payers who remain in the scheme from having to cover these liabilities with larger premiums.


The Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 passed the House of Representative on 26 November 2014 and is currently before the Senate. That bill is focused on expanding the coverage of the Comcare scheme for national employers as self-insurers. The bill excludes coverage for recess breaks where a person is injured during an ordinary recess break away from their employer's premises unless the injury arises from employment. The bill also excludes an injury arising from serious and wilful misconduct where it results in death or serious and permanent impairment.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015 is not in any way related to these reforms. That said, given Labor's inability to do any of the hard work of meaningful reform in this space, I do want to briefly touch on the other bills that are currently being considered. The Comcare scheme generally operates effectively. It achieves relatively high safety and return-to-work outcomes, and it is almost the only scheme in Australia to provide income replacement to retirement age and medical support for life. The legislation underpinning the scheme has not changed much since it was introduced 27 years ago. 


Workplaces and working conditions, healthcare and rehabilitation practices, technology and social behaviour and expectations have all changed in that time. Various court decisions have also affected the way the act is applied in practice. To keep pace with the modernisation of work and health practices, the scheme needs to be updated. There are also signs that the scheme is coming under pressure. For example, whilst Comcare's return-to-work rates are better than average, they are falling; some medical treatments are failing to make people better, in the long term; and employers face rising premiums and other costs. 


The proposed amendments aim to do the following things: improve return-to-work outcomes for injured workers; put the focus on early intervention and health outcomes of injured workers and improve the operation of the system by excluding injuries sustained in non-work activities outside work; exclude secondary psychological injuries; and remove payment for non-traditional treatments. That package of reform, which will be considered by this place in due course, is important in providing a strong and sustainable scheme into the future to ensure that Australia's only remaining long-tail workers' compensation scheme is able to continue. Further, in an unprecedented submission to the Senate committee, that package of reform has been supported by departmental secretaries and agency heads, it has been supported by licensees and it has broad support in the community.


The Education and Employment Legislation Committee examined this and the associated Comcare legislation in the first months of 2015. Submissions from stakeholders, which were picked up by the opposition in its additional comments, also related to a different bill—falsities that have been repeated by the opposition that this bill will impact on state and territory workers' compensation schemes. This bill has no impact on states and territories as it only applies to Commonwealth authorities if they exit the Comcare scheme, and it has no impact on premium payers under the state schemes.


Concerns have been raised, however, about the impact of another bill currently before the parliament—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014—on the viability of state and territory work health and safety and workers' compensation schemes due to the potential exodus of employers, particularly large employers, from those schemes. The concern is that if large employers with better safety records move to the Comcare scheme, premium rates will increase for employers remaining in the state and territory schemes.


The 2004 Productivity Commission Inquiry into National Workers' Compensation and Occupational Health and Safety Frameworks specifically noted that the concern that exiting premium payers from state schemes would lead to volatility in premium rates was not supported by the evidence. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry and for the 2008 review of self-insurance arrangements under the Comcare scheme—the Comcare review—indicated that the impact of the exit of corporations from state based schemes on those schemes or remaining employers would be minimal.


Taylor Fry—in their actuarial report to inform the 2008 Comcare review—concluded that the financial impacts of exits to the Comcare scheme from the other Australian jurisdictions had been insignificant. Actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission concluded: 'The larger the employer, the closer the premium is to the true cost of claims and expenses, such that the exit of such large employers would be relatively neutral to the state and territory schemes.' The percentage of exiting employers from state schemes would represent less than 10 per cent of scheme revenues and probably less than five per cent of scheme revenues.


In the government's assessment, the circumstances have not changed since 2004 and the impact will remain minimal. I call on those opposite to focus on the bill at hand and do the right thing and provide certainty for workers under the Comcare scheme. The bill will ensure that Commonwealth authorities exiting the Comcare scheme cover the costs of their liabilities. This will protect premium payers remaining in the scheme and ensure that injured workers are supported.


Any senator voting against this bill is voting against ensuring that injured workers have a safety net should their employer leave the scheme. I therefore commend this bill to the Senate.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-05-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:57):  I rise to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. At this time of the day—after the big, long night of the budget—I suppose people are starting to feel a little weary, and it is hard to keep your attention on these things. It is really important to pay attention, because something really important could happen if this legislation were allowed to go through in the way this government is proposing.


The purpose of this bill has been discussed in very different ways in the contributions from both sides of the chamber this evening. The explanatory memorandum of this bill states: 


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the Act) establishes a scheme (the Comcare scheme) to provide compensation and rehabilitation support to injured Australian Government and Australian Capital Territory employees, as well as employees of private corporations that hold a licence under the Act.


It sounds like a mouthful, and by the time you get to the end of a few sentences like that it is very easy to have your eyes start to glaze over. But we have to remember that at the heart of this piece of legislation is either a positive or a negative outcome for people who find themselves injured while at work. That could be any one of us or any of the people we love or care for or any of the people we work with. This is not an abstract concept, this is not an abstract set of words and it is not a meaningless set of words, even though it does sound like that in the way that it is written for the purposes of legislation. This is about people and real outcomes for people.


In fact, this piece of legislation is more complicated in the way that it has come before this parliament than many others, because this is part of a suite of three bills that are dealing with Comcare. That is why we need to be really careful about what we are doing with it. Senator Lines, Senator Cameron and Senator Bilyk have made very strong claims, articulating our concerns about the haste with which this is being attempted to be pushed through the parliament by the government, and I think with good cause. One of the things that my kids say these days, using a very descriptive word, is that things may be 'dodgy'. I have every feeling that there is something dodgy going on here—the sense of speeding to get this piece of legislation through.


The fact is that, only as recently as 25 February this year, the ACT government announced that it was going to leave Comcare. When that announcement happened, pretty much at the same time the Territory government also announced that it was going to conduct a six-week consultation period before deciding on the design of the new scheme—whatever it might look like. That consultation period has been open to some discussion. There are concerns about how private those conversations have been and there are concerns about why such an important discussion about a scheme that could affect so many people here in the ACT has not been held in a much more public way. Given that the consultation period ended on 8 May, just last Friday, it is really quite remarkable that we are in the week of the budget and this piece of legislation has been rushed into this place.


Pardon me: I do not usually like cynics or cynicism, but I have to say that the alarm bells are ringing at this point in time. What on earth is going on here? A secret, quiet process over six weeks, an attempt to push this through and no chance for us to have the great scrutiny of this bill that the Senate committees can undertake. Labor's first priority with regard to this bill is to ensure that we get the bill right. To do that we need to make sure that any design of any new scheme is going to provide at least the same protection. In my view, if you have an opportunity to review, you should look to ways that would enhance the protection. We can enhance the financial outcome too—they are not necessarily mutually exclusive goals—but we should be determining that this scheme will advance the cause of the people who are going to be sadly caught up in it.


The ACT government, from what I can gather, have made a commitment to work with the stakeholders. There should be sufficient time allowed to unearth any outstanding matters and have public scrutiny of the process, public consideration of what is proposed, and certainly those who have been affected may have some particularly valuable insights that they could bring to the process. In a way, one of the reasons why I am so concerned about this process is that I watched the failure of the government to consult in a public way prior to the last budget—the very first budget that they delivered—particularly with regard to the area of health. Compensation for injured workers is not exactly a health matter, but it is certainly intimately connected with the health sector. We had a government that decided it was a good idea, without consultation, without talking to the RACGP, without talking to the AMA and without talking to any of the state departments of health—they just arbitrarily decided, this week last year—that they were going to bring in a $7 GP co-payment, a GP tax.


Failure of consultation leads to really stupid policies like that, and the government have had to remove themselves from that position to a point. They still have lots and lots of issues with their health policy. They have had to change their minister and they have got to a point now where the minister says she is consulting, but all that is happening in private and it has taken a committee of the Senate to watch what is going on in the health sector publicly and put it on the record. Acting Deputy President Peris, you are well aware of the work of the committee that is doing that and why it is important to have public scrutiny and use the resources of this parliament to put on the record the evidence that experts have to offer, not just people who can get inside a little private room and make some decisions that ultimately might advantage them over others who have less power and less opportunity to have their voice heard.


It is in that context that I really want to emphasise that Labor's first priority is to ensure, with this bill in particular, that there will be no worker worse off. We also want to make sure that there is no structuring of this to provide an incentive to make workers worse off. We wanted it to go to a Senate committee for thorough investigation, but with unseemly haste the government has rushed it here into the chamber. There is something wrong with that attitude. Our story is the Australian Labor story. It is about protecting and promoting the interests of working men and women. The future of Australia, from the values that we hold, is about getting a great job—giving people the opportunity and the support they need to get a job that they can be fulfilled in, where they can go to work each day and come home safely and well. We know that it does not always turn out that way and that people will need, from time to time, assistance if they find themselves injured or so unwell that they require rehabilitation.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill is one of the suite of bills that I referred to in my opening remarks. It is another reason that explains why I am concerned about what is happening here tonight. That bill was introduced into the parliament in March last year. What we saw in that bill was absolutely outrageous—directly and indirectly risking the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. One of the things that was threatened in that was the right of Australian workers to have reasonable cover when they suffered the misfortune of a work related illness or injury. Labor completely opposed that bill. We continue to oppose that bill. There is great concern on this side of the chamber that, in that bill, the government has included provisions to hollow out state workers compensation schemes. Part of the process that the community should be aware of is that one of the plans, revealed in the process of looking at that legislation, intended to open up the Comcare scheme to private sector companies.


I am trying, with this abstract piece of legislation, to continue to remember, and to speak about, the people who will be affected if this legislation is wrong and if this legislation is hastily pushed through. We need to keep remembering that people are at the heart of what we do here in this place, and that the impact of this legislation on people is real. I am trying to use language that reminds us of that because we have heard from the other side technical language distancing people from the conversations of this place. Legislation has to be rich and in a particular form of words. But when those on the other side stand up and their language choices do not mention people, do not mention health consequences and do not mention safety in the workplace, and when they do not look like they are there to protect workers but to exploit them, and when their language choices are filled with words like contributions, funds, instalments, liabilities, assessments and remittances, when they are punctuated and littered with those sorts of words and there is no consideration of what those words might collectively mean in terms of impacting somebody's life, then there are more alarm bells ringing in my head. We are concerned that there are going to be large companies that will flee state schemes and that would compromise the capacity of those schemes to properly look after workers. We do not believe it would be in the interests of workers to have that happen. We do not think this legislation should proceed with such haste.


In addition to the bill that is before the house tonight, and the one that I have just mentioned, there is yet another Comcare bill—the third one in the sequence—that has just recently been introduced by the government. This is also one that should have us raising our concern and casting a close eye over what is being proposed by the government. That third bill makes cuts to lump sum compensation payable for permanent impairment for the vast majority of injured workers. Let me just say that again: it cuts lump sum compensation payments to permanently impaired people. It also attempts to remove the already modest pain and suffering payment that people so far can access. In her commentary in this place this evening, Senator Lines spoke eloquently about the reality of a period of work in which she was interacting with people who had found themselves on the wrong side of a workplace incident. These people suffered in the first instance a physical impairment that disconnected them from the experience of work, marginalised them from their community of work and impacted their health and wellbeing and family lives, and then the stress of dealing with the system that was so discriminatory towards them and so aggressive towards them meant that there was an amplification of their injury from a physical one into a mental health injury. We need to be careful about not allowing the construction of a system that will create that reality for people.


This third piece of Comcare legislation that the government is advancing does other things. It changes the eligibility requirements. That means that injured workers are locked out of the scheme altogether. It also attempts to reduce incapacity payments. It expands sanctions against workers, including the removal of medical support if a worker fails to attend a medical appointment. Where have I heard that before? These are some of the most excessive and punitive measures that we have seen this government try to implement since they came into the parliament with regard to people who find themselves unemployed.


We have seen this government almost selectively targeting those who are the most vulnerable, seeking them out, almost, when they are at their lowest point and then really kicking them while they are down. That is why this legislation is so important and deserves the proper scrutiny of a committee. There should be time given to this second part in the bill under the chamber's consideration this evening. We oppose all of the elements of that Comcare bill. We are very concerned about this Comcare bill. We oppose the elements of the first Comcare bill. There is a theme here. These guys are up to something no good. We are onto it. As the Labor Party, we will stand here and make sure that the proper scrutiny is applied, no matter how uncomfortable it is for those opposite.


What we have here is the Abbott government asking the parliament to make a determination on a matter which it has very recently introduced. It is a very substantial bill. It does, potentially, contain crucial information about future changes. Given the introduction of a third substantive Comcare bill, Labor really cannot believe that there was proper opportunity to fully investigate the current bill. These bills do not sit as separate entities. Once one gets through, there will be interactions with the other. Those interactions, those sophisticated and complex interactions, need to be given consideration as well.


I said earlier that the ACT government has not made a determination on the make-up of any new scheme. They only announced it in February. They have only just finished their consultation process. So, supporting the legislation that is before us is a foolish thing to do. It is foolish and it is dangerous, because the whole detailed process that should be part of any change is simply being overlooked. Obviously it is not reasonable or fair to suggest that people exit a particular type of arrangement that covers workers if they are injured at work and without being able with any certainty to outline what entitlements they may have in any subsequent scheme. It is simply not reasonable to ask us to support such a proposition. So inevitably we have considerable reservations about this bill.


That is not to say that we seek to usurp the rights of the ACT to make determinations about this. The ACT clearly should be making decisions for its own workforce in relation to workers compensation, including rehabilitation. But it is only reasonable that they make clear their intentions, in a detailed way, before this bill passes. And certainly a Senate inquiry would provide a space in which such reportage could happen and due consideration could be given.


I am advised that there has been considerable conversation with the ACT government. I am led to believe that the concerns that I am raising here in the chamber and that have been raised by my other colleagues who have participated in this debate have been raised with the ACT. We need them to outline their intentions. We need to explain any material changes that might be made to entitlements of those workers if they are injured. We need, in fact, a simple degree of fair scrutiny to be provided. I do not believe we have had sufficient time for that to happen at this stage, and it is certainly unduly hasty to be pushing for a resolution of this matter so promptly. The ACT government really does need to provide that information to this government and to the opposition as well so that we can ensure that there actually are no adverse consequences of this bill before the government exits the scheme.


One of the things I thought it would be worth putting on the record for people who may be listening and are interested in the process of scrutiny of these bills is that one of the very impressive things I found when I was a new senator was the introduction of a consideration of the human rights implications. Each bill has to be considered in terms of that human rights lens. Articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and articles 26 and 27 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. It reminds us, as I said at the beginning of my remarks this evening, that this is a complex piece of legislation. At its heart are outcomes for real people, and I urge a due degree— (Time expired)

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (19:17):  It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. Unfortunately, I do not think I will get to complete my contribution, but I am really looking forward to the full 20—full bottle—on this particular piece of legislation when we next have it before us. I am chair of the committee that Senator Lines is deputy chair of. I sat  in my office and listened to the tirade from Senator Lines, and I am looking forward to correcting so many of the false assumptions that she put on the Hansard, as if they were somehow fact—as if somehow because she says them they must be true. She complains that the committee did not undergo a full and transparent assessment of the submissions. The inquiry was conducted under the usual practice of the Senate. Public submissions were sought, and we got not hundreds, not thousands but four submissions—from, as we like to say in the game, 'usual suspects'. We had the ACTU, the ETU, my own state government of Victoria, and the Department of Education—so, four submissions. With the workload that the current Senate committee is under—and it is not just my own committee; this is the case right across the Senate at the moment, thanks to the Greens' inquiries and thanks to the numerous reference committee inquiries from those opposite and indeed from the scrutiny of bills process, which is referring so much of the government's legislative agenda, which it has a mandate to deliver, off to committee in a tactic to delay us delivering on election promise after election promise for the Australian people—in that deliberate tactic by those opposite to use those Senate committees, there is an enormous burden. If those opposite want to consider the workers of Australia, then they need to actually consider the committee secretariats and the workload that they are currently under. So, when we get four submissions saying what we all knew they would say—

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (19:20):  Earlier today during senators' statements I talked about my trip a few weeks ago up into Western and Northern Queensland, and I foreshadowed that I would be talking about bananas later today. I now wish to address the very important issue of the banana industry in Queensland. Bananas are Australia's No. 1-selling supermarket product, with annual farm gate production of over $600 million. About 95 per cent of the bananas produced in Australia come from the coastal strip between Babinda and Cardwell and across the Atherton Tablelands, in particular around Tully and Innisfail. Many businesses and communities in this district rely on the banana industry directly and indirectly for income and for their jobs. That is why Panama tropical race 4 represents a very serious threat to the livelihoods of hundreds of banana growers across North Queensland and also a threat to the communities of North and Far North Queensland.


To give some background, Panama tropical race 4 is caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum. It is spread only by the movement of infected planting material, soil and water, not through the air. Panama tropical race 4 is a very destructive disease of banana plants, but it is important to note that it poses no threat to human health whatsoever. It was originally identified in the Northern Territory during 1997, resulting in the widespread destruction of the banana industry in the Territory. The disease, sadly, was first detected on a Queensland plantation in Tully in March of this year. A second positive test came from a commercial banana farm near Mareeba in early April—and both farms are now under quarantine.


The banana peak industry body, the Australian Banana Growers' Council, has been working closely with growers, biosecurity officials and governments to formulate measures to support growers and to protect the banana industry in North Queensland from further disease. The Australian Banana Growers' Council has formulated a package of measures to deal with Panama tropical race 4, calling for measures including: a Biosecurity Queensland-approved protocol that sets out minimum biosecurity standards that infected farms need to meet in order to restart operations,    government assistance for infected farms, including for the costs of destroying infected plants and fencing infected farms; a joint government-grower funded program for other farm biosecurity measures; a Biosecurity Queensland program for ensuring the provision of clean banana planting material; and, finally, a special research and development fund to assist with disease research. The local state member for much of the area, the Liberal-National Party member for Hinchinbrook, Andrew Cripps, has two-thirds of Australia's bananas growing in his electorate. Mr Cripps has thrown his full support behind the Australian Banana Growers' Council's plan and has requested that, in addition to the 5-point plan released by the Australian Banana Growers' Council, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments formalise a bilateral agreement to fund a testing and control program that would continue to battle the spread of Panama tropical race 4. I support Mr Cripps in these efforts.


The potential to find vaccines, better treatment products and fungus-resistant banana varieties is something that certainly needs to be explored. Sadly, the response from the Queensland Labor government and Biosecurity Queensland has, at times, been ponderous and slow, leaving growers tangled in bureaucracy and dealing with uncertainty for too long. I call on the Queensland government to work with the Commonwealth and the Australian Banana Growers' Council, and especially the impacted banana growers and their communities and other stakeholders, to implement these proposed measures to prevent the spread of this disease and the ensuing devastation that it could cause across North Queensland. If the North Queensland banana industry is wiped out, it would be similar to a cyclone wiping out North Queensland—a permanent cyclone hanging over the banana plantations.




Senator Sterle:
  It would be worse! Worse!




Senator McGRATH:
  Thank you, Senator Sterle, for acknowledging the threat that this Panama tropical race 4 poses to the Queensland banana industry. I was fortunate in my two trips to North Queensland over the past six weeks to meet with some local banana growers, in particular the families of one of the impacted banana plantations, along with Steve Lizzio in Innisfail. I really appreciate that they have taken the time to speak with me. I commend the Australian Banana Growers' Council Chairman, Doug Phillips, and the CEO, Jim Pekin, for their work towards finding a solution to this menace and for their advocacy of growers' interests. I say to them: 'We are all in this together, and we are all behind you.'
